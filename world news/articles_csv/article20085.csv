"'08-05-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The advertising firm McCann-Erickson Worldwide on Thursday agreed to pay a $12 million fine to resolve federal regulators’ claims of civil accounting fraud in transactions with its parent, Interpublic Group of Companies.The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the settlement with McCann-Erickson and Interpublic, a major advertising and marketing company, which the S.E.C. accused of negligence for failing to address accounting problems at its biggest subsidiary from 1997 to 2004. McCann-Erickson and Interpublic, both based in New York, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the accord but did agree to refrain from future violations of the securities laws.The S.E.C. also filed a complaint against Salvatore LaGreca, a former chief financial officer of McCann-Erickson, and Brian Watson, a former director of operations in its Europe-Middle East-Africa region. Mr. LaGreca agreed to pay a $25,000 fine and $46,947 in restitution; Mr. Watson agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and restitution of $17,325. Neither admitted nor denied the S.E.C.’s accusations.The regulators accused McCann-Erickson, which owns hundreds of regional and local advertising agencies, of fraudulently misstating its financial results by recording as receivables intercompany charges that should have been booked as expenses.In late 2002, Interpublic restated its earnings by $181 million for 1997 to 2002, the S.E.C. said in its civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan. That did not resolve the accounting problems, the agency said, and Interpublic again restated its income in September 2005, for $420 million, covering 2000-2003 and the first nine months of 2004.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','“It’s very disconcerting,” Mr. Shepherdson said. “About half of all consumption is not really discretionary, it’s things like food, energy, medical costs, over which people have very little control in the short run.”The report illustrated why Americans had cut back on major purchases: Workers’ wages continued to grow at an anemic pace in March, even as higher prices for food and gasoline took more out of their pocketbooks.Income rose 0.3 percent in March, down from an increase of 0.5 percent in February. After taxes, and adjusted for inflation, Americans’ income was flat for March. Americans also saved less; the savings rate slipped to 0.2 percent from 0.4 percent in February.Inflation, already at elevated levels, accelerated in March, the report said, with costs to consumers now 3.2 percent higher than a year ago. On a monthly basis, costs were up 0.3 percent in March after rising 0.1 percent in February.The bleak report does not bode well for the economy’s future prospects, economists said. Spending is the primary engine of the economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product. If these pistons start to slow, the system is likely to sputter to a halt. An earlier report on the economy’s performance in the first quarter, released Wednesday by the Commerce Department, showed consumption at its weakest point since the recession of 2001.Spending is expected to tick up slightly after the government mails out tax rebates in an effort to stimulate the economy. But economists said the coming rebates were unlikely to prop up sales for long.“The worry is that after that relief fades away, the consumer will still be faced with the same underlying problems,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm, in a note. “Any burst of spending based on the stimulus payments is likely to prove short-lived.”Thursday’s report also provided little comfort to the Federal Reserve, which is trying to avoid a recession while keeping price pressures in check. The Fed, in determining inflation dangers, is said to keep close track of a figure in the report that measures prices of goods that exclude energy and food products, which are considered volatile from month to month. This figure, known as the core personal consumption expenditures price deflator, ticked up to 2.1 percent in March from 2 percent in February, slightly above the Fed’s presumed “comfort zone.”Separate reports on Thursday revealed problems in the construction and manufacturing sectors, which have been battered in the last year by the housing slump. Residential construction fell sharply in March, shrinking 4.6 percent as builders cut back on groundbreakings or stopped work on projects. Over all, spending on construction declined 1.1 percent in March after rising 0.4 percent in February, the Commerce Department said.Meanwhile, a bellwether gauge of manufacturing activity stayed flat in April as companies laid off workers. The Institute of Supply Management’s index was unchanged at 48.6 last month. Inventories and export orders rose, but new orders stagnated.Wall Street’s focus turns now to the Labor Department’s report on unemployment in April, which will be released Friday. Economists predict that employers shed up to 100,000 jobs last month, a forecast bolstered by a report on Thursday that claims for unemployment benefits rose by 35,000, to 380,000 last week. Economists had forecast an increase of 18,000.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','What used to be an “affordable luxury” is no longer that for some customers, Mr. Schultz said, referring to Starbucks’ signature espresso drinks.“Like most other retailers and restaurants, we are experiencing a downturn in customer traffic, demonstrated in reduced frequency of customer visits, that we believe ties to a real reduction in consumers’ discretionary spending habits,” Mr. Schultz said.The report, released after the close of regular trading, had little impact on Starbucks shares. The stock, which fell 11 percent after the company’s warning last week, rose 3 cents, to $16.23 a share, in regular trading.“This is certainly a positive step,” said Larry Miller, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “At least they’re on the road to recovery, but I think it’s going to be a long road.”Mr. Schultz, who returned as chief executive in January in hopes of turning the company around, said the results were heavily influenced by operations in the United States, which accounted for 77 percent of revenue. Same store sales in the United States fell by about 5 percent.“We are not satisfied with the downturn of traffic in our stores, and we are working diligently to reverse that,” Mr. Schultz said. “There are no sacred cows.”Starbucks said that in the United States it planned to open 1,020 stores this year, down from its previous goal of 1,175, and to open fewer than 400 stores a year from 2009 to 2011. But internationally, the company plans to continue its expansion, with more than 1,000 new stores a year from 2009 to 2011. Starbucks’ store count will be about 21,500 stores by the end of 2011.The company, based in Seattle, plans to cut capital expenses to $800 million, from about $1.1 billion, from 2009 to 2011. About 70 percent of that will be for stores.Mr. Schultz said that while customers were not visiting Starbucks stores as often as they once did, he did not believe that meant they were abandoning Starbucks for its competitors.Mr. Schultz said the company had begun to lure customers back with a new coffee called Pike Place Roast, a better brewing system and improved service. The company also announced three new cold beverages.Starbucks expects profit this fiscal year to be lower than the 87 cents a share reported last year, but company officials declined to provide precise figures. The company expects revenue growth of 13 percent to 14 percent this year.Looking ahead over the next three years, the company expects profit of 90 cents a share to $1 in 2009, $1.10 to $1.20 in 2010 and $1.35 to $1.50 in 2011.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','LIMA, Peru (Reuters) — More than 1,000 women protested outside Peru’s Congress on Wednesday, banging empty pots and pans to demand that the government do more to counter rising food prices, which are squeezing the poor worldwide.The women, some toting small children on their hips, run food kitchens, known as eating halls, for the poor.The meals the eating halls serve are subsidized by the government, but the women say they are struggling to provide enough food and want the government to increase financial aid so they can cover their costs.Hundreds of thousands of people rely on the eating halls each day in Peru, where about 12 million people, or 42 percent of the population, live in poverty.The rising cost for basic foods sank President Alan García’s approval rating to 26 percent this month, the lowest level since he took office in 2006. This month, weeks after cutting taxes on food imports, Mr. García started sending the army to hand out free bags of food in the poorest neighborhoods here in the capital.“Food prices keep on rising, and the government doesn’t pay attention to the eating halls,” said María Bozeta, director of one of three associations that represent eating halls in Lima.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','MOSCOW (AP) — For nine decades after Bolshevik executioners shot Czar Nicholas II and his family, there were no traces of the remains of Crown Prince Aleksei, the hemophiliac heir to Russia’s throne.Some said the prince, a delicate 13-year-old, had somehow survived and escaped; others believed he was buried in secret as the country lurched into civil war.Now an official says DNA tests have solved the mystery by identifying bone shards found in a forest as those of Aleksei and his sister Grand Duchess Maria.The remains of their parents, Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra, and three siblings, including the czar’s youngest daughter, Anastasia, were unearthed in 1991 and reburied in the imperial resting place in St. Petersburg. The Russian Orthodox Church made all seven of them saints in 2000.Researchers unearthed the bone shards last summer in a forest near Yekaterinburg, where the royal family was killed, and enlisted laboratories in Russia and the United States to conduct DNA tests.'"

"'08-05-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The Senate on Wednesday delivered its judgment on a constitutional question involving one of its own and formally declared that Senator John McCain is eligible to be president — at least from a citizenship perspective.Weighing in on an arcane question that has arisen because of Mr. McCain’s birth in the Panama Canal Zone, the Senate without opposition approved a nonbinding resolution recognizing that Mr. McCain is a natural-born citizen.Among the basic qualifications the Constitution lays out for president is that the person be a natural-born citizen, a phrase not defined and one that has been subjected to various interpretations.At the request of Mr. McCain’s campaign, two constitutional lawyers studied the issue and found in favor of Mr. McCain, whose father was stationed in the zone with the Navy when the future candidate was born. Colleagues of both parties in the Senate, including his two potential Democratic rivals, concur.“There is no evidence of the intention of the framers or any Congress to limit the constitutional rights of children born to Americans serving in the military nor to prevent those children from serving as their country’s president,” the resolution said.It does not have the power of law. Its authors, chiefly Senators Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Claire McCaskill of Missouri, both Democrats, said they wanted the Senate clearly on record.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','The Food and Drug Administration has ordered Merck & Company to correct numerous manufacturing deficiencies at its main vaccine plant, the agency said Wednesday.The agency released a warning letter sent to Merck’s chief executive, Richard T. Clark, that states its inspectors had determined that manufacturing rules were not being followed at the plant in West Point, Pa., just outside Philadelphia.The plant, which recalled two vaccines in December over sterility problems, makes a number of children’s vaccines and four for adults.The nine-page letter states that the agency found “significant objectionable conditions” in the manufacture of vaccines and drug ingredients during repeated inspections from Nov. 26 to Jan. 17.In a separate posting on its Web site, the agency said it had issued the warning letter because Merck’s response to the F.D.A. report sent after the inspections was “inadequate to address the serious deviations noted.”The F.D.A. said in the posting that it “does not believe that the issues identified will affect the safety of the vaccines” made at West Point, or their availability.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','The exclusion costs the federal government more than $212 billion a year in income and payroll taxes, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. That is more than the cost of the deductibility of home mortgage interest, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.The tax treatment of health benefits has been criticized as both discriminatory and regressive, and some analysts believe it encourages workers to buy more coverage than they need, driving up health costs.To end the disadvantage to those who do not buy insurance through employers, Mr. McCain proposes to eliminate the exclusion of health benefits from taxable income. In exchange, he would provide refundable tax credits of $2,500 to single people and of $5,000 to families, with the goal of stoking competition in the individual insurance market. The elimination of the exclusion would generate $3.6 trillion over 10 years, according to the McCain campaign, and that money would pay for the tax credits.Mr. Holtz-Eakin calculated that workers in the top income tax bracket would have to pay more in taxes if their employers have been contributing at least $14,285 toward a family insurance premium. Nationwide, the average cost of a family policy is $12,106, with employers paying $8,824 of that amount.While the change would primarily affect those with gold-plated insurance policies, health analysts point out that middle-income workers with conventional coverage could conceivably pay more in regions where insurance costs are high. Over time, that might depend on how the tax credits are adjusted for inflation, a detail Mr. McCain has not discussed.Gary Claxton, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy research group, said that about 6 percent of insured employees worked for companies where the average employer contribution met the threshold set by Mr. Holtz-Eakin. Mr. Claxton said he could not project how many of those workers are in the top tax bracket and would pay higher taxes.Interviewed on his campaign bus Wednesday afternoon, Mr. McCain said: “I’m giving them a $5,000 refundable tax credit. I believe that that takes care of the overwhelming majority of Americans.”Charlie Black, a senior adviser to his campaign, who was also on the bus, acknowledged that some would pay more. “It would be a very, very small percentage of people,” Mr. Black said, “and they would be people who are getting a plan that’s way beyond what regular people have.”Mr. McCain has said he would maintain the Bush-era income tax cuts and support other tax reductions, and he has pledged repeatedly that he would not raise taxes. “Do you mean none?” Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked in a March 16 interview.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain’s health proposal does not contradict his tax pledge because the government would gain the same amount of revenue by ending the exclusion as it would lose by granting the tax credits.“He has said that he is in favor of a tax code that is fairer, simpler, flatter, more pro-growth and more internationally competitive,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. “There’s nothing about revenue-neutral tax reforms that’s inconsistent with his position.”Some scholars say otherwise. “Anyway you cut it, if you make health benefits subject to taxation, that’s a tax increase,” said Jonathan B. Oberlander, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “You can argue with lots of merit that it’s a responsible increase, that it takes away an inequitable exclusion, but it’s still a tax increase.”On the Democratic side, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York also wants to change the tax treatment of employee health benefits, though not as radically as Mr. McCain. She has proposed limiting the exclusion for those earning more than $250,000, about 2 percent of workers. Under her plan, which would raise an estimated $2 billion to support universal health coverage, high earners would pay taxes on the part of employer-provided health benefits that exceed a standard policy. Mrs. Clinton has not defined where that limit would be set.Her Democratic rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, has not proposed changing the tax exclusion.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','Q. Is it possible to get a cracked iPod screen repaired for significantly less than what it would cost to just buy a new iPod? Are there other repair options besides Apple?A. Thanks to a number of online mail-in iPod repair shops that have popped up around the Web, you can get a damaged L.C.D. screen on your iPod replaced for $60 to $100. Prices vary depending on the specific model and whether you choose to perform the repair yourself or have the company do it.The shops include iResQ (iresq.com), Tech Restore (techrestore.com/ipod) and PDASmart (pdasmart.com/ipodpartscenter.htm).You can buy parts to install yourself, but if cracking open your iPod makes you squeamish, you can have a professional technician do the surgery.Most companies offer a variety of repair options, including battery, hard drive and L.C.D. screen replacement. Broken headphone jacks and damaged faceplates can be fixed as well. Typically, you go to the Web site and select the type of repair you need. The company then ships you a prepaid courier box to send in your iPod. Once fixed, your iPod is returned to you — usually overnight by the same courier service.Repairing an iPod is typically less expensive than buying a brand-new player, but you should factor in the overall age of the device and any new features in later models that appeal to you. The most current iPod models may require the most recent version of iTunes, so if you have an older model that works with an outdated operating system like Windows 2000 or Mac OS X 10.3, repairing the player will probably be less disruptive than upgrading your computer to get a new iPod working.If you do decide to buy a new device, you can recycle your old one free through Apple (apple.com/environment/recycling).'"

"'08-05-01,'1','T-Mobile’s offering, called HotSpot @Home, uses specially outfitted phones to send calls through your Internet connection over a $30 router. The service costs $10 a month on top of your regular bill and allows unlimited calls between phones in the United States and Wi-Fi hotspots anywhere in the world. Once you leave the hotspot, the cellular wireless network takes over.T-Mobile now has three Hot Spot @Home compatible phones, which cost no more than regular phones, and will release 10 more this summer. The company says it has trained its sales force to work with potential customers who may not be aware that their homes or offices are in a dead zone.“One of the first things our reps are trained to do is a personal coverage check to see, real time, what you can expect the coverage to be at your home,” said Britt Wehrman, director of product development at T-Mobile. (You can check your own coverage at www.t-mobile.com/coverage.)Verizon Wireless, AT&T Wireless and Sprint are all looking at femtocell products as well. Sprint is running trials in Denver, Indianapolis and Nashville with its own hardware. A Verizon spokesman, John Czwartacki, said the company was still evaluating the technology. These carriers are likely to use a different kind of device that mimics a cell tower, avoiding the need to use special phones and Wi-Fi.Hassan Ahmed, founder of Sonus Networks, a company that makes femtocells, said he believed that almost all of the carriers would add the technology to their product lines.“I get great cellphone coverage around my house, and I get great Internet inside my house with DSL,” Mr. Ahmed said. “However, when I’m in my house I can’t get any bars. A femtocell device is a win-win: it gives the carrier a way to improve their infrastructure and it gives me full bars.”If you can’t wait for your carrier to start selling femtocells, you might try a cellular repeater, also known as a booster. This device picks up cellular signals from outside and “repeats” them inside the house, increasing their strength. The signals from your phone are then broadcast back outside via the repeater, ensuring that both sides of the conversation are clear.Wi-Ex (www.wi-ex.com) makes several cellphone boosters including the zBoost zP YX300 ($169), which covers a small area, and the zBoost YX510 ($400), a larger device for homes or offices that improves coverage over a 3,000-foot zone. These devices have an internal antenna and an external one that can be mounted on a window or outside wall. Because of the way the device rebroadcasts the signal, the external antenna must be about five feet away from the base station. If the antennas are too close, the signals begin to echo each other, reducing range and reception or even blocking the signal.Another new product, the Cell Ranger Stix, is a portable booster that is powered by your car’s cigarette lighter. Available at www.getcellranger.com for $129, the device has an external antenna and a 15-foot cable. You attach the antenna to the back of the car and then run the cable through to the cigarette lighter. While it won’t help in areas with no cell reception at all, it could be useful in areas where signals are too weak to pass through a car’s glass and metal.Booster shoppers need to know that not all boosters work with all carriers, because the carriers use different frequencies and technologies to transmit calls. T-Mobile and AT&T use something called GSM, while Verizon and Sprint use CDMA. The booster, unless it is a universal model, must be compatible with the carrier you use regularly.The presence of boosters on frequencies that belong to the carriers has made them somewhat controversial. The Federal Communications Commission certifies the devices for some purposes, but they recommend contacting your carrier before installing one.If a person is interested in improving coverage with a booster, “we would encourage that person to first work with his or her wireless carrier to identify a certified device that the carrier also approves of before installing it and using it on the network,” said Robert Kenny, a spokesman for the F.C.C.Those in the industry say newer models don’t have the blocking problem. Sina Khanifar, one of the owners of RepeaterStore.com, said a newer booster will amplify only the signals that are being used, preventing it from overwhelming and degrading the cell tower signal. “Because they scan the band, they get lots of additional information about the signal,” Mr. Khanifar said.Of course, boosters require you to shell out your own money to improve a service you are already paying for. Pestering your carrier to upgrade its network is a cheaper — but slower — approach.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','Certain revolutions speak in small voices yet describe profound and sudden change. “L’Histoire du Soldat,” Stravinsky’s traveling music-theater show, was one of them, saying — in few words and not that many notes — what music in 1918 no longer was and at the same time offering an alternative for what music might become.“L’Histoire,” along with Saint-Saëns’s “Carnival of the Animals,” enjoyed a substantial, well-conceived revival at the 92nd Street Y on Tuesday night. The Saint-Saëns, with Alan Alda reading Ogden Nash’s running commentary in verse, had its usual gentle appeal. The Stravinsky was something more: a landmark that perhaps because of its restricted dimensions, has gone largely unnoticed.“L’Histoire” had a single premiere performance and no tour. Its theatrical ambitions were thwarted by a deadly influenza epidemic in both Europe and America. The public knows it best as an instrumental suite, but recordings and occasional performances like this one join the music to C. F. Ramuz’s narrative (here freely interpreted) about a soldier making his way home from duty and fighting an ultimately losing battle with the devil.The music is brightly, sharply colored by seven solo instruments. The violin (Jaime Laredo) scrapes, the clarinet (Alan R. Kay) plays above its normal register. Every hint of Romantic luxury is expunged, and yet these sounds are in no way hostile. Stravinsky’s chorale harmonization toward the end compares favorably in depth and sophistication to one of Bach’s. Metric movement, punctuated by a drum (Ayano Kataoka), is in constant change, though the impression given is of a calculated energy, not a case of nerves.“L’Histoire” bursts with life. After the lingering historical heaviness of Mahler and Schoenberg, listening to it is like opening a window and letting in fresh air. Mr. Alda was the bright-eyed narrator for “Carnival of the Animals” and later served as stage director, actor, storyteller and puppeteer in a production of the Stravinsky that worked on a high professional level and used the small stage well.Noah Wyle was the Soldier, played here as an American in both onstage and in filmed snippets. Colleen Dunn danced, mimed, spoke and, like Mr. Wyle, tried her hand at puppets. Both were very good.'"

But so far, the Chinese authorities have acknowledged the deaths of only 19 people, who they describe as victims of Tibetan violence. Most of them were members of the Han Chinese majority, though at least one was Tibetan. The government has encouraged Han Chinese to migrate to Tibetan areas of the country.There have been official accounts of clashes in which police officers fired on crowds, but without any reports of deaths. On March 16, according to official news accounts, the police shot and wounded protesters in the town of Ngawa, in Sichuan Province.

"'08-05-01,'1','WASHINGTON — The Bush administration and Congress reacted coolly to a new $50 billion proposal by the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to permit the Treasury Department to lend directly to as many as a million homeowners to help ease the housing crisis.The proposal, made public on Wednesday by the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., Sheila C. Bair, would enable borrowers struggling to meet their mortgage payments to take new loans from the government and use the money to reduce the principal on their mortgage, up to 20 percent. The borrowers would have five years before they had to begin to repay the government loans. If the borrower failed to pay, the government would have the first priority on the property to recoup its money. Establishing the program would require legislation.The plan by Ms. Bair, a former Treasury official appointed to her current job by President Bush, comes as Congress has been drafting various housing proposals.The House Financial Services Committee is expected to complete work this week on a measure proposed by the panel’s chairman, Representative Barney Frank, to provide insurance to as many as 1.5 million homeowners facing foreclosure. Three weeks ago, the Senate approved a bill to give tax breaks for home builders and other businesses, a $7,000 tax credit for buyers of foreclosed homes, $150 million for counseling borrowers and $4 billion for local governments to buy foreclosed properties.Concerned that Washington has not responded vigorously enough, Ms. Bair has made a number of proposals that raised objections within the administration. In December, she proposed permanently freezing rates of subprime loans. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. rejected that idea, although ultimately the administration reached an agreement with the mortgage industry to freeze rates for up to five years for some of the two million homeowners who bought homes with subprime loans.“We appreciate her work in this area and we’ll look at the proposal, but we’re more focused now on getting Federal Housing Administration and government-sponsored enterprise legislation over the finish line,” said Michele Davis, a Treasury spokeswoman.Mr. Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the F.D.I.C. proposal was recognition that the Bush administration was not doing enough to stem the mortgage crisis.'"
"'08-05-01,'1','“There is political pressure to be put on China, with more chance of success if we’re united,” Mr. Fillon said.His boss, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, will bring some specific proposals to the summit meeting of the Group of 8 major industrialized countries in July. One Western bargaining chip, Mr. Fillon said, might be the prospect of China’s membership in the group.The French need Washington’s help on China, especially after the fierce anti-France protests in China over Tibet and the Beijing Olympic Games. But France’s emphasis on the yuan might signal the opening of another front between the West and China, the world’s largest emerging economy. The high euro has strained European exports, and the falling dollar has led to concerns in the United States that inflation will accelerate — and that foreigners will start buying not only American products on the cheap, but also American companies.France shares global concerns that the crisis that started with the subprime disaster is not finished. “In several countries, there have been near defaults of financial institutions,” he noted, “and growth forecasts, while not catastrophic, are falling.”But Mr. Fillon, who has been prime minister of the center-right government for nearly a year, has serious domestic political concerns as well. The sudden increase in prices for fuel, basic foods and transportation is making it more difficult for him and Mr. Sarkozy to make good on their promises to institute structural reform and increase the purchasing power of citizens whose salaries are not growing nearly as fast as inflation.Mr. Sarkozy wants to open the French system, with its generous social benefits, to more competition and market forces.“The more time passes, the easier it is to feel resistance, this is why 2008 is a strategic year for us,” Mr. Fillon said.Mr. Fillon, 54, a Gaullist and defense expert, made an electoral pact with the more liberal Mr. Sarkozy to try to push through structural changes from the right. Some of their ideas — deregulating the labor market, reducing the size of the public sector, shrinking the deficit — are hardly original. Other countries, like Britain and even Germany, have instituted such changes.“France is at a key moment of its history,” Mr. Fillon said. “Either she accepts to work more, makes more of an effort, implements reforms and we keep our social model effective — or we let ourselves go, and our social model will become unsustainable, and it’s a process of decline.”“Obviously it’s easier to reform when there is a little growth,” he said, which is “why it’s so important to us to know what the impact of the American crisis will be on our economy, to adjust our budget and the pace of our reforms.”While Mr. Sarkozy’s dramatic personal life has led to a drop in his approval ratings, the poll numbers for Mr. Fillon, a quieter man, have remained higher. That disparity has led to some tension between them, according to the French press. Mr. Fillon has called the reports “exaggerated,” but said recently that although he was loyal to Mr. Sarkozy, he was not a courtier.Asked about his choice of words, Mr. Fillon was momentarily uncomfortable. “I wanted to say that I was loyal, that I was faithful, but that I have my own convictions,” he said.Forty years after French students tried to change the system from the street, they are now terrified of change, Mr. Fillon said. “A majority of the French are pessimistic about the future, which is not the case for most European countries, and that’s especially true for French youth,” he said, “We are late regarding reforms and the young generation feels that there’s something heavy weighing on its future, weighing on its shoulders, that it is going to pay the price of the current generation’s lack of courage, who didn’t push through necessary reforms.”What France needs most, he said, is a restoration of faith, “faith in the future, faith in institutions, faith in the political system.”Mr. Fillon is married to a Welsh woman, Penelope, and they have five children. At a recent France-Wales rugby match, he said, she sang the French national anthem, but very softly. “Then she sang the Welsh national anthem and there” — Mr. Fillon took a huge breath and stretched his arms wide — “oof, with real force!”'"
"'08-05-01,'1','Earlier in April, Mr. Ballmer threatened to start a proxy fight to oust Yahoo’s board if the two companies did not reach a negotiated deal by April 26. The deadline passed without an agreement or substantive negotiations between the companies.Last week, Mr. Ballmer raised the possibility that Microsoft could drop its bid altogether. Other Microsoft executives have said publicly that in the apparent absence of alternatives for Yahoo, their company would be unwilling to increase its offer, and said they planned to announce a decision this week.Analysts maintain that if Microsoft abandons its bid, Yahoo’s share price could be expected to drop substantially. This would not preclude Microsoft from trying to reach a negotiated merger agreement with Yahoo at a later date.Yahoo has repeatedly rejected Microsoft’s offer, originally valued at a total of $44.6 billion, saying it substantially undervalued the company. With a decline in Microsoft’s share price, the value of its stock-and-cash offer has fallen to $41.8 billion.Yahoo’s chief executive, Jerry Yang, has said his board is not opposed to a sale to Microsoft at a higher price.Yahoo continues to explore other options that would allow it to remain independent, including a combination with the AOL Internet unit of Time Warner and a search advertising partnership with Google, according to people close to the company.Spokesmen for Yahoo, Google and Time Warner declined to comment.Google and Yahoo recently conducted a two-week test in which Google delivered ads alongside Yahoo’s search results. The test was intended to determine how much more Yahoo could earn by outsourcing some of its search ads to Google, whose technology is more effective. The results have been positive, according to people close to Yahoo.Antitrust experts have said that a broader search advertising partnership between the companies would be likely to raise objections from regulators, and the Justice Department has begun asking questions about the test. But executives from Google and Yahoo have said it would be possible to structure the deal in a way that would placate regulators. A person close to the discussions said no deal between Google and Yahoo was imminent.'"

"'08-05-02,'1','It would be hard for Florida to surpass its disastrous performance in the 2000 election, but give the Sunshine State credit for trying. Its latest assault on democracy: a law threatening volunteer groups with crippling fines if they make small mistakes in registering voters. The law seems clearly aimed at keeping new voters — especially minorities and the poor — off the rolls. And it is working. The League of Women Voters, which has registered Florida voters since 1939, has called off its registration drive this year.Florida is not the only state trying to stop eligible people from voting. Georgia passed a law in 2005 that made voters pay for their voter ID cards — a modern poll tax. The fee was eventually removed, but the law could still block as many as 300,000 registered voters without the right ID from casting ballots. In 2004, Ohio ordered counties to throw out voter registration forms that were not on thick enough paper.It is chilling to think that state legislators and election officials would intentionally try to make it harder for Americans to vote, but they always have — with poll taxes, literacy tests and gerrymandering. There was a time when the Supreme Court regularly struck these restrictions down. In 1966, it held Virginia’s $1.50 poll tax unconstitutional. In 1972, it ruled that Tennessee’s one-year residency requirement for voting violated the Constitution.Now the Supreme Court has switched sides. This week, it upheld a harsh Indiana voter ID law that could disenfranchise many poor, elderly and student voters. The ruling will make it even easier for other states to block voters’ access to the ballot box.If the courts won’t protect voters, Congress has to. The Constitution, in Article 1, Section 4, gives Congress broad authority to set the rules for federal elections. It should use this power to set minimum voting rights standards that would apply nationwide and ensure that all eligible Americans could vote.'"

"'08-05-02,'1','WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve announced new steps on Friday to help ease tight global credit markets by increasing the size of its cash auctions to banks and allowing financial institutions to put up credit card debt, student loans and car loans as collateral for Fed loans.The Fed also acted in coordination with central banks in Europe to make it easier for European banks to obtain dollars in currency swaps.In a terse statement Friday morning, announced just before the government reported that 20,000 jobs were lost in April, the Fed said that it was acting to counter “persistent liquidity pressures” in credit markets in Europe and the United States.The Fed’s action came as some analysts are saying that a measure of stability has returned to American financial markets after months of turbulence. Nevertheless, the Fed has made clear that it remains concerned about the risk from credit markets seizing up because of losses from bad loans, particularly in the housing sector.Two days ago, the Fed signaled its continuing concern about the economy, lowering short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2 percent from 2.25 percent, while signaling that it would not be lowering rates again for a while.'"
"'08-05-02,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The Federal Reserve on Friday announced steps to help ease persistent strains in credit markets, increasing the size of some cash auctions for financial institutions and the amount of dollars it provides to the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank.The Fed said it was stepping up the amounts offered in its Term Auction Facility auctions, which are held every two weeks, to $75 billion from $50 billion, beginning with an auction on May 5.It also said it was increasing an existing temporary currency swap line with the European Central Bank to $50 billion from $30 billion and increasing a swap line with the Swiss National Bank to $12 billion from $6 billion.The swap lines, which the Fed said it was extending through Jan. 30, 2009, are aimed at sating demand for dollars in European markets.“In view of the persistent liquidity pressures in some term funding markets, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and the Swiss National Bank are announcing an expansion of their liquidity measures,” the Fed said.The Fed launched its Term Auction Facility program in December, and has repeatedly increased the amounts offered under the program to help ease the crunch in credit markets.'"

"'08-05-02,'1','Those forecasts were paired with sharply more pessimistic tax revenue forecasts for the coming years, which Ms. Anglin — echoing Mr. Paterson’s recent calls for more budget cuts — said would require drastic reductions in state spending. Over the past nine months, the state has revised its projections for this year downward by $1.7 billion.“The typical New Yorker is tightening their belts,” Ms. Anglin said. “They’re feeling the crunch of higher prices; they’re having to manage their resources better. I think that the typical New Yorkers should know that we’re aware of that and that the state needs to do the same thing.”The budget gap for the next fiscal year is projected at $5 billion. It is expected to increase to $7.7 billion in the 2010 fiscal year and $8.8 billion in the 2011 fiscal year, according to the budget office, approaching levels not seen since the recession that followed the 9/11 attack, which all but put Lower Manhattan out of business for months.Without the budget cuts already planned for next year, Ms. Anglin said, spending would increase by 10.2 percent over this year compared with revenue increases of only 2.7 percent, a level she described as “not sustainable.” Because of steadily increasing state spending, Ms. Anglin said, even a quick economic recovery would not necessarily ameliorate future budget gaps.Mr. Paterson sought and won hundreds of millions of dollars in additional cuts from his commissioners and agency heads soon after succeeding Gov. Eliot Spitzer in March. And last week, he suggested that he wanted the Legislature to take the unusual step of reopening the budget to seek more cuts for next year and after.The just-approved budget increased spending by 4.8 percent over all for the current fiscal year, with significant increases in school aid, upstate economic development and capital improvements to the state university system. Medicaid continues to be a major state expense.Not since former Gov. George E. Pataki’s first term has New York actually cut spending, said Edmund J. McMahon, director of the Manhattan Institute’s Empire Center for New York State Policy, which advocates lower government spending. Mr. Paterson, he suggested, would need to do the same.“The budget gaps are clearly spending-driven. And the budget gaps were made worse by the budget they just did,” Mr. McMahon said. “The school-aid spigot is going to have to be turned off. And he’s going to have to fight his own battles on Medicaid.”'"
"'08-05-02,'1','IS that much-heralded, and some cynics might say sadly belated, crane safety seminar (don’t even try leaving the Department of Buildings on Lower Broadway without a full-page, freebie invitation) today or is today the excavation site lecture at 7 World Trade? And what day is this, anyway?Please pardon Robert D. LiMandri his temporary amnesia. He is not yet two weeks into learning how to stay afloat in the fishbowl he has occupied since his hasty promotion to acting buildings commissioner. As evidenced by the abandoned Starbucks-and-sidewalk-fruit-vendor spread on his desk, he also forgot to eat lunch — not so wise for a member of the perilously skinny minority.This being Construction Safety Week in New York City, where construction accidents since Jan. 1 have already claimed the lives of more workers (13) than occurred in all of 2007 (12), Mr. LiMandri is making a valiant attempt to appear unfrazzled while having his commissioner chain jerked in several directions simultaneously. He was appointed acting commissioner of the chronically dysfunctional — and sporadically corrupt — Buildings Department by the Bloomberg administration on April 22, the same day the administration urged and accepted the resignation of his boss, Patricia J. Lancaster.Ms. Lancaster, whose tenure commenced in 2002 with a mayoral mandate to rewrite the city’s incomprehensible building code, was undone by a series of construction accidents linked to improper safety inspections culminating in a crane collapse in March that killed seven people.“The inspector lied, and that really peeves me off,” says Mr. LiMandri, 43, who grew up on Long Island and lives in Hollis Hills, Queens, with his wife and two sons. (He takes perverse pride in being one of just two Yankees fans in his Mets-rabid neighborhood.) His first order of business is to uproot the liars and the lax from his inspection staff. “If we catch you, we’re going to show you the door,” he says. He is empowered by an administrative realignment that groups the Buildings Department under the same public safety mantle as the Police and Fire Departments. “We need to make it clear to everyone at the construction table that we are like the P.D. and Fire, and we need to regulate like them,” Mr. LiMandri says.HIS new obligations include, for starters: repairing a department in which an inspector failed to investigate a complaint about the instability of a crane that 10 days later collapsed at an East Side building site and killed seven people; ratcheting up compliance by adding 20 specialized engineers to reinspect construction sites throughout the city; reassuring the public that it is safe to stroll the sidewalks of a city that has come to resemble a construction beehive.'"
"'08-05-02,'1','As has often been noted, Hamm is something of a ham, and Mr. Turturro serves up a nicely cooked one. “Can there be misery loftier than mine?” he asks with a thrill of grandiloquence. His Hamm luxuriates in the sound of his own voice in self-dramatizing rhapsodies that echo absurdly in the emptiness around him.Mr. Turturro varies the dynamics of his performance with a robustness that pays homage to old-school histrionics, using a booming basso note for Hamm’s more majestic pronouncements; leaping into a shrill, metallic bark when Hamm is abruptly seized by a need to see the world outside through Clov, his vicarious eyes; and by embroidering Hamm’s monologues with flowery arm gestures. Eventually a craven dependency creeps into his voice, a soft nasal whine that signifies the bleeding heart inside Hamm, the “solitary child who turns himself into children, two, three, so as to be together, and whisper together, in the dark.”Mr. Casella imbues his performance with a vivid physicality as Clov staggers through routines he finds both laughably pointless and absolutely necessary. He moves with a pigeon-toed, wobbly, herky-jerky gait suggesting that Clov has been walking so long he has somehow forgotten how to do it. Clov and Hamm lurch from day to day enacting the same bickering rituals but forgetting when to do what, and why they have to keep doing anything at all. (“Is it not time for my painkiller?” Hamm keeps asking.)I was full of admiration for Mr. Epstein’s performance as Nagg in a production at the Irish Repertory Theater a few seasons back. So it was a pleasure to re-encounter it here, and marvel anew at its pungent humor and unforced pathos. Mr. Epstein’s braying, babyish voice, his gumming mouth and sly, scornful looks at his son, are hilarious. Nor will I soon forget the arresting piteousness of those bony white fingers spidering skittishly along the rim of the garbage as Nagg pleads for a sugarplum or tries to cajole Nell into a shared reverie of their happy past.This passage may just be the most haunting in the production, thanks to the perfectly calibrated, tragicomic rapport between Mr. Epstein and Ms. Stritch, who selects from her capacious persona just the emotional notes specific to this small role. (Did I imagine Ms. Stritch’s initial, conspiratorial little wink, which seemed to say: “Yes, it’s me in here. No, I won’t be doing ‘Ladies Who Lunch’ for an encore, so let me get on with it”?)Ms. Stritch has always retained an odd air of girlishness, and she uses it here to memorable effect, her bright blue eyes popping with elegiac wonder as Nagg reminds her of a joyous moment in the past. But the look of animation turns stricken and empty as Nagg embarks on a meandering comic anecdote.“I tell this story worse and worse,” he says bitterly, although he insists that Nell once found it so very funny when he first told it, all that time ago. But no. “It was because I felt happy,” Nell says simply, as the smile of recollection gradually freezes into a grim rictus.Any effective production of “Endgame” has a similar impact. The laughter curdles as the ludicrous humor of the situation before us begins to settle uneasily into the mind and wrap itself insidiously around memories of experience, the piles of days and years that drag on and on as they fly by. “It’s like the funny story we have heard too often,” as Nell says. “We still find it funny. But we don’t laugh anymore.”By Samuel Beckett; directed by Andrei Belgrader; sets by Anita Stewart; costumes by Candice Donnelly; lighting by Michael Chybowski; production stage manager, James Latus; assistant stage manager, Tom Taylor; presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Alan H.

"'08-05-02,'1','1. Get a full evaluation by a urologist, said Tracy L. Rankin, program director of male reproductive health at the National Institutes of Health. Most fertility centers request a semen analysis to identify men with low sperm count and other sperm problems. A urologist can screen for cancer, since the risk of testicular cancer is up to 30 times higher in men with severely low sperm counts.2. “Infertility” is a relative term for men. A man with a low sperm count (under 20 million per milliliter) could impregnate his wife, but it may take longer than a man with a healthier count. Be wary of clinicians who talk in absolutes, advises Dr. Robert A. Greene, a reproductive endocrinologist and medical director of the Sher Institute for Reproductive Medicine of Northern California. In addition, men should make sure they have at least two semen analyses before deciding on any treatment. Semen can vary considerably in a man from month to month.3. A man should not ignore a low sperm count, said Dr. Harry Fisch, professor of clinical urology at Columbia University in New York. “If you have a sperm problem, you may have another health problem,” he said. Some causes of low sperm count, like a urinary tract infection, can be treated. “One of the most common things I see are infections in men,” Dr. Fisch said. “When I treat it with antibiotics, fertility rates skyrocket.”4. Being overweight is an important risk factor for infertility. “Thirty percent of people who are overweight have a lower sperm count,” Dr. Fisch said. Losing as little as 5 percent of body weight can improve fertility. Other causes of low sperm count include smoking, drinking, high blood pressure and certain medications. All of these factors are believed to cause oxidative stress, an increased level of oxygen free radicals that can damage sperm DNA. Despite a lack of good evidence, some fertility experts have long advised all men who are experiencing infertility to take antioxidants to help minimize this damage.5. Consider psychological concerns. Though most men with fertility problems have fairly normal testosterone levels, many men feel as if their masculinity is in question if they cannot impregnate their partner, said Anne Adams, director of policy and programming at The American Fertility Association. Though men are becoming more open to the idea of fertility treatments, there is still tremendous resistance. Men can seek support through various infertility Web sites and organizations like the American Fertility Association, Resolve and Fertility Community.'"

"'08-05-03,'0','Tzelem (the Hebrew word meaning “image,” as in “people are created in the image of God”) is developing curriculums around intimacy and sexual development and health for yeshiva students starting in fourth grade. The project also has an as-yet-untitled book in the works that will be something like a kosher “Joy of Sex.”A lively discussion forum of sexual issues for Orthodox Jews can be found on the Web site of a wedding-planning company called Calm Kallahs, or brides.Marla Lemonik, Calm Kallahs’s owner, started the discussion board in 2005 because she found that many prospective brides were asking her about sex.“A lot of the brides felt they were too embarrassed to ask the questions at kallah classes and that they didn’t have anyone else to ask, so they asked someone they would never see again,” Ms. Lemonik said. “The whole point of the message boards is to give people a place to ask technical questions, for lack of a better word, because they felt so uncomfortable discussing it face to face.”In the Orthodox community, physical contact with the opposite sex — even holding hands or being in the same room with the door closed — is off limits before marriage. Schools are single-sex and offer little in the way of sexual education, and young people rarely discuss the issue with their parents. Socializing between boys and girls is frowned upon. Among the most strictly Orthodox, teenagers are sometimes punished for publicly chatting with peers of the opposite sex.Indeed, even as sex has become more openly a part of American popular culture, Orthodox leaders have increasingly emphasized a culture of modesty.“Increased media exposure does force the issue a little bit more in the Orthodox community,” said Bat Sheva Marcus, clinical director of the Medical Center for Female Sexuality, which has offices in Manhattan and Purchase, N.Y. “But because of the tone the media takes, which is crass and nonrespectful, which the Orthodox community would say is nonholy, it’s discounted.”Ms. Marcus is a medical sexologist and observant Jew, and finds that many of her Orthodox Jewish patients are unfamiliar with even the basics of sexual health.She told the story of a young Hasidic woman who had been married two years without becoming pregnant. After seeing a fertility specialist, the woman was referred to Ms. Marcus, who discovered that the patient and her husband had no idea that they had never consummated their marriage.“I have variations on that all the time,” Ms. Marcus said. “There’s a complete lack of information about their bodies below their navels.”Ms. Marcus was chairwoman of a conference in March titled “Demystifying Sex and Teaching Halacha: A Kallah Teacher’s Workshop.” (Halacha is Jewish law.) It was held at Drisha, a Manhattan institute of advanced Torah study for women, and co-sponsored by the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance and Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, a rabbinical school.It is “important to bring the issue up in a more public way,” said Ms. Rosenfeld, of Tzelem. “Our notion of modesty is misguided if it’s leading us to send couples into marriage without adequate preparation. The problem of an unconsummated marriage under banner of modesty is not a Jewish value.”Even as Orthodox teenagers and young adults are exposed to sexualized images in popular culture, the age of marriage has risen. While ultra-Orthodox Jews still generally marry in their late teens to early 20s, Modern Orthodox Jews typically wed in their mid-to-late 20s, and some wait until their early 30s, said Sylvia Barack Fishman, professor of contemporary Jewry and American Jewish sociology at Brandeis University.There are also pockets, like the Upper West Side of Manhattan, where there are many older singles, said David Pelcovitz, professor of education and psychology at Yeshiva University, who spoke at a two-session forum in January at a synagogue there, Congregation Ohab Zedek, that drew some 200 people.“We heard some of the frustrations and challenges of the Modern Orthodox single community, in terms of their sexuality,” Professor Pelcovitz said. “People were really happy that it was being addressed. They’re single for longer periods of time, and sexual human beings, yet living under ethical guidelines that don’t allow them to engage it.”“I don’t know that it would have taken place a few years ago,” he said of the forum. “Now, the community was willing to have it.”Orly Lieberman, a kallah teacher from Manhattan who attended the March conference at Drisha, echoed Professor Pelcovitz’s view that such events reflected the development of a conversation about sexuality in the Orthodox community.“We’re all sitting here having open conversations about how to talk about sex in a way that fosters healthy relationships between husbands and wives,” Ms. Lieberman said. “That alone shows that something is happening here.”'"
"'08-05-03,'0','“But before you decide to sign on to that kind of a program, go to Canada, or go to European countries that have government-run health care systems,” he continued. “My friends, they don’t work, they’re inefficient, and they end up in a two-tiered system where the wealthiest can afford to pay for their own health care and those with low income sometimes wait six or eight months for a routine kind of treatment. And that’s what I’m not going to let happen to the United States of America.”Earlier in the campaign Mr. McCain made the accusation more explicitly. “There will be efforts to have a single-payer big government solution by the Democrats,” he said at a debate in Orlando, Fla., in October. “They’ve already espoused those causes. If you believe them, please take a trip to Canada or England before you decide to support such a thing.”And in August when he was interviewed by Charlie Rose on PBS, Mr. McCain said: “Look at what the Democrats’ proposal is. It’s a government-run, single-payer system like they have in Canada and like they have in England.”Mr. Rose interrupted: “But I beg to differ. They will say that it is not that at all.”Language, of course, is a potent weapon in the battle to shape policy. And Mr. McCain’s effort to cast the Democrats’ plans as a government takeover is just the latest example in a long tradition of using similar language to characterize proposals to change the health care system, said Robert J. Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard.“In the campaign, what Senator McCain tries to appeal to is a general antigovernment feeling, a sense that we shouldn’t be doing things too big,” Professor Blendon said. “In a sense he’s appealing to a value that may or may not relate to the policies being discussed by either of the candidates.”The only Democratic presidential candidate to propose a true single-payer, Medicare-for-all type of health plan in this election cycle was Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio. Mr. Obama’s and Mrs. Clinton’s plans do not call for a single-payer system like Canadians have, or a government-run national health system like the British have.Both candidates have called for universal health coverage, with Mrs. Clinton saying she would require everyone to have insurance and Mr. Obama saying he would mandate coverage for children. Both would maintain the existing private insurance system, providing government subsidies or tax credits to help the low-income uninsured afford premiums. And they would give consumers a new option to buy insurance from the federal government, with policies along the lines of Medicare.Some opponents — and even some supporters — of such universal health care proposals believe that they could eventually lead to something like a single-payer system.Tucker Bounds, a McCain campaign spokesman, noted that Mr. Obama had called himself “a proponent of a single-payer health care program” in 2003. And he noted that just this week, Mr. Obama had spoken favorably of systems in Canada and Europe and said, “If I were designing a system from scratch, if I were just starting from zero , I would probably set up a similar system, just a Medicare-for-all plan.”But Mr. Obama has even stopped short of mandating health insurance for everyone.Mr. Bounds said that Mr. McCain’s characterization of the Democrats’ plans was completely reasonable. “While their proposals may not outline one to the finite extent, they clearly suggest that the movement toward a single-payer system is in their overall interests,” he said.Democrats and Republicans view health care differently, polls suggest. Surveys have found that the most significant health concern voiced by Democrats is expanding coverage for the uninsured, while Republicans and independents are more focused on bringing down health care’s cost.Even the phrase “socialized medicine” means different things to members of each party. A telephone survey conducted earlier this year by the Harvard School of Public Health and Harris Interactive found that 70 percent of Republicans thought that “socialized medicine” would be worse than the current system, while 70 percent of Democrats thought that it would be better.'"
"'08-05-03,'0','The recent wave of bankruptcies in American retailing widened on Friday as Linens ’n Things, the big seller of beddings and home furnishings, filed for protection from its creditors.Staggering under heavy debts and declining sales, the 33-year-old company plans to close 120 of its 551 stores in the United States. About 2,500 employees will lose their jobs.Linens ’n Things is the latest in a string of retailers — among them the furniture store Levitz, the electronics seller Sharper Image and the catalog and Internet retailer Lillian Vernon — that have sought protection in recent months as consumers tighten their belts. The industry’s troubles have prompted thousands of store closings across the country.Michael Gries, who was appointed interim chief executive of Linens ’n Things on Friday to oversee a restructuring, said in an interview that the company filed for bankruptcy with the support of its lenders, bondholders and vendors. The company hopes to devise a capital restructuring and other business plans within two to three months, he said.“While this is not a prearranged bankruptcy, we’re hoping it will lead to a soft landing,” said Mr. Gries, a principal at the restructuring firm Conway, Del Genio, Gries & Company.'"
"'08-05-03,'0','The Republicans, meanwhile, recycled some of their old proposals to increase domestic production, with bills that would allow drilling in the Arctic, as well as in the Atlantic and Pacific, and would mandate increased production of fuel derived from coal.Although officials at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue and on the campaign trail are eager to appear active in addressing the most critical pocket-book issue of the moment — Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, is calling for a “new Manhattan Project for clean energy independence” — officials quietly acknowledge that there is little that government can do in the short term to bring relief.With $60 fill-ups routine in many regions, lawmakers in both parties are revving up efforts to make clear they are paying attention. They are also seeking to capitalize, with Republicans suggesting that Democrats are secretly pleased about the high prices because it is better environmentally if people drive less, and Democrats suggesting that Republicans are secretly happy about high prices because they are allies of big oil companies.“We’re seeing the price soar higher and higher, and it’s an election year,” Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said this week at a news conference. “For some, honest talk about energy is there, and it’s real. But for many, honest talk and high prices are not a very good combination.”Mr. Domenici insisted that the Republican proposals would help, if not right away, definitely over the longer term.Both Republicans and Democrats faced unusually strong skepticism from the press corps.“Most of the provisions in this bill,” a reporter told Mr. Domenici, “the offshore drilling, the coal-to-liquid, have all failed at some point previously. What makes you think that there’s any chance that any of this would pass in this Congress or that there’s any support?”Mr. Domenici said, “Let me say, ma’am, none of those failed when oil was $112, $115.”At a Democrats’ news conference on Thursday, another reporter asked the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, “Are these going to be fresh ideas or just regurgitated old ones that haven’t been passed?”Mr. Reid laughed off the question, promising that Democrats would announce eye-popping proposals on Friday. Apparently, they were not quite eye-popping enough, because Mr. Reid postponed the announcement until next week.Democratic aides said their bills would have five core components: a temporary moratorium on Strategic Petroleum Reserve contributions; new taxes on big oil companies’ “windfall” profits; a crackdown on price gouging; Mr. Kohl’s so-called Nopec plan, which would allow antitrust suits against OPEC; and new efforts to reduce speculation in oil futures.Some Democrats have called on the Bush administration to delay arms deals with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other OPEC members unless they agree to increase oil production.Tougher regulation of the futures market may be an area where lawmakers in both parties and the White House can find common ground, and it may also be an area where new public policy could make a dent in high prices.In the fall, the Indian petroleum secretary proposed halting the trading of crude oil on commodities exchanges in an effort to drive down prices. Some oil-producing nations have said they believe that prices are inflated 25 percent to 40 percent above market demand because of real, or fraudulent, speculative trading.The Federal Trade Commission announced on Thursday that it was developing new rules against manipulation of the market. Last year, Congress gave the commission wider authority to prohibit such manipulation.Democratic lawmakers hailed the F.T.C. announcement and said they hoped to pursue measures that would limit speculation.Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, said Thursday in a speech on the Senate floor and Friday at a news conference that increased regulation could prevent market manipulation that was spiking prices.“We are going to use this law and this new rule to police the oil markets and stop any kind of activity that is spiking the price of gasoline and running our economy,” Ms. Cantwell said.'"
"'08-05-03,'0','Pfizer has started settling cases over its Celebrex and Bextra painkillers, a New York lawyer said on Friday.The company has begun negotiating settlements with individual plaintiff’s firms, David S.

Celebrex, in the same class of medicines as Merck’s recalled Vioxx, is Pfizer’s third-best-selling drug. The product, which is still on the market, generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2007, a 12 percent increase from the previous year.The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Pfizer had reached settlements with three law firms representing more than 200 of the thousands who sued over the drugs. Firms have been offered $40,000 to $50,000 a client to resolve Bextra cases and as much as $200,000 a client for Celebrex, The Journal reported, citing an unidentified lawyer.Pfizer withdrew Bextra in April 2005 after it was tied to a potentially fatal skin condition.The first Bextra trial, due to begin May 5 in federal court in San Francisco, was postponed until May 29, according to court records.'"
"'08-05-03,'0','The White House says there is no reason for Mr. Bush to talk about recession absent concrete proof the nation is in one, and it has been assertive about pushing back. When NBC News reported Wednesday that first-quarter growth data showed the nation just short of a recession, Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, sent a complaint to the anchor, Brian Williams.“I e-mailed Brian and his producers and said, ‘No, you’re wrong,’ ” Mr. Fratto recalled.Aboard Air Force One on the way here Friday, Mr. Fratto dismissed talk of even a mild recession, saying the new jobs numbers were “not in recessionary territory.”The comment drew a sharp rebuke from Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, who ridiculed Mr. Bush and his advisers, saying they had not gotten the news that “this is a recession that is hurting more Americans every day.”But “recession,” an emotionally freighted word, also has a technical meaning, and with Wall Street whispering another r-word — “rebound” — some economists say Mr. Bush is correct not to use it just yet. Michael T. Darda, the chief economist at MKM Partners, a nonpartisan brokerage and research firm, said Friday’s numbers suggested “a sharp slowdown,” not quite a recession.The official determination will come from the National Bureau of Economic Research, an independent organization that tracks fluctuations in the business cycle. Luckily for Mr. Bush, the bureau works slowly — so slowly that there may be no official word until after he leaves office. The last recession ended in November 2001; the bureau declared it official in June 2003.There is no hard and fast way to define a recession; the old rule of thumb — two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth — no longer applies. Instead, the bureau defines recession as “a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months,” and relies on a mix of economic indicators.That leaves the White House free to choose its own words — a linguistic challenge that has bedeviled presidents past.When a top adviser to President Jimmy Carter, Alfred E. Kahn, warned of a depression, Mr. Carter was furious, and Mr. Kahn dropped the word from his vocabulary, substituting “banana.” (“We’re now in danger of having the worst banana in 45 years,” Time Magazine quoted him saying in 1978.) Mr. Carter himself is known for what many remember as his malaise speech (an aide, not Mr. Carter, used the word, but it stuck).Mr. Bush’s father, President George Bush, lost re-election in 1992 in part because his tone was out of sync with what Americans felt. “He kept saying things have turned a corner, they’re looking up; and statistically he was right,” Mr. Luntz said. “But nobody believed him.”The current Bush administration engaged in pessimistic economic talk early on, using it to make the case that tax cuts would spur growth. Even before taking office, Vice President Dick Cheney warned that the country could be “on the front edge of a recession”; in March 2001, Mr. Bush warned that the economy was “beginning to sputter.”That turned out to be accurate; the economic research bureau dates March as the beginning of the 2001 recession. But the remarks left Mr. Bush open to accusations of preying on anxieties to advance his tax agenda, said B. Dan Wood, a political scientist at Texas A & M University who has written a book on presidential economic rhetoric.“In my view he lost credibility about the economy,” Professor Wood said.Mr. Bush began this year talking about the economy’s resilience, and its strong foundation, but as the picture has darkened, such talk often fell by the wayside. Here on Friday, it was back, with the president sounding far more chipper than just a few days ago in the Rose Garden, before the latest reports.“I know it’s tough times and I know you’re having to pay more at the fuel pump than you want,” Mr. Bush said. “But this economy’s going to come on. I’m confident it will.”'"
"'08-05-03,'0','The award to Ms. Koller, with a prize of $150,000, is viewed by scientists and industry executives as validating her research, which has helped transform artificial intelligence from science fiction and speculation into an engineering discipline that is creating an array of intelligent machines and systems. It is not the first such recognition; in 2004, Ms. Koller received a $500,000 MacArthur Fellowship.Ms. Koller is part of a revival of interest in artificial intelligence. After three decades of disappointments, artificial intelligence researchers are making progress. Recent developments made possible spam filters, Microsoft’s new ClearFlow traffic maps and the driverless robotic cars that Stanford teams have built for competitions sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.Since arriving at Stanford as a professor in 1995, Ms. Koller has led a group of researchers who have reinvented the discipline of artificial intelligence. Pioneered during the 1960s, the field was originally dominated by efforts to build reasoning systems from logic and rules. Judea Pearl, a computer scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, had a decade earlier advanced statistical techniques that relied on repeated measurements of real-world phenomena.Called the Bayesian approach, it centers on a formula for updating the probabilities of events based on repeated observations. The Bayes rule, named for the 18th-century mathematician Thomas Bayes, describes how to transform a current assumption about an event into a revised, more accurate assumption after observing further evidence.Ms. Koller has led research that has greatly increased the scope of existing Bayesian-related software. “When I started in the mid- to late 1980s, there was a sense that numbers didn’t belong in A.I.,” she said in a recent interview. “People didn’t think in numbers, so why should computers use numbers?”Ms. Koller is beginning to apply her algorithms more generally to help scientists discern patterns in vast collections of data.“The world is noisy and messy,” Ms. Koller said. “You need to deal with the noise and uncertainty.”That philosophy has led her to do research in game theory and artificial intelligence, and more recently in molecular biology.Her tools led to a new type of cancer gene map based on examining the behavior of a large number of genes that are active in a variety of tumors. From the research, scientists were able to develop a new explanation of how breast tumors spread into bone.One potentially promising area to apply Ms. Koller’s theoretical work will be the emerging field of information extraction, which could be applied to Web searches. Web pages would be read by software systems that could organize the information and effectively understand unstructured text.“Daphne is one of the most passionate researchers in the A.I. community,” said Eric Horvitz, a Microsoft researcher and president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. “After being immersed for a few years with the computational challenges of decoding regulatory genomics, she confided her excitement to me, saying something like, ‘I think I’ve become a biologist — I mean a real biologist — and it’s fabulous.’ ”To that end, Ms. Koller is spending a sabbatical doing research with biologists at the University of California, San Francisco. Because biology is increasingly computational, her expertise is vital in gaining deeper understanding of cellular processes.Ms. Koller grew up in an academic family in Israel, the daughter of a botanist and an English professor. While her father spent a year at Stanford in 1981 when she was 12, she began programming on a Radio Shack PC that she shared with another student.When her family returned to Israel the next year, she told her father, the botanist, that she was bored with high school and wanted to pursue something more stimulating in college. After half a year, she persuaded him to let her enter Hebrew University, where she studied computer science and mathematics.By 17, she was teaching a database course at the university. The next year she received her master’s degree and then joined the Israeli Army before coming to the United States to study for a Ph.D. at Stanford.She didn’t spend her time looking at a computer monitor. “I find it distressing that the view of the field is that you sit in your office by yourself surrounded by old pizza boxes and cans of Coke, hacking away at the bowels of the Windows operating system,” she said. “I spend most of my time thinking about things like how does a cell work or how do we understand images in the world around us?”In recent years, many of her graduate students have gone to work at Google. However she tries to persuade undergraduates to stay in academia and not rush off to become software engineers at start-up companies.She acknowledges that the allure of Silicon Valley riches can be seductive. “My husband still berates me for not having jumped on the Google bandwagon at the beginning,” she said. Still, she insists she does not regret her decision to stay in academia. “I like the freedom to explore the things I care about,” she said.'"

"'08-05-03,'0','Spokesmen for Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment.The renewed discussions would explain the silence from Microsoft this week after the passing of an April 26 deadline it had imposed on Yahoo to reach a negotiated merger. Microsoft had threatened to wage a proxy contest if Yahoo did not meet the deadline. A week has passed without any announcement from Microsoft about how it intends to proceed.Shares of Yahoo rallied Friday on news of the renewed talks, rising to $28.67, up $1.86, or nearly 7 percent. Microsoft shares dropped to $29.24, or half a percent.The main stumbling block has been a sharp disagreement over the value of Yahoo. Microsoft’s initial stock-and-cash offer, made Jan. 31, was valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 a share. After the decline in Microsoft’s share price, the offer was worth $29.40 a share on Friday.Yahoo repeatedly rejected Microsoft’s bid, saying it substantially undervalued the company. But Jerry Yang, the co-founder and chief executive, said he would not be opposed to a deal with Microsoft at a higher price.Speaking to Microsoft employees on Thursday, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, said: “I know exactly what I think Yahoo is worth to me.” Mr. Ballmer added, “I won’t go a dime above, and I will go to what I think it’s worth if that gets the deal done.”The higher offer was as much an attempt to bring Yahoo to the negotiating table as an effort to win over large Yahoo shareholders, whose support would be essential in a proxy fight. Some Yahoo shareholders had signaled they were holding out for more than $35 a share. Each $1 a share represents about $1.4 billion extra in the value of the deal.Mr. Ballmer had personally lobbied large Yahoo shareholders in recent days, according to people familiar with the discussions. On Friday, the calls from representatives from both companies to large shareholders intensified, according to people involved in the discussions.Analysts said that by raising its offer, Microsoft was probably trying to avoid having to follow through with a hostile bid, which it was uncertain to win and which could have resulted in a drawn-out battle and the defection of many Yahoo employees.“Everybody wants to avoid an outright hostile bid,” said Morton A. Pierce, who heads the mergers and acquisitions practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf, a law firm in New York.While Microsoft’s decision to raise its offer represents an about-face for Mr. Ballmer, who last month had threatened to lower it, Mr. Pierce said that investors would judge his maneuvering by the ultimate outcome of the negotiations.“You threaten to lower in an attempt to get people to the negotiating table,” Mr. Pierce said. “It doesn’t mean that you have to carry through with it. If he is successful in the end, it means the tactic was successful.”Since Microsoft’s made its bid public on Feb. 1, Yahoo has explored a series of strategic alternatives that would allow it to remain independent. That included talks about potential mergers with the MySpace unit of the News Corporation and the AOL unit of Time Warner. Talks with News Corporation have not been active for some time.Yahoo also conducted a two-week test in which Google placed ads alongside Yahoo search results. The test was intended to see how much more Yahoo could earn by outsourcing a portion of its search advertising business to Google, which has more effective technology.Even as Microsoft and Yahoo were talking Friday, Yahoo was also talking with Google about a broader search advertising partnership, said a person with knowledge of the discussions. If talks with Microsoft collapse, analysts say Yahoo will probably follow through with a Google deal.“Unless there is a friendly deal, I don’t think there is any question that Yahoo will probably pursue an extended relationship with Google,” said Scott Kessler, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s.'"
"'08-05-03,'0','NEW DELHI — A week after the Chinese government offered to meet with representatives of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan government in exile in India announced Friday that two envoys were on their way to an undisclosed location in China for “informal” discussions. But in a signal of low expectations, the announcement predicted that the visit would be “brief.”The envoys, based in Switzerland and the United States, were scheduled to reach China on Saturday, the Tibetan statement said. “During this brief visit, they will convey His Holiness the Dalai Lama’s deep concerns about the Chinese authorities’ handling of the situation and also provide suggestions to bring peace to the region,” Chhime R. Chhoekyapa, the Dalai Lama’s private secretary, said in the statement, from the seat of the Tibetan government in exile in the North Indian town of Dharamsala.It is unclear whether the talks could yield anything substantial when accusations continue to be lobbed by each side.On Friday, for instance, alongside the statement on the envoys’ visit to China, the Tibetan administration in India sent out a list of Tibetans it said had been killed or beaten and arrested in China in recent weeks.In the same statement, it condemned what it called the “arbitrary sentences” China handed down on Tuesday for 30 Tibetans, with terms ranging from three years to life in prison for convictions on charges that include attacking the police, burning vehicles and looting stores. The Tibetan statement said the defendants were given no more than a “pretense of a fair trial.”Last week, the government in exile greeted China’s offer of dialogue by saying the crackdown inside Tibet would have to stop if talks were to be meaningful. On Friday afternoon, a spokesman for the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Taklha, went further by saying he hoped that “the Chinese recognize a majority of Tibetan people have deep resentments against Chinese policies.”From the Chinese side, vitriol continued throughout the week, as editorials in the press again painted the Dalai Lama as an instigator of violence inside Tibet. An opinion article in The China Daily said he and his followers were “seeking to revive theocracy, the darkest and the cruelest system in Tibetan history.”'"

Preska said that Mr. Anemone had “a long history of disruptive and insubordinate behavior,” and that “no reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff was terminated for an impermissible reason.”Mr. Anemone said in an interview on Saturday that he had not read Judge Preska’s ruling, but added that he was not discouraged and planned to appeal. “Reasonable people can differ,” Mr. Anemone said. “In this case, I beg to differ with the judge on her interpretation. We’ll have to let an appellate panel see if they agree or disagree.”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','“You have made it a one-game series,” Woodson told his players. “You have a chance to do something special.”The Celtics are trying to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the fourth No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 8 seed in the playoffs. They were 66-16 in the regular season, but they have seemed old in several games against the Hawks.Johnson, who has emerged as an All-Star, said he watched the Celtics bending over, clutching their shorts, in the fourth quarter of the Hawks’ 103-100 victory Friday night. Johnson said that Kevin Garnett and Kendrick Perkins, in particular, seemed tired, especially on pick and rolls.“They weren’t coming as fast,” Johnson said. “Sometimes, they weren’t coming at all.”The Celtics have won all three games of the series that have been played at TD Banknorth Garden. The victories have been convincing, by an average of 22 points. The Celtics seem to play with more energy at home, and the Hawks have not figured out how to combat Boston’s pressure when the Celtics are playing on their own court. “We feel good at home all the time,” said Doc Rivers, Boston’s coach. “That’s why we fought all year to get home-court advantage. As I said after Game 5, we can’t just hang our hat on being at home.”Atlanta is shooting 47.6 percent from the field at Philips Arena, but only 39 percent in Boston. The Hawks have turned the ball over 94 times, compared with only 66 turnovers for the Celtics.The health of the 6-foot-9 forward Marvin Williams, who has been assigned to guard the Celtics’ Paul Pierce, may be a more-pressing issue for the Hawks.Williams sprained his left knee in the second half of Game 6 on Friday. He limped through Saturday’s walk-through with the knee bandaged, and the Hawks listed him as doubtful for Sunday’s game, although Woodson said, “My gut says he’ll play.”The Hawks have been able to win because players other than Johnson — Williams, for example — have established themselves. Johnson, who scored 35 points in Atlanta’s Game 4 win, had only 7 points through three quarters in Game 6 because of the Celtics’ relentless double teams. The Hawks responded by sharing the scoring duties, and six players finished in double figures.The Celtics want to regroup and show the same strong defense they displayed during the regular season. Boston gave up 90.3 points a game; only Detroit had a better average.“It’s either win or go home,” Celtics guard Rajon Rondo said. “We’ve just got to go out there and get the job done.”'"

"'08-05-04,'0','Dean Strom, a financial planner from Muskego, Wis., usually goes to 20 to 30 races a year, mostly at grass-roots-level short tracks in the Midwest. These days he has more incentive to stay home.“Now there’s the gas price issue,” said Strom, who also works as the public address announcer at the Milwaukee Mile racetrack. “I think twice now before I go and do something.”Racetracks generally do not release official attendance numbers. But in a recent conference call with financial analysts, officials with one major track, International Speedway Corp., said the company was seeing a high-single-digit percentage drop in ticket sales over last year.Wheeler is hoping unlimited hamburgers, hot dogs and snacks will help his track, which is run by a rival company, Speedway Motorsports. He is selling $89 all-you-can-eat tickets to his race, an idea he said he lifted from baseball’s Atlanta Braves.He is also promoting the Nascar All-Star race, set for May 17 at Lowe’s. To rev up fans for that, he has added entertainment — a burnout competition in which drivers will perform wheel-spinning, tire-smoking pirouettes in their cars, the way they do after winning a race.Indianapolis Motor Speedway is hoping the publicity generated by Danica Patrick’s recent victory, the first by a woman in the IndyCar series, and a recent reunification of two rival racing series will raise interest for the May 25 Indianapolis 500.The track is also showcasing rock music acts in the weeks leading up to the race, aiming to turn qualifying and practice sessions into fan festivals.Indianapolis Motor Speedway’s president, Joie Chitwood, said ticket sales for the track’s July 27 Nascar race, the Brickyard 400, were looking “a little bit tougher these days” and might be a sign that the economy is having an impact on racing.So far, Wheeler said, ticket sales for the All-Star race, an event that costs less and usually draws more local fans than the 600-miler, are “substantially ahead” of last year.Sales for the Coca-Cola 600 are “not ahead,” he said — although the all-you-can-eat section is selling well.Jon Ackley, who teaches a course on the business of Nascar at Virginia Commonwealth University, sees plenty of out-of-state license plates at Richmond International Raceway.But with a Nascar Sprint Cup series race coming up in Richmond this weekend, Ackley could not help noticing that the track still had tickets on sale last week.“Clearly, the gas prices are having an impact on travel plans,” Ackley said.Texas Motor Speedway did not sell out its April 6 Sprint Cup race, but it did draw more than 180,000 fans — “three times the Super Bowl,” the track president, Eddie Gossage, said.At Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, sales of a $159 package for a family of four to sit in the tougher-to-sell backstretch have gone up 600 percent in the past three years.During the energy crisis of the 1970s, Wheeler found a way around gas shortages that might have prevented fans from making it to the track: He hired a former oil company executive to drive up the Interstates leading to Charlotte and pay gas station owners $500 each to guarantee a fill-up to any fan holding race tickets.“I don’t know if it was legal or not,” he said, chuckling. “I think, it was good old American capitalism.”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Sometimes it feels as if nothing is what it seems. Iraqi ambulances have been used to ferry weapons, and homes are used as safe houses for militia fighters. Men in the vests of municipal road workers sometimes toil at burying improvised explosive devices while Iraqi and American forces have holed up in schools and Education Ministry buildings.The sign at the iron gate at the entrance to the building demolished by the American strike reads “Imam Hussein’s Resthouse.”The Americans described the building in a statement as “a “criminal element command and control center.”“Intelligence reports indicate the command and control center was used by criminal elements to plan and coordinate attacks against Iraqi security and coalition forces and innocent Iraqi citizens,” the statement said.When asked about the attack, Col. Gerald O’Hara, a spokesman for the multinational forces, said the Americans “take great care to prevent any collateral damage and will continue to do so.”“We don’t target civilians and regret any casualties,” he added. One of the leaders of the Sadr bloc in Parliament, Nassar al-Rubaie, condemned the attacks, which are mainly focused on the Mahdi Army and other militias associated with Moktada al-Sadr, a radical Shiite cleric. “We blame the government as it stands watching quiet and does not lift a hand. The airstrikes are targeting civilians.”“Today was a serious case because it included the hospitals and the ambulances,” he said. “This is aggression in the full sense of the word.”A doctor, who asked that his name not be used, said that nurses and doctors ran screaming as the blasts blew out hospital windows and shook the building.The first missile hit the building next door. The second struck an area used as a parking lot for the hospital’s ambulances, damaging a water line and creating a small pond, as well as destroying three ambulances and shattering the windows in others. A third missile hit a generator nearby that supplied the neighborhood; the hospital’s generator was not damaged.About an hour later, at the front line between the southern part of the neighborhood that is held by the American and Iraqi military and the northern section that is held by Shiite militias, the group of children was hit, according to a child and one adult who was injured there and brought to the Sadr hospital.Haider Abbas, 10, was brought to the hospital with what appeared to be a gaping hole in his back and shrapnel injuries across his stomach. The boy screamed and whimpered in pain, barely able to answer a doctor’s questions.“My friend brought me to the hospital, but we had to leave the other wounded kids behind,” he said. “The Iraqi Army refused to allow them to be evacuated, but my friend took me anyway.”The doctor, Abdul Rahman Hadi, said the boy was bleeding internally. “He needs surgery quickly,” Dr. Hadi said. “The irony is that not one of his relatives has come because he is an orphan.”Another victim of that attack, Ahmad Yahya, 31, whose leg was broken, said the Iraqi Army had blocked evacuation from the area of the attack. “I was with a group of about 15 children who were collecting the empty cans or the trash in Jamila,” he said. “I don’t know why this happened.”Also on Saturday, the Turkish military announced that it had killed 150 fighters in Kurdistan where fighters for the rebel Kurdish group, the P.K.K., and allied groups have remote redoubts. The P.K.K. is fighting to have greater self-rule for Kurds living in Eastern Turkey.But Bryar Gabary, a spokesman for one of the allied groups, disputed the Turkish military’s figures. “The Turkish incursions on Friday killed six of our fighters.”The military announced Saturday that an American soldier was killed Friday when his vehicle struck an improvised explosive device in eastern Baghdad.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','But is that true?The assertion looks more debatable in recent weeks, after the furor over Mr. Obama’s former pastor and his inflammatory views on America, the biggest of a series of “distractions” that have knocked the Obama campaign off stride. And if he wins the nomination, such issues will almost certainly rise again, given that he will run against a war hero, in Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is advised by several veterans of the campaign against Mr. Kerry.Mr. Obama himself seemed chastened by the re-emergence of the old politics last week. “Let’s be honest,” he said in an interview on NBC. “You know, here I am, an African-American named Barack Obama who’s running for president. I mean, that’s a leap for folks. And I think it’s understandable that my political opponents would say, ‘You know, he’s different. He’s odd. He’s sort of unfamiliar. And what do we know about him?’ ”There is a subtext for this history lesson: Mr. Obama’s rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, is running hard on the notion that she is the more electable candidate, that what she calls her “baggage” has been thoroughly vetted, and that she has survived 16 years of the harshest Republican attacks.But David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, argues that any Democratic nominee will be subject to the same withering attacks on values and character.“The question,” Mr. Axelrod said, “is whether given the abysmal state of our economy, given the war, given all the challenges that people sense we face that have led George Bush to have the lowest rating ever, do you believe that voters are going to be distracted from the fundamental need for change? I think the answer to that is no.”In fact, as Mr. Axelrod suggests, these are very different times.Twenty years ago, the nation was in an era of comparative peace and prosperity; a sense of crisis did not hang over the election. Today, with the war in Iraq in its sixth year and the economy stumbling, more than 8 in 10 Americans say the country is on the wrong track. A new generation of voters have entered the electorate, who may not be as susceptible to values issues.In such a climate, it would presumably be far more difficult than in 1988 to keep the campaign focused on symbolic, values-related issues, or matters of personality.There are differences, as well, in the political skills of the candidates then and today: Mr. Obama rose to national prominence largely on the basis of his oratorical skills, and has never been accused of lacking vision; Mr. Dukakis based his campaign on a prosaic promise of managerial competence and “good jobs at good wages.”And yet, some veterans of past Democratic campaigns say, there are similarities, as well.Even with so many big issues at stake this time around, the race between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton has often been focused on questions of values, background and character — witness the recent fixation on Mr. Obama’s ties to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., or the continued unfounded rumors that Mr. Obama is a Muslim.Like Mr. Dukakis in 1988, Mr. Obama is relatively new to the national scene, and thus vulnerable to being defined by Republican attacks. And like Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Obama lacks experience with the politics of wedge issues on a national stage.Attacks on a presidential candidate’s patriotism are hard for many politicians to take seriously. “Unless you’re talking about the Manchurian candidate, the idea that someone who put their heart and soul into running for president didn’t care deeply for their country is kind of ridiculous,” said Drew Westen, a psychologist and political consultant.Still, one of the clearest strategic errors of 1988 was the Democrats’ failure to realize that such attacks could stick and open the door to broader efforts to portray Mr. Dukakis as fundamentally out of sync with the nation’s values.“The attacks against Dukakis, which were systematic and attacked his patriotism, did a lot of damage to him,” said Tad Devine, a top advisor to the Dukakis campaign and the campaign of Mr. Kerry in 2004. “They developed words and phrases that essentially said this guy is not part of the mainstream.”If Mr. Obama is the nominee, Mr. Devine said, “I think it will happen again, and it will be aimed at both the candidate and his wife.”Michelle Obama has already drawn conservative fire for declaring that, because of her husband’s success and the voters’ hunger for change, “For the first time in my adult lifetime, I’m really proud of my country.” And Mr. Obama has been questioned about why he does not wear a flag pin every day.In 1988, one of the central attacks revolved around the Pledge of Allegiance. Mr. Dukakis, as governor, had vetoed state legislation in 1977 that required teachers to lead their students in the pledge. He did so on the basis of an advisory opinion from the state court, which said the legislation was unconstitutional.Mr. Dukakis, a Harvard lawyer surrounded by other Harvard lawyers, believed himself on very firm ground. But by August 1988, his Republican opponent, Vice President George H.W. Bush, was rousing huge crowds with a contemptuous question: “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?”Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bush said, was “out in deep left field on these issues.” He was also “a card-carrying member of the A.C.L.U.,” more concerned with giving furloughs to criminals — like Willie Horton — than upholding national values, the vice president asserted.“I simply can’t understand the kind of thinking that lets first-degree murderers out of jail on a furlough and won’t deal with the Pledge of Allegiance,” Mr. Bush said.Mr. Dukakis defended his patriotism and scoffed at Mr. Bush for wrapping himself in the flag, but, in essence, lost control of the campaign and his own image.After his loss, in 40 states, many Democratic leaders swore they would never be caught off guard that way again.Mr. Obama faces different issues, beginning with Mr. Wright, who suggested last week that the United States was attacked by terrorists because it had itself engaged in terrorism; Mr. Obama has now denounced his former pastor. He has been challenged, as well, about his relationship with a former radical from the 1960s; Mr. Obama says he simply served on the board of a foundation with the man.The questions may be taking a toll: The New York Times/CBS News Poll last week found 29 percent found him “very patriotic,” compared with 40 percent who felt that way about Mrs. Clinton, and 70 percent who felt that way about Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war.The lessons of history are fairly clear for Democrats, said Bruce Reed, president of the Democratic Leadership Council and a longtime Clinton ally. “Republicans have been trying to put us in the same box for 40 years now,” Mr. Reed said. “We win elections when we don’t let them.”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','The difficulty for Mr. McCain is that last month he called for cutting $95 billion worth of earmarks, and federal spending that began life as earmarks, to make up for the revenue that would be lost if he won passage of some of the large tax cuts he has proposed. So for every worthy earmark he agrees to save and pay for through the traditional budget route, Mr. McCain will have to find a spending cut elsewhere.“I’m sure that we can find the money to fund those programs,” he said aboard his bus. “It’s the process I object to.”But Democrats, who have questioned whether Mr. McCain could save enough by cutting earmarks to make up for some of the tax cuts he wants to make, said that it appeared less likely that Mr. McCain could do so now, when he is talking about saving some of those programs.“John McCain is playing a disturbing game of three-card monte with his own credibility and our country’s economic security,” said Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.By some measures, large spending programs that Mr. McCain supports, including aid to Israel and money for military housing, count as earmarks. When he was asked recently on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on ABC whether he favored cutting aid to Israel or money for military housing, Mr. McCain replied, “Of course not.”On his campaign bus, Mr. McCain said he was confident there was enough wasteful spending in Washington that he would be able to find cuts to offset the programs he would want to keep.He used a colorful analogy to make the point that while good things can come out of a bad process, they do not excuse it. “The Mafia does good,” he said. “There are some projects that the Mafia’s engaged in that do good. I will accept that. I will accept that sometimes a godfather helps the ailing child of a member of the Mafia.” But he added that the ends do not justify the means. “I can’t give you a justification for the Mafia,” he said. “I can’t give you a justification for the corruption that’s been bred, which has sent members of Congress to federal prison.”Earmarks have been central to Mr. McCain’s critique of Washington. On the trail he often boasts he has never taken pork-barrel spending for his home state of Arizona, and despite critics who say a couple of projects he sought could be called pork, he is nothing like lawmakers who routinely take millions, and even hundred of millions of dollars in pork barrel projects each year.Mr. McCain rails against earmarks in his stump speech, sometimes several times a day, and often argues that the Republicans lost control of Congress in 2006 because of runaway spending, and not because of opposition to the war in Iraq.Bruce M. Riedl, a budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation who has studied Congressional pork barrel spending, said it would take much more than cutting earmarks to balance the budget.“Congress can’t balance the budget by cutting earmarks alone,” Mr. Riedl said. “As a matter of fact, any significant spending cuts will probably have to come out of entitlements, and, in particular, in Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare reform.” But he added that it would still be good to end earmark abuses so that lawmakers could regain the trust of the people and tackle more difficult problems.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Senator John McCain is 71 years old, a survivor of an aggressive form of skin cancer. If elected, he would be the oldest man to become president.These factors are not disqualifying, but they impose on Mr. McCain a larger duty than usual to provide detailed, timely disclosure about his health. So far, he has failed to meet this obligation to voters, even though he is now the presumed Republican nominee.And it is not just on health issues that there is a lack of transparency in this campaign. Neither Mr. McCain nor Senator Hillary Clinton has been forthcoming enough about financial records.No presidential candidate should get to the point that he has locked up his party’s nomination without public vetting of his health. And Mr. McCain, in particular, knows that. Early in his first run for president, in 1999, he provided an in-depth look at his medical history: 1,500 pages of medical and psychiatric records collected by a Navy project on the health of former prisoners of war. He has released precious little medical information since his surgery for melanoma in August 2000.In March, this newspaper’s medical reporter, Dr. Lawrence Altman, wrote about interviews with several experts not connected to Mr. McCain’s case concerning the probability of melanoma recurring. Most were positive about his prospects, but they lacked the benefit of Mr. McCain’s actual records and his physicians’ explanation of the extensive nature of his surgery. Voters are entitled to know about other potential health concerns for an average 71-year-old man.'"

"'08-05-04,'0','While a number of other states have set voluntary goals for curbing greenhouse gas emissions, or set caps for a specific sector like power plants or motor vehicles, only three states, New Jersey, California and Hawaii, have taken on legislation that goes further. The Connecticut bill, similar to those in the other three states, could affect every source of greenhouse gas emission — including the public sector, industry, transportation and private homes.The bill would require that total greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80 percent below 2001 levels by 2050.In New York, a similar bill passed the Assembly on April 15, though its fate in the Senate is uncertain and Governor David A. Paterson has taken no position on it. The New York legislation would require yearly greenhouse gas reductions of 2.3 percent of 1990 levels beginning in 2014 and reaching at least 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.Like the bills in Connecticut, New Jersey, and California — California’s legislation is considered the granddaddy of so-called carbon cap bills — the specifics in the New York bill of how to reach cap levels are left for state agencies to determine.“It allows different sectors to handle this in whatever way is appropriate for them,” said Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney, a Democrat from Lindenhurst, N.Y., and chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee. “The ideal thing would be for the federal government to do this on a nationwide basis. That hasn’t happened. I don’t think we have the luxury of waiting to see whether they will do it.”New Jersey, nearly a year into its process of putting the Global Warming Response Act into effect, has nearly completed an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions — a necessary first step for figuring out where to cut them. The state has released a draft energy master plan that dovetails with the emissions cap and is on target to meet its first cap level in 2020.“One of the things the governor expected and has totally played out is that in showing leadership on this issue, we would raise the volume on the level of dialogue and actions in the state,” said Lisa P. Jackson, commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection. “Individual companies are taking climate change action on their own — in anticipation of what we are doing.”In Connecticut supporters of carbon caps note that even a small state can pressure other states like Massachusetts and Vermont, which are considering similar legislation — and the states together can push the federal government into a national cap on emissions.“I just think it’s too important of an issue for us to say we’ll leave it up to the federal government or leave it up to the bigger states,” said state Senator John McKinney of Southport, the Senate minority leader as well as the ranking Republican on the General Assembly Environment Committee.Mr. Rothenberger said current state law, passed in 2004, set only “aspirational,” or voluntary, goals for reducing greenhouse gases. Those goals, he said, were not being met.“This is really designed to put the foot on the accelerator,” he said. “Right now the agencies can act or not as is their inclination, and there’s really not much groups outside the agencies can say about it.”Gina McCarthy, commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, helped fine-tune the legislation into something that the administration of Governor Rell could support: firm goals with a flexible means to achieve them. The legislation was also designed to be in keeping with the governor’s stated desire to use such energy policies as economic development opportunities.“I don’t think the be-all and end-all is mandatory climate caps; Connecticut has had that commitment regardless of whether it’s mandatory,” Ms. McCarthy said. “It’s not a magic pill. It still means you need to make investments and you need to make changes.”Opponents in Connecticut, generally business groups and power companies, said they preferred to wait for the next presidential administration, which is believed more likely than the current one to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions. They also argued it would be better to see the effects of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (known by its acronym, RGGI, pronounced “reggie”) which later this year initiates a multistate cap and trade system for power plants in the Northeast.Eric Brown, associate counsel for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, echoed the concern of several energy companies that a cap would push energy prices higher. “The high cost of energy in this state is a major factor in driving business out of Connecticut and discouraging new business from coming into Connecticut,” Mr. Brown said. “This bill will do nothing more than exacerbate that trend.”Robert Repetto, a professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, said that attaching a cost to the emission of greenhouse gases is the key to effective legislation and a way to make the necessary political impact.“RGGI and the California cap have been quite important primarily because they have been partially responsible for bringing about a change in the political stance of big business in this country,” he said, adding that businesses are facing the reality that states are taking action even if the federal government is not.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Last summer in a quiet suburb of Vail, Colo., Kent Logan showed off his private gallery to a group of visitors. Around the building were paintings by Andy Warhol and sculpture by Jeff Koons, along with flat files filled with hundreds of precious drawings and works on paper. Mr. Logan said he owned about 1,000 works of art and then politely announced that he had promised much of it to museums.Now Mr. Logan is sending his art on the road, with exhibitions like “Out of Shape: Stylistic Distortions of the Human Form in Art From the Logan Collection” at the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center. It comes on the heels of an exhibition of works from his collection at the Denver Art Museum, a beneficiary of his largess, along with the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.“Out of Shape” concentrates on works on paper, which amount to about 20 percent of the collection. Mary-Kay Lombino, the museum’s curator, made the selection in consultation with Mr. Logan, assembling works by 27 artists that focus on the distorted human figure. The 34 pieces in the exhibition have not been displayed publicly since entering the collection.The exhibition is divided up according to themes, including full-length portraiture, fragmentation, exaggeration of the figure and the body in motion. Because the bulk of the collection was assembled in the 1990s, it reflects not only that era’s fashionable artists but also the art world’s concerns with subjectivity, gender and sexuality. In this way the show is something of a time capsule.And yet these themes have a more contemporary resonance, for today the body we are born with is not necessarily “a fixed entity,” as Ms. Lombino puts it in the exhibition catalog. In a society in which appearances matter, elective surgical enhancements have become widespread. Some of the works here reflect this new volatility in the human form. John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage distort the female figure by depicting exaggerated body parts. Ms. Yuskavage’s drawing in particular shows a woman in an open, beaded jacket with outsized and radically misshapen breasts. She looks deformed, suggesting perhaps the risks associated with cosmetic surgery.Elements of the comic and the grotesque also combine in Nicola Tyson’s wildly imaginative charcoal and pastel drawings, which suggest affinities with Surrealism. “Untitled #67” (1997) depicts a disproportioned woman in the shape of a garlic bulb. It is laughable and ridiculous. Still, I love it.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','All the paintings in the exhibition depict figures, beginning with a self-portrait on newspaper painted in Paris in 1951. It shows a handsome young man in a green shirt, arms folded and staring intently at the viewer. It is not a great work (the hands, especially, are poorly rendered), but it shows clear promise.From here the show jumps forward almost two decades, to the late 1960s. The explanation for the break, according to Ms. Albert, is that Mr. Brodsky did not paint much in the late 1950s, preoccupied as he was with further university studies. In any case, the figurative paintings from the late 1960s and the 1970s are lovely and worth lingering over.Among them are “Tillie and Eddie” (1972) and “Ellen and Adam” (1968), a pair of compressed, stylized compositions whose blocky forms and keyed-up colors can sometimes make them seem jigsawlike. They are also reminiscent of Milton Avery, though with more bracing, vivid brushwork. Still, they are beautiful.Like most of the paintings here, “Ellen and Adam” is a portrait of the artist’s family — in this case the artist’s first wife and his son, who later received a diagnosis of a mental illness. Adam’s illness is the subject of several series of works, gut-churning, layered paintings and mixed-media compositions that are not for the fainthearted. They are portraits of emotional trauma.Because these paintings and collages incorporate childhood drawings by Adam, along with family photographs and copies of his son’s medical records, they must have been painful for the artist to make. They reflect a desire to help his son, but also powerlessness in the face of illness.Adam was helped by medical treatment, which is reflected in a later series of works on the same theme. Pictures like “Together” (2004) are even jubilant, the artist showing himself and his son happily talking. The choices of color and brushwork here are more in tune with Mr. Brodsky’s landscape paintings.Other autobiographical paintings show Mr. Brodsky’s parents and a family Passover celebration. Perhaps the most striking and powerful of these is “Vigil for Grandpa Jack” (1986), an expressionistic piece in which the figure of the artist’s dying father seems to dissolve into the canvas.With no need for explanation, this painting instantly affects the viewer. It is stylistically looser, and the colors are a bit brighter, despite the subject matter. It also shows us the artist at his most honest and emotionally vulnerable, which is to say at his most compelling.“Vigil for Grandpa Jack,” which is on loan from the Neuberger Museum of Art at SUNY Purchase, is an astonishing, original and assertive picture, and probably the best work here. It was turned into a lithograph, “Vigil” (1989), an example of which hangs alongside the painting in the middle of the exhibition. In choosing this theme Mr. Brodsky makes you understand that great art transcends medium or style; it touches the soul.'"

She is literally allergic to everything, and I’m always the one taking her to the vet or shoving the pill down her throat.Obsolete item he won’t part with: I hang onto any cool T-shirt, even if it doesn’t fit anymore. My son, when he was 1 1/2, made this drawing, and it looked like me, and I made a T-shirt of it. I keep it no matter how threadbare it has become.Travel ritual: I always want to bring the same bag. I am very superstitious about my carry-on bag. It’s this ratty, smelly backpack I have had for 15 years.How he writes: On my laptop. I can’t do it any other way. I have to be able to type, pull up music and get references from the Internet. What made me brave about writing was the idea that with the computer I could cut and paste and think of writing as sculpture.Procrastination technique: I heard David Sedaris say he couldn’t write in the afternoons because he would spend hours looking in the mirror trying to find where his hair parts. Me? I troll I-Tunes. That’s a time sink.Favorite TV show: A dead-heat tie between “The Wire” and “Battlestar Galactica.” There will never be a smarter show than “The Wire.” “Battlestar Galactica” doesn’t pull any punches. It’s great in its character development and storytelling.Collection: Scripts. Because I felt I was a late bloomer and student of screenwriting, I felt I couldn’t learn enough, fast enough. I buy scripts, and I always want to find the versions that were green-lighted. I’m always fascinated about what got someone’s attention.Next big purchase: A new home theater. It will be a room where I can ensconce myself and watch movies big and loud.Favorite vacation: We’re from a little seacoast town called Rockport, Mass. It’s idyllic. I try to go back every summer for the Fourth of July and still drag my kids if they’re willing.Keepsake: We’ve got a framed nautical map of Rockport harbor. It probably cost more to frame than to buy, but it is our favorite work of art on the wall.Objects of his desire: I’m a closet guitar player. I have a Martin acoustic and a distressed replica of Joe Strummer’s Fender electric.As a child he wanted to be: A comic-book artist, then an actor, then an animator.Commitment: My wife, Julie, and I are childhood sweethearts. We’ve been together 27 years, since I was 15 and she was 13. We’ve been married 18 years.Field day: My six-by-six-inch piece of sod from the 2004 World Series. I was born and raised in Massachusetts, and I’m a rabid Sox fan. My father found out they were selling sod from Fenway Park following the series win. My father bought one, and I planted it in my front lawn. It’s doing well.Hobby: Playing Guitar Hero with my 16-year-old son. We have a sweet setup, and if he’s ever in not too sullen of a mood, I convince him to play with me. It has become a father-son thing.Obsession: Well, my wife would say I am a jacket hoarder. I’m like women are supposed to be about shoes. I can’t have enough choices for outer coats.Best recent gift: My producer got me a clownfish guitar. It looks like a kid could play it, and it is self-amplified. It works.Evening routine: I usually get home just in time for dinner with family. Then we try to finish up so we can watch “Jeopardy.” Then we’ll read or watch TV. We’re in bed by 10.By his bed: A stack of 6 to 12 books. My eyes are much bigger than my reader’s stomach. I can read 3 to 5 at the same time.Concession to age: At 42 I always make sure I have Advil with me. As I get older, one glass of wine gives me a hangover.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','THE STUBBORN CORE of violence in American cities is troubling and perplexing. Even as homicide rates have declined across the country — in some places, like New York, by a remarkable amount — gunplay continues to plague economically struggling minority communities. For 25 years, murder has been the leading cause of death among African-American men between the ages of 15 and 34, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has analyzed data up to 2005. And the past few years have seen an uptick in homicides in many cities. Since 2004, for instance, they are up 19 percent in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, 29 percent in Houston and 54 percent in Oakland. Just two weekends ago in Chicago, with the first warm weather, 36 people were shot, 7 of them fatally. The Chicago Sun-Times called it the “weekend of rage.” Many killings are attributed to gang conflicts and are confined to particular neighborhoods. In Chicago, where on average five people were shot each day last year, 83 percent of the assaults were concentrated in half the police districts. So for people living outside those neighborhoods, the frequent outbursts of unrestrained anger have been easy to ignore. But each shooting, each murder, leaves a devastating legacy, and a growing school of thought suggests that there’s little we can do about the entrenched urban poverty if the relentless pattern of street violence isn’t somehow broken.The traditional response has been more focused policing and longer prison sentences, but law enforcement does little to disrupt a street code that allows, if not encourages, the settling of squabbles with deadly force. Zale Hoddenbach, who works for an organization called CeaseFire, is part of an unusual effort to apply the principles of public health to the brutality of the streets. CeaseFire tries to deal with these quarrels on the front end. Hoddenbach’s job is to suss out smoldering disputes and to intervene before matters get out of hand. His job title is violence interrupter, a term that while not artful seems bluntly self-explanatory. Newspaper accounts usually refer to the organization as a gang-intervention program, and Hoddenbach and most of his colleagues are indeed former gang leaders. But CeaseFire doesn’t necessarily aim to get people out of gangs — nor interrupt the drug trade. It’s almost blindly focused on one thing: preventing shootings.CeaseFire’s founder, Gary Slutkin, is an epidemiologist and a physician who for 10 years battled infectious diseases in Africa. He says that violence directly mimics infections like tuberculosis and AIDS, and so, he suggests, the treatment ought to mimic the regimen applied to these diseases: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. “For violence, we’re trying to interrupt the next event, the next transmission, the next violent activity,” Slutkin told me recently. “And the violent activity predicts the next violent activity like H.I.V. predicts the next H.I.V. and TB predicts the next TB.” Slutkin wants to shift how we think about violence from a moral issue (good and bad people) to a public health one (healthful and unhealthful behavior).EVERY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, in a Spartan room on the 10th floor of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s public-health building, 15 to 25 men — and two women — all violence interrupters, sit around tables arranged in a circle and ruminate on the rage percolating in the city. Most are in their 40s and 50s, though some, like Hoddenbach, are a bit younger. All of them are black or Hispanic and in one manner or another have themselves been privy to, if not participants in, the brutality of the streets.On a Wednesday near the end of March, Slutkin made a rare appearance; he ordinarily leaves the day-to-day operations to a staff member. Fit at 57, Slutkin has a somewhat disheveled appearance — tie askew, hair uncombed, seemingly forgetful. Some see his presentation as a calculated effort to disarm. “Slutkin does his thing in his Slutkinesque way,” notes Carl Bell, a psychiatrist who has long worked with children exposed to neighborhood violence and who admires CeaseFire’s work. “He seems kind of disorganized, but he’s not.” Hoddenbach told me: “You can’t make too much of that guy. In the beginning, he gives you that look like he doesn’t know what you’re talking about.”Slutkin had come to talk with the group about a recent high-profile incident outside Crane Tech High School on the city’s West Side. An 18-year-old boy was shot and died on the school’s steps, while nearby another boy was savagely beaten with a golf club. Since the beginning of the school year, 18 Chicago public-school students had been killed. (Another six would be murdered in the coming weeks.) The interrupters told Slutkin that there was a large police presence at the school, at least temporarily muffling any hostilities there, and that the police were even escorting some kids to and from school. They then told him what was happening off the radar in their neighborhoods. There was the continuing discord at another high school involving a group of girls (“They’d argue with a stop sign,” one of the interrupters noted); a 14-year-old boy with a gang tattoo on his forehead was shot by an older gang member just out of prison; a 15-year-old was shot in the stomach by a rival gang member as he came out of his house; and a former CeaseFire colleague was struggling to keep himself from losing control after his own sons were beaten. There was also a high-school basketball player shot four times; a 12-year-old boy shot at a party; gang members arming themselves to counter an egging of their freshly painted cars; and a high-ranking gang member who was on life support after being shot, and whose sister was overheard talking on her cellphone in the hospital, urging someone to “get those straps together. Get loaded.”These incidents all occurred over the previous seven days. In each of them, the interrupters had stepped in to try to keep one act of enmity from spiraling into another. Some had more success than others. Janell Sails prodded the guys with the egged cars to go to a car wash and then persuaded them it wasn’t worth risking their lives over a stupid prank. At Crane Tech High School, three of the interrupters fanned out, trying to convince the five gangs involved in the conflict to lie low, but they conceded that they were unable reach some of the main players. Many of the interrupters seem bewildered by what they see as a wilder group of youngsters now running the streets and by a gang structure that is no longer top-down but is instead made up of many small groups — which they refer to as cliques — whose members are answerable to a handful of peers.For an hour, Slutkin leaned on the table, playing with a piece of Scotch tape, keenly listening. In some situations, Slutkin can appear detached and didactic. He can wear people down with his long discourses, and some of the interrupters say they sometimes tune him out. (On one occasion, he tried to explain to me the relationship between emotional intelligence and quantum physics.) But having seen a lot of out-of-control behavior, Slutkin is a big believer in controlling emotions. So he has taught himself not to break into discussions and to digest before presenting his view. The interrupters say he has their unqualified loyalty. Hoddenbach told me that he now considers Slutkin a friend.It became clear as they delivered their reports that many of the interrupters were worn down. One of them, Calvin Buchanan, whose street name is Monster and who just recently joined CeaseFire, showed the others six stitches over his left eye; someone had cracked a beer bottle on his head while he was mediating an argument between two men. The other interrupters applauded when Buchanan told them that, though tempted, he restrained himself from getting even.When Slutkin finally spoke, he first praised the interrupters for their work. “Everybody’s overreacting, and you’re trying to cool them down,” he told them. He then asked if any of them had been experiencing jitteriness or fear. He spent the next half-hour teaching stress-reduction exercises. If they could calm themselves, he seemed to be saying, they could also calm others. I recalled what one of the interrupters told me a few weeks earlier: “We helped create the madness, and now we’re trying to debug it.”IN THE PUBLIC-HEALTH field, there have long been two schools of thought on derailing violence. One focuses on environmental factors, specifically trying to limit gun purchases and making guns safer. The other tries to influence behavior by introducing school-based curricula like antidrug and safe-sex campaigns.Slutkin is going after it in a third way — as if he were trying to contain an infectious disease. The fact that there’s no vaccine or medical cure for violence doesn’t dissuade him. He points out that in the early days of AIDS, there was no treatment either. In the short run, he’s just trying to halt the spread of violence. In the long run, though, he says he hopes to alter behavior and what’s considered socially acceptable.Slutkin’s perspective grew out of his own experience as an infectious-disease doctor. In 1981, six years out of the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, Slutkin was asked to lead the TB program in San Francisco. With an influx of new refugees from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, the number of cases in the city had nearly doubled. Slutkin chose to concentrate on those who had the most active TB; on average, they were infecting 6 to 10 others a year. Slutkin hired Southeast Asian outreach workers who could not only locate the infected individuals but who could also stick with them for nine months, making sure they took the necessary medication. These outreach workers knew the communities and spoke the languages, and they were able to persuade family members of infected people to be tested. Slutkin also went after the toughest cases — 26 people with drug-resistant TB. The chance of curing those people was slim, but Slutkin reckoned that if they went untreated, the disease would continue to spread. “Gary wasn’t constrained by the textbook,” says Eric Goosby, who worked in the clinic and is now the chief executive of the Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation. Within two years, the number of TB cases, at least among these new immigrants, declined sharply.Slutkin then spent 10 years in Africa, first in refugee camps in Somalia and then working, in Uganda and other countries, for the World Health Organization to curtail the spread of AIDS. During his first posting, in Somalia, a cholera epidemic spread from camp to camp. Slutkin had never dealt with an outbreak of this sort, and he was overwhelmed. The diarrhea from cholera is so severe that patients can die within hours from dehydration. According to Sandy Gove, who was then married to Slutkin and was also a doctor in the camps, infection rates were approaching 10 percent; in one camp there were 1,000 severely ill refugees. “It was desperate,” she told me. Slutkin drove a Land Cruiser two and a half days to an American military base along the coast to the closest phone. He called doctors in Europe and the United States, trying to get information. He also asked the soldiers at the base for blue food coloring, which he then poured into the water sources of the bacteria, a warning to refugees not to drink. “What Gary is really good about is laying out a broad strategic plan and keeping ahead of something,” Gove told me. There were only six doctors for the 40 refugee camps, so Slutkin and Gove trained birth attendants to spot infected people and to give them rehydration therapies in their homes. Because the birth attendants were refugees, they were trusted and could persuade those with the most severe symptoms to receive aid at the medical tent.After leaving Africa, Slutkin returned to Chicago, where he was raised and where he could attend to his aging parents. (He later remarried there.) It was 1995, and there had been a series of horrific murders involving children in the city. He was convinced that longer sentences and more police officers had made little difference. “Punishment doesn’t drive behavior,” he told me. “Copying and modeling and the social expectations of your peers is what drives your behavior.”Borrowing some ideas (and the name) from a successful Boston program, Slutkin initially established an approach that exists in one form or another in many cities: outreach workers tried to get youth and young adults into school or to help them find jobs. These outreach workers were also doing dispute mediation. But Slutkin was feeling his way, much as he had in Somalia during the cholera epidemic. One of Slutkin’s colleagues, Tio Hardiman, brought up an uncomfortable truth: the program wasn’t reaching the most bellicose, those most likely to pull a trigger. So in 2004, Hardiman suggested that, in addition to outreach workers, they also hire men and women who had been deep into street life, and he began recruiting people even while they were still in prison. Hardiman told me he was looking for those “right there on the edge.” (The interrupters are paid roughly $15 an hour, and those working full time receive benefits from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where CeaseFire is housed.) The new recruits, with strong connections to the toughest communities, would focus solely on sniffing out clashes that had the potential to escalate. They would intervene in potential acts of retribution — as well as try to defuse seemingly minor spats that might erupt into something bigger, like disputes over women or insulting remarks.As CeaseFire evolved, Slutkin says he started to realize how much it was drawing on his experiences fighting TB and AIDS. “Early intervention in TB is actually treatment of the most infectious people,” Slutkin told me recently. “They’re the ones who are infecting others. So treatment of the most infectious spreaders is the most effective strategy known and now accepted in the world.” And, he continued, you want to go after them with individuals who themselves were once either infectious spreaders or at high risk for the illness. In the case of violence, you use those who were once hard-core, once the most belligerent, once the most uncontrollable, once the angriest. They are the most convincing messengers. It’s why, for instance, Slutkin and his colleagues asked sex workers in Uganda and other nations to spread the word to other sex workers about safer sexual behavior. Then, Slutkin said, you train them, as you would paraprofessionals, as he and Gove did when they trained birth attendants to spot cholera in Somalia.The first step to containing the spread of an infectious disease is minimizing transmission. The parallel in Slutkin’s Chicago work is thwarting retaliations, which is precisely what Hoddenbach was trying to do in the aftermath of Emilio Torres’s murder. But Slutkin is also looking for the equivalent of a cure. The way public-health doctors think of curing disease when there are no drug treatments is by changing behavior. Smoking is the most obvious example. Cigarettes are still around. And there’s no easy remedy for lung cancer or emphysema. So the best way to deal with the diseases associated with smoking is to get people to stop smoking. In Uganda, Slutkin and his colleagues tried to change behavior by encouraging people to have fewer sexual partners and to use condoms. CeaseFire has a visible public-communications campaign, which includes billboards and bumper stickers (which read, “Stop. Killing. People.”). It also holds rallies — or what it calls “responses” — at the sites of killings. But much research suggests that peer or social pressure is the most effective way to change behavior. “It was a real turning point for me,” Slutkin said, “when I was working on the AIDS epidemic and saw research findings that showed that the principal determinant of whether someone uses a condom or not is whether they think their friends use them.” Daniel Webster, a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University who has looked closely at CeaseFire, told me, “The guys out there doing the interruption have some prestige and reputation, and I think the hope is that they start to change a culture so that you can retain your status, retain your manliness and be able to walk away from events where all expectations were that you were supposed to respond with lethal force.”As a result, the interrupters operate in a netherworld between upholding the law and upholding the logic of the streets. They’re not meant to be a substitute for the police, and indeed, sometimes the interrupters negotiate disputes involving illicit goings-on. They often walk a fine line between mediating and seeming to condone criminal activity. At one Wednesday meeting this past December, the interrupters argued over whether they could dissuade stickup artists from shooting their victims; persuading them to stop robbing people didn’t come up in the discussion.LAST DECEMBER, at the first Wednesday meeting I attended, James Highsmith came up to introduce himself. At 58, Highsmith is one of the older interrupters. He wears striped, collared shirts, black rectangular glasses and often a black Borsalino, an Italian-made fedora. He reminded me that I had mentioned him in my book, “There Are No Children Here,” about life in a Chicago public-housing project in the late 1980s. I wrote about a picnic that some Chicago drug kingpins gave in a South Side park. There was a car show, a wet T-shirt contest and softball games for the children. About 2,000 people attended, dancing to a live band while the drug lords showed off their Mercedes Benzes, Rolls-Royces and Jaguars. Highsmith was the key sponsor of the event. He controlled the drug trade on the city’s South Side. He owned a towing business, an auto-mechanic’s shop and a nightclub, as well as a 38-foot boat. In January 1994, he was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison on drug-conspiracy charges; he was released in 2004. Highsmith was just the kind of recruit CeaseFire looks for: an older man getting out of the penitentiary who once had standing on the streets and who, through word of mouth, appears ready, eager even, to discard his former persona. “I’m a work in progress,” Highsmith told me.One evening we were sitting in Highsmith’s basement apartment when the phone rang. It was Alphonso Prater, another interrupter. The two had a reunion of sorts when they joined CeaseFire; they shared a cell in the county jail 34 years ago. Prater’s voice is so raspy it sounds as if he has gravel in his throat. He told me that he became permanently hoarse after a long stint in segregation in prison; he had to shout to talk with others. When Prater called the night I was there, all Highsmith could make out was: “There’s some high-tech stuff going on. I need you to talk to some folks.” Highsmith didn’t ask any questions.We drove to a poorly lighted side street on the city’s West Side. Empty beer bottles littered the side of the road. Prater, who is short and wiry and has trouble keeping still, was bouncing on the sidewalk, standing next to a lanky middle-aged man who had receded into his oversize hooded sweatshirt. Highsmith, Prater and another interrupter joined the man in a parked car, where they talked for half an hour. When they were done, the car peeled away, two other sedans escorting it, one in front, the other in the rear. “Protection,” Highsmith commented. Apparently, the man in the hooded sweatshirt, whom I would meet later, had been an intermediary in a drug deal. He had taken an out-of-town buyer holding $30,000 in cash to a house on the South Side to buy drugs. But when they got there, they were met by six men in the backyard, each armed with a pistol or an automatic weapon, and robbed. The out-of-town buyer believed he’d been set up by the intermediary, who, in turn, was trying to hunt down the stickup artists. In the car, Prater, who knew the intermediary, had worked to cool him down, while Highsmith promised to see if he could find someone who might know the stickup guys and could negotiate with them. The intermediary told Prater and Highsmith, a bit ominously, “Something got to give.”After the intermediary drove off, Prater joked that there was no way he was getting back in a car with him, that he was too overheated and too likely to be the target or the shooter. “I’m not sure we can do anything about this one,” Highsmith told Prater.RELYING ON HARDENED TYPES — the ones who, as Webster of Johns Hopkins says, have some prestige on the streets — is risky. They have prestige for a reason. Hoddenbach, who once beat someone so badly he punctured his lungs, is reluctant to talk about his past. “I don’t want to be seen as a monster,” he told me. Hoddenbach’s ethnicity is hard to pinpoint. His father was Dutch and his mother Puerto Rican, and he’s so light-skinned his street name was Casper. He has a discerning gaze and mischievous smile, and can be hardheaded and impatient. (At the Wednesday meetings, he often sits near the door and whispers entreaties to the others to speed things up.) Hoddenbach’s father had an explosive temper, and to steal from Slutkin’s lingo, he seems to have infected others. Two of Hoddenbach’s older brothers are serving time for murder. His third brother has carved out a legitimate life as a manager at a manufacturing firm. Hoddenbach always worked. He did maintenance on train equipment and towed airplanes at a private airport. But he was also active in a Hispanic street gang and was known for his unmitigated aggression. He served a total of eight years in the state penitentiary, the last stay for charges that included aggravated battery. He was released in 2002.In January, I was with Slutkin in Baltimore, where he spoke about CeaseFire to a small gathering of local civic leaders at a private home. During the two-hour meeting, Slutkin never mentioned that the interrupters were ex-felons. When I later asked him about that omission, he conceded that talking about their personal histories “is a dilemma. I haven’t solved it.” I spent many hours with Hoddenbach and the others, trying to understand how they chose to make the transition from gangster to peacemaker, how they put thuggery behind them. It is, of course, their street savvy and reputations that make them effective for CeaseFire. (One supporter of the program admiringly called it “a terrifying strategy” because of the inherent risks.) Some CeaseFire workers have, indeed, reverted to their old ways. One outreach worker was fired after he was arrested for possession of an AK-47 and a handgun. Another outreach worker and an interrupter were let go after they were arrested for dealing drugs. Word-of-mouth allegations often circulate, and privately, some in the police department worry about CeaseFire’s workers returning to their old habits.Not all the interrupters I talked to could articulate how they had made the transition. Some, like Hoddenbach, find religion — in his case, Christianity. He also has four children he feels responsible for, and has found ways to decompress, like going for long runs. (His brother Mark speculated that “maybe he just wants to give back what he took out.”) I once asked Hoddenbach if he has ever apologized to anyone he hurt. We were with one of his old friends from the street, who started guffawing, as if I had asked Hoddenbach if he ever wore dresses. “I done it twice,” Hoddenbach told us — quickly silencing his friend and saving me from further embarrassment. (One apology was to the brother of the man whose lungs he’d punctured; the other was to a rival gang member he shot.) Alphonso Prater told me that the last time he was released from prison, in 2001, an older woman hired him to gut some homes she was renovating. She trusted him with the keys to the homes, and something about that small gesture lifted him. “She seen something in me that I didn’t see,” he told me.Though the interrupters may not put it this way, the Wednesday meetings are a kind of therapy. One staff member laughingly compared it to a 12-step program. It was clear to me that they leaned on one another — a lot. Prater once got an urgent call from his daughter, who said her boyfriend was beating her. Prater got in his car and began to race to her house; as he was about to run a stop sign, he glimpsed a police car on the corner. He skidded to a halt. It gave him a moment to think, and he called his CeaseFire supervisor, Tio Hardiman, who got another interrupter to visit Prater’s daughter. Not long ago, three old-timers fresh out of prison ruthlessly ridiculed Hoddenbach for his work with CeaseFire. They were relentless, and Hoddenbach asked to sit down with them. But when it came time to meet, he realized he was too riled, and so he asked another interrupter, Tim White, to go in his place. “I was worried I was going to whip their asses, and wherever it went from there it went,” Hoddenbach told me. “They were old feelings, feelings I don’t want to revisit.”Recently I went out to lunch with Hoddenbach and Torres. It had been four months since Torres buried his nephew. Torres, who looked worn and agitated (he would get up periodically to smoke a cigarette outside), seemed paradoxically both grateful to and annoyed at Hoddenbach. In the end, Hoddenbach had persuaded him not to avenge his nephew’s murder. Torres had returned the guns and quickly left town. This was his first visit back to Chicago. “I felt like a punk,” he told me, before transferring to the present tense. “I feel shameful.” He said he had sought revenge for people who weren’t related to him — “people who weren’t even no blood to me.” But he held back in the case of his nephew. “I still struggle with it,” he said. On the ride over to the restaurant, Torres had been playing a CD of his nephew’s favorite rap songs. It got him hyped up, and he blurted out to Hoddenbach, “I feel like doing something.” Hoddenbach chided him and shut off the music. “Stop being an idiot,” he told Torres.“Something made me do what Zale asked me to do,” Torres said later, looking more puzzled than comforted. “Which is respect my brother’s wishes.”When Slutkin heard of Hoddenbach’s intervention, he told me: “The interrupters have to deal with how to get someone to save face. In other words, how do you not do a shooting if someone has insulted you, if all of your friends are expecting you to do that? . . . In fact, what our interrupters do is put social pressure in the other direction.”He continued: “This is cognitive dissonance. Before Zale walked up to him, this guy was holding only one thought. So you want to put another thought in his head. It turns out talking about family is what really makes a difference.” Slutkin didn’t take this notion to the interrupters; he learned it from them.ONE JANUARY NIGHT at 11 p.m., Charles Mack received a phone call that a shooting victim was being rushed to Advocate Christ Medical Center. Mack drove the 10 miles from his home to the hospital, which houses one of four trauma centers in Chicago. Two interrupters, Mack and LeVon Stone, are assigned there. They respond to every shooting and stabbing victim taken to the hospital. Mack, who is 57 and has a slight lisp, is less imposing than his colleagues. He seems always to be coming from or going to church, often dressed in tie and cardigan. He sheepishly told me that his prison term, two years, was for bank fraud. “The other guys laugh at me,” he said. LeVon Stone is 23 years younger and a fast talker. He’s in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the waist down as a result of being shot when he was 18.Advocate Christ has come to see the presence of interrupters in the trauma unit as essential and is, in fact, looking to expand their numbers. “It has just given me so much hope,” Cathy Arsenault, one of the chaplains there, told me. “The families would come in, huddle in the corner and I could see them assigning people to take care of business.” Mack and Stone try to cool off family members and friends, and if the victim survives, try to keep them from seeking vengeance.The victim that night was a tall 16-year-old boy named Frederick. He was lying on a gurney just off the emergency room’s main hallway. He was connected to two IVs, and blood was seeping through the gauze wrapped around his left hand. Mack stood to one side; Stone pulled up on the other.“You know, the most important thing is —” Mack ventured.Stone then asked Frederick if he had heard of CeaseFire. The boy nodded and told them that he had even participated in a CeaseFire rally after a killing in his neighborhood.“We try to stop violence on the front end,” Stone told Frederick. “Unfortunately, this is the back end. We just want to make sure you don’t go out and try to retaliate.”The boy had been shot — one bullet shattered his thigh bone and another ripped the tendons in two fingers. Nonetheless, he seemed lucid and chatty.“My intention is to get in the house, call my school, get my books and finish my work,” he told Mack and Stone. He mentioned the school he attends, which Mack instantly recognized as a place for kids on juvenile-court probation. Frederick told his story. He was at a party, and a rival clique arrived. Frederick and his friends sensed there would be trouble, so they left, and while standing outside, one of the rival group pulled a gun on them. Frederick’s friend told him earlier he had a gun. It turned out to be braggadocio, and so when his friend took off running, so did Frederick, a step behind. As he dashed through a narrow passageway between buildings, he heard the shots.“Can I ask why you’re in the wheelchair?” Frederick asked Stone.“I got shot 15 years ago,” Stone told him. Stone didn’t say anything more about it, and later when I asked for more detail, he was elusive. He said simply that he had gotten shot at a barbecue when he tried to intervene in a fistfight.“You doing good,” Stone assured him. “You got shot. You’re here. And you’re alive. What you do when you get out of here?”“You got to stop hanging with the wrong person, thinking you’re a Wyatt Earp,” Frederick said, speaking in the third person as if he were reciting a lesson.At that point, Frederick’s sister arrived. She explained that she was bringing up her brother. She was 18.“He just wants to go to parties, parties, parties,” she complained. “But it’s too dangerous.” She started to cry.Mack left a CeaseFire brochure on Frederick’s chest and promised to visit him again in the coming weeks.LAST MAY, after a 16-year-old boy was killed trying to protect a girl from a gunman on a city bus, Slutkin appeared on a local public-television news program. He suggested CeaseFire was responsible for sharp dips in homicide around the city. Slutkin, some say, gives CeaseFire too much credit. Carl Bell, the psychiatrist, was on the program with Slutkin that night. “I didn’t say anything,” he told me. “I support Slutkin. I’m like, Slutkin, what are you doing? You can’t do that. Maybe politically it’s a good thing, but scientifically it’s so much more complex than that. Come on, Gary.”Last year, CeaseFire lost its $6 million in annual state financing — which meant a reduction from 45 interrupters to 17 — as part of statewide budget cuts. One state senator, who had ordered an audit of CeaseFire (released after the cuts, it found some administrative inefficiencies), maintained there was no evidence that CeaseFire’s work had made a difference. (The cuts caused considerable uproar: The Chicago Tribune ran an editorial urging the restoration of financing, and the State House overwhelmingly voted to double CeaseFire’s financing; the State Senate, though, has yet to address it.)It can be hard to measure the success — or the failure — of public-health programs, especially violence-prevention efforts. And given Slutkin’s propensity to cite scientific studies, it is surprising that he hasn’t yet published anything about CeaseFire in a peer-reviewed journal. Nonetheless, in a report due out later this month, independent researchers hired by the Justice Department (from which CeaseFire gets some money) conclude that CeaseFire has had an impact. Shootings have declined around the city in recent years. But the study found that in six of the seven neighborhoods examined, CeaseFire’s efforts reduced the number of shootings or attempted shootings by 16 percent to 27 percent more than it had declined in comparable neighborhoods. The report also noted — with approbation — that CeaseFire, unlike most programs, manages by outcomes, which means that it doesn’t measure its success by gauging the amount of activity (like the number of interrupters on the street or the number of interruptions — 1,200 over four years) but rather by whether shootings are going up or down. One wall in Slutkin’s office is taken up by maps and charts his staff has generated on the location and changes in the frequency of shootings throughout the city; the data determine how they assign the interrupters. Wes Skogan, a professor of political science at Northwestern (disclosure: I teach there) and the author of the report, said, “I found the statistical results to be as strong as you could hope for.”BALTIMORE, NEWARK and Kansas City, Mo., have each replicated components of the CeaseFire model and have received training from the Chicago staff. In Baltimore, the program, which is run by the city, combines the work of interrupters and outreach workers and has been concentrated in one East Baltimore neighborhood. (The program recently expanded to a second community.) Early research out of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health shows that in the East Baltimore neighborhood there were on average two shootings a month just before the program started. During the first four months that interrupters worked the streets, there had not been a single incident.“My eyes rolled immediately when I heard what the model was,” says Webster of Johns Hopkins, who is studying the Baltimore project. Webster knew the forces the interrupters were up against and considered it wishful thinking that they could effectively mediate disputes. “But when I looked closer at the data,” Webster continues, “and got to know more about who these people were and what they were doing, I became far less skeptical and more hopeful. We’re going to learn from it. And it will evolve.” George Kelling, a Rutgers professor of criminal justice who is helping to establish an effort in Newark to reduce homicide, helped develop the “broken window” theory of fighting crime: addressing small issues quickly. He says a public-health model will be fully effective only if coupled with other efforts, including more creative policing and efforts to get gang members back to school or to work. But he sees promise in the CeaseFire model. “I had to overcome resistance,” Kelling told me, referring to the introduction of a similar program in Newark. “But I think Slutkin’s on to something.”Most of the police officials I spoke with, in both Chicago and Baltimore, were grateful for the interrupters. James B. Jackson, now the first deputy superintendent in Chicago, was once the commander of the 11th district, which has one of the highest rates of violent crime in the city. Jackson told me that after his officers investigated an incident, he would ask the police to pull back so the interrupters could mediate. He understood that if the interrupters were associated with the police, it would jeopardize their standing among gang members. “If you look at how segments of the population view the police department, it makes some of our efforts problematic,” Baltimore’s police commissioner, Frederick H. Bealefeld III, told me. “It takes someone who knows these guys to go in and say, ‘Hey, lay off.’ We can’t do that.”Like many new programs that taste some success, CeaseFire has ambitions that threaten to outgrow its capacity. Slutkin has put much of his effort on taking the project to other cities (there’s interest from Los Angeles, Oakland and Wilmington, Del., among others), and he has consulted with the State Department about assisting in Iraq and in Kenya. (CeaseFire training material has been made available to the provincial reconstruction teams in Iraq.) Meanwhile, their Chicago project is underfinanced, and the interrupters seem stressed from the amount of work they’ve taken on.THE INTERRUPTERS have certain understandings. At the Wednesday meetings, no one is ever to mention anyone involved in a dispute by name or, for that matter, mention the name of the gang. Instead they refer to “Group A” or “Group B.” They are not investigators for the police. In fact, they go out of their way to avoid knowing too much about a crime. When Highsmith and Prater left me the night of the failed drug deal, they began working their contacts. Highsmith found someone who knew one of the stickup men and who, at Highsmith’s request, negotiated with them. Highsmith’s contact persuaded the robbers to return enough of the money to appease the drug-buyer’s anger. When I met with the intermediary a few weeks after things were resolved, he was still stirred up about the robbery. “I was mad enough to do anything,” he told me, making it clear that he and his friends had been hunting for the stickup guys. “This could’ve been a hell of a lot worse than it was.” To this day, neither Highsmith nor Prater know the identities of anyone except the intermediary — and they want to leave it that way.The interrupters often operate by instinct. CeaseFire once received a call from the mother of a 15-year-old boy who wanted out of a gang he joined a few weeks earlier. The mother told Hoddenbach and another interrupter, Max Cerda, that the gang members chased her son home every day from school threatening to beat him. They had shot at him twice. Hoddenbach found the clique leaders and tried to talk sense to them. If the boy didn’t want to be in the gang, he told them, he’d be the first one to snitch. The gang members saw the logic behind that but insisted on giving him a beating before releasing him. Hoddenbach then tried another tack: he negotiated to let him leave the gang for $300 — and no thrashing. The family, though, was only able to come up with $50, so Hoddenbach, Cerda and another interrupter came up with the rest. At their next Wednesday meeting, some interrupters were critical of Hoddenbach for paying what they considered extortion money. “It was kind of a messed-up way, but it was a messed-up way that works,” Hoddenbach said.It was nearly three months before Charles Mack could find time to visit Frederick, the young shooting victim. Frederick had since moved in with his great-grandmother in a different part of town. In his old neighborhood, he told Mack, “there always somebody who knows you. And I had a reputation.” He complained to Mack that he had never been interviewed by the police but then declared he would never identify the person who shot him anyway. “I’m going to leave it alone,” he said. As is so often the case, Frederick couldn’t remember the genesis of the disagreement between his clique and the other. Mack promised to stay in touch, and as we dropped him off, Mack turned to me and said, “I think he’s going to be all right.” It sounded like both a proclamation as well as hopeful aside.Not long ago, I stopped by to visit with Hoddenbach at the Boys and Girls Club, where he holds down a second job. It was a Friday evening, and he was waiting for an old associate to come by to give him an introduction to a group of Hispanic kids on the far North Side. Apparently, earlier in the week, they bashed in the face of an African-American teenager with a brick. From what Hoddenbach could make out, it was the result of a long-simmering dispute — the equivalent of a dormant virus — and the victim’s uncle was now worried that it would set off more fighting. As we sat and talked, Hoddenbach seemed unusually agitated. His left foot twitched as if it had an electric current running through it. “If these idiots continue,” he told me, “somebody’s going to step up and make a statement.”Hoddenbach also worried about Torres, who had recently gone back to Texas and found a job working construction. Hoddenbach says he originally hoped Torres would stay in Chicago and establish some roots, but then decided he’d be better off in another town. “I kept him out of one situation, but I can’t keep him out of all of them,” Hoddenbach said. This may well speak to CeaseFire’s limitations. Leaving town is not an option for most. And for those who have walked away from a shooting, like Torres, if there are no jobs, or lousy schools, or decrepit housing, what’s to keep them from drifting back into their former lives? It’s like cholera: you may cure everyone, you may contain the epidemic, but if you don’t clean up the water supply, people will soon get sick again.Slutkin says that it makes sense to purify the water supply if — and only if — you acknowledge and treat the epidemic at hand. In other words, antipoverty measures will work only if you treat violence. It would seem intuitive that violence is a result of economic deprivation, but the relationship between the two is not static. People who have little expectation for the future live recklessly. On the other side of the coin, a community in which arguments are settled by gunshots is unlikely to experience economic growth and opportunity. In his book “The Bottom Billion,” Paul Collier argues that one of the characteristics of many developing countries that suffer from entrenched poverty is what he calls the conflict trap, the inability to escape a cycle of violence, usually in the guise of civil wars. Could the same be true in our inner cities, where the ubiquity of guns and gunplay pushes businesses and residents out and leaves behind those who can’t leave, the most impoverished?In this, Slutkin sees a direct parallel to the early history of seemingly incurable infectious diseases. “Chinatown, San Francisco in the 1880s,” Slutkin says. “Three ghosts: malaria, smallpox and leprosy. No one wanted to go there. Everybody blamed the people. Dirty. Bad habits. Something about their race. Not only is everybody afraid to go there, but the people there themselves are afraid at all times because people are dying a lot and nobody really knows what to do about it. And people come up with all kinds of other ideas that are not scientifically grounded — like putting people away, closing the place down, pushing the people out of town. Sound familiar?”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Especially inane, though, is Wendell Berry’s suggestion that “specialization” has been bad for humanity. Division of labor has allowed man to rise from savannas and caves to cities, to feed multitudes and to cure deadly disease. Specialization is precisely what will produce the experts who will ultimately figure out how to make cheap energy without fossil fuels. That process, not some Arcadian fantasy that all humanity will voluntarily regress to a semi-industrial state, is the way to a cleaner world.Has Michael Pollan, whose curiosity and prose can stop me in my tracks, forgotten the time he spent with the “pasture-based” farmer Joel Salatin, when he echoes the opinion that milk and beef are major contributors to one’s carbon footprint? (I assume he means industrially raised meat. Let’s make this important distinction.) Has he forgotten how one family restored sadly depleted soil in a generation by setting up land and animalsto do what they’re made to do? How grass-grazing ruminants make perfect foods with simple solar energy, all the while setting things right in their innards, the air and pastures? That this family trains other farmers (one of whom supplies me with eggs and dairy — cheaper than the supermarket). The difference (industrial versus local grass farming) is night and day to animals and environment, not to mention consumers.Pollan briefly mentions composting kitchen waste. Let me tell you how easy this is. Keep a container in the sink; I use and reuse the same heavy-duty plastic bag, which never leaks. Save only vegetable and fruit waste — no grains, fat or meat. When the bag fills, empty it into an outdoor compost bin or pile. Throw some leaves or grass clippings on top if you care about looks. Eventually the material will break down into terrific black humus, good for growing flowers, fruits, vegetables and lawns. If you compost kitchen waste, you reduce or eliminate reliance on chemical fertilizers, all the while improving the soil and encouraging earthworms.Bill Nye (Domains: “Greener Pastures”) takes environmental credit for outfitting his home with a “pergola . . . of lumber from sustainable sources,” a table “built from Australian jarrah wood . . . harvested in a sustainable way” and a fence made from “plastic lumber.” We wonder why, with his background, he did not use steel in any of these projects. He must know that steel can be recycled over and over again without any loss of its physical or chemical properties, claims none of the other materials he used can make.I think the Freakonomics guys, Stephen J. Dubner and Steven D. Levitt, may have missed the boat on two points with the suggestion that insurance rates be adjusted by the number of miles people drive (“Not-So-Free Ride”).First, is there any research to show that Americans are really driving wastefully? I don’t know of anyone who goes on a “Sunday drive” anymore, though it used to be a popular event in my childhood. I think that we have cut our driving significantly due to the current high cost of gas.Second, they have not accounted for the driving skills acquired with experience. I’ll bet that people who drive only 2,000 miles a year are more accident-prone, making them a higher insurance risk, than those who drive 30,000 miles a year.I found your various carbon-use articles fascinating. Unfortunately, reading them has seriously expanded my carbon footprint. The eight-point print and the frequent red ink proved so difficult to read that I am sure the extra energy expended burned much more oxygen and released much more CO2 than was necessary. Perhaps, though, that waste was balanced by the savings in paper. Nonetheless, your eyesight-challenged constituency was ill served.Many thanks for your marvelous “Low-Carbon Catalog.” New Yorkers who want to see many of the technologies in your issue should visit the Queens Botanical Garden’s Visitor and Administration Center. With its photovoltaic cells, geothermal heating and cooling, gray-water recycling, planted green roof (one of the few in New York City accessible to the public), compost toilets and much more, the center is the city’s most advanced green building.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Michael Erard, author of “Um . . . Slips, Stumbles and Verbal Blunders and What They Mean” (that title has too many ands; he mistitled), differentiates the “doesn’t know better” errors due to ignorance, failures of attention or knowledge from the “knows better” errors (which you would correct if given the chance to revise). “The most basic dynamic in gaffe politics,” he informs me, “is to try to make a error seem more like the other type, depending on what suits the listener’s or speaker’s agenda. Opponents try to make the error seem more intentional than it was, twisting an honest linguistic mistake into an emblem of personal failure. Speakers, on the other hand, try to maximize the ‘slippiness’ of an error — no intention, no mistake.”Students of verbal slipmanship along with a few cognitive neuroscientists took note of a speech in Santa Barbara, Calif., recently by the philosopher Daniel Dennett in which he used the computer-jargon noun thinko. Coined on the analogy of typo, it means “mental glitch; brief interruption of the thought process; wind breakage of the brain,” like calling your best friend by your dog’s name, which I did this morning. In years to come, advances in imaging technology may elucidate a connection between the thinko and the prevalence of misspeaking on the political stump.“Long ago I discovered that the word ‘frankly’ often meant a lie was coming,” wrote the columnist Richard Cohen in The Washington Post, who then went on to criticize Hillary Clinton for characterizing a statement by Barack Obama as “elitist, out of touch and, frankly, patronizing.” That is not the standard meaning of frankly (“candidly, outspokenly”); rather, it is a personal definition of one sense of the word by a columnist apparently sensitive to signals of incipient prevarication. (I take frankly to mean “it pains me to put it so bluntly.”)It shows how our long, hard political slog is generating a new media interest in vogue words. Another Post writer, Libby Copeland, focused on margin, “which has been so abused in the six-week-long run-up to the Pennsylvania primary that it began suffering from diminishing marginal returns.” Forget size or degree; examples of margin fixation on MSNBC’s coverage of that primary election night were Keith Olbermann’s “The margin is . . . the essential issue” and a flashing alert that read, “Now awaiting final margin of victory.” The Post’s synonym-rich headline: “ ‘Margin’: On the Border of Being Over the Edge.”One independent candidate bugged by a voguish euphemism is Ralph Nader, who called me the other day to register a complaint about the unthinking, universal adoption of the word detainee. “You put somebody in jail for three years and still call him a detainee? What’s wrong with prisoner?” The famed consumer advocate has a point, which he will undoubtedly make while campaigning in Florida, California and other states that permit mavericks to get access to the ballot. Whatever may be the legal meaning of detainee, first cited in 1928, the Latin root of detain is tenere, “to hold,” and the verb means “to hold temporarily, usually in an emergency,” a far cry from “imprison,” which connotes longer or more severe confinement.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','You can’t get better publicity for a book than “Banned in Boston.” But as product endorsements go, “Banned in China” sends a more mixed message, even if it still wins points for piquancy. Seeing this legend on the dust jacket of Yan Lianke’s faux-naif novel, “Serve the People!” — the first of his books to be translated into English — you have to wonder what Chinese officials are banning books for these days. Publishing overly frank air pollution charts? Leaking hints on Olympic gymnasts’ floor routines? Indulging in too much of the wrong kind of self-criticism? Too much lead in the ink or too much lead in the pencil — that is, excessive lewdness?Yan Lianke has spent much of his adult life refining the highly rarefied, not especially transferable skill of being a provocateur who knows how far he can go without having his quill snapped. It’s a challenging job description: cautious troublemaker. Yan Lianke has won two of China’s top literary prizes for previous novels, but he has also been censured for writing books that annoyed the Party hierarchy. And although he admits to censoring himself to avoid censorship by others, this pre-emptive step hasn’t always been enough. His first book, “Xia Riluo,” described in a Washington Post author profile as a send-up of two People’s Army war heroes gone bad, was banned. A Chinese edition of his most recent novel, which takes place in his native province of Henan, was banned once the authorities understood the subversiveness of its subject. Called “The Dream of Ding Village,” it is reportedly a science-fictiony satire in which opportunists export the blood of peasants by pipeline, as if it were oil.“Serve the People!,” smoothly translated by Julia Lovell, offers an initial sample of Yan Lianke’s writing to an English-speaking audience. A bluntly drawn, mildly erotic fable, it teases Mao Zedong by poking fun at a true believer who obeys the Chairman’s precepts too literally. To a Western sensibility, the broad strokes of Yan Lianke’s humor would seem to pose little risk of inciting rebellion, whether of the flesh or of the body politic. But then, part of the book’s attraction is that it doesn’t have a Western sensibility. It lets the reader see — or rather, intuit — what jokes Chinese officials don’t consider funny, and how very little it takes for a writer to be branded an incendiary in 21st-century China, more than three decades after the death of Mao, a decade after the death of Deng Xiaoping and seven years since China entered the World Trade Organization, a move that would seem to signal a willingness (however wary) to mingle with the rest of the world.Set in 1967, near the outset of the Cultural Revolution and at the height of the Maoist cult of personality, “Serve the People!” tells the story of a docile, doctrinaire peasant soldier named Wu Dawang, whose word-perfect memory of Mao’s sayings (coupled with his excellent kitchen skills) leads to a plum job: cook and general orderly for the commander of his military division. As guileless as a 6-year-old, yet muscular and handy (imagine an Asian Forrest Gump), Wu unquestioningly accepts Mao’s credo that the noblest duty is to “Serve the People!” And he enjoys the slogan’s multiple variations, especially “To serve the Division Commander is to Serve the People!” However, when Wu’s boss departs his residential compound, leaving behind his pretty young wife, Liu Lian, Wu’s Red loyalties slip into a gray area.Yan Lianke builds his story speedily and sparely, as if he were raising a barn against the clock — all frame, little décor. “This is just how things were with this love story,” the author baldly states. “Its beginning, middle and end bereft of the intervening complexities one might imagine necessary to an affair of the heart.” In place of complexities, Yan Lianke deploys similes, like a clumsy coquette dropping handkerchiefs. He compares Liu’s breasts to “fluffily perfect bread rolls,” the curves of her shoulders to “large apples hanging in the gentlest of breezes”; he likens Wu’s desire for her to the hunger of a “starving beggar,” to the “nervous, greedy yearning of thieves before a robbery” and to the thirst of a “parched throat” that craves a “sweet, ripe melon.” He describes their liaison as (among other things) a “honeyed trap,” a “tiger-infested mountain” and “a single rose and a hoe left abandoned in a vast, bare flower bed.”Liu wants to be serviced, not served; but Wu, who is married (to a cloddish peasant back in his home village, though this is a technicality — a “tinny overture to the grand opera into which his affair with Liu Lian would swell”), has no interest in horseplay. Terrified both of betraying the Division Commander’s trust and of wrecking his hopes for advancement, he tries to put off his succubus lady boss when she summons him to her bedroom. But Liu will not be deterred. Instead, she bullies Wu to do her bidding, unwittingly abetted by Wu’s clueless commanding officer, who scolds him when the lady of the house complains of his fractiousness, reminding him of his responsibilities by making him do penance. Chastened, Wu roars, for all to hear, the principle that must guide him: “To Serve the Division Commander and his family is to Serve the People!”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Midway through Wang Anyi’s extraordinary novel “The Song of Everlasting Sorrow,” its heroine, Wang Qiyao, is on her way to a pawn shop when she runs into Mr. Cheng, a friend she hasn’t seen in 12 years. A portrait photographer, Mr. Cheng had taken Wang Qiyao’s photo in the late 1940s; the picture appeared in a magazine, and she went on to win third place in the Miss Shanghai beauty contest, the pinnacle of her career. By the time they meet again, it is 1960. Tragedy and ill-starred romance have ruined Wang Qiyao’s reputation; she is pregnant with the child of a lover whose identity she refuses to reveal. Food shortages have pushed China to the brink of famine, so Mr. Cheng, taking pity on her, invites Wang Qiyao to share his modest lunch of rice and salt pork. At his apartment, “after her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, she saw that the little world inside had barely changed; it was as if the little room had been encased in a time capsule. ... Wang Qiyao failed to understand that it is precisely this myriad of unchanging little worlds that serves as a counterfoil to the tumultuous changes taking place in the outside world.”These observations could stand as an epigraph for this beautiful novel, which considers, among its many themes, the question of what endures and what remains the same — what resists the passage of time and what succumbs to the forces of cataclysmic social change. The scope and sweep of the book, which begins in 1945 and ends 40 years later, as well as its focus on the lives of women, may seem reminiscent of “Wild Swans,” Jung Chang’s memoir of her family’s travails under the draconian policies of Chairman Mao. But in fact the two works are remarkably different.Though politics play a role in the deaths of two of the men Wang Qiyao loves, history more often seems to happen offstage. It enters the characters’ consciousness like the gossip — “made up of fragments discarded from serious conversations, like the shriveled outer leaves of vegetables, or grains of sand in a bag of rice” — that dominates the culture of Shanghai. Its residents, we are told, “hewed to the little things of life, which left them stranded on the margins when it came to politics.”Throughout the novel, Shanghai, with its distinct and mysterious longtang — neighborhoods circumscribed by narrow alleys — is as powerful a presence as its citizens and provides the occasion for the most poetic writing, as in this description of young girls’ bedrooms, “where anything can happen, where even melancholy is noisy and clamorous. When it drizzles, raindrops write the word ‘melancholy’ on the window. The mist in the back longtang is melancholic in an ambiguous way — it unaccountably hastens people along. It nibbles away at the patience she needs to be a daughter, eats away at the fortitude she must have to conduct herself as a woman. ... Every day is more difficult to endure than the last, but, on looking back, one rues the shortness of the time.”+For the young girls who yearn to escape these rooms, history is filtered through the lens of fashion. The advent of Communism replaces their delicately embroidered cheongsams with blue “liberation suits”; the Cultural Revolution tears the curtains from the windows and fuels bonfires with high-heeled shoes. Rebelliousness asserts itself “in the slight curls at the tips of otherwise straight hair, in shirt collars peeping out from underneath blue uniforms, and in the way scarves were tied with fancy shoestring bows. It was remarkably subtle, and the care people put into these details was moving.” We know a more liberal era has begun when clothing stores open along the boulevards, a mania for shopping infects the population, and Wang Qiyao’s daughter and her friends rush to adopt “the hottest fashion on the street.” Meanwhile, the city itself changes almost beyond recognition. By the final chapters, old Shanghai has become a polluted modern metropolis, the maze of its longtang shadowed by high-rises and hideous new construction.In contrast, the novel’s characters each possess, for better or worse, a unique and unalterable core that remains unaffected not only by the lessons of history but by those of personal experience. No amount of enforced “liberation” can make Wang Qiyao’s neighbors transcend their conservative mores and forgive her for having lived in sin with the rich and powerful Director Li. When Wang Qiyao’s girlhood friend, Jiang Lili, becomes an ardent Maoist, she wears a military uniform and struggles to substitute self-discipline for her former self-indulgence. Only her soul is resistant to political re-education. Her youthful “odes to the wind and moon had been replaced by devoted words about steely determination and selfless sacrifice. Now, as then, however, the style smacked of theatrical exaggeration and was not entirely persuasive.” And Jiang Lili still adores gentle Mr. Cheng, whose heart has belonged to Wang Qiyao ever since he photographed her in his studio.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','For Glenn O’Brien and Gina Nanni, weekend life in the Hamptons had become too stressful. So the couple sold their Bridgehampton, N.Y., farmhouse in 2003 and set their sights on the more laid-back Litchfield County, in Connecticut. A vintage Modernist stone-and-glass structure caught their attention online. But when they drove up from the city to look at it, what they found was a scene straight out of “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House” — the “before” scene. “It looked great on the outside,” says Nanni, a partner in the New York public relations firm Company Agenda, but “the inside was a horrible disappointment.”The two-story house had been badly altered inside. “There were seven bedrooms, not all of which you could have occupied,” recalls O’Brien, a well-known writer who is now the editorial director of Brant Publications, the owner of Interview, a magazine he once edited under Andy Warhol. “Our bedroom had mold growing on the ceiling, and if you had walked across the room, you would have stepped through the floor,” he continues. And it needed a new roof. So they kept on looking, but they couldn’t get the house out of their minds. Finally they decided (or perhaps rationalized) “that if we could get Neil to take the job, we would buy the house.” Neil is Neil Logan, who, with his wife, Solveig Fernlund, is a partner in the New York firm Fernlund + Logan Architects. (The two had designed O’Brien and Nanni’s Manhattan loft.)As it turned out, not only did Logan like the house, but he also found its original plan in “Guide to Modern Architecture: Northeast States,” a book that was published by the Museum of Modern Art in 1940. In spite of its sorry state, the house had an interesting pedigree. Completed in 1940, it was designed byCharles H. Warner Jr. for the playwright Hatcher Hughes, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1924 for “Hell-bent fer Heaven.” (Warnerlater founded the firm Warner, Burns, Toan & Lunde, known for its university buildings.) Hughes bought the land from what O’Brien describes as “a very chic swami” who ran a yoga camp for affluent New Yorkers. The house was built from stone and timber taken from its heavily wooded site. “I like the fact that it was built for a writer,” he adds.Fernlund and Logan saw their task as returning the house to something close to its original layout, which included an open living-dining area with a wraparound band of windows and only four bedrooms — a master and two smaller rooms on the main floor, one now occupied by the couple’s young son, Oscar, and another downstairs. The kitchen was restored to its rightful place on themain floor, and they inserted a long row of bookcases along the living-dining area’s southern window wall. “Our input was not to add new features,” Logan says, “but to accentuate the existing ones.” Since both clients have a strong visual sense, he knew that a neutral backdrop would be most effective.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','The first bought each stock five business days before its earnings were to be announced, and sold each one just before the actual announcement. The second portfolio bought each stock immediately after the earnings announcement and held the stock for five business days. The first portfolio beat the market by an annualized rate of 47 percentage points, according to the professors, while the second lagged the market by an annualized rate of 43 percentage points.The professors did not find nearly as pronounced a run-up and drop-back among stocks whose 12-month performance was only slightly behind that of the stocks that led the momentum hit parade. Why was this pattern concentrated among such a small group of top performers?The professors surmise that this is the answer: As earnings season begins, these stocks receive a disproportionate share of attention from small investors, no doubt largely because they are at the top of the leader board for 12-month returns. This appears to lead many of those investors into bidding these stocks even higher, to levels that may be unsustainable.The stocks decline when reality sets in — after the excitement of a positive earnings report ebbs, or, more sharply, after an earnings report disappoints the market.These results would seem to illustrate a hazard of momentum investing — that it works only as long as it works. When momentum reverses itself, a stock may plummet.IT’S theoretically possible that after dropping back in the wake of earnings announcements, this group of stocks will recover over the following few months, Professor Trueman said in an interview. But he said that this study didn’t investigate possible recovery trends, so investors would be going out on a limb in betting on one.Another option for momentum traders would be to avoid altogether the stocks at the top 1 percent of the rankings, betting instead on those that have performed just slightly behind those leaders — and thus were less likely to be magnets for some small investors. As a result, Professor Trueman said, their prices will be less likely to be thrown out of whack.Over all, though, the study suggests just how risky momentum strategies can be.

"'08-05-04,'0','Q. Many years ago, the city’s public high schools required male students to take swimming lessons in the buff. Why? And when did this practice begin and end?A. “I’ve been told this was routine in phys ed classes until the late 1960s, when the practice of swimming in the nude was stopped,” Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, wrote in an e-mail message.The practice was not universal; some New Yorkers who attended public schools in the late 1950s and early 1960s said that their schools either did not have nude swimming or did not require it.Physical education classes with nude swimming were common for boys (but not girls) in some schools and colleges across the country until the courts began upholding complaints by embarrassed students.Originally, what seemed natural to Tom and Huck may have seemed natural to administrators. But nude swimming continued in school and college pools long after bathing suits had become mandatory in most public places. The authorities’ explanations sometimes involved sanitation, like keeping soiled suits out of the water and lint out of the filters. They never sounded very convincing.Q. Why do city buses have readouts behind the driver that light up to indicate the amount of fare paid? How is it any of the other passengers’ business?A. The last time F.Y.I. answered this question was in 1994, when tokens were still in use. One purpose, officials said then, was to assure riders that someone had actually paid.Now that fares are paid by MetroCard, we thought it was time to ask the question again. In response, Deirdre Parker, a New York City Transit spokeswoman, explained that the readout is not just for the passengers.“N.Y.C. Transit’s Department of Buses has a group of undercover supervisors who ride the buses as customers in order to observe bus operators,” she said in an e-mail message. “By having the readouts that display behind the operator, the supervisor is able to tell, in an unobtrusive way, if bus operators are making sure customers are paying the appropriate fare.”'"
"'08-05-04,'0','Bud Selig has been the commissioner of Major League Baseball since 1992. A former owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, Selig, 73, has presided over the game during a period of tremendous growth. But he may ultimately be remembered for his handling of baseball’s so-called steroids era. This year, team owners extended his contract by three years, through 2012. MIKE ABRAMSMOST MEMORABLE BASEBALL MOMENTS The first one is Oct. 10, 1982. My team is one out away from winning the American League pennant. Rod Carew was batting, Pete Ladd was pitching for us, and he hit a rocket toward shortstop Robin Yount for the out. That’s a moment in my life that I’ll never forget. It was etched in my memory. The other one, frankly, is as a 23-year-old kid, Hank Aaron hitting a home run to win the pennant for the Milwaukee Braves in September 1957 off Billy Muffett of the St. Louis Cardinals.HOW DO YOU KEEP UP WITH EVENTS? My routine is six newspapers a day, including yours. I also read clips of every sports story pertaining to baseball. I’ve done that all my life. I’ll tell you what it’s done for me: it’s enabled me to understand what’s going on, what people think, why they think. So when I go from city to city or talk to a lot of people, I understand them.WHAT BOOKS DO YOU READ MOST OFTEN? American history and political science. My favorite author is Doris Kearns Goodwin.WHAT ARE YOU READING NOW? “The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court,” by Jeffrey Toobin.FAVORITE ACTORS Humphrey Bogart and Clark Gable.

"'08-05-04,'0','This evidence of her concern had moved Tom. At the same time, he thought, She wants the money. The web of their relations was shot through with these ambivalences, shade and bright twined with such cunning that their pattern never settled.His jacket hung on the back of a chair. He put it on, then paused: shuffled pages, squared off the stack of paper, touched what he had accomplished. James's dictum caught his eye: Experience is never limited, and it is never complete.When Tom called, raising his voice, the dog went on nosing through leaves and damp grass. It was their last morning there; the territory was no longer new. Yet whenever the dog was allowed outside, he would race to the far end of the yard and start working his way along the fence. Instinct, deepened over centuries, compelled him to check boundaries, drew him to the edges of knowledge.Afterward, Tom would remember the dog ignoring him and the spurt of impatience he had felt. The dog had to be walked and the house packed up before the long drive back to the city. He was keen to get moving while the weather held. So he didn't pat the dog's soft head when he strode to the fence and reached for him.The dog was standing still, one forepaw raised, listening.Tea-colored puddles sprawled on the track. A cockatoo flying up from a sapling dislodged a rhinestone spray. It was a wet spring even in the city, and in these green hills, it rained and rained.The dog's paw-pads were shining jet. He sniffed, and sneezed, and plunged into dithering grass. A twenty-foot rope kept him from farmland and forest while affording him greater freedom than his lead.The man picking his way through rutted mud at the other end of the rope disliked the cold. Tom Loxley had spent two-thirds of his life in a cool southern city. But his childhood had been measured in monsoons, and the first windows he knew had contained the Arabian Sea. Free hand shoved deep in his pocket, he held himself tight against the morning.Light rubbed itself over the paddocks. It struck silver from the cockatoo and splintered the windshield of a toy truck threading up the mountain where trees went down to steel. But what Tom took from the scene was the thrust and weight of leaves, the season's green upswinging. Over time, his eye had grown accustomed to the bleached pigments of the continent where he had made his life. But love takes shape before we know it. On a damp, plumed coast in India, Tom's first encounter with landscape had been dense with leaves. A faultless place for him would always be a green one.He glanced back at Nelly's house. Afterward, he would remember his sense that everything ? the pepper tree by the gate, the sloping driveway, the broad blue sky itself ? was holding its breath, gathered to the moment. The impression was forceful, but Tom's thoughts were busy with Nelly as he had once seen her: astride a sunny wall in the suburb where they both lived, a striped cat pouring himself through her arms.In the corner of his eye, something blurred. At the same time, the rope skidded through his fingers. His head snapped around to see gray fur moving fast, and the dog in pursuit, the end to which sinew and nerve and tissue had always been building.Tom swooped for the rope and clawed at air. On the hillside above the track, the dog was swallowed by leaves.It had begun, seven months earlier, with a painting.April becalmed in hazy, slanted light. Tom clipped on the dog's lead, and they left his flat to walk in streets where houses were packed like wheat. Windows were turning yellow. Dahlias showed off like sunsets. On an autumn evening in the city, Tom looked sideways at other people's lives.At a gallery he hadn't entered in the four years since his wife left, long sash windows had been pushed up; there were smokers on the terraces with glasses in their hands. Tom tied the dog to the garden side of the ornate iron railings and went up the steps.A group show: four young artists. Their friends and relatives were congratulatory and numerous in the two rooms on the ground floor. Tom drank cold wine and looked at paintings. They seemed unremarkable, but he knew enough to know he couldn't tell.From the street it had seemed that there were fewer people upstairs. He had his glass refilled by a pierced girl with ruffles of hair parted low on the side, and started up the stairs. But something made him glance back. She was looking up at him, her face gleaming and amused; and he realized, with a little lurch of perception, that she was a boy.The second-floor room that ran the width of the building contained work unrelated to the exhibition below. A well-fleshed man stood in front of a painting, blocking it from view.""Eddie's still channeling Peter, it seems."" He had a thin, carrying voice. A dark boy standing beside him snickered.On the short wall opposite the door was an almost abstract landscape at which Tom looked for four or five minutes, a long time. Then he went out onto the balcony and saw a couple leaving the gallery stop to fondle the dog's floppy ears. The word Beefmaster passed on the side of a van.When Tom stepped back through the floor-length window, the large man was in the center of the room. More people had attached themselves to his group. He gazed out over their heads; his face was round and turnip-white. The pallor made his eyes, which were very dark, appear hollow. He murmured as Tom passed. There was a small explosion of laughter.Tom gulped wine in front of the picture opposite the door. His scalp hummed. He thought, I am the wrong kind of thing. He thought, I don't belong here. The adverb having a wide application.By an act of will, he directed his attention to the landscape in front of him. His formal training in Art History was limited to two undergraduate years. They had left him a vocabulary, formal strategies for thinking about images. He believed himself to possess a set of basic analytical tools for operating upon a work of art.Faced with this picture, he thought only, How beautiful. And relived, at once, the frustration that had edged his youthful efforts, shadowing the pleasure he took in looking at art. Pictures belong to the world of things. They cannot be contained in language. Tom was still susceptible to their immanent hostility. It had persuaded him, as a student, to concentrate on literature.There he was at home in the medium. For all their shifting play, narratives did not exceed his grasp. He paid them the tribute of lucid investigation, and they unfolded before him.An English voice said, ""Isn't it completely wonderful?""A milky woman with crimson pigtails was smiling down at him. ""I was sure it was you."" She went up on her toes; she was wearing beaded mesh slippers. Up and down she went again, holding out her hand.The rocking was a boon. It identified a party in the summer; a long woman rising and falling. ""We met at Esther's, didn't we?"" Tom took her cool, boneless fingers. ""I'm sorry, I don't remember ...?""""Imogen Halliday. But everyone just says? Mogs.'""Mogs was wearing a kimono fashioned from what might have been burlap, slashed here and there to show a silky green undergarment. She said, ""How is Esther? I've been simply swamped.""""I've been out of touch myself.""Two years earlier, Tom Loxley and Esther Kade had been deputed by their respective university departments, Textual Studies and Art History, to attend a weekend conference on Multimedia and Interactive Teaching Strategies. Under the circumstances, alcohol and sex had seemed no more than survival mechanisms. Later both regretted the affair, which outlived the conference by only an awkward encounter or two. But Esther now felt obliged to invite Tom to her parties to show there were no hard feelings; for the same reason, he felt obliged to go.""Isn't life mad? But I adore working here."" Mogs swayed above him, waving a hand on which a green jewel shone.Mogs was, in her own way, catching.""I was looking at you: you were transfixed. Isn't she a marvel?"" The slippers rose and fell. ""Nelly Zhang,"" said Mogs's soft English voice.Tom nodded. He had read the name, which meant nothing to him, on the list he had picked up at the door. And noted that the picture was not for sale.""Carson's known her forever. Since before ... you know, everything. She's over there with him, actually. In the black ... tunic, I think you'd say.""Tom turned his head and saw a woman in a loose, dark dress that fell to midcalf. Red beads about her neck, her twisted hair secured with a scarlet crayon.""Really exciting. A painting. An early work, of course. She was barely out of art school. From Carson's own collection. Such a privilege just to see it now that Nelly only shows photographs of her work.""Mogs was all right. But Tom wished she would go away. He wanted to be left alone with the picture.Outside the gallery, a spotlight fell across a strip of grass where Nelly Zhang squatted, scratching the dog's chest.""Hail, dog,"" she said. ""You speckled beast."" She peered at his name tag. Her sooty fringe made an almost shocking line against her powdered skin.The dog wagged his tail. His good looks habitually elicited caresses, tidbits. Experience had taught him confidence in his ability to charm.Nelly stood up. Tom was not a tall man, but her head was scarcely higher than his shoulder.He remembered that his wife used to refer to the dog as a chick magnet.Nelly was lighting a thin cigarette. The pungency of cloves and behind it — Tom's sense of smell was acute — a bodily aroma. The dog tilted his spotted muzzle and sniffed. Tom bent to untie his leash.""A man who knows his knots. So much rarer than one who knows the ropes.""He didn't say, I was lonely growing up.He didn't say, String is cheap.But it might have begun long, long before that evening in Carson Posner's gallery. It might have been historical.War took an Englishman called Arthur Loxley to the East and in time returned him with two medals and a shattered knee to ruined Coventry. His mother had been killed in the first raid; to his father he had never had much to say. A trio of sisters inspected him as if their free trial period might expire and leave them stuck with him forever. At some point each took him aside to ask what he had brought her from the Orient. Their blue eyes glittered with the understanding that the world had been made safe for the business of acquisition.He was twenty-six, and his knee ached all through the winter. But the map was still stained pink. Pink people could move about it as they pleased, could rule a line on it and bring nations into being. Arthur returned to India, where that kind of thing was causing a commotion. He paid no attention to it, having had his fill of history. What he was after, then and for the rest of his life, was a bolt-hole, with drink thrown in. There was also the memory of a twenty-four-hour leave he had spent in the whorehouses of Bombay. A Javanese half-caste with spongy golden thighs was instructing him in the art of cunnilingus when boots thundered past in the street and a Glaswegian voice bellowed that Rangoon had fallen. Thereafter, news of defeat would always induce in him a mild erotic stir.Having drifted down the Malabar Coast, he fetched up in Mangalore, where he was taken on as an inventory clerk by Mr. Ashok Lal, an exporter of cashew nuts with a godown in the port. When Arthur looked up from his ledger, boats rocked on green water.He rediscovered, with gratitude, the room India granted to casual human theater. It was there, on every street: in garlanded Ganesh affixed to a radiator grille, in a scabby, naked toddler with liquid jewels at his nostrils, in the man who, possessing no legs, propelled himself on a wheeled plank, advancing on Arthur with a terrible smile. It was not that Arthur idealized the place, for he was a kind man and the daily spectacle was often cruel. But he relished the friendly attention paid here to comedy and tragedy alike, a willingness to be entertained, amused, horrified, that he recognized as a form of thanksgiving for the faceted world.And so, from modest pleasures, Arthur fashioned a happy life. The locally distilled whiskey was cheap, the beer cheaper. He ate deviled prawns every Sunday. Once a month he visited a former maharani who had a house with turquoise shutters in the shadow of the cathedral, and five exquisitely skilled girls.An Indian who had been with the firm for eighteen months was promoted over Arthur, whose congratulations were sincere. He was as indifferent to distinctions of race as to his own advancement. He drank steadily, sometimes fabulously, but always arrived at his desk sober.Contentment, being rare, never fails to attract attention. Arthur Loxley, with his veined cheeks and drunkard's careful gait, was increasingly in the thoughts of a beautiful woman. Iris de Souza's father had informed her at the age of six that she was to marry an Englishman, and neither of them had ever lost sight of that goal. Iris's skin was fair, her face ravishing; many a pretty Eurasian was let down by toothpick legs, but Iris's calves were shapely. Her mother, a handsome crow, had had the good sense to die young. Her father ... But it would take a separate volume to explore the intricate self-loathing of this man, who despised in others the inadequacies that crawled in his own murk. He was an umbrella, tightly furled. Springing open, he might gouge flesh from your fingers. His rages were unpredictable and inconsistent. Iris acquired early the important female attribute of fear.Fear, crouched always like an imp under her ribs, leaped out on her thirty-third birthday. She remained in front of the mirror, fingering the treacherous silver thread coiling through her hair. She could still pass for twenty-four, but that was hardly the point.Next door the Ho baby was crying.It was the war, thought Iris, the war had ruined everything, mixed everything up. It was the mixing she had loved, at the time. In the WVS she had rolled bandages and mixed with English people. A girl called Babs — a new style of girl, fresh from England — was kind to the Eurasian volunteers. It was rumored that Babs was a Communist. Iris was able to overlook this — also the way Babs wasted time conversing with tonga drivers, also Babs's blond mustache — because Babs took a shine to her. There were invitations to tea, the loan of a monograph on shanty dwellers.In April Babs was offered the use, for a week, of a tin-roofed out-bungalow on a tea garden in the Nilgiris. It stood on the far side of the valley from the manager's house; his assistants had gone to the war and left their bungalow vacant. Unfortunately, Babs had seen fit to invite two Indian sisters as well, the up-to-date kind who had opinions. Even the discovery that the Guptas were connoisseurs of detective fiction could not redeem them in Iris's view. With their homespun saris and dog-eared Agatha Christies, they had a disturbingly ambiguous air.Excerpted from ""The Lost Dog"" by Michelle de Kretser Copyright 2007 by Michelle de Kretser.

"'08-05-04,'0','Microsoft’s decision to walk away casts a cloud of uncertainty over Yahoo and its shareholders. The breakdown in the talks is likely to send Yahoo’s shares plunging, and Mr. Yang and his team will have to decide how to placate investors.The company has been exploring alternatives to a marriage with Microsoft, including a partnership in search advertising with its arch rival, Google, which could lift Yahoo’s profit and perhaps its stock price. Yahoo has also discussed possible mergers with the AOL unit of Time Warner and the MySpace unit of the News Corporation. The MySpace talks have not been active of late.But both remaining options pose challenges. A Google partnership would be likely to attract scrutiny from regulators because of Google’s dominance over online search and advertising, while AOL and Yahoo have many overlapping businesses and technologies, making a merger difficult.In a statement issued late Saturday, Mr. Yang said, “With the distraction of Microsoft’s unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history.”Reactions inside Yahoo are likely to be mixed. Several senior executives favored selling to Microsoft and said in recent days that they were hoping to see a deal happen. Yet other executives were high-fiving each other for defeating Microsoft’s bid, people close to the company said.While its stock may fall on Monday, Yahoo’s management was encouraged by discussions with its largest investors in which they urged management to not accept $33 a share, these people said. For Mr. Yang, Microsoft’s withdrawal is considered a “personal victory,” according to one person who spoke with him.Microsoft has spent years and billions of dollars trying to build an online business. Yet it has steadily lost ground to Google in the search business and has failed to gain significant momentum with advertisers.Microsoft’s decision to abandon its pursuit of Yahoo is not necessarily the last chapter in the three-month-old saga. If Yahoo’s shares fall significantly, the company will be under intense pressure to act, and may choose to resume negotiations.Earlier this year, under intense shareholder pressure, BEA Systems did just that, agreeing to a takeover by Oracle soon after Oracle dropped an unsolicited offer it had made for BEA.“This seems like a very strong but serious negotiating tactic,” said Jonathan Miller, the former chairman and chief executive of AOL. “It will be up to Yahoo to come back to the negotiating table.”Microsoft had threatened to pursue a hostile takeover if it could not come to an agreement with Yahoo’s management. That could have involved an appeal directly to Yahoo’s shareholders and an effort to remove members of Yahoo’s board of directors.In a letter to Mr. Yang sent on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Ballmer wrote: “It is clear to me that it is not sensible for Microsoft to take our offer directly to your shareholders. This approach would necessarily involve a protracted proxy contest.”He added: “Our discussions with you have led us to conclude that, in the interim, you would take steps that would make Yahoo undesirable as an acquisition for Microsoft.” Mr. Ballmer took particular aim at Yahoo’s discussions of a partnership with Google, noting that it would “make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us for a number of reasons.”Microsoft’s decision to abandon its bid is likely to raise questions among investors about the judgment of both Microsoft and Yahoo.When Microsoft made its initial bid, it said Yahoo was an important part of its strategy to take on Google. Its choice to withdraw, after threatening to force a shareholder vote, may prompt its shareholders to doubt its resolve. At the same time, many Microsoft shareholders who did not want the company to bid for Yahoo may be relieved and send shares of Microsoft higher on Monday.For Yahoo’s shareholders, the abandoned bid may create even more uncertainty over the company’s management. Many Yahoo shareholders would have preferred that the company accept the offer of about $47.5 billion, which was roughly 70 percent higher than the company’s market value at the end of January.Over the last three months, the companies had infrequent talks, according to people involved in the negotiations from the start who were not authorized to be quoted by name.Frustrated by the lack of discussions, Microsoft sent a threatening letter to Yahoo on April 5 suggesting that Microsoft would try to force a shareholder vote to circumvent Yahoo’s management if the companies could not reach an agreement within three weeks. At the same time, Microsoft began seeking a partner for its bid, holding talks with the News Corporation, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, as well as AOL. Both of those companies had been holding concurrent negotiations with Yahoo about their own partnerships.On April 15, Microsoft and Yahoo held a secret meeting in Portland, Ore., in which the companies discussed “social issues” — like who would run the Yahoo unit if it were folded into Microsoft — but no decisions were made.Three days later, bankers for Microsoft and Yahoo held a conference call in which Yahoo’s bankers suggested that $40 a share would be a “slam dunk” that would get the deal done. A week later, Microsoft’s deadline passed without Microsoft proceeding with a proxy contest as it had threatened. Microsoft decided that it would still try to seek a friendly deal and that a hostile bid could impair the value of Yahoo.Last Tuesday, three days after the deadline, Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Yang had several telephone conversations as Yahoo sought to reach a deal to keep Microsoft from turning hostile. In those talks, Mr. Yang overruled his bankers, telling Mr. Ballmer that Microsoft did not have to go as high as $40 a share to get a deal done, and suggested that they begin negotiations.The next day, Microsoft and Yahoo began talks in earnest, pulling in dozens of bankers and lawyers to try to reach a deal. Mr. Ballmer flew to Yahoo’s headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., where Mr. Yang said Yahoo would be willing to accept nothing lower than $38 a share. Each dollar per share is equal to about $1.4 billion.Microsoft pushed back, saying it would pay no more than $33 a share. The talks culminated in a final meeting on Saturday in which Mr. Yang flew to Seattle to meet with Mr. Ballmer. Mr. Ballmer stuck to his $33 price, and Mr. Yang said Yahoo’s board would accept $37 a share. Hours later, Mr. Ballmer sent Mr. Yang the letter saying Microsoft would withdraw its bid.'"
"'08-05-04,'0','The efforts are paying off. In the 2008 Michelin guide to Europe, 11 restaurants in and around Copenhagen captured a total of 12 stars, more than Norway and Finland combined. The excellent crop of new gastronomic destinations all but guarantees Copenhagen’s continued ascent.Claus Meyer, the co-owner of this vanguard Copenhagen restaurant (Strandgade 93, 45-3296-3297; www.noma.dk), writes in “Noma: Nordic Cuisine” what could be called the rallying cry of the city’s new restaurants: “It was crystal clear to us that somebody had to face up to the challenge of dusting off and updating traditional Danish cuisine, so that it could be lifted out from the nationalistic stench that fills the air in bodegas and inns, so that it could be resurrected in a modernized rendition.”Barely four years old, Noma already has two Michelin stars, the most in town. Along with Mr. Meyer, the head chef, co-owner René Redzepi — a veteran of top international restaurants like El Bulli in Spain and the French Laundry in California — has scouted out unusual, distinctive regional ingredients from the forests and fjords of the remotest North Sea countries. (Many of the best new Copenhagen restaurants have enthusiastically followed suit.)It’s not uncommon to find Greenland cold-water shrimp, Faroe Island langoustines or Icelandic seaweed in their frequently changing menus. No wine is used in soups or sauces; sweet and sour flavors often involve sugar beets or herbs like wood sorrel. Food preparation, too, hearkens back to time-honored Nordic traditions like smoking, salting and pickling.The afternoon I ate there, the harborside space — a low-slung 18th-century brick warehouse with raw plank floors and exposed beams — was a tranquil hum of businessmen and couples. The four-course lunch menu (495 kroner, about $100 at 4.78 kroner to the dollar) began with not one but three successive amuse-bouches, including a peeled, pickled and poached quail egg. The preparation created an unexpected woody-toasty lushness.The first course underscored both the inventiveness and wit of Noma’s kitchen. A small plate arrived bearing a greenish gelatin tube — made from parsley — topped in a cold, white, snowlike powder made from horseradish. The verdant patch under the white powder was clearly an allusion to the winter season outside.But this was much more than a visual gimmick. Invisible inside the parsley gelatin tube were razor clams, which would have been too unsightly if placed directly on the plate. Biting into all three components at once produced the salty flavors of cold North Sea (the clams), a taste of chilly fields (the parsley) and a pleasing bite of winter frost (the horseradish snow). This culinary metaphor of the December landscape was also proof that a near-frozen dish need not be flavorless.In between bites of warm bread and some intriguing jazzed-up butter (one made with pork lard, giving it a bacon-y taste) came a bowl of smoked liquid egg yolk in a mushroom-birch sauce. To balance the heartiness of the main course, reindeer, each cut was topped with an ultra-thin slice of apple (for an iota of acidity) and dime-sized disk of jellied woodruff (for a very delicate herbal sweetness). It was excellent.Dessert again invoked the Christmas season. This time the green on the plate was an ice cream made from tarragon that was sprinkled with crumbly wood-like pellets composed of malt, nuts and a small amount of beer. A heated sugary sauce of beets and tapioca added warmth and completed the red and green color scheme: mistletoe in a bowl.Another strategy to elevate a humble cuisine like Denmark’s is to wed it to a world-renowned and widely respected one — a bit like marrying one of your children into an aristocratic family.At Alberto K, on the 20th floor of the Radisson SAS Royal Denmark hotel (Hammerichsgade 1, 45-3342-6161; www.alberto-k.com), “fine Scandinavian raw materials are united with all that is best from the new Italian kitchen” to create “an untraditional Scandinavian-Italian symbiosis,” according to its Web site. But don’t expect herring primavera or ham alfredo. Alberto K’s creations are subtle and delicate — though sometimes too much so.Molded like petits fours, small chunks of North Sea cod and oysters arrived with tiny spheres of apple. Both were drizzled lightly in prosecco. I was hoping the dish would be able to match the sublimity of the restaurant’s panoramic view and the crispness of the Arne Jacobsen furnishings. Alas, it wasn’t. The cod and oysters overwhelmed the apple taste, and the prosecco was undetectable. It was a nice bit of seafood, but hardly revolutionary.Flashier and more successful was the second course of the four-course dinner (555 kroner), the veal sweetbreads. Pan-fried, they were placed on slices of red beets and topped with shaved truffles. The creamy veal nuggets got sweetness and backbone from the crunchy beet slices and pleasant earthiness from the truffles. The main course — deer — was even better, though the ingredients were pretty much all Danish. The small, thick filets of deer, cooked medium-rare and red, were served with tart-sweet gooseberries that nicely cut the meat’s robustness.The real revelation was the cheese course, which paired a firm Danish cow’s milk cheese from Jutland and a soft Danish blue alongside an Italian goat cheese and a creamy Italian goat-sheep-cow hybrid. The Danish blue, from Holm, was like a more refined Roquefort, while the cow’s milk cheese was supple, smooth and mild. It was more hope that this Italian-Danish marriage might have staying power.The chefs Rasmus Kofoed and Soren Ledet, the award-draped owners of this elegant year-old restaurant, must really like smoke. Long before the presentation of my smoldering dessert, a roaring fire blazed in the restaurant’s backyard, casting a warm orange glow inside and sending up ashy clouds. Meanwhile, within the all-white rustic-chic dining room, Mr. Ledet was delivering the first haze-emitting laboratory experiment of the four-course lunch (548 kroner): smoked salmon topped with quail egg and salmon roe.“In fact we are smoking the salmon right in front of you,” he explained, setting down a plate topped with a small bell jar.He lifted the glass and a puff of fragrant white smoke billowed into the dining room. The chunk of bright pink newly smoked salmon meat was ringed with different types of garnishes, offering myriad ways to embellish the flavor of the fish: delicate horseradish mayonnaise for zest; sliced cucumber for freshness; and sliced apple and rye crisp for crunchy sweetness.For gastronomes who still think that pig is a base animal and pork unworthy of haute cuisine, Geranium (Kronprinsessegade 13; 45-3311-1304; www.restaurantgeranium.dk) offers a bucket of cold Nordic water to the face. My cut looked unassuming at first: a small roll of white-pink tenderloin meat coated with an ultra thin layer of cooked bread, more like a foil. But from the first bite it was clear that the preparation keeps the pork remarkably tender and juicy. As flavorful as a prime rib, it may be the best pig meat I’ve ever tasted. Served with slow-cooked marinated mushrooms, a few red berries and some green sprigs (Christmas colors again), the dish was a swineherd’s ambrosia.With the presentation of the nitrogen-treated elder flowers — a Scandinavian blossom transformed into a high-tech dessert — it was clear that Noma’s two Michelin stars would be getting a healthy challenge from Geranium, which won its first Michelin star in March.I piled the red jelly, white ice cream, black chocolate and frozen white nuggets into my mouth, half expecting the mass to burn through my body and downward toward China. Instead they burst on my tongue and crackled like Pop Rocks. Thoroughly Danish, impressively innovative and potentially explosive, they seemed apt symbols of the new Copenhagen dining scene.'"

"'08-05-05,'0','Mr. Lindsay said that if Yahoo agreed to let Google sell some of its advertising, it could make enough money to justify a share price above $30. If it bought AOL, he added, its shares could rise further.Yahoo’s successful resistance to Microsoft’s pursuit set up a clear challenge for Yahoo’s chief executive, Jerry Yang: prove to investors that the company is worth $37 a share, the price he was willing to sell it for.People close to Yahoo said that Mr. Yang and his team greeted Microsoft’s decision as a victory. High-fives were exchanged Saturday afternoon when they learned Microsoft was backing down.Yet some Yahoo shareholders, large and small, have indicated that they favored a deal at around $34 to $35 a share. Even those who were holding out for a higher price said a merger with Microsoft made strategic sense.“I don’t believe that Jerry Yang as a founder, as someone who is emotionally attached to the company, was really looking out for my interest as a shareholder,” said Darren Chervitz, co-manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owns about 150,000 shares of Yahoo. “I don’t think anything Yahoo puts out there is going to be comparable with what Microsoft was offering.”The entire board backed Mr. Yang’s desire to reject Microsoft’s offer, said a person involved in the negotiations who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. But unhappiness with Mr. Yang could spread through the company’s ranks.“If the stock drops as far as I think it will, a lot of employees are going to be angry and many key employees could leave,” said a Yahoo executive, who asked to remain anonymous to avoid upsetting his superiors.On Jan. 31, just before Microsoft’s uninvited bid for Yahoo became public, Yahoo closed at $19.18, near a four-year low.Yahoo defended its decision, saying it had always thought Microsoft’s offer, worth about $47.5 billion, undervalued the company. Officially, the company has shed little light on what it might do next. “We remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and pursuing strategic opportunities that position Yahoo for success and leadership in its markets,” Roy Bostock, Yahoo’s chairman, said in a statement issued late Saturday.But people close to the company suggested that Yahoo’s most likely lifeline could come from an unlikely source: Google.The two companies recently conducted a two-week test in which Google delivered ads on a small portion of Yahoo searches. The test, which both companies described as successful, was intended to show how much more Yahoo could earn by outsourcing some of its search ads to Google, whose technology and large base of advertisers allow it to extract more revenue on average for every search.Now Google and Yahoo will have to decide whether to move from test to broader partnership. Talks around a deal were active Friday, even as Yahoo and Microsoft were engaged in a last-ditch effort to come to an agreement, said a person familiar with the discussions.For Yahoo, the idea of letting Google run some of its search ads is not new. Some shareholders and even some Yahoo executives have long favored it. By the company’s own reckoning, Google earns about 60 percent to 70 percent more on average for every search than Yahoo.But before Microsoft made its offer, Mr. Yang and his team had repeatedly rejected the idea, saying search advertising was an essential part of the company’s long-term strategy. Instead, the company spent millions in improving its own search advertising system, called Panama, telling investors it was the right choice.In a letter sent Saturday to Mr. Yang, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, used precisely those arguments to emphasize why a search advertising partnership with Google was a bad idea. He also noted that it was one reason Microsoft decided to walk away from its offer, rather than initiate a proxy fight.A partnership with Google “would fundamentally undermine Yahoo’s own strategy and long-term viability by encouraging advertisers to use Google as opposed to your Panama paid search system,” Mr. Ballmer said. “This would also fragment your search advertising and display advertising strategies and the ecosystem surrounding them.”Yahoo and Google, however, are not talking about outsourcing all of Yahoo’s search ads to Google. Instead, they are considering a more limited partnership, under which Google would deliver ads only on particular searches for which the revenue difference is significant, according to people familiar with the discussions.Analysts say such an arrangement could have multiple benefits. It would allow Yahoo to retain Panama and even use the extra revenue it receives from Google to invest in its own ad system. A limited partnership could help get around the antitrust scrutiny that a broader deal would most certainly face from regulators. The Justice Department has already begun asking questions about the companies’ relationships.Some in Silicon Valley say a deal with Google made sense before and makes sense now. “If Yahoo were to put as much attention into its product as it put in catching Google in search monetization, it would be doing fine,” said Roger McNamee, a veteran technology investor and the co-founder of Elevation Partners, a private equity firm.Many analysts say that a partnership with Google is the most significant thing Yahoo could do to bolster its value to shareholders.Until the weekend, Yahoo was still in active discussions about a possible merger with Time Warner’s AOL unit, said people with knowledge of the talks. Under the deal being considered, Time Warner would exchange AOL for a 20 percent stake in Yahoo, these people said.But some analysts warn that a merger with AOL may not be a panacea for Yahoo. Advertising on AOL’s main portal has declined recently, and the company has been through a string of acquisitions of online advertising companies that have yet to be successfully integrated into AOL.“I think you’d have potentially equal or greater integration challenges in a Yahoo-AOL combination than in a Yahoo-Microsoft combination,” Christopher Vollmer, who leads the media practice at consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton, said in a recent interview.Yahoo, or its executives, may also initiate a stock buyback, to demonstrate to shareholders that they have faith in the company. Yahoo had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31.“It stands to reason that if Yahoo seems so convinced that the stock is worth at a minimum $37, insiders and the company itself would probably have to put their money where they mouth is,” said Scott Kessler, an equity analyst with Standard & Poor’s.Regardless, shareholder lawsuits are likely to follow. Eric Jackson, who has organized an informal group of individual shareholders collectively holding about 2 million shares of Yahoo, said that he planned a campaign urging Yahoo shareholders to withhold their votes from all Yahoo directors at the company’s annual meeting, which is expected to be announced soon.“I always had a concern that the board would bluff its way to this kind of an outcome,” said Mr. Jackson said. “But I didn’t think it would come to this. I’m very upset.”'"
"'08-05-05,'0','What really seems to have shocked and surprised Obama is what Wright said about him: “What I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing.” Later on in his press conference, Obama returned to this, saying that Wright’s cavalier dismissal of Obama as just another politician was “a show of disrespect to me.”Some voters might think it would have been nice if Obama had been as angry in March at Wright’s disrespect to the United States of America as he was in April at Wright’s disrespect to Barack Obama.Still, Obama is the likely Democratic nominee. Some conservatives are giddy at the thought — kidding themselves that the general election will therefore be easy, that Obama will be another Dukakis. I was struck, though, in several conversations this week with McCain campaign staffers and advisers that they’re pretty sober about the task ahead. About the Dukakis analogy, for example, one McCain aide said: If in 1988 Ronald Reagan had had a 30 percent job approval rating, and 80 percent of the voters had thought we were on the wrong track, Dukakis would have won.And the McCain campaign knows the environment for Republicans remains toxic. They noticed that on Saturday night Republicans lost their second House seat in a special election in two months — this one in a district they had held since 1974 and that Bush had carried by almost 20 points in 2004.Another McCain staffer called my attention to this finding in the latest Fox News poll: McCain led Obama in the straight match-up, 46 to 43. Voters were then asked to choose between two tickets, McCain-Romney vs. Obama-Clinton. Obama-Clinton won 47 to 41.That reversal of a three-point McCain lead to a six-point deficit for the McCain ticket suggests what might happen (a) when the Democrats unite, and (b) if McCain were to choose a conventional running mate, who, as it were, reinforced the Republican brand for the ticket. As the McCain aide put it, this is what will happen if we run a traditional campaign; our numbers will gradually regress toward the (losing) generic Republican number.Maybe that’s why, in separate conversations last week, no fewer than four McCain staffers and advisers mentioned as a possible vice-presidential pick the 36-year-old Louisiana governor, Bobby Jindal. They’re tempted by the idea of picking someone so young, with real accomplishments and a strong reformist streak.It might also be a way to confront the issue of McCain’s age (71), which private polls and focus groups suggest could be a real problem. A Jindal pick would implicitly acknowledge the questions and raise the ante. The message would be: “You want generational change? You can get it with McCain-Jindal — without risking a liberal and inexperienced Obama as commander in chief.” I would add that it was after McCain spent considerable time with Jindal in New Orleans recently, and reportedly found him, as he has before, personally engaging and intellectually impressive, that the campaign’s informal name-dropping of Jindal began.Of course, we shouldn’t assume that the Democratic nominee will be Obama. Maybe Clinton will win both Indiana and North Carolina on Tuesday. If she does, she’ll have a chance — an outside chance, but a chance — to win the nomination. And if that happens, the reason will have been that Obama allowed his own running mate in the primaries to become Reverend Jeremiah Wright.'"
"'08-05-05,'0','SOMERSET, Pa. — As envisioned by its designer, the memorial to the victims who died on Sept. 11, 2001, when United Flight 93 crashed into a field near Shanksville, Pa., would follow the topography of the bowl-shaped land, creating a circular pathway ringed by trees, all focused on the “sacred ground” of the crash site near the bottom of the circle.But almost from the moment the winning entry for the memorial was chosen in 2005 over 1,058 others it has been beset by controversy, most of it coming from critics who see Islamic symbolism in the design.The critics complain that the shape of the memorial — designed by Paul Murdoch, an architect based in Los Angeles — is an Islamic crescent, that a wind-chime tower mirrors an Islamic minaret and that the memorial would point east toward the Islamic holy city of Mecca.The complaints gained traction recently because Tom Burnett Sr., the father of a Flight 93 victim, has become one of the most prominent opponents.“It’s really revolting to me, this whole thing,” said Mr. Burnett, a retired high school English teacher from Northfield, Minn. “It’s an insult to my son and all the others.”On Saturday, five people told members of the Flight 93 Memorial Task Force and the Flight 93 Advisory Committee that the design should be scrapped because of what they saw as Islamic symbolism. One of those speakers, Harry Beam, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, presented petitions with 5,300 signatures opposing the design to members of the Flight 93 boards, who were holding a quarterly meeting.'"
"'08-05-05,'0','ALMATY, Kazakhstan — A 246-foot tall, rocket ship-like monument to the late ruler of Turkmenistan, topped with a golden statue of himself that rotates to always face the sun, will be removed from the center of the Turkmen capital, state news media there have reported.A decision by President Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov to move the monument was his latest step in dismantling the personality cult of Saparmurat Niyazov, whose often bizarre decrees turned the isolated, energy-rich country into the punch line of a bad international joke.The president had already reversed Mr. Niyazov’s order renaming the days of the week and months of the year in honor of himself and his family. He had also ended the bans on opera, ballet and the circus, which Mr. Niyazov had decreed un-Turkmen, and lifted restrictions on the Internet.The monument, erected in 1998 and known as the Neutrality Arch, remains the most prominent icon to Mr. Niyazov, who ruled the desert nation of five million people from its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 to his death in 2006. A giant white tripod with an Eiffel Tower-type observation deck, the monument is capped with a spinning 39-foot-tall effigy of Mr. Niyazov.President Berdymukhammedov ordered that the monument be moved to the southern edge of the capital, Ashgabat, the official Web site, turkmenistan.ru, reported late Saturday night.In its isolation and leader worship, Mr. Niyazov’s Turkmenistan resembled a less severe but more eccentric version of Kim Jong-il’s North Korea. Turkmen could travel abroad, but with difficulty, while foreign visits to the country were sharply restricted. Mr. Niyazov’s image was plastered throughout the country — on buildings, watches, and vodka and perfume bottles.'"
"'08-05-05,'0','The British border agency is appealing for a second time to keep the rapper Snoop Dogg, below, out of the country, the BBC reported. The agency maintains that “a material error in law” was made at Snoop Dogg’s hearing in January, when he was cleared to enter Britain by an immigration judge who said he found no evidence that Snoop Dogg was responsible for any public disorder. Last month the agency lost its appeal of that ruling. In announcing its decision to appeal once more, a representative said, “We will continue to oppose the entry to the U.K. of individuals where we believe there may be a risk to the public.” The case began when Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was refused a visa for a tour after he and five members of his entourage were arrested during a reported melee at Heathrow Airport in 2006.'"
"'08-05-05,'0','Studios and theater owners were looking to “Iron Man” for clues about whether declining consumer confidence would keep moviegoers at home. Although movies are relatively inexpensive entertainment — and have even benefited from economic slowdowns in the past — prices for tickets and concessions have risen steadily over the years, prompting worries.“What I think this says about the marketplace is that if we make really entertaining movies, people will show up for them,” said Rob Moore, president for marketing at Paramount. Hed said “Iron Man” delivered the best opening weekend of any live-action film in Paramount’s history.Still, establishing box office momentum could be difficult for the studios. Unlike last summer, when Hollywood offered up mostly sequels, this year the big bets are on originals. Total domestic ticket sales for the weekend stood at $165 million, a 13 percent decline from the same weekend last year, when “Spider-Man 3” opened.Next up is “Speed Racer,” a Warner Brothers movie based on the 1960s-era cartoon. The picture, which opens Friday, has posed substantial marketing challenges because of, among other things, its over-the-top visual style.There are other questions waiting to be answered as the studios roll out their summer slates. Can the up-and-coming star Shia LaBeouf turn out young women for the latest “Indiana Jones” installment? Does Angelina Jolie, starring in “Wanted” as an assassin, still have the drawing power to open a big movie? Is the Pixar brand powerful enough to sell “Wall-E,” a robot romance that has almost no dialogue?A variety of factors propelled “Iron Man” to strong results, box office analysts said. Among them: pent-up demand in the marketplace for an event movie and overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics. A megawatt marketing campaign from Paramount helped create interest in a film about one of the comic book world’s lesser-known characters.Casting was also crucial. “Iron Man” is the story of Tony Stark, a beyond-brilliant engineer who builds a metal suit that allows him to fly and fight bad guys. Marvel’s decision to cast the seasoned actor Robert Downey Jr. in the title role helped the movie woo adults who might skip a superhero movie, at least on a frenzied opening weekend.Marvel and Paramount are already discussing a sequel, although the upstart Marvel studio will have a much more expensive project on its hands should that come about. Mr. Favreau, for instance, has not yet signed on for a second installment.The weekend’s only other movie of significance, Sony’s “Made of Honor,” ran a distant No. 2 but was not trampled as many had predicted. That $40 million comedy, staring Patrick Dempsey as a guy in love with an engaged woman, sold an estimated $15.5 million in tickets at North American theaters.Two holdover comedies from Universal also performed remarkably well against the competition. “Baby Mama,” starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, earned $10.3 million (for a total of $33.2 million), while “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” the latest from the producer Judd Apatow, earned $6.1 million ($44.8 million overall).Rounding out the weekend’s Top 5 was “Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay” (Warner Brothers), with $6 million ($25.3 million overall).'"
"'08-05-05,'0','A study recently published in the Journal of Consumer Research finds that eBay bidders react in profound ways to a seller’s numerical “reputation” on the site.When a seller has a bad reputation as shown in feedback ratings, the study found, buyers are highly suspicious of surcharges like shipping, and tend to factor those costs into their bids. The study’s author looked at 271 auctions of several DVD trilogies in 2004 and 2005, and found that low-reputation sellers sacrificed $1.18 in bid prices, on average, for every dollar of surcharge. By contrast, sellers with high reputations seemed to get slightly higher bids when they added surcharges, although the increase was too small to be statistically significant.The author, Amar Cheema, an assistant professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said that low-reputation sellers should simply build surcharges into their prices, in markets where it was possible, because buyers direct extra scrutiny to surcharges. “Some previously published data show that people’s price sensitivity to a surcharge is twice their price sensitivity to a base price,” he said.'"
"'08-05-05,'0','Competitive zeal, persistence and patient investment have been crucial to Microsoft’s triumphs over the years, as it built businesses instead of buying them. The formula worked again and again, in personal computer operating systems, applications like word processors and spreadsheets, data center software, and even video game systems.The same tactics also vanquished the challenge from the early leader in Internet browsing software, Netscape Communications, in the 1990s. But Microsoft’s campaign in the browser rivalry led to the sweeping federal antitrust suit against the company, filed in 1998, and continuing antitrust oversight in the United States and Europe.Microsoft’s competitive behavior is more restrained these days in the aftermath of its antitrust troubles, industry veterans and analysts say. That helps to explain why Microsoft has struggled in this round of competition, especially against Google, which has leapt far ahead in markets like Web advertising.“Microsoft’s pursuit of Yahoo and its antitrust troubles have the same root,” said Timothy F. Bresnahan, an economist at Stanford University and a former Justice Department antitrust official. “The future of mass-market computing is not the personal computer.”Microsoft’s effort to grab Yahoo and its ultimate decision to abandon the campaign displayed the two sides of Mr. Ballmer’s business style: high-octane competitive aggression and analytical pragmatism.Mr. Ballmer informed a startled Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive, that Microsoft would be making an unfriendly offer for Yahoo in an afternoon phone call the day before the bid was made public on Feb. 1. The stock-and-cash offer, valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 a share, was 60 percent more than what Yahoo’s shares had traded for the day before.On April 5, frustrated by the lack of negotiations, Mr. Ballmer sent Yahoo a threatening letter, suggesting Microsoft would go directly to Yahoo shareholders for a vote if Yahoo’s management did not agree to a merger within three weeks.But in a meeting two weeks ago with Mr. Yang, it became clear to Mr. Ballmer that he needed to reach a friendly deal or withdraw entirely, according to people close to him who attended the meeting. The small group met in downtown Portland, Ore., at the offices of the law firm founded by Mr. Gates’s father.Mr. Yang made a lengthy presentation, using Microsoft’s PowerPoint software, that ended with a page stating, in bold letters, that Microsoft’s offer “substantially undervalues” Yahoo. But when Mr. Ballmer asked what price would value the company properly, Mr. Yang refused to even discuss the subject, according to a person at the meeting.As the Microsoft team left, this person said, one of Mr. Ballmer’s lieutenants whispered, “They are going to burn the furniture if we go hostile. They are going to destroy the place.”On Saturday, the two men again failed to reach an agreement on a fair price, and Mr. Ballmer walked away.The decision also showed Mr. Ballmer’s analytic discipline; he had his number, and he wasn’t going further.For most of his career, Mr. Ballmer has been overshadowed by Mr. Gates. Their friendship started in their days as students at Harvard University; their business partnership began when Mr. Ballmer joined Microsoft.Though he became chief executive in 2000, Mr. Ballmer has typically been cast as a marketing dynamo: tireless, hyperkinetic and a booming orator, renowned for his uninhibited performances at Microsoft sales meetings. But Mr. Ballmer, colleagues say, has a deep mastery of strategy and finance. He is a math whiz who as a student scored a perfect 800 on the SAT math exam.Yet Mr. Ballmer’s business skills have not yet helped Microsoft much in trying to catch Google, analysts say. The Silicon Valley powerhouse is a smart, nimble and aggressive competitor, and the leader of a broad shift toward Internet computing.That transition began in the 1990s, and Netscape was part of it. But the tilt toward the Internet has accelerated in recent years. People now go online from a PC or cellphone, while most of the processing and services they use are located in vast data centers run by Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Facebook and other Internet companies. Google and others have even begun offering online word processors and spreadsheets as alternatives to Microsoft’s desktop products.Microsoft has made huge investments in the online field, but its heritage, profits and leadership come from the desktop PC software business.Looking at Microsoft today, Mitchell Kapor, an elder statesman of modern computing, is reminded of another industry power that was chastened by a lengthy antitrust struggle and a seismic shift in the technology landscape — I.B.M. in the 1980s and early 1990s, as the mainframe gave way to personal computing.“I.B.M. came out of those years still large and enormously important to its customers, but I.B.M. was displaced by Microsoft,” he said. “I.B.M. was no longer the defining company.”“The irony is that what Microsoft did to I.B.M., Google is doing to Microsoft,” said Mr. Kapor, founder of Lotus Development, which made the leading spreadsheet program in the 1980s, and the founding chairman of the Mozilla Foundation, developer of the free Web browser Firefox.In the current round of Internet competition, Microsoft must be careful to not antagonize antitrust authorities. Despite years of scrutiny, sanctions and fines, Microsoft’s lucrative business remains largely untouched. Still, analysts and rivals say, Microsoft is a more cautious competitor these days.For example, one ingredient in Microsoft’s formula for success has been to link new software to its dominant PC operating system, Windows, either with proprietary formats or by simply bundling new software into Windows. It did that long ago with its desktop word processing and spreadsheet programs, and it used the bundling tactic most forcefully with Web browsing software in the 1990s.Microsoft declared the browser a part of the operating system and gave it away free. The move, according to Microsoft, was done to benefit consumers. Rivals and antitrust officials saw it as a blatant tactic to stifle competition from Netscape.This bundling strategy was a central element in the federal antitrust suit in the United States, and it has been challenged in Europe as well. The Bush administration, however, settled the federal case without restricting Microsoft’s freedom to put new products and features into Windows.“But the legacy of the antitrust suit was to make Microsoft much more cautious about bundling for fear of reigniting the problem,” Mr. Kapor said.In Internet search, Microsoft has not used its dominance in desktop and browser software to favor its offering called Live Search. In the upper-right corner of a Web browser window, there is typically a slender box for typing in search terms. In search, the equivalent of the bundling formula would be to send those queries to Microsoft’s search service by default.“It could have, but Microsoft never did that with Google,” said Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. “The antitrust process made Microsoft more restrained, and it did change the company’s culture.”Now, without Yahoo, Microsoft may seek smaller deals or return to its traditional game plan, relying on patient investment and persistence to build a more competitive online business.Speaking to a group of investors and analysts in 2005, Mr. Ballmer said no one should doubt Microsoft’s determination. “We will do well,” he said. “Whether it’s me or the guy who replaces me because we don’t do well. We’ll keep coming, and we will do well.”'"

"'08-05-06,'1','An 1873 canvas by Monet of a riverbank landscape with two trains atop a railway bridge sold for $41.4 million Tuesday night at Christie’s. It was a record price for the artist.Three bidders competed for the painting, “The Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil,” which is considered a prime example of high Impressionism. Christie’s had predicted the canvas would fetch $35 million.The hammer price was $37 million. (Final prices include Christie’s commission: 25 percent of the first $20,000, 20 percent of the next $20,000 to $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Christie’s sale of Impressionist and Modern art, which opens two weeks of big spring art auctions, has been widely viewed as a harbinger of how economic anxieties over the stock market, oil prices, the pending bailout of Bear, Stearns and other economic developments will affect a booming art market.So committed was Christie’s to the Monet painting that it gave the sellers a guarantee — an undisclosed amount that the auction house would pay the seller regardless of the sale’s outcome — that experts in the field said was around $34 million.The sellers were the Nahmad family, dealers with galleries in New York and London. They bought the painting in 1988 at Christie’s in London for $12.6 million, which at the time the second-highest price ever paid at auction for a Monet.'"
"'08-05-06,'1','The company also announced that it planned to raise $6 billion in capital through an equity offering. And it said that it would cut its dividend, starting in the third quarter, to 25 cents a share from 35 cents. Fannie Mae shares fell as much as 11 percent in premarket trading, but recovered in regular trading and were up about 5 percent.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were created by Congress but are owned by investors, suffered more than $9 billion in mortgage-related losses last year, and analysts expect those losses to grow this year. Freddie Mac is to report earnings next week.Analysts say the companies are sitting on billions of dollars in additional losses that they have not yet fully acknowledged, analysts say. If either company stumbled, the mortgage business could lose its only lubricant, potentially causing the housing market to plummet and the credit markets to freeze up completely.And if Fannie or Freddie fail, taxpayers would probably have to bail them out at a staggering cost.“We’ve taken tremendous risks by loosening these companies’ purse strings,” said Senator Mel Martinez, Republican of Florida and a former secretary of housing and urban development. “They could cause an economywide meltdown if they got into real trouble and leave the public on the hook for billions.”Concerns over the companies’ finances had prompted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle between nervous government officials and the two companies. Bush administration officials, the Federal Reserve and lawmakers all believed that the companies’ financial safety cushion was far too thin and had pleaded with them to raise more capital from investors.Freddie and Fannie, which are enjoying new growth and profits, had largely resisted those pleas, people briefed on the talks say, because selling new shares could dilute the holdings of existing shareholders and drive down their stock prices.Moreover, the companies are using their newfound clout to push Congress and their regulator to roll back the limits that were imposed after recent scandals over accounting and executive pay, according to participants in those conversations.On Tuesday, Fannie Mae’s regulator said that it would lift the limits that it had imposed. The regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, said it intended to reduce the capital surplus requirement after the company raised more capital. The regulator said that it would lower the surplus that must be retained to 15 percent from 20 percent. The requirement was reduced from 30 percent in mid-March.As a result, high-ranking government officials are now quietly threatening to publicly criticize the two companies if they do not soon raise large amounts of capital, people with firsthand knowledge of those threats say. William Poole, a president of a Federal Reserve bank who has since retired, has warned that companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are “at the top of my list of sources of potentially serious trouble.”A report last month by the agency overseeing the companies said that they pose “significant supervisory concerns” and that Freddie Mac suffers “internal control weaknesses.”Lawmakers are pushing to rein in the companies with new legislation. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who leads the Banking Committee, will soon take up legislation giving the government broad authority over the companies. Lawmakers say it is likely a bill will pass this year.“They are on real thin ice financially,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. “And the way the law is written right now, there is very little we can do to correct that.”The companies say such criticisms are without merit. Their latest regulatory filings, they note, show a combined financial safety net that exceeds required minimums by $7 billion. The companies raised $13 billion from investors last year and say any future losses will be offset by new revenue and by money they have already set aside.“The irony is that right now I’m seeing the best opportunities since I’ve been in this business,” said Daniel H. Mudd, chief executive of Fannie Mae, in an interview conducted last month.The companies also say that they have not demanded anything. Rather, they say, the limitations have been dropped because of the companies’ commitment to financial transparency and aiding the housing recovery.But others remain concerned. Though the companies’ main regulator, James B. Lockhart III, director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, has voiced strong confidence in the companies, a high-ranking member of his staff said some officials had begun considering the worst.“It’s not irrational to be thinking about a bailout,” said that person, who requested anonymity, fearing dismissal.Fannie and Freddie do not lend directly to home buyers. Rather, they buy mortgages from banks and other lenders, and thereby provide fresh capital for home loans. The companies keep some of the mortgages they buy, hoping to profit from them, and sell the rest to investors with a guarantee to pay off the loan if the borrower defaults.Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.Those profits were threatened earlier this decade, however, when new competitors emerged and after audits revealed that both companies had manipulated their earnings. The companies were forced to replace top executives, pay hundreds of millions in penalties and consent to strict growth limits.To keep profits aloft and meet affordable-housing goals set by Congress, the companies began buying huge numbers of subprime and Alt-A mortgages, the highly profitable loans often taken out by low-income and riskier borrowers. By the end of last year, the companies had guaranteed or invested in $717 billion of subprime and Alt-A loans, up from almost none in 2000.Then the housing bubble burst. In February, the companies revealed a $6 billion combined loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, and both companies’ stock prices fell more than 25 percent in less than two weeks. Freddie Mac fell to $17.39 on March 10 from $24.49 on Feb. 28, while Fannie Mae declined to $19.81 on March 10 from $27.90 on Feb. 28.Despite those troubles, lawmakers had few alternatives to asking Fannie and Freddie to buy more and riskier mortgages.“I want these companies to help with affordable housing, to help low-income families get loans and to help clean up this subprime mess,” said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “Otherwise, why should they exist?”But now that the government depends on Fannie and Freddie to keep markets humming, the companies are making demands of their own — namely, repealing some of the limits created after the scandals and even some established by law.Last year, in return for buying billions of dollars of subprime mortgages to help stabilize the market, executives won the right to expand their investment portfolios. In March, the companies agreed to raise more capital within the year. In exchange, they received an additional $200 billion in purchasing power.Last month, the companies promised to pump money into the more expensive reaches of the housing market. In return, Congress temporarily raised the cap on the size of the mortgages they can buy to almost $730,000 from $417,000.“We have to bow and scrape and haggle each time we need help,” said a senior Republican Senate assistant who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.Each time Congress or regulators have given the companies new room for growth, their stock prices have risen. But so far the companies have balked at raising more capital. That hesitation has lawmakers concerned that when the companies raise money this year, it will not be enough.In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. Michael L. Cosgrove, a spokesman for Freddie Mac, said Mr. Syron was committed to both satisfying the company’s public mission and creating shareholder value. Fannie Mae, which is in a regulatory-imposed quiet period because it will soon release financial information, declined to comment on capital-raising issues.As worrisome as the need for new capital, some analysts say, are the companies’ books.A report released earlier this month by Mr. Lockhart, the regulator, noted that although Freddie and Fannie had a combined $19.9 billion of “unrealized losses” on mortgage-related investments, neither company had reduced its earnings to reflect those declines. That is because they judged the losses to be temporary — in essence wagering that the mortgage market would recover before those assets were sold. Such a wager is permitted by the rules but difficult for outsiders to analyze.Fannie Mae declined to discuss unrealized losses. Mr. Cosgrove, the Freddie Mac spokesman, said the company discloses all financial choices and downgrades all potentially impaired securities when appropriate.The regulator’s report also noted that Freddie used accounting choices that gave it an immediate $1 billion capital increase. While those and other tactics are technically permitted, the regulator said, they deserve scrutiny.“Companies can make assumptions that cause very large differences in what they report,” Mr. Lockhart said in an interview. He has repeatedly said that the companies are making good progress and have fixed many of their problems. But at least one accounting choice, he said, “concerns us.”Mr. Cosgrove said Freddie Mac’s accounting choices had been the best way to reflect financial realities.Both companies have also recently changed their policies on delinquent loans, which they previously recorded as impaired when borrowers were 120 days late. Now, some overdue loans can go two years before the companies record a loss.Fannie Mae declined to discuss the accounting of impaired loans. A representative of Freddie Mac said marking loans as permanently impaired at 120 days does not reflect that many of them avoid foreclosure. But the biggest risk, analysts say, is that both companies are betting that the housing market will rebound by 2010. If the housing malaise lasts longer, unexpected losses could overwhelm their reserves, starting a chain of events that could result in a federal bailout.A version of those events began in November, when Freddie Mac’s capital fell below congressionally mandated levels. The company stemmed the decline by selling $6 billion in preferred stock. But it might not manage that again if there is another unexpected loss, analysts say.“The last two years have shown the real need for a stronger regulator,” Mr. Lockhart said. If his agency did not curb the companies’ growth earlier this decade, he added, “they would be part of the problem right now instead of part of the solution.”'"
"'08-05-06,'1','Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, cited the proposed Google partnership as the main reason for not pursuing a hostile bid and instead walking away on Saturday.“Such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us,” he wrote Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive, in a letter, and cited five specific reasons Google would be bad for Yahoo.Yahoo may well pursue the partnerships with Google, its main rival, to bolster its depressed stock price. Yahoo shares dropped 15 percent, or $4.30 Monday, to $24.37. The two companies refused to comment.Not surprisingly, analysts are saying the Microsoft-Yahoo story has one clear winner: Google. And its stock price reflected that thinking Monday. More than $4 billion was added to Google’s value as the stock price rose 2.34 percent.Not yet 10 years old, Google has emerged as a powerhouse that is wielding tremendous power in the world of technology and beyond. It was able to influence a government auction of broadcast spectrum. It nudged several cellphone companies into opening up their networks to the phones of rivals.Its influence is all the more surprising, because its economic power is still derived largely from a single, seemingly prosaic business: the ability to place interesting text advertisements in front of people when they do searches. Advertisers pay for those ads — sometimes $1 or less — only when users click on them. In a sense, Google has built a highly profitable $16.6 billion empire a dollar at a time.“They are the company that is going to have more influence and more control over the structure of the world information industry than any other,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “The right way to think about Google is they are the next Microsoft.”The mission set by Google’s two founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to organize all the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is every bit as ambitious as Microsoft’s goal, in the early 1980s, to put a PC on every desk and in every home, said Tim O’Reilly, chief executive of O’Reilly Media.“Microsoft succeeded,” said Mr. O’Reilly, producer of the Web 2.0 Summit, a high-profile industry conference. “Now Google has an incredibly audacious goal. Great companies do come from big ideas and people who are willing to go after really big ideas.”It is the combination of Google’s economic power and its unbounded ambition that strikes fear in industry leaders in the world of technology, and beyond, in advertising, media and telecommunications. In part that is because Google wields power more subtly, and perhaps more effectively, than other big companies ever have.For instance, this year Google rattled some of the biggest players in the telecommunications industry. The company played an important role in persuading the Federal Communications Commission to impose “open access” conditions on an auction for a portion of the nation’s airwaves. The conditions require that any network using those airwaves allow any phone and any software to run on it. Such a rule breaks the established business model of the cellphone industry, where carriers have significant control over what phones their customers can use.Google backed its lobbying for the conditions with the promise to bid at least $4.6 billion, the minimum price set by regulators for the spectrum. Google then bid that amount, not with the intention of winning, but simply to force the open-access conditions. Verizon Wireless ultimately won rights to the spectrum.“They just wanted to saddle a potential competitor with those obligations,” said Scott Cleland, a telecommunications analyst and frequent Google critic.Some lawmakers even said Google’s role amounted to “gaming the system.” Google disputes that accusation, saying it risked its own capital in the auction. Both Google and the F.C.C. said the conditions would benefit consumers.“Google has thought very strategically about having to impact the market without necessarily spending a lot of money,” Mr. Yoffie said. “It pays to be clever.”He saw the same strategy at work in the Microsoft-Yahoo deal. “They played spoiler by giving the Yahoo board confidence that they had a viable economic solution if they turned down the Microsoft offer,” Mr. Yoffie said.As Google’s clout grows, the company may encounter the same antitrust scrutiny that hobbled Microsoft. Regulators in the United States and Europe investigated Google’s merger with DoubleClick for nearly a year before approving it. The Justice Department has already begun asking questions about the antitrust implications in the possible partnership between Google and Yahoo. Yet it was little more a year ago that Mr. Ballmer described Google as a one-trick pony in a speech to business school students at Google’s birthplace, Stanford.That remains largely true today. The search ads, as well as similar text ads that Google places on tens of thousands of partner Web sites, still drive the overwhelming majority of the company’s revenue. But it is a one-trick pony with the speed and surefootedness of Secretariat.Google’s dominance of the search advertising business is overwhelming. In March, Google accounted for almost 60 percent of all searches in the United States, according to comScore. That was nearly triple Yahoo’s share of 21.3 percent, and more than six times Microsoft’s 9.4 percent share. In some European countries, Google’s dominance is even larger.The search advertising business has proved so profitable, that it has allowed Google to make large investments in a long string of other businesses. Few of them make much money now, but analysts say that many of them may some day turn into very profitable enterprises.Google is now the dominant player in online video after its 2006 acquisition of YouTube; it has begun offering, mostly free, a suite of e-mail, word processing, spreadsheet and other programs that compete with two of Microsoft’s cash cows, Office and Exchange; it is building software for mobile phones that later this year may compete with Apple’s iPhone and others; it has begun selling advertisements on television, radio and newspapers; and with its acquisition of DoubleClick this year, it is going after the market for online banners and graphical ads, which is Yahoo’s bread and butter.Google’s success is not preordained. The company has yet to prove it can make money in any of these markets beyond online text ads. Even in graphical advertisements online — the banners, video ads and social network ads, that marketers use to create brand awareness — Google remains a relatively small player. It is an important market that is expected to some day match the search advertising business in size.“Search is great, but you can’t advertise Coca-Cola in search,” said Peter Sealey, a former chief marketing officer at the Coca-Cola Company. “Google is going to try to compete there, but they don’t have the same algorithm that they had in search.”'"

"'08-05-06,'1','Shares of Marvel Entertainment, the comic book publisher, soared on Monday after “Iron Man,” its first self-produced film, raked in more than $100 million in ticket sales over the weekend.The company, which reported a first-quarter profit above market estimates and raised its 2008 outlook on Monday, also unveiled plans to release a sequel, and three other films in 2010 and 2011.Ticket sales for “Iron Man” exceeded expectations of an opening in the $70 million to $80 million range for the three-day period beginning on Friday.The film had the second-biggest opening for a nonsequel ever, according to Media by Numbers, a provider of box-office data. The first was “Spider-Man.”Marvel stock rose more than 9 percent, closing at $33.10, on the New York Stock Exchange.First-quarter net income for Marvel was $45.2 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with $46.8 million, or 54 cents a share, in the period a year ago.The company also raised its earnings outlook range by 5 cents a share, to $1.35 to $1.55 a share.'"
"'08-05-06,'1','Microsoft had raised its initial bid to $33 a share when Mr. Yang and his co-founder, David Filo, met with Mr. Ballmer and other Microsoft executives at the Seattle airport on Saturday. After that meeting, Mr. Ballmer made public a letter to Mr. Yang withdrawing the offer. “I am disappointed that Yahoo has not moved towards accepting our offer,” he wrote.In the interview Monday, Mr. Yang and Roy Bostock, Yahoo’s chairman, said that throughout the process they were open and receptive to a merger with Microsoft. Mr. Yang said that he spent personal time alone with Mr. Ballmer but that they were ultimately unable to bridge their differences.Mr. Yang also looked ahead to the daunting task of guiding Yahoo’s growth as an independent company — under heavy scrutiny. Mr. Yang — who last June took control of the company he co-founded, acting after the departure of the prior chief, Terry Semel — must now quickly demonstrate that Yahoo can increase its revenues and share price while navigating an online advertising industry that is quickly coming to be dominated by Google.“I feel like we now have the task to continue to build shareholder value,” he said. “This is just creating another set of challenges we have to overcome as a company. We have to show the world the opportunity that we have been talking about for the last three months.”One immediate problem for Mr. Yang is frustration among shareholders — including some of the largest ones. In reaction to the deal’s collapse, Yahoo’s stock fell almost 15 percent on Monday, to $24.47.“I am extremely angry at Jerry Yang and at the so-called independent board,” said Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager for Capital Research Global Investors, which owns 6 percent of Yahoo. The firm’s parent company owns a total of 16 percent of Yahoo, making it the largest shareholder.Mr. Crawford questioned a statement from Mr. Bostock in which he said the company was pleased that so many shareholders had supported its position.“I would love to know who these shareholders are,” Mr. Crawford said. “It’s none of the ones that I talked to today. Everybody I talked to would have sold their stock at $34.”“I’m hoping that there is such an outpouring of outrage that the board is embarrassed into revisiting this thing,” Mr. Crawford added, “but I’m not optimistic about that.”Making Mr. Yang’s job even harder is the recession’s effect on the online advertising market and intense day-to-day scrutiny from Wall Street analysts and shareholders, who will view any more vague long-term plans from Yahoo’s management team with skepticism.“Yahoo is now in a position where it has to prove its worth quickly,” said Derek Brown, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald & Company. “It’s as if there are many things happening behind the scenes that have given Yahoo management so much confidence. We need to see what those things are.”Mr. Yang argued that the Microsoft bid had opened up new doors for Yahoo. “We feel Microsoft approaching us has created an opportunity for us to talk to just about anybody and everybody in the industry,” he said. He said the company would do new deals “in a way that ensures that it’s the right thing to do for Yahoo, and not because of some time pressure.”One of those deals could be a tie-up with its chief rival, Google. In April, Yahoo conducted a two-week advertising test with Google, whereby Google served up its own more lucrative ads on 3 percent of Yahoo searches in the United States. The companies said the trial was successful and that they were exploring an extension of it, though some analysts say that could raise antitrust issues in Washington.“Anything we might do with Google would allow us to maintain the ability to compete in what is important to us,” Mr. Yang said. He declined to say whether Yahoo would pursue such a deal.Christa Quarles, an analyst at Thomas Weisel, said a deal with Google could have the long-term effect of strengthening Yahoo’s largest rival. “At the end of it you wouldn’t have an alternative to Google,” Ms. Quarles said. “It would be thrust into the very powerful position of being the only real provisioner of paid search.”Yahoo might also consider tie-ups with AOL, a division of Time Warner, and MySpace, a division of News Corporation, though shareholders and analysts seem unenthusiastic about those options. Mr. Yang would not address speculation about those deals.He did want to address what he said was a misconception: that Yahoo executives celebrated the news of Microsoft’s withdrawal and viewed it as a victory. “I was not witness to any celebration, and we do not consider it a victory. I would have been personally very happy to do a deal with Microsoft,” he said.Mr. Yang is now left without that deal — at least if Microsoft is serious about going in another direction and closing this chapter in its history.At the very least, Mr. Yang has impressed some in the industry with his gumption in rejecting the most highly capitalized technology company on the planet.“It’s pretty bold to turn down a 70 percent premium,” said Peter Falvey, managing director at Revolution Partners, a technology investment bank. “Long term, do I think he should have taken it? Yes, I do. But he’s obviously got guts.”'"

"'08-05-06,'1','When humans engage in highly strenuous exercise day after day, they start to metabolize the body’s reserves, depleting glycogen and fat stores. When cells run out of energy, a result is fatigue, and exercise grinds to a halt until those sources are replenished.Dogs are different, in particular the sled dogs that run the annual Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in Alaska. This is a grueling 1,100-mile race, and studies show that the dogs somehow change their metabolism during the race.Dr. Michael S. Davis, an associate professor of veterinary physiology at Oklahoma State University and an animal exercise researcher, said: “Before the race, the dogs’ metabolic makeup is similar to humans. Then suddenly they throw a switch — we don’t know what it is yet — that reverses all of that. In a 24-hour period, they go back to the same type of metabolic baseline you see in resting subjects. But it’s while they are running 100 miles a day.”Dr. Davis, who studied the sled dogs, found they did not chew up their reserves and avoided the worst aspects of fatigue. He is pursuing the research for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which gave him a $1.4 million grant in 2003 to study the physiology of fatigue resistance of sled dogs.Dr. Davis, who is teaming with researchers at Texas A&M in a $300,000 Darpa grant, awarded last fall, has been traveling to Alaska for years to learn why the sled dogs are “fatigue-proof.”“They have a hidden strategy that they can turn on,” he said. “We are confident that humans have the capacity for that strategy. We have to figure out how dogs are turning it on to turn it on in humans.”'"
"'08-05-06,'1','In “Noble Eagles, Nasty Pigeons, Biased Humans” (Basics, April 29), Natalie Angier does an incisive job of demonstrating how fickle we are in our perception of the behavior of nonhuman animals. One thing is certain: once we label an animal a pest, be it pigeons, coyotes or Canada geese, the creatures will be unmercifully hunted, poisoned or gassed. And worst of all, when we label them as livestock, we slaughter them by the millions.The most potent example of what Natalie Angier calls “biobigotry” against farmed animals isn’t that we use their names to lob as insults. It’s that our agricultural practices cause these animals tremendous pain and suffering — treatment that would be illegal if doled out to the equally sentient animals we pamper as pets.'"
"'08-05-06,'1','Research by Dr. Dukas and others has shown that insects deserve more respect. Dr. Dukas has found that the larvae of one of the all-time favorite lab animals, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, could learn to associate certain odors with food and other odors with predators.In another set of experiments, Dr. Dukas discovered that young male flies wasted a lot of time trying to court unreceptive females. It takes time to learn the signs of a receptive fly.Dr. Dukas hypothesizes that any animal with a nervous system can learn. Even in cases where scientists have failed to document learning in a species, he thinks they should not be too quick to rule it out. “Is it because I’m not a good teacher or because the animal doesn’t learn?” Dr. Dukas asked.Although learning may be widespread among animals, Dr. Dukas wonders why they bothered to evolve it in the first place. “You cannot just say that learning is an adaptation to a changing environment,” he said.It is possible to adapt to a changing environment without using a nervous system to learn. Bacteria can alter behavior to help their survival. If a microbe senses a toxin, it can swim away. If it senses a new food, it can switch genes on and off to alter its metabolism.“A genetic network like the one in E. coli is amazingly good in changing environments,” Dr. Dukas said.Learning also turns out to have dangerous side effects that make its evolution even more puzzling. Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues have produced striking evidence for these side effects by studying flies as they evolve into better learners in the lab.To produce smarter flies, the researchers present the insects with a choice of orange or pineapple jelly to eat. Both smell delicious to the insect. But the flies that land on the orange jelly discover that it is spiked with bitter-tasting quinine. The flies have three hours to learn that the nice odor of oranges is followed by a nasty taste.To test the flies, the scientists then present them with two plates of jelly, one orange and one pineapple. This time, neither has quinine. The flies settle on both plates of jelly, feed, and the females lay their eggs.“The flies that remember they had a bad experience with orange should continue to avoid orange and go to the pineapple,” Dr. Kawecki said.Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues collect the eggs from the quinine-free pineapple jelly and use them to produce the next generation of flies. The scientists repeat the procedure on the new flies, except that the pineapple jelly is spiked with quinine instead of the orange.It takes just 15 generations under these conditions for the flies to become genetically programmed to learn better. At the beginning of the experiment, the flies take many hours to learn the difference between the normal and quinine-spiked jellies. The fast-learning strain of flies needs less than an hour.But the flies pay a price for fast learning. Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues pitted smart fly larvae against a different strain of flies, mixing the insects and giving them a meager supply of yeast to see who would survive. The scientists then ran the same experiment, but with the ordinary relatives of the smart flies competing against the new strain. About half the smart flies survived; 80 percent of the ordinary flies did.Reversing the experiment showed that being smart does not ensure survival. “We took some population of flies and kept them over 30 generations on really poor food so they adapted so they could develop better on it,” Dr. Kawecki said. “And then we asked what happened to the learning ability. It went down.”The ability to learn does not just harm the flies in their youth, though. In a paper to be published in the journal Evolution, Dr. Kawecki and his colleagues report that their fast-learning flies live on average 15 percent shorter lives than flies that had not experienced selection on the quinine-spiked jelly. Flies that have undergone selection for long life were up to 40 percent worse at learning than ordinary flies.“We don’t know what the mechanism of this is,” Dr. Kawecki said.One clue comes from another experiment, in which he and his colleagues found that the very act of learning takes a toll. The scientists trained some fast-learning flies to associate an odor with powerful vibrations. “These flies died about 20 percent faster than flies with the same genes, but which were not forced to learn,” he said.Forming neuron connections may cause harmful side effects. It is also possible that genes that allow learning to develop faster and last longer may cause other changes.“We use computers with memory that’s almost free, but biological information is costly,” Dr. Dukas said. He added that the costs Dr. Kawecki documented were not smart animals’ only penalties. “It means you start out in life being inexperienced,” Dr. Dukas said.When birds leave the nest, they need time to learn to find food and avoid predators. As a result, they are more likely to starve or be killed.Dr. Dukas argues that learning evolves to higher levels only when it is a better way to respond to the environment than relying on automatic responses.“It’s good when you want to rely on information that’s unique to a time and place,” Dr. Dukas said. Some bee species, for example, feed on a single flower species. They can find plenty of nectar using automatic cues. Other bees are adapted to many different flowers, each with a different shape and a different flowering time. Learning may be a better strategy in such cases.Scientists have carried out few studies to test this idea. One study, published this year by scientists at the University of London, showed that fast-learning colonies of bumblebees collected up to 40 percent more nectar than slower colonies.Dr. Kawecki suspects that each species evolves until it reaches an equilibrium between the costs and benefits of learning. His experiments demonstrate that flies have the genetic potential to become significantly smarter in the wild. But only under his lab conditions does evolution actually move in that direction. In nature, any improvement in learning would cost too much.Dr. Kawecki and Dr. Dukas agree that scientists need to pinpoint the tradeoffs, and they will have to gauge the role of learning in the lives of many species. As their own knowledge increases, they will understand more about humans’ gift for learning.“Humans have gone to the extreme,” said Dr. Dukas, both in the ability of our species to learn and in the cost for that ability.Humans’ oversize brains require 20 percent of all the calories burned at rest. A newborn’s brain is so big that it can create serious risks for mother and child at birth. Yet newborns know so little that they are entirely helpless. It takes many years for humans to learn enough to live on their own.Dr. Kawecki says it is worth investigating whether humans also pay hidden costs for extreme learning. “We could speculate that some diseases are a byproduct of intelligence,” he said.The benefits of learning must have been enormous for evolution to have overcome those costs, Dr. Kawecki argues. For many animals, learning mainly offers a benefit in finding food or a mate. But humans also live in complex societies where learning has benefits, as well.“If you’re using your intelligence to outsmart your group, then there’s an arms race,” Dr. Kawecki said. “So there’s no absolute optimal level. You just have to be smarter than the others.”'"
"'08-05-06,'1','Critics of the Pengzhou plan said in interviews on Monday that the government had not done proper environmental reviews of the project, which could pollute the air and water and lead to health hazards.“We’re not dissidents,” said Wen Di, an independent blogger and former journalist living in Chengdu. “We’re just people who care about our homeland. What we’re saying is that if you want to have this project, you need to follow certain procedures: for example, a public hearing and independent environmental assessment. We want a fair and open process.”Fan Xiao, an environmental advocate who is a geologist with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Chengdu, sent out a mass cellphone message that had been written by one of the movement’s leaders and was being widely circulated across the country. “Protect our Chengdu, safeguard our homeland,” it said. “Stay away from the threat of pollution. Restore the clear water and green mountains of Sichuan.”In an interview, Mr. Fan said, “People have been hoping this issue would get more attention.”The protest captured the national spotlight on Monday when it was reported in The Beijing News, a newspaper that is popular with intellectuals and sometimes reports on issues that other state-run publications do not mention.The plant is a joint venture of the Sichuan provincial government and PetroChina, the publicly traded subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the country’s main oil producer. Approved last year, the plant is expected to produce 800,000 tons of ethylene and refine 10 million tons of crude oil a year, according to a Web site set up by the Pengzhou city government. Ethylene is widely used in the production of goods like packaging and trash liners.Repeated calls to the joint venture company, PetroChina Sichuan Petrochem Industry, went unanswered. The project’s Web site said that $565 million of the total investment would be dedicated to environmental protection.The march appears to have put government officials on the defensive. A brief front-page article arguing the merits of the project appeared Monday in a state-controlled newspaper, Chengdu Business News. The article said the project had been approved by the National Development and Reform Commission as part of a long-term plan to expand the country’s refining industry.“The Sichuan refinery project will install advanced equipment and improve environmental protection facilities with strict pollution prevention,” the article said.Police officials in Chengdu, reached by telephone, declined to comment on the march.Rural protests by farmers have taken place for years, sometimes prompting heavy-handed suppression. Civil action by wealthier urban residents are still relatively rare, but the movement in Chengdu is at least the third widely publicized groundswell in the past year.Construction of a Taiwanese-financed chemical plant outside the city of Xiamen, a port in Fujian Province, was halted last year after thousands of residents held street protests. Last winter, residents in Shanghai protested construction of an extension to the high-speed rail line called the Maglev, forcing officials to put that project on hold as well.In each of those cases, residents complained that the project was situated too close to a major population center and had received only cursory environmental review despite serious environmental and health risks. The protests in Xiamen and Shanghai got prominent attention on Web sites and in the Chinese news media, which, despite state control, have sometimes encouraged more public participation in environmental issues.Protest organizers in each city appear to have no formal links, but they have formed a tight-knit blogging network that they use to trade ideas in an online world that the police, particularly at the local level, have trouble trying to control.One outspoken critic of the Chengdu project posts regularly on one site that is frequented by Lian Yue, a blogger who was instrumental in organizing the Xiamen protests.“We’re definitely inspired by the events in Xiamen and Shanghai,” said the critic, who asked to be identified only by her family name, Wu, because she said she worried about attracting the attention of the authorities.“Chengdu is in a basin,” she said. “If there’s a chemical plant there, it’ll bring pollutants. Also, Pengzhou is upstream from Chengdu, and the river provides the city’s drinking water.”On Sunday night and Monday, a flurry of messages and photos from protesters excited by the march appeared across the Internet. One person calling himself Devil Xiaomi seemed to sum up the complaints of Chengdu residents.“What Chengdu people demand is very simple,” he said. “This is a policy closely related to people’s interests, so why was it not open to the public?”'"
"'08-05-06,'1','Crude oil futures briefly surged over $120 a barrel on Monday, raising concerns about higher prices for gasoline, and other goods and services.Though retail gas prices fell more than a cent over the weekend, the advance in oil prices increased the chances that prices at the pump would resume rising.Supply threats over the weekend in Nigeria sent oil for June delivery to an intraday high of $120.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a new record, before retreating to settle at $119.97, up $3.65. Gasoline futures rose 8.65 cents, to $3.0529 a gallon.The sharp rise in oil prices has sent gasoline prices high enough to prompt some prospective travelers to modify vacation plans.The average retail price of a gallon of regular gas nationwide slipped to $3.611 on Monday, down 1.1 cents from Friday, according to AAA, the automobile club, and the Oil Price Information Service. Prices reached a record $3.623 a gallon last Thursday.But a spokesman for AAA, Troy Green, said that if oil prices resumed climbing, regular gasoline could rise as high as $3.75 a gallon nationwide. And he said that “in some places, it’s already above $4 a gallon.”'"

"'08-05-07,'0','In “Battle for Haditha,” the British filmmaker Nick Broomfield revisits a wretched chapter of the war in Iraq. On Nov. 19, 2005, marines stationed in Haditha, a Euphrates River valley city northwest of Baghdad, killed 24 Iraqi civilians, including at least 10 women and children, from toddler age up, who were in their homes. The reasons for the killings remain in dispute, though not this evidence: most victims died from close-range gunfire and at least five were shot in the head. After various investigations, murder charges against four marines were dropped; one still faces reduced charges.Although Mr. Broomfield has made his name with spiky, pugnaciously personal documentaries like “Biggie and Tupac” and “Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer,” this new film is a dramatization, complete with actors and a semblance of a screenplay. Shot in Jordan with mostly nonprofessional performers, including several former marines who fought in Iraq (including in Falluja) and many more Iraqi war refugees, the film is located at the familiar intersection of nonfiction and fiction, where raw documentary grit receives an imaginary glaze. The Middle East dust in this film looks chokingly authentic because, much like the prostrated Iraqi women keening over their dead and much like the battle scar that runs along one marine’s upper leg like a zipper, it is.That scar belongs to Corporal Ramirez (Elliot Ruiz, a former Marine corporal turned actor), a brutalized young squad leader who’s trying to protect his men and his own increasingly besieged mind. (Corporal Ramirez has been based on Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich, the enlisted marine who was the squad leader during the Haditha massacre, though it’s unclear how much the character owes to the real man.) The movie, which was shot in good-looking if not the glossiest digital video (the trace of digital artifacts adds to the documentary vibe), opens with a succession of young men addressing the camera with varying degrees of cynicism and confusion, voicing the same question that is repeatedly intoned back home: Why are we here?Mr. Broomfield doesn’t presume to know the answer to that question. Somewhat surprisingly, given how subjective his documentaries skew, “Battle for Haditha” isn’t a jeremiad against the war, the American administration or even the quick-triggered marines. Rather, with dry-eyed intelligence, he takes the killings at Haditha and returns the incident to the historical moment from which it has been removed by politics and propaganda. He points fingers, suggests reasons and explores rationales, showing sympathy for the war-ravaged marines without letting them off the hook. He introduces the insurgents who planted the bomb that killed a marine, apparently precipitating the massacre by the dead man’s squad. And then with sickening realism, he shows how those innocent Iraqis, caught between the insurgents and the marines, died.Even as he creates an almost unbearable level of tension in his film — mostly through deft parallel editing that draws the marines, the victims and the insurgents inexorably together — Mr. Broomfield maintains a level of cool detachment throughout. That’s to the good of the movie, which, though technically exemplary, falters dramatically on occasion, becoming dangerously close to overheated whenever the characters speak for any length. The performers apparently did a fair amount of improvisation, and too often their talk veers into exposition, which, however heartfelt and true, paradoxically sounds (badly) scripted. At times there is a kind of therapeutic quality to the entire enterprise, almost as if the marines, the Iraqis and Mr. Broomfield were collectively trying to work through a nightmare from which none have awakened.Directed by Nick Broomfield; written (in English and Arabic, with English subtitles) by Mr. Broomfield, Marc Hoeferlin and Anna Telford; director of photography, Mark Wolf; edited by Stuart Gazzard and Ash Jenkins; produced by Mr. Broomfield and Ms. Telford. At Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','A late Wednesday afternoon tumble sent the stock markets to their worst session in nearly a month, as a swirl of unsettling financial and economic news unnerved investors who had enjoyed several weeks of relative calm after the winter’s tumult.The Dow Jones industrials had nearly broken even for the year after being down more than 10 percent. But the charts took a vertical swoon just after 2 p.m. on Wednesday as shares of banks and financial services firms plummeted, with the mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Countrywide Financial, trading down more than 5 percent.The Dow gave up 206.48 points to 12,814.35, after spending much of the day ambling through negative territory.

"'08-05-07,'0','“Railroad Bridge” proved a wise long-term investment for the Nahmad family, dealers with galleries in New York and London who were the sellers. They bought the painting in 1988 at Christie’s in London for $12.6 million, which was at the time the second-highest price ever paid at auction for a Monet. (A few months earlier, his 1876 “In the Prairie” had sold for $22.5 million at Sotheby’s.)Such prices looked like bargains on Tuesday as sculpture was catapulted into a new sphere. The Christie’s sale included some stunning sculptures, a corner of the market that had been undervalued recently by comparison with top paintings, and they were the focus of the most competitive bidding.Included were a rare group of works by Giacometti. The grandest among them, “Standing Woman II,” a 1960 bronze of an elongated woman — she stands nearly nine feet — went for $27.4 million, a record price for the artist. Christie’s had thought it would bring $18 million, but there were seven serious bidders. Andrea Crane of the Gagosian Gallery submitted the winning bid but declined to say whether she was buying for the gallery or a client. An earlier Giacometti sculpture, “City Square II,” consisting of five attenuated walking figures men and a solitary woman, was sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $14.6 million. Christie’s had estimated that it would bring $12 million. Conceived in 1948 and cast the following year, it was being sold by the family of Vera List, the philanthropist and collector who died in 2002. Ms. List’s family bought it from the Pierre Matisse Gallery in 1962.An even earlier Giacometti, “Man (Apollo),” a 1929 male figure carved in plaster within an open geometric framework, was the first lot in the sale. Six bidders went for the sculpture, which brought nearly three times its $1.2 million high estimate, selling to Franck Giraud, a Manhattan dealer for $3.6 million. Mr. Giraud said he was buying the sculpture for an American collector whom he declined to identify. (Final prices include the commission to Christie’s: 25 percent of the first $20,000, 20 percent of the next $20,000 to $500,000, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)Monumental sculptures also brought surprising prices. “Eve, the Large Version,” a five-foot-tall Rodin bronze of a woman with folded arms hiding her face in shame, sold for $18.9 million, a record price for the artist. Conceived in 1881 and cast in 1887, it had been expected to bring $9 million to $12 million.Laurence Graff, the London-based jeweler, sat in the front row and was seen buying two sculptures by Henry Moore: “Family Group,” a nearly 18-inch-high bronze of a family of four for $4 million, just above its $3.5 million estimate, and “Working Model for Reclining Figure: Angles” (1975-77), for which he paid $3.2 million, in line with its high estimate.“Portrait with a Blue Coat,” a 1935 Matisse, was also a winner. A portrait of Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant and frequent model, in a fur stole and pearls, sold to a telephone bidder for $22.4 million, well above its $17 million estimate.Miró’s “Caress of the Stars” (1938), which shows the artist’s familiar grotesque abstract figures against a galaxy of menacing tentacular stars, brought $17 million. The painting, which experts link to the artist’s preoccupation with the civil strife in Spain, sold for $11.7 million at Christie’s in 2004. Christie’s had estimated it would sell for $12 million to $16 million on Tuesday night.“Anita en Almée” (1908), a sexually charged painting by Kees Van Dongen of a topless woman with veils whose title invokes the Near Eastern “almah,” or belly dancer, failed to sell. It had been expected to go for $12 million to $16 million.A Venice scene painted by Monet in 1908 also had no takers. It had been estimated to fetch $8 million to $12 million.As the crowds milled outside of Christie’s after the sale, dealers and collectors were visibly relieved that the money is still out there for the right art.“It was a bit like playing the lottery — you just don’t know if it’s your night,” said James Roundell, a London dealer. “It’s hit or miss.”'"
"'08-05-07,'0','CHICAGO (AP) — Sara Lee posted an 82 percent increase in third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, crediting higher sales prices and the weak dollar.But soaring commodity prices limited the gains and disappointed Wall Street, and the company said earnings and revenue in the 2008 fiscal year would also come in below expectations.Sara Lee, which makes Jimmy Dean sausages, Hillshire Farm deli meats and its namesake breads, reported a 10 percent increase in revenue, led by strong international sales. But the results, including net earnings of $211 million, fell short of analyst estimates.Shares in the company, based in Downers Grove, Ill., fell 90 cents, or 6 percent, to $13.86.Earnings for the January-March period amounted to 30 cents a share and were up from $116 million, or 16 cents a share, a year ago. Adjusted earnings rose to 22 cents a share, from 13 cents a share, but were 2 cents below the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.Revenue increased to $3.24 billion from $2.94 billion, led by international sales, which leaped 18 percent compared with a 4 percent gain in North America. Sara Lee said that for the 2008 fiscal year it expected adjusted earnings of 95 cents to 99 cents a share, excluding 18 cents a share received in the first quarter from the 1999 sale of its tobacco business. Analysts had estimated full-year adjusted earnings of $1 a share.Sara Lee sold its low-profit Mexican meats joint venture in the quarter and also announced recently that it was eliminating about 300 jobs, or around 1 percent of its North American work force.'"

"'08-05-07,'0','After years of warnings, and a spell of hot weather that did nothing to improve the stink of tons of uncollected trash around Naples, the European Commission filed suit against Italy on Tuesday, charging that it had failed to meet its obligation to collect and dispose of its rubbish.“The piles of uncollected rubbish in the streets of Campania graphically illustrate the threat to the environment and human health that results when waste management is inadequate,” Stavros Dimas, the European Union’s environment commissioner, said in Brussels, referring to the southern region around Naples. “Italy needs to give priority to putting in place effective waste management plans.”The suit, filed before the European Court of Justice, is aimed at pressing Italy to take more serious action against a problem that has enraged southerners, embarrassed national pride and influenced recent national elections. If the court rules against it, Italy could face substantial fines, more than a dozen years after Naples faced the first of its regular trash crises.During the campaign for an election he won last month, the prime minister-elect, Silvio Berlusconi, repeatedly promised to finally clean up the mess — and the court case may prove an early challenge to his new center-right government. To show his determination, Mr. Berlusconi, about to begin his third term as prime minister, has said he will hold his first cabinet meeting in Naples and visit three times a week until the crisis is resolved.But, over many years, the problem has been difficult to tackle, in part because politicians have been reluctant to take on the organized-crime groups that have dumped refuse — some of it toxic — for many years.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','The N.C.A.A. punished 218 teams Tuesday, handing out sanctions that ranged from warnings to reductions in the amount of practice time, to push those programs focus on academics. According to Myles Brand, the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the biggest disappointment came in men’s basketball, which had eight teams from Bowl Championship Series leagues penalized, including U.S.C., Kansas State, Tennessee and Purdue.The men’s basketball overall score was 906, well below the expected minimum of 925, which is the approximate equal of a 60 percent graduation rate.Over all, however, the numbers showed progress virtually across the board, and Brand praised his academic reform movement by saying there has been “measurable progress.”But the grimmest news of the day came from the 26 programs that received stiff penalties and a warning that they could be barred from postseason play next year if they do not improve their scores. Those included the football programs at Temple and San Jose State and the basketball programs at Centenary, New Mexico State and East Carolina.For a program like Temple, however, the release of Tuesday’s numbers did not elicit gloom and doom. The Owls lost two football scholarships because of historical penalties, but Temple Athletic Director Bill Bradshaw said he was braced for their academic turnaround to become a feel-good story. Since Al Golden took over as football coach in 2006, Bradshaw said the university had invested nearly $500,000 in a “complete overhaul” of its academic support system.Bradshaw pointed out that Golden’s first recruiting class had an score of 980 in the progress report, and that this year’s class projected to a score of 975, both easily surpassing the 925 threshold.“All of us at Temple football are proud to say that we have been a part of the greatest academic turnaround in the A.P.R. reform era,” Golden said in a statement. “We inherited a liability and in just a short 29 months made it our single greatest asset.”But that turnaround cost money, which is the struggle for colleges outside major conferences that lack the cash flow from ticket sales and television revenue of bigger programs.“When the A.P.R. first was introduced, I think all of our schools took it to heart and put in plans to face it and to fight it,” said Karl Benson, the commissioner of the Western Athletic Conference. “But I know that we may not have had the same resources that others have had.”He added: “I don’t think it’s a fairness issue. I think we have to recognize the difference and disparity that exist.”'"

All have pleaded guilty.He was sentenced by Judge Denny Chin of United States District Court in Manhattan, who accepted most of a pre-sentencing report that recommended probation.Mr. Okada was involved in using stock recommendations by analysts at UBS, the Swiss bank, before they were made public, to execute hundreds of trades and net more than $17.5 million, an assistant United States attorney, Andrew Fish, said at an earlier hearing.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','By the time Mr. Novak spoke, though, bloggers, reporters and NBC itself were already telling of the collapse of Eight Belles, who broke down after finishing second and was euthanized.Online commenters pilloried Yum for its seeming insensitivity.“Based on the YUM reps’ disgraceful smiling and product plugging — while Eight Belles was dying yards away from them — I’ll never buy ANY of their products again,” wrote one.“I’m happy that the CEO of Yum is just smiling and not even caring that a horse was just killed on the track,” wrote another.Bob Costas of NBC said he told Mr. Novak and others gathered at the winner’s circle of Eight Belles’ fate. But Mr. Blum said that Mr. Novak had no idea a horse was dying.“If he knew then what he knows now, he never would have made the comment we did,” Mr. Blum said Tuesday.It was about 20 minutes later, after Mr. Blum and Mr. Novak had picked their way back through the crowd to Yum’s suite, that they learned what had happened. By then, it was too late. Yumwas hoping for a brand lift from the race, but instead found itself on the defensive. The company is in the third year of a Derby sponsorship, which gives it signs at the track and seven commercials during the broadcast. Yum started the sponsorship to attract more individual shareholders, who make up 23 percent of its stockholders, Mr. Blum said. Yum wants to increase that by 2 to 3 percentage points, he added.Yum executives thought the Derby, with its high-net-worth viewers, would be a good place for marketing. A bonus was that Yum’s headquarters are in Louisville, Ky., home to the racetrack. “The sponsorship’s a natural,” Mr. Blum said.In the first year of the sponsorship, 2006, another horse’s fatal injury cast a shadow on the sport. However, Barbaro died in January 2007, because of an injury suffered at the Preakness Stakes two weeks after winning the Derby. Yum reacted by offering a $1 million prize in the 2007 Derby to any horse that could beat Barbaro’s 6 ½-length victory. Mr. Blum said the company had not discussed a similar program commemorating Eight Belles.At the awards ceremony Saturday, Yum, the presenting sponsor, was joined by Visa, a longtime sponsor of the event, and by United Parcel Service, which sponsored Big Brown, the winning horse.Visa, which used to back all three Triple Crown races, reduced its sponsorship to only the Derby in 2006. The company said the change was meant to reflect the shift in Visa’s marketing message from breadth (“It’s Everywhere You Want to Be”) to experiences (“Life Takes Visa”). The idea is to give its high-end Visa Signature cardholders access to events like paddock tours and grandstand tickets at the Derby; the current sponsorship runs through 2010.The U.P.S. sponsorship came about through Big Brown’s co-owner, Paul Pompa Jr., who ran a trucking company, renewed a contract with UPS Freight in 2007 and named his new horse after the company.For U.P.S., whose main air hub is located in Louisville, the sponsorship was serendipitous. “This really just kind of fell onto our plates, and we were very excited to take advantage of the opportunity,” said John Flick, a U.P.S. spokesman. The company’s logo was on the jockey’s clothing, the U.P.S. chairman walked the horse to his stall, and U.P.S. had a presence in the winner’s circle.“The folks in the winner’s circle were unaware of what was going on,” Mr. Flick said. “The events with Eight Belles were quite sad — that’s not the way you want to celebrate your win.”Sports marketing executives said they doubted that Eight Belles’ death would damp enthusiasm for sponsorships. After the Nascar driver Dale Earnhardt died in a crash in 2001, all the big sponsors stayed on board.These sports “draw such tremendous audiences,” said Ray Schultz, the editorial director of Penton Media’s business group, which publishes Promo magazine. “You can write in a lot of contractual protection, but in the end, you have to know there’s a risk factor and you could be tarred with it.”'"
"'08-05-07,'0','According to some experts, it was not surprising that the officials’ recollection of the play was not perfect.“We know that in the course of even a single minute, when you’re getting distracted by all the noise in the crowd, the emotion, the discussion of what the rulebook says to do, most of the short-term memory gets emptied out,” said David Meyer, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan. “It’s sort of like what happens at a crime scene where we know that eyewitness accounts of what happened are greatly altered by emotion.”And it does not take long after an event for one’s memory to begin to fade. “Distortions start to creep in when more than a tenth of a second is allowed to pass,” Meyer said.Marc Wittman, a neuropsychologist and time researcher at the University of California-San Diego, said it was unusual for the officials to underestimate the duration of time in such a situation. “In this case, it’s difficult because the referees were not explicitly paying attention to time,” he said. “They, of course, relied on the clock to signal when time is up. But they had to rely on their memory contents. And we know from lab testing that the more that happens, in retrospect, the longer the duration seems to have lasted.”Meyer added that officiating a professional basketball game presents several confounding factors. Most important, he cited the pressure of following a fast-paced game surrounded by screaming fans and coaches who might question almost every decision. That the officials were running down the court also affected their perception.“What they’re going to do is end up guessing about how much time passed,” Meyer said. “They’ll ask themselves: ‘How long does it take to make that pass?’ and ‘How long does it take to set up for a shot?’ They’re doing some mental simulation.”The league statement did say that the officials “followed proper procedure in addressing the clock malfunction by estimating the elapsed time and using their judgment as to whether the shot was taken in time.”The statement also said the use of video replay for those kinds of situations would be discussed when the league’s competition committee meets at the end of the month. Until then, officials will continue to rely on their internal clocks to function when the arena clocks do not.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','President Bush on Tuesday submitted three new nominees to the Federal Election Commission, a move that could help end a political impasse that has left the agency paralyzed in the midst of a heated presidential campaign.The regulatory agency, which monitors compliance with federal election laws, for months has had only two commissioners out of a usual complement of six, leaving it without a quorum and powerless to act on complaints, issue advisory opinions and police the record spending in this year’s presidential campaign.The standoff centered on objections by Senate Democrats to the nomination of Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans demanded that Mr. Spakovsky be voted on in a package with other nominees, something Democrats refused to do.The White House declined on Tuesday to withdraw Mr. Spakovsky’s nomination, but a spokeswoman, Emily Lawrimore, said Republican officials were now willing to allow each of the nominees to be voted upon separately.The commission is typically made up of three Democrats and three Republicans. To that end, Mr. Bush on Tuesday nominated Cynthia L. Bauerly, a Democrat and legislative director for Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York; Donald F. McGahn II, a lawyer for the National Republican Congressional Committee; and Caroline C. Hunter, a Republican and head of the Election Assistance Commission. He also said he would agree to hold over Ellen L. Weintraub, a sitting Democratic commissioner.But Mr. Bush declined to renominate David Mason, the current Republican chairman of the commission, a move that drew sharp criticism on Tuesday from Democrats and campaign finance watchdogs.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','And confronting the concerns of conservatives, Mr. McCain also defended his central role in a 2005 deal by a bipartisan group of senators, nicknamed the Gang of 14, that protected the rights of the minority party, Democrats at the time, to continue to filibuster judicial nominees. The truce is credited for avoiding bedlam in the Senate and lasting long enough for some conservative jurists to be appointed, among them Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.“It showed that serious differences can be handled in a serious way, without allowing Senate business to unravel in a chaos of partisan anger,” Mr. McCain said in his speech.But Mr. McCain’s participation in the agreement nonetheless angered some conservative leaders. One of them was James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family, who took note of Mr. McCain’s role in the Gang of 14 when he announced this year that he could not under any circumstances support Mr. McCain as the Republican nominee.Many conservatives see the courts as a bedrock counterweight to Democrats’ inroads on Capitol Hill and their efforts to retake the White House. And they fear that if Mr. McCain becomes president, he might use judicial appointments as a bargaining chip with a Democratic Congress for political compromises.Mr. McCain’s speech on Tuesday appeared to soothe at least some conservatives who had been wary of him, among them the Rev. Richard Land, an official with the Southern Baptist Convention, who said this year that Mr. McCain had to speak out in language that indicated there would be “no more Souters.” Mr. Land was referring to Justice David H. Souter, an appointee of the first President Bush who has been a disappointment to the right.Mr. Land, who acknowledged Tuesday in a brief telephone interview that Mr. McCain had not been his first or second choice for the Republican nomination, nonetheless said he was pleased by the speech.“If his template is Roberts and Alito,” Mr. Land said, “and a judicial restraint and judicial humility template, that’s a more positive and less personal way of saying ‘no more Souters.’ ”Bradford A. Berenson, a former associate White House counsel under former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, had a similar reaction in another telephone interview. “He succeeded very well if his goal was to get conservatives energized and excited about his candidacy,” said Mr. Berenson, who originally supported Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. “His speech was a well-articulated and orthodox endorsement of the philosophy of judicial restraint, which is really what conservatives want to hear.”But Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who has written extensively on judicial appointments, called Mr. McCain’s speech worthy of “Alice in Wonderland” and said that many conservative jurists were themselves “activist” judges. “They don’t consider themselves activists if they strike down a position of government that is in disagreement with their policy views,” Mr. Goldman said.Mr. McCain made his remarks on a day when he was competing for attention in a state riveted by the primary battle between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama — timing that could suggest he did not want the speech to draw notice among moderate Democrats and independents who would find his embrace of conservative judges distasteful, and whom he is wooing for November.Whatever the reason, Mr. McCain took particular aim in his remarks at Mr. Obama for his 2005 vote against Chief Justice Roberts.“Senator Obama in particular likes to talk up his background as a lecturer on law, and also as someone who can work across the aisle to get things done,” Mr. McCain said. “But when Judge Roberts was nominated, it seemed to bring out more the lecturer in Senator Obama than it did the guy who can get things done. He went right along with the partisan crowd, and was among the 22 senators to vote against this highly qualified nominee.”In short, Mr. McCain said, for Mr. Obama “nobody quite fits the bill except for an elite group of activist judges, lawyers and law professors who think they know wisdom when they see it — and they see it only in each other.”Mr. Obama’s campaign responded that Mr. McCain had “promised his conservative base four more years of out-of-touch judges.”'"
"'08-05-07,'0','“In the past, high prices could be offset by borrowing or making more money,” said Adam Robinson, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. “It’s really when you have the triple bite — a weaker economy, less access to credit, and higher prices — that you see the consumer recoil.”The high cost of fuel has become a major issue in the presidential race, with the Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, clashing over a summer waiver of the 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax.The gas tax holiday is supported by Senator Clinton and the presumptive Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, who have both said it would provide some relief in the summer driving season. Senator Obama calls the idea “pandering” and said that cutting the tax would spur more consumption, pushing prices back up.In its monthly report, the Energy Department projected that domestic petroleum consumption would decline by about 190,000 barrels a day this year, a result of the economic slowdown and high prices. That is a sharper drop than the 90,000-barrel-a-day decline projected by the department last month.After accounting for increased ethanol use, domestic consumption will fall by 330,000 barrels a day, or less than 1 percent of total gasoline demand. While limited, it would be the first annual decline in gasoline demand since 1991.The Energy Department expects oil prices to average $110 a barrel this year, about $9 more than its previous outlook.Despite these higher costs, global oil demand is still projected to rise by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, mostly because of growing consumption in China, the Middle East, Russia, Brazil and India.China alone will account for a third of the jump in consumption. In March, Chinese imports rose by 800,000 barrels a day, compared with levels a year earlier, a big increase that could mean China is filling its oil reserve needs before the start of the Olympic Games this summer.Oil supplies, meanwhile, continue to lag behind. After a drop in Nigerian output last month, production by OPEC nations fell 1 percent in April, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped an average of 32.1 million barrels a day last month, down 320,000 barrels from March, according to the survey of oil companies, producers and analysts.Nigerian production dropped by 160,000 barrels, to an average of 1.88 million barrels a day, the country’s lowest level since August 1999. The country’s output suffered from a strike by Exxon Mobil workers. Adding to these troubles, rebel militants have apparently resumed their attacks on oil companies in the Niger Delta, forcing Royal Dutch Shell to reduce production.As demand continues to outpace the growth in oil supplies, analysts expect little relief in prices. A shortfall in supplies over the next two years will probably send oil to $150 to $200 a barrel, Goldman Sachs said in a new report.Analysts’ forecasts for the price of gasoline over the next few years run as high as $7 a gallon.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','Might this be because there’s an absence of political engagement on the other side of the spectrum? I inquired first at Trafo, a city-financed theater and art gallery. The gallery recently organized a show by a Polish artist, Artur Zmijewski. (Mr. Zmijewski, among other things, made a video in which he touches up, or “refurbishes,” to use his word, the tattoo of a Polish Auschwitz survivor, perhaps Jewish, perhaps not.) The theater presented a Dutch troupe, Hotel Modern, which staged a performance about the Holocaust. Both events were sensitive, in complex ways, to issues of anti-Semitism.But, as Gyorgy Szabo, Trafo’s director, noted, the artists involved were foreigners, not Hungarians. “In the Hungarian arts community, we don’t have a tradition of confrontation,” he said. He obviously wasn’t thinking of Hungarica.He then harked back to the Communist days: “In the former era there was a social treaty that said you can have your privacy as an artist if you don’t touch on political issues.”Peter Gyorgy, a professor of media theory and an art critic here (he wrote admiringly in the leading Hungarian daily newspaper about Mr. Zmijewski’s show), nodded when he learned what Mr. Szabo had said. Like everyone, he acknowledged that anti-Semitism is more out in the open today.“Hungary is a deeply traumatized society since the First World War, and the Holocaust, of course,” Mr. Gyorgy said. “After the early years of Hungarian Communism, to be Jewish was one’s private affair. Then after Communism, in the early ’90s, when the multiparty system started, we missed our chance for a public discourse about this situation. Now there’s a confluence: the instability of the government, the hatred for the prime minister and the fact that Jewish culture has become more conspicuous. A new generation of Jews has emerged, which behaves like Jews.”He was talking especially about young Jews, not necessarily religious, but also not shy about identifying themselves culturally as Jews. “To be Jewish today is a question of one’s public culture,” Mr. Gyorgy went on. During the Communist era, he explained, many Jews grew up hardly knowing they were Jewish; he was among them. “Before, I was defined in a way I could influence,” Mr. Gyorgy said. “Now, as happened in Germany and Austria, that’s over. In today’s political atmosphere, there’s less space for autonomous self-definition. You are forced to address your own Jewishness, to see it as a problem.”Agoston Mraz, a young centrist-minded political analyst for the Hungarian think tank Nezopont, put it a little differently: “There is a new Jewish pluralism, and Jewish culture is flourishing in Budapest. And one result is that, while I myself don’t think there is such a clear increase in anti-Semitism, there is now the opportunity to be more explicit about it.”But this is only part of the story. Some months ago a French government bureaucrat named Jean-Pierre Frommer, hearing about efforts to protect the Jewish Ghetto district in Budapest, petitioned for signatures supporting the effort in an open letter to the news media in Hungary. He told a Hungarian literary journal that he was shocked when his gesture provoked anti-Semitic reactions, even though most Jews had long left the neighborhood for the 13th District or elsewhere.“The fate of something that is important to all of us is at stake,” Mr. Frommer told the journal, Elet es Irodalom. “What Hungarians should understand is that this is not just an issue for the Jews, but an issue for Budapest, for the country.” He was referring to preservation of the neighborhood.Except that Hungarians lobbying to preserve the Ghetto district insist that anti-Semitism hasn’t been a problem for their effort at all. To the contrary, they said the other day, the real trouble comes from developers, several of whom are Israelis, in cahoots with district politicians. It was coincidental, they maintained, that all the core members of their preservation group happen to be Jewish.One of them is Janos Ladanyi, a sociologist specializing in the Roma, or Gypsies. We met one morning at an outdoor cafe near the Buda Castle. He described two currents of Hungarian anti-Semitism, one cultural, the other political. Culturally speaking, “there is a general belief that anti-Semitism, or racism, is a denial of the right to be different,” he said. “In Hungary it is all right today if you behave as a religious Jew. The Ghetto is fine for that reason. It’s a distinct historical entity. But what is now being denied here is the notion that Jews, no matter how we behave, are the same as non-Jews. The problem comes when we say we are like them.”Maybe. The other day, at the Orthodox Synagogue in the Ghetto district, an Art Nouveau masterpiece from 1912, Gabor Zoltan, an elfin, 60-something guide who offered to show a visitor around, said that for the first time he could recall he was openly mocked on the street, not long ago, for wearing a yarmulke.A professor who often appears on television, and has never made an issue of being Jewish, said that recently a driver stopped to let him cross the street, then rolled down his car window to announce that ordinarily he would run over a Jew but, recognizing the professor, decided against it.The professor preferred not to be identified. So did a middle-aged Hungarian who has spent years investigating discrimination here. Lately he has been taken aback by his parents, whom he had never heard utter a word against Jews during the Communist years as he was growing up. Suddenly they’ve started to make little anti-Semitic remarks.Loyal Hungarians all, these unnerved people cautioned against overstating the problem, which, while pervading the culture, is nothing like discrimination against the Roma (as if that’s any consolation). They suggested anti-Semitism may be no worse here than in other eastern and central European countries. Tibor Frank, a Hungarian historian, described the situation in the context of longstanding prejudices that link Jews with national debacles like the Bolshevik revolt of 1919 and the years of Communist rule, when many leaders were Jewish. Today those associations have passed on to the troubled Socialists. “The Jewish issue,” he said, “is part of a larger reassessment of our history.”In any case, he added, as did many others, anti-Semitism has become a political issue exploited by the two main parties now that the ruling coalition has split up and the economy is in free fall. The Socialist Party accuses the center-right opposition party, Fidesz, of not distancing itself firmly enough from the far-right extremists. And Fidesz says that when it was in power, there was no extremist problem.Meanwhile, far-right groups reap the benefit, occupying the public space left by, among others, the country’s reluctant cultural liberals. As Mr. Szabo, from Trafo, put it, “We need to learn again how to involve ourselves.”That would be a start.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','Similar stories can be told about eggs, bananas, bread and frozen orange juice. Food was getting cheaper relative to everything else, as Neil Harl, an agriculture professor at Iowa State University, explained to me, because of a combination of government subsidies, global trade and the rise of industrial farms.During the 1980s and 1990s, though, did you ever stop and marvel at what a small share of your paycheck you were spending at the supermarket? I didn’t. I also didn’t really notice that gas cost less in the late 1990s than it had in the 1980s. Yet lately, every time my wife or I pass a new benchmark for filling up our tank — $40, $50 and now $60 — we have a conversation about it.Price increases are simply more noticeable — more salient, as psychologists would say — than price decreases. Part of this comes from the notion of loss aversion: human beings dislike a loss more than they like a gain of equivalent size. If you have to sell your house for less than you bought it for, you’re really unhappy. You hate that ground chuck now costs $2.83 a pound, but you didn’t notice that oranges are 31 percent cheaper than they were a year ago.There is also something particular to inflation that aggravates loss aversion. Price increases are obvious. But price declines are often hidden. The cost of an item stays about the same for years, while everything else gets more expensive and nominal incomes rise.When you dig into the Consumer Price Index, you start to realize just how many things fall into this category. The price of major appliances has been flat over the last year. Furniture is 1 percent less expensive. A decade ago, a basic four-door Toyota Corolla LE cost $16,018, according to the company. The 2009 basic model costs $16,650, and it’s a safer, more powerful, more fuel-efficient car than its predecessor.To top it all off, most people don’t buy any of these items very often. “People tend to remember things they do frequently,” says Stephen Cecchetti, an economist at Brandeis University who studies inflation. “And what do you buy more frequently than gas and food?”But combine the less noticeable trends with some true price declines, like a 5 percent drop in women’s clothing over the last year, and an inflation rate of 4 percent starts to seem more reasonable. Inflation really has gotten worse recently — it was only 2 percent a year and a half ago — but it’s not as bad as it feels.The conspiracy theories about inflation play off these human instincts, but they also depend on two other oddities. The first is the amount of attention given to the so-called core inflation rate. This is a version of inflation that excludes food and energy, which makes it a little like a grade point average that excludes math and French.The core inflation rate does have a purpose. Its movements help Federal Reserve officials base interest rates on underlying price trends, instead of being overly influenced by food or gas prices, both of which can be volatile. But when Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, talks publicly about core inflation, he can leave the impression that the government is cooking the books. In fact, all the important economic indicators, including real wages, are based on overall inflation, as are Social Security checks and cost-of-living raises.The final piece of the puzzle — and the focus of the Harper’s article — is the way that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has changed the price index recently. Back in the mid-1990s, a committee of academic economists concluded that the Consumer Price Index overstated inflation. To take just one example, years would often pass before the index included new products — like cellphones — and therefore it missed the enormous price declines that occurred shortly after those products entered the mainstream.In response, the bureau tweaked the index. But economists who have studied the changes say they have had only a modest effect on the inflation rate, lowering it by perhaps a half point a year. More to the point, the changes seem to have made the index more accurate than it used to be.“It’s about as accurate as anybody is going to get it,” Mr. Cecchetti said.That said, there is one way in which the official numbers were clearly understating inflation. To track housing costs, the Consumer Price Index analyzes rents, not home prices. (Why? Long story.) And rents didn’t go up anywhere near as much as house prices during the real estate boom. So the index missed the huge run-up in home values that made life harder on anyone trying to buy a first home.Since 2006, of course, home prices have been falling. But rents have kept rising slowly, which means that, as far as the Consumer Price Index is concerned, housing has somehow gotten more expensive during the real estate crash.So when the new inflation numbers come out next week, they will indeed be misleading. They will be artificially high.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','Ingrid Newkirk, the president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said that PETA would launch a series of initiatives designed to discourage fans from attending racetracks.The organization has already taken aim at Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. Last week, before the Derby, Clinton apparently played to the crowd by encouraging people to go to the Derby and bet on Eight Belles. In the wake of Eight Belles’s death, PETA sent Clinton a page-long letter chiding her for supporting thoroughbred racing and asking her to denounce betting on the sport.“She’s partly culpable because it’s money that makes them race, and money that makes them race prematurely,” Newkirk said Tuesday during a telephone interview. “It was inappropriate.”I’ve always been leery of PETA, and even resentful of some of the group’s over-the-top tactics to promote animal rights and to discourage cruelty to animals. But this much is certain: From the National Football League to clothing manufacturers, any number of people are reluctant to tangle with the group.PETA staged protests Tuesday in Lexington, Ky., outside the offices of the state’s horse racing regulators, and it plans to have a presence May 17 at the Preakness and again three weeks later at the Belmont. The goal is to make celebrities and vote-conscious politicians reluctant to attend the high-profile Triple Crown races.“If we suddenly make it kind of tainted, it will not be really the place where you want to be seen,” Newkirk said. “We want other politicians, other people, not to wish to be associated with it.”Whatever PETA’s aims may be, there are myriad issues to debate.¶Medication is the mainstay of racing in the United States. If steroids are rampant in baseball, what are they in horse racing? If we’ve learned anything about steroids over the last 10 years, it is that they kill.¶Faster but more fragile horses are being churned out — not to race all that much, but to be sold to stud. What needs to be done about breeding?¶Should the age at which horses are allowed to race — currently 2 — be raised?¶What about racing surfaces? There are indications, but no conclusive proof, that synthetic surfaces are safer. I suspect, however, that synthetic surfaces are becoming popular not so much to aid the horses, but to keep the surface consistent in order to make racing easier to schedule.¶The toll that the day-to-day grind takes on horses goes largely unnoticed. The Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont present an unrealistic picture of thoroughbred racing. Come to a track in late November, when the stands are empty and a cold rain is falling and horses are being run to generate money for the simulcast handle.Looking at all these issues makes you realize that trying to get your arms around horse racing is like trying to nail Jell-O to a tree. Even if Congress were outraged and so inclined, whom would it summon to Washington? Where is the accountability? If ever a sport needed a commissioner or a chief executive, it is horse racing. But there is no such person, so the issues may end up being debated without any real resolution, leaving us with intelligent voices, but no solutions.One such voice is Bob Reeves, president of the Thoroughbred Horseman’s Group, who says that “this is an industry that needs direction.”His organization is an alliance of about 17 horsemen’s groups covering more than 45 racetracks. Reeves agrees that horse racing desperately needs a central authority, but that is not his group’s focus. Its priority is straightening out the simulcast model and increasing the percentage of money that horse owners receive from increased wagering on the Internet.“We’re just trying to straighten the economics out first,” Reeves said. “If we don’t straighten the economics out, you’re not going to have to worry about all the rest.”But the general public cares far less about the economics of horse racing and far more about its impact on thoroughbreds. The death of Eight Belles should resonate in a way that forces reform.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','Amid the chatter about whether the Democrats would be able to unite around one of their candidates was an interesting nugget. Incomplete returns on Tuesday night showed that more than 20 percent of those who voted in the Republican primary in Indiana voted for someone other than Senator John McCain, the party’s presumptive nominee.With 74 percent of the state reporting, Mr. McCain was winning Indiana with 77.3 percent of the vote, according to The Associated Press. That would be considered a robust margin on most election nights. But consider the competition.Mike Huckabee, who dropped out of the race two months ago and has campaigned for Mr. McCain, received 10.3 percent of the vote. Another McCain supporter, Mitt Romney, who dropped out of the race even earlier, won 4.8 percent. And Representative Ron Paul of Texas, whose unconventional campaign has often drawn to the polls people who do not normally vote in Republican primaries, received 7.6 percent.Quite a few Republican crossover voters participated in the Democratic primary. One in 10 of the voters who cast ballots in the Democratic primary identified themselves to exit pollsters as Republicans.Mr. McCain and his aides have said they are pleased with the way the Republican Party has united around his candidacy since he became the presumptive nominee in early March. They note that polls show them doing as well with Republicans as President Bush did at similar points in his first campaign for president, if not better.But nonexistent or marginal competitors continue to draw votes in the primaries.The situation was similar on Tuesday in North Carolina, where, with 54 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. McCain had 73.8 percent of the vote, Mr. Huckabee 12.1 percent, Mr. Paul 7.7 percent, and others 6.3 percent.'"
"'08-05-07,'0','Although dinner at Ko is a two-hour, eight-course, full-throttle commitment, it’s also an experiment in subtraction, in calculating which niceties can go without the enjoyment ebbing as well.Proper tables and place settings? At Ko you belly up to a plain counter that wraps around a plain galley kitchen, and your chopsticks rest on a wine cork.Lumbar support? At Ko you straddle a backless stool. Lovely scenery? There’s a plywood wall to your back and, in front of you, cooks so close you can count their beads of sweat as they not only prepare and plate your food but also hand it to you. You can feel the heat from the stoves like a sunburn on your brow.There’s no hard liquor, no tea, no regular coffee and above all no choice. You eat dishes of Ko’s choosing in the order it chooses, and most everybody around you is having roughly the same meal.The omakase experience at sushi bars is one point of reference; another is the feng shui of the French chef Joël Robuchon’s counter-centric L’Atelier restaurants. But Ko makes the interface between you and the cooks even more casual, more blithe: you sit like an Abdul in judgment of their ability to carry the Led Zeppelin tune blaring from the speakers, because try to carry it they will.Ko pares down stuffy atmospherics in a particularly thorough way. It wagers that for a younger generation more focused on food than on frippery, a scruffy setting, small discomforts and little tyrannies are acceptable — preferable, even — if they’re reflected in the price.They are. For $85 you get a number and caliber of dishes — including a wacky and wonderful blizzard of cold foie gras flakes and a cheeky panna cotta whose sweet, milky flavor mimics the sublime dregs of a bowl of cereal — that might cost $150 in a more formal environment.You don’t get start-to-finish enchantment, but that’s not a function of insufficient coddling. It’s a function of where you set the bar for a restaurant that must master only a cluster of dishes on a given night, and that compels you to surrender so fully to its authority.Under those terms there’s a promise of unwavering transcendence, and Ko in its early months serves a few dishes that merely intrigue along with others that utterly enrapture. It also falls prey to some inconsistency.Twice I was blown away by the first savory course, which follows an amuse-bouche of an English muffin soaked with whipped pork fat. It showcases uncooked fluke in a wash of buttermilk, yuzu and Sriracha that struck a thrilling balance of round and sharp notes, silky and spiky effects, coolness and heat. On top of this mix were enough toasted poppy seeds to give it a pleasant grittiness and a pointillist skin.But the next time I had this dish, with scallop filling in for fluke, the Sriracha was a tamer presence, and the sauce was slightly watery.One of the final savory courses, slices of short rib that are cooked sous vide for 48 hours before being deep-fried, was a miracle of tender-crisp contrast one night and a letdown of leathery-crisp redundancy on another.Deification may have come prematurely to Mr. Chang. But a low-key coronation makes sense.With Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, both near Ko in the East Village, he has demonstrated a shrewd grasp of the culinary zeitgeist, bringing considerable skill and high standards to noodle soups, slider-size sandwiches, Asian burritos and chicken wings. He’s playful, never pompous, and despite the offal and other adventurous streaks on the menus at Noodle and Ssam, they resemble glossy snack bars, raucous and rollicking into the wee hours.The last seating at Ko, which means “child of” in Japanese, is 9:30 p.m. This even-tempered child gives Mr. Chang and his cohorts, including Peter Serpico, a business partner who acts as the restaurant’s chef de cuisine, a smaller, more orderly sanctum in which to labor over a succinct lineup of dishes more classically artistic than the archetypal Momofuku pork bun, not to be found here.It continues his exploration of his Korean heritage, adoration of pork belly and penchant for pickling. Pickled carrots and pickled mustard seeds surround the short rib, offsetting its heaviness with tart, acidic elements.He’s also a fiend for smokiness, achieved with abandon and efficiency through the addition of a bacon purée — liquid pork belly! — to the dressing of a dish centered around scallop or trout, depending on the night.The soft-boiled egg that he serves with hackleback caviar is dipped in smoked water, but that’s not the fun part. Next to it are cooked onions and tiny slivers of deep-fried fingerling potato. It’s a chip-and-dip of a more delicate order.Lately he has replaced this dish with a less successful eggy meditation: a version of chawan mushi, the Japanese custard, with caviar, asparagus, argan oil and cashews, which don’t register forcefully or give the dish much textural contrast.There’s lasagna, but it’s a dissident lasagna, the noodles entwined with snails, porcini, spring asparagus, a ricotta foam of sorts and — the genius touch — a Lilliputian bouquet of dehydrated broccoli rabe flowers. They’re crunchy, a smart hedge against any lasagna soupiness. And they’re adorable, like miniaturized marigolds.There’s a Georgia pea soup with such resonant pea flavor that you wonder about the bastard pedigree of all prior peas in your life and almost fail to notice the morels and the delicate crawfish in the soup. I said almost. Crustaceans rarely get past me.And then there’s that arresting foie gras, a torchon of which is frozen so it can be shaved into a loosely packed snowball. This preserves the liver’s creaminess while tempering its unctuousness, and it’s rounded out with a brittle of cashews or pine nuts, a gelée of riesling or Sauternes, and litchi or pickled grapes.

"'08-05-07,'0','There are two important recessions going on in the world today. One has gotten enormous attention. It’s the economic recession in America. But it will eventually pass, and the world will not be much worse for the wear. The other has gotten no attention. It’s called “the democratic recession,” and if it isn’t reversed, it will change the world for a long time.The term “democratic recession” was coined by Larry Diamond, a Stanford University political scientist, in his new book “The Spirit of Democracy.” And the numbers tell the story. At the end of last year, Freedom House, which tracks democratic trends and elections around the globe, noted that 2007 was by far the worst year for freedom in the world since the end of the cold war. Almost four times as many states — 38 — declined in their freedom scores as improved — 10.What explains this? A big part of this reversal is being driven by the rise of petro-authoritarianism. I’ve long argued that the price of oil and the pace of freedom operate in an inverse correlation — which I call: “The First Law of Petro-Politics.” As the price of oil goes up, the pace of freedom goes down. As the price of oil goes down, the pace of freedom goes up.“There are 23 countries in the world that derive at least 60 percent of their exports from oil and gas and not a single one is a real democracy,” explains Diamond. “Russia, Venezuela, Iran and Nigeria are the poster children” for this trend, where leaders grab the oil tap to ensconce themselves in power.But while oil is critical in blunting the democratic wave, it is not the only factor. The decline of U.S. influence and moral authority has also taken a toll. The Bush democracy-building effort in Iraq has been so botched, both by us and Iraqis, that America’s ability and willingness to promote democracy elsewhere has been damaged. The torture scandals of Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay also have not helped. “There has been an enormous squandering of American soft power, and hard power, in recent years,” said Diamond, who worked in Iraq as a democracy specialist.'"

"'08-05-08,'1','A bayside community of 117,000 25 miles northeast of San Francisco, Vallejo is the largest city in California to declare bankruptcy, though Orange County did so in 1994 after a spate of bad investments.“With Orange County,” Professor Quigley said, “there were identifiable bad guys. This is different. Near as one can tell, this is more of a low-level infection everywhere.”Municipal bankruptcies are not unheard of, but are often accompanied by scandal or legal losses. County commissioners in Jefferson County, Ala., are considering bankruptcy amid a federal lawsuit over payments to the mayor of Birmingham, the county seat, and a missed bond payment.Smaller cities like Half Moon Bay, Calif., and McCall, Idaho, have also flirted with bankruptcy. In Vallejo, Council members and residents fault decisions by past Councils, including agreeing to binding arbitration for contracts with city employees, whose salaries account for nearly 80 percent of the general fund.Like many Bay Area cities, Vallejo has struggled to keep up with demand for services as its population has grown over 20 years. “We as a state are growing by 500,000 people a year, and that is continuing to put pressure on the cities,” said Dan Carigg, the legislative director for the League of California Cities, an association for the 478 cities in the state. “And when you run short, you tend to have two choices. Cut programs or try to raise revenues.“And when it comes to cities trying to raise new revenues, their options are very limited.”Because of propositions approved by voters, California strictly limits increases in property taxes. And in Vallejo, public workers say the cutting has already gone too far.“We’ve been doing more with less forever,” said Detective Mat Mustard, vice president of the Vallejo Police Officers Association, which opposed the bankruptcy declaration. “We’re going to start losing people. Who wants to work for a company or a city that’s bankrupt?”Council members disputed that public safety or the attractiveness to businesses would be reduced.“This morning, going around town, it’s weird, because everyone’s saying congratulations,” Councilwoman Stephanie Gomes said. “Its kind of odd to say, but the mood among people is that we’re finally going to solve the problems.”Along the main drag, Georgia Avenue, the sentiment seemed to be more bittersweet.“I’m sad to see it go this way,” Debbie Rojas, owner of the Georgia Street Grill, said. “But I’m kind of excited for bankruptcy.”'"

"'08-05-08,'1','There is no shortage of drama these days in the credit markets, which happen to be Mr. Fink’s specialty. Back in the 1980s, at First Boston, he helped pioneer mortgage securities, the kind of investments that are causing so much of the trouble now.BlackRock’s funds have largely dodged the blowup in the subprime mortgage market. So lately the firm has been counseling Florida about how its public investment fund, tainted by subprime investments, should ride out the storm. BlackRock was also among several Wall Street firms that advised the Treasury late last year on a controversial plan to shore up certain bank-affiliated investment vehicles. (The initiative has since died.)Just this week, BlackRock agreed to manage risky subprime assets with a face value of $22 billion from UBS, the ailing Swiss bank. Mr. Fink has been crisscrossing the country to drum up even more business.All this is helping to make Mr. Fink and his shareholders richer at a time that much of Wall Street is getting poorer. During the last year, as the shares of many larger, wealthier financial companies have plummeted, BlackRock’s share price has soared 43 percent, closing at $212.15 on Wednesday.In the stock market, BlackRock, which Mr. Fink founded in a one-room office in 1988, is now worth about $25 billion, eclipsing the market capitalization of the venerable Lehman Brothers, which traces its history back to 1862. Mr. Fink made $26.4 million last year. But he also owns about 1.3 million BlackRock shares, a stake that is now worth $275 million.Sitting in his Midtown office, Mr. Fink exudes the same restless energy as his traders, who hunch over computer terminals in concentric rings a few feet away. He folds his tall frame into his chair but cannot sit still. He twists this way and that, jumps up to offer a visitor chocolate candies with “BlackRock” emblazoned on the wrappers, and bellows to his assistant about his appointments.“Most of the advancements of today are based on what we did more than 20 years ago,” Mr. Fink said of his days at First Boston, where he earned the reputation as a whiz kid. But even now, two decades later, he still recalls how he ran up big losses at First Boston’s bond division in 1986. That episode taught him a painful lesson, one that he said Wall Street is now learning all over again: risk management is absolutely essential.Mr. Fink has transformed his firm from a small bond shop into the largest publicly traded asset management company in the country. Along the way, the firm has focused ruthlessly on managing the risks it takes in the markets, BlackRock executives said.That conservative approach appears to have paid off.“We’re paranoid and neurotic,” Robert S. Kapito, BlackRock’s president and a co-founder, said. “That’s important in working with clients.”While many others on Wall Street are suffering, including BlackRock’s biggest shareholder, Merrill Lynch, Mr. Fink’s firm, which trades under the ticker symbol BLK, seems poised to prosper.“BLK remains well positioned to benefit from the market turmoil and generate solid organic growth, given its balanced product offering, global footprint, and its risk management reputation in a difficult capital market environment,” Robert A. Lee, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a research note last month.Granted, BlackRock has made its share of mistakes. While it was correct in adopting a cautious stance against subprime mortgages as early as 2006, the firm may have been too early in acting on that hunch, several executives acknowledge. Rivals like the Pacific Investment Management Company, another big bond manager, timed the course of events better, reaping greater rewards in the process.Pimco “shot the lights out,” Peter R. Fisher, a former Fed and Treasury official who is BlackRock’s co-head of fixed income, said. “We avoided blowing up.”And BlackRock’s recent push into hedge funds, those secretive, sometimes volatile investment vehicles for the rich, has not gone as well as the company had hoped. Two weeks ago, BlackRock raised $275 million for a London-based fund of hedge funds, a little more than half of what its underwriter had sought.But, not surprisingly, it has been BlackRock’s role in the sale of Bear Stearns that has attracted the most scrutiny.Last month, Representative Henry A. Waxman, the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demanding more information about how BlackRock won the assignment without an open bidding process.“The committee’s investigations have shown that when contract terms are not defined in advance, it is usually the taxpayer — not the contractor — who suffers,” Mr. Waxman wrote.But Mr. Fink echoes comments by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and others in arguing that time was of the essence in arranging the Bear Stearns deal. An hour after JPMorgan executives called BlackRock on that Saturday in March, about 50 people were assembled at BlackRock’s offices, going through paperwork.BlackRock officials point to their early experience managing investments through the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s and early ’90s. But according to Mr. Kapito and others, the firm really established itself in 1994, when it was hired by General Electric to sell off Kidder Peabody’s portfolio of mortgage-backed securities.“It was a true test of whether our systems worked,” Mr. Kapito said.Since then, BlackRock has been called upon to advise in scores of other situations. Florida, one of BlackRock’s first clients, called upon the firm in late November to help sort out a subprime-infected investment pool for local governments. By the time the firm was hired, the fund had lost nearly half its value as municipalities rushed to redeem their investments, and Florida had temporarily halted withdrawals.The BlackRock team, led by Barbara G. Novick, had 36 hours to come up with a solution. The firm proposed hiving off $2 billion in tainted assets. Within a few days, Florida reopened the fund.Last fall, JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America chose BlackRock to manage a planned Treasury-backed fund that would bail out investment vehicles saddled with subprime mortgages. But the three banks later pulled the plug on the fund.And this week, the firm is preparing to undertake its latest assignment, setting up the UBS subprime fund. How BlackRock won the assignment was, in part, a reflection of its deep connections to other Wall Street firms: Mr. Fink developed a dialogue with Marcel Rohner, UBS’s chief executive, within a week or two of his assuming that role last summer. And Mr. Fink knew Jerker M. Johansson, the bank’s head of investment banking, from Mr. Johansson’s days at Morgan Stanley.The discussions became more intense last month, as UBS said it would consider creating a “bad bank,” a unit in which it could work out its subprime mortgage holdings. Shortly afterward, several UBS investors called BlackRock to ask if it could play a role.“We had comprehensive connections with several groups that led to the assignment,” Mr. Fink said.For all this, Mr. Fink said BlackRock’s success is exacting a heavy toll — on his sleep. “I’m getting a lot less than I need,” he joked.'"
"'08-05-08,'1','Microsoft is teaming up for the contest with TriggerStreet.com, the Web site of a production company owned by the actor Kevin Spacey that is aimed at aspiring moviemakers and screenwriters. TriggerStreet.com and Microsoft were brought together by Omelet, a company in Los Angeles that works on advertising, entertainment and branding projects with marketers that in addition to Microsoft include Anheuser-Busch, NBC Universal and Toyota Motor.“Omelet has helped us to amplify the impact of the contest by hooking us up with partners that have reach, influence and credibility,” said Barry Goffe, director for Windows client product management at Microsoft.“I’ve done video editing on my PC and could probably write a white paper on it,” Mr. Goffe said. “But I’m a geek, not a Hollywood director” like Mr. Newman, he added, so such a technical approach would draw a far smaller audience than the contest.Encouraging consumers to create content “is a very different approach for us,” Mr. Goffe said of the Windows division of Microsoft, but “I think it’s the best way to engage with our customers and achieve the long-term goals of the business.”There is always a risk with user-generated content: the materials submitted by consumers may be at variance with the shiny, happy, official corporate approach to a product or brand.For example, when the Chevrolet division of General Motors asked computer users in 2006 to create commercials for the Tahoe sport utility, many spots made pointed references to its large size and thirst for gasoline.If the Microsoft contest is flooded with video clips that criticize or mock Vista, “I’d probably end up with a little bit of a red face,” Mr. Goffe said.“But in the end I’d be happy,” he added, “if it generated that much noise and traffic.”“One of the things that makes me feel O.K. about this,” Mr. Goffe said, “is that we’re not asking people to write a script that says ‘Windows Vista Ultimate is great’ or romances technology.” Rather, he added, the idea is to create content that in its tone would mirror the lighthearted approach of Act I of “The Cube.”Shervin Samari, a partner at Omelet, acknowledged that marketers asking consumers to create content must be comfortable with giving up control of the ad-making process.“Those brands willing to let go will make deeper connections with consumers,” Mr. Samari said. “There is that element of ‘You never know,’ but in this case we’re showcasing creativity and how the technology can help deliver that.”Besides, he added, if restrictions were imposed on the intended contest audience — whom he described as “the filmmaking community, superenthused gadget fans and early adopters” — they “would just backfire, because these people are going to smell any funny business from a mile away.”Microsoft has undertaken other efforts to improve perceptions of Vista, including price reductions and statements of support from senior corporate managers.But reports of problem-plagued upgrades to Vista from Windows XP have been widespread. And ads from Apple that make fun of Vista are among the campaigns most often talked about online.The Apple ads — by TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group — show “Mac Guy” watching “PC Guy” trying to light a sign that reads “Don’t give up on Vista.” Glitches render the sign’s message as either “give up” or “give up on Vista.”Mr. Goffe said: “There are some people having issues with Vista. A lot of people are having a great experience. The people I’m talking to know the technology works for them.”The contest will be conducted in four phases. First, contestants will submit scripts for Act II, and five will be chosen by voters at the relay Web site. After those five scripts are produced, voters will select the winning clip, which will be added onto Act I on the Web site. Act III will be created the same way.Act I of “The Cube” features an actor, Sam Huntington, who is also a star of “Fanboys,” as well as the model Jaime King, who is also Mrs. Kyle Newman. Mr. Goffe even makes a cameo appearance in the clip, as a character named Barry Turtleneck.“Fanboys” has attracted attention in Hollywood because its intended distributor, the Weinstein Company, is embroiled in a dispute with the filmmakers over which version to release. There has been a large effort online among young filmgoers to persuade Weinstein to release the filmmakers’ preferred version.Mr. Newman, in a telephone interview, had encouraging news for the “Fanboys” fans. “I have been brought back into the editing room to work on a final version,” he said, adding: “All the key people are back. That’s all good.”Mr. Newman may be the perfect choice to direct a movie for a consumer contest because, he said, “I won a similar contest when I was in college.”In 1998, when Mr. Newman was a 21-year-old undergraduate film student at New York University, he became the first winner of what was known as the Coca-Cola Refreshing Filmmaker’s Award. A 60-second film that Mr. Newman made, “Bitten by Love,” was chosen from among 150 entries and was shown in about 10,000 theaters around the country.A decade later, an aspiring filmmaker can “make something so fast, get it online and get millions of people to watch it,” Mr. Newman said. “It’s great.”'"
"'08-05-08,'1','The White House is removing a member of the Federal Election Commission for standing up for clean elections, while trying to install another member whose specialty is keeping eligible voters from casting ballots. The Senate, which must confirm nominees, should insist that President Bush appoint commissioners with a proven record of supporting voting rights and fair elections.Mr. Bush is purging the current F.E.C. chairman, David Mason, presumably because he was responsible enough to challenge the funding machinations of Senator John McCain’s presidential campaign. Mr. Mason shocked his fellow Republicans by notifying Mr. McCain that he might run afoul of the law by switching from public funding to private donations once he secured the party’s nomination.The White House proposes to replace Mr. Mason with Donald McGahn, a Republican warhorse. F.E.C. commissioners are expected to be aligned with a party — one of the new Democratic nominees is a staff member of Senator Charles Schumer of New York — but Mr. McGahn has a particularly partisan background. He was the party’s Congressional campaign counsel — and the ethics lawyer for Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader from Texas who left office under multiple clouds.The six-member commission, which now has four vacancies, has been rendered inoperable. If it is to perform its role as referee of national elections, it urgently needs a full complement — and it needs commissioners with the sort of professionalism displayed by Mr. Mason.Senate Democrats should push for someone more suitable than Mr. McGahn, and they should continue to oppose Hans von Spakovsky, a terrible nominee with a record as a Justice Department lawyer of aggressive partisanship and opposition to minority voting rights.'"
"'08-05-08,'1','The Federal Reserve monitors productivity trends closely, because wage escalation is often the way that inflation gets out of control.Private economists say they believe that the weakening economy will damp inflation pressures, but that the sharp economic slowdown is occurring at the same time that energy and food prices have continued to rise.In further evidence of the squeeze on consumers, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday that Americans increased their borrowing at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, compared with a 3.1 percent rate of increase in February.The gain was much larger than economists had been expecting and reflected strong borrowing on credit cards. Credit card borrowing was up at an annual rate of 7.9 percent, compared with a 5 percent gain in February, while borrowing in the category that includes car loans jumped by 6.8 percent, compared with a 2 percent increase in February.The increase in consumer debt totaled $15.3 billion at an annual rate in March, much bigger than the $6 billion increase that economists had been expecting.Consumers have been moving to put more purchases on their credit cards as banks have tightened lending standards for home equity loans in response to the deepening credit crisis.The rise in productivity in the first three months of the year occurred as the number of hours worked declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent.That reflected layoffs as businesses cut their payrolls in the face of an economic slowdown prompted by a steep slump in housing.The 2.2 percent rate of productivity growth in the first quarter was up slightly from a 1.8 percent increase in the fourth quarter of last year.Productivity for all of 2007 rose by 1.8 percent, up a bit from the 1 percent gain in 2006. Both of those increases were far below the growth levels of the past decade as productivity experienced a healthy rebound, reflecting investments that had been made in equipment to improve efficiency, like computers.'"
"'08-05-08,'1','While he said he was unaware of the lawsuit, Mr. Kelly said: “We think that the stop and question provision in the criminal procedure law is a valuable tool for this department. We think it’s a tool that is necessary. We try to do it with civility, with respect.”The lawsuit states that Mr. Blair, 28, a citizen of Jamaica, has been working for The Post on a one-year training visa, and that the arrest will make it more complicated for him to change his immigration status.Mr. Blair was holding a gym bag and walking from his car to his home in the Bronx shortly after 8 p.m. on Nov. 28, 2007, according to the suit. As he turned onto Tenbroeck Avenue, an officer in a police car asked him what he was doing. Officer Castillo jumped out of the car and asked him if he spoke English, and Mr. Blair replied, in Spanish, that he did not, the suit contends.Mr. Blair was ordered to put his hands in the air and was frisked, and his bag was then searched, the suit says. When he put his hands down, the suit contends, Officer Castillo said that he had not been told to do so and Mr. Blair was handcuffed. He claims that Officer Castillo told him he had disobeyed a lawful order.Mr. Blair was arrested and taken to a holding cell, where, the suit contends, he overheard officers examining his identification and Officer Castillo remarking incredulously, “Look at this — he’s not even from the projects.” Mr. Blair told them he was a reporter and a Columbia University graduate, the suit says.Within a few minutes, Mr. Blair was issued two summonses — one for disobeying a lawful order and the other for “unreasonable noise” — and was freed, the suit says. Both charges were dismissed in Bronx Criminal Court in February.The Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul. J.

"'08-05-08,'1','After years of legal and political wrangling and hundreds of millions of dollars in public money, the New Jersey Meadowlands Commission voted Wednesday to end its relationship with a developer that wanted to build thousands of homes and a golf course atop several landfills.The result is a black eye for Cherokee Investment Partners, a North Carolina company with the majority investment in EnCap Golf Holdings, the development company, which repeatedly missed budget deadlines because the cost of cleaning the landfills had skyrocketed.Last November, Cherokee brought in Donald J. Trump to help revive the project. Mr. Trump’s organization persuaded the Meadowlands Commission, the state planning agency with jurisdiction over the project, to grant two extensions so it could create a new budget and financial plan.But in a resolution approved Wednesday, the commission said that although EnCap had made progress cleaning the landfills, it “has failed to demonstrate that it will be able to achieve the necessary financing.”In a separate letter to Mr. Trump, Robert A. Romano, an assistant attorney general for New Jersey, said that EnCap still needed $125 million to finish closing the landfill.'"
"'08-05-08,'1','One of those conservatives is the Rev. Richard Land, an official with the Southern Baptist Convention, who wrote last month to Mr. McCain and to the Democratic candidates, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, urging them to speak out about human trafficking. Mr. Land has also spoken to Mr. McCain about promoting religious freedom overseas and cracking down on child pornography on the Internet, which Mr. McCain has focused on in the Senate.On Wednesday, Mr. Land pronounced himself “delighted” with Mr. McCain’s speech. “He was ringing all the Southern Baptist bells,” Mr. Land said in a telephone interview. “This shows that Senator McCain is making it clear it will be a priority commitment, and that’s very important to my constituency.”After his speech, Mr. McCain was hit with a fusillade of tough questions, including a query about whether his temper — he acknowledged he gets angry — would pose a problem in the White House.“The next question is about this issue that has become something of a concern to some of your colleagues in the Senate, and is concerning many Republicans as well, and that is the question of your temper,” a member of the audience began.“How dare you ask that question!” Mr. McCain shot back in a mock rage, generating laughter.“I wouldn’t ask it if I wasn’t concerned, sir,” the man continued. “I have a quote from a colleague of yours, Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, somebody you may be familiar with, and with regards to you, he said, and I quote——— ”“I’m familiar with the quote,” Mr. McCain interjected, a little wearily.But the man plunged forward, sharing Mr. Cochran’s often-repeated words about Mr. McCain — “the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine” — and continuing so long into Mr. Cochran’s discourse that the generally friendly audience began booing the man.“Look, I will confess to you, my friend, that I get angry,” Mr. McCain finally replied, listing things he said made him irate: the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, pork-barrel spending projects, corruption.Mr. McCain then ticked off a list of Democrats he likes to work with. “And if I had some problem as such as has been described, my friends, I would not be able to work with Joe Lieberman and Russ Feingold and Ted Kennedy,” he concluded.Earlier, another participant, Susan Alderman, a Democrat from Fort Gratiot, Mich., asked if the war with Iraq had started over oil, as Mr. McCain seemed to suggest last week.“No, ma’am,” he replied, adding that he had always said the reason was “the issue of weapons of mass destruction, primarily.”'"
"'08-05-08,'1','Re “In Stores, Hints of Change Under New Castro” (front page, May 2):In my three trips to Cuba this year — before, during and after the election of Raúl Castro — Cubans were talking, with greater candor and hope than I’ve encountered during more than 30 trips since 2001.The signal sent by the reforms, such as moving control over agriculture from Havana to the municipal level or allowing Cubans to buy cellphones or stay in hotels, is that after 50 years the path forward is now toward decentralization and honoring the desire of Cubans for more autonomy.What catches the attention of Cubans is that they asked for these changes in a continuing national debate, the government is responding, and they now expect that these reforms will produce an even greater opening.Rather than condemning the reforms as cosmetic, as our government does, our foreign allies are commending Cuba’s government to encourage it to do more. By contrast, no Cuban tells us that United States policy has a constructive role.

"'08-05-08,'1','But can you compost a sofa and its throw pillows? Should you?“It’s an admirable idea,” said Warren Shoulberg, editor of Home Furnishing News, a trade publication. “But it doesn’t seem particularly practical,” he said. “Maybe biodegradable means it goes in your backyard, which could signal a whole new meaning for the Appalachian porch look.”Advertising products once marketed for their durability as biodegradable acknowledges that we are in a throwaway society, and that one’s furniture may not be an heirloom, to be passed along, but an object of fashion, ultimately destined for the landfill.Joanna Notkin, a 32-year-old Montreal-based textile designer, guarantees that her brightly colored knitted pillows and chunky, waffle-weave blankets will biodegrade in one year, should you choose to throw them in your composter once you’re done with them. They are sold under the name Looolo (looolotextiles.com) and have been featured in fashion-forward magazines like Lucky, Domino and Elle. Ms. Notkin described her mandate for her four-year-old company (Looolo is a typographical representation of 100 percent), as “biodegradable with an aesthetic.”Even mass-market manufacturers are embracing the B-word. Umbra, maker of inexpensive, stylish housewares, uses “biodegradable plastic” for many of its trash cans, which its ads say “break down into powder” in a landfill. And its Garbino can — the swoopy garbage can designed by Karim Rashid — is now made from corn plastic, which Umbra advertises as “completely biodegradable.”“As part of the design process we’ve been trying to introduce the idea of what happens to a product’s end use,” said David Quan, who handles sustainable initiatives for the company. “And one of the options, if something is not recyclable, is to have it break down.”WHEN wrestled to the ground, “biodegradable” can be as vaporous a term as “green.” ASTM International, formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials, defines the word, in part, as “a degradation caused by biological activity” but doesn’t specify just how long that might take. Consumers, by and large, according to a 2006 survey by the American Chemistry Council, believe that “biodegradable” means an object will totally disappear within a year, which makes the purchase of a product like a biodegradable sofa an exercise in magical thinking.“I see a new generation of marketers who are looking at biodegradability as a panacea to solid waste,” said Steve Mojo, executive director of the Biodegradable Products Institute (bpiworld.org), remembering the “biodegradable” diapers and trash bags of decades past. Mr. Mojo continued, “There is no data that I’ve seen to support manufacturers’ claims that any plastics will completely biodegrade under landfill conditions.” Tightly packed, covered and relatively dry, landfills are not exactly designed for biodegradation, he said.In any case, there is something quixotic and poignant about makers of home goods — particularly large home goods, like sofas — advertising their wares for their evanescence.“Their longevity, in the past, has always been part of the thing that gives them value,” said Bill Brown, chairman of the English department at the University of Chicago, best known for his work on “thing theory.”He explained how the value of a piece of furniture you come in contact with often, like a dining room table or a sofa, draws much of its worth from that contact: the longer we keep it around, the more psychologically valuable it becomes. “We use the ‘object world’ to stabilize human life,” he said. “Hannah Arendt said that sitting at the same table grants man his sameness, which is to say his identity.”The idea of biodegradable furniture, he said, seemed perverse and comic. “We all live such cluttered lives in which so much of what we have we’d be better off without, yet most of us are better off with our dining room tables or our sofas,” he said. To thing theorists like Mr. Brown, who poses a kind of “my furniture, myself” worldview, degradable home goods suggest an identity crisis.To some industry observers, like Joel Makower, executive editor of GreenBiz.com, which covers the “greening” of mainstream businesses, “biodegradability seems like a noble attribute but an irrelevant concept. You also have to ask, Is it reasonable to assume that a product will go into a system that will allow it to degrade? Is there a snowball’s chance it would be put on a compost pile?”Mr. Makower described a notorious experiment called the Garbage Project, wherein researchers from the University of Arizona in Tucson excavated the contents of landfills and discovered layers of mummified natural objects.“Hardly anything had broken down,” he said. “Carrots had been mummified for 50 years, and you could tell for how long because of the headlines on the newspapers, also intact, found alongside them.”One young Canadian designer named John Ryan has sidestepped the landfill conundrum entirely, by presenting objects that “decompose” in a more active manner. (You’ll need a hammer.) His terra-cotta wine decanter and cups are designed to be smashed into bits when you’re tired of them. The outdoor furniture he designed for his thesis project at the Ontario College of Art & Design in Toronto would be made from quarry silt — inspired, he said, by research showing that many urban Canadians buy inexpensive outdoor furniture and throw it out after a season. These pieces look like gleaming white tree stumps; you can smash them up at the end of the season, and sprinkle the dust on the sidewalk during the icy winter months.Mr. Ryan’s objects are the ultimate disposables, the anti-heirlooms.Of course, there are other responses to the problem of trash. One is to make objects more valuable, “moving to a place where the more traditional attributes of quality become more important than fashion and convenience,” said David Zucker, a specialist in sustainability at Porter Novelli International, a public relations company.John Grant, author of “The Green Marketing Manifesto” (Wiley, 2008), and a London-based marketing consultant for socially aware companies and ventures, said people once expected their possessions to outlive them, but now see them as transient, as “fashionable items, to be replaced every three to seven years as the cycles, from baroque to minimal, futurist to rustic, etc., turn.”He added, “We don’t buy disposable wedding rings. Why disposable crockery?” The industry should emphasize the heirloom concept, he suggested.There are some signs that might be happening. At the recent Milan furniture fair, said Franklin Getchell, an owner of Moss, the gallery-like design store, one trend in evidence “was the move toward use of more expensive materials and craftsmanship, made so with the expectation they’d be saved and passed on. For the business we’re in, this seems to make much more sense than making something that will fall apart and return to the earth.”ULTIMATELY, the greenest statement is to ignore the blandishments of the marketers and buy no products at all.“Consumers are expressing a clear interest in understanding the impact of what they’re buying on the environment. Meaning the whole shebang,” said Mr. Zucker, the marketer at Porter Novelli. But it is often difficult to know what is true or what makes sense, which leads to what he calls “green confusion.”Mr. Zucker has been conducting ethnographic research of what he called “highly motivated green consumers,” interviewing them on the street and in environments where they congregate. He said that last November, at the farmers’ market in Union Square, he questioned a man who confessed to being utterly bewildered in his quest to buy green. He told Mr. Zucker, “I don’t know the right answers. I guess at the end of the day I’m trying to buy less stuff.”'"

"'08-05-08,'1','The switch in roles has given birth to a related trend that he described as “super targeting,” in which companies that have tapped into business school students’ expertise then seek help from specialists in other departments, like computer science professors.The class at Stetson, in Deland, Fla., got an unexpected reward for its work. Becky Oliphant, an associate marketing professor at Stetson, and her students were given the chance to sky dive, using, of course, parachutes made by Complete Parachute Solutions, a consortium of three parachute equipment makers with more than 300 employees.Five took up the offer. One, Heather Fuller, who is also the director of a hospital pharmacy and the owner of a dance business called Dancelexic, said she was nervous about making the jump but now cannot wait to do it again. “It was the most exhilarating sensation I’ve ever had,” she said.The Stetson students spent the semester compiling recommendations for upgrading the company’s Web site. Ms. Fuller said the group proposed ways to make the site easier to use and to add features like a customer portal and an online store.After the students’ final presentation on Monday, Mr. Williams said, “We’ll certainly take elements of their report, especially concerning the Web site.”He said that he was especially intrigued by a map the group created that showed how many keystrokes it took customers to reach various spots on the site and that he found persuasive the students’ arguments for making India and Japan primary marketing targets.Didi Davis, founder of Didi Davis Food in Ipswich, Mass., credits a consulting program offered by the business school of nearby Babson College for getting her venture on track — and indirectly lifting it from a niche outpost into a potential national distributor of specialty food products.Ms. Davis, 55, ran a catering service in high school, started a cooking school in 1982 and wrote two cookbooks before experiencing an entrepreneurial epiphany on a trip to Paris four years ago. There, she sampled vanilla-flavored sea salt, and she was so taken by it that she started Didi Davis Food on her return home. Her idea was to make gourmet condiments like flavored salts and syrups and to sell high-end packaged foods like vinegars and mustards.The firm grew slowly, to $75,000 in revenue last year, but, Ms. Davis said, “Believe it or not, I didn’t have a business plan.” So last fall, she enlisted a team of undergraduate students at Babson’s business school, under the direction of a master’s degree candidate, to write one.“What we gained was a smart, polished report that focused our minds and opened up the potential for us to raise outside capital,” Ms. Davis said. “Perhaps the biggest immediate benefit was to persuade us to institute a proper accounting system. The business plan was a wake-up call; it forced us to join the real world of business.”That in turn gave her the confidence to make a move that she believes could put her company on the food industry map. In February, she made a $120,000 deal to acquire Salt Traders, a Web site that markets specialty sea salts. “We can sell our stuff over Salt Traders,” she said. “We’ll have a national presence.”She was not the only one to gain a practical benefit from the project. Aditi Chowdhary, who led the Babson consulting team and is getting her business degree this weekend, said it gave her management expertise that she can use when she joins her family’ small manufacturing company in India. “Right now, my ambition is taking my father’s company global,” she said.Rosemary Casey, the Babson business school’s manager of consulting programs, said the practice of exposing students to local companies dated to the 1970s. The number of teams has grown to 14 or 15 a semester, from 10 to 12 four years ago.Babson likes to work with nonprofit groups, she said. One team did research for the Earthwatch Institute in Maynard, Mass., on pricing adventure tours for the public, for example, she said, while another did a report for the Cape Cod chapter of Habitat for Humanity on the feasibility of creating a resale store for discarded housing materials like shingles, gutters and bricks. (It recommended against the move.)“I think this sort of experiential education has become more and more common,” Ms. Casey said.Dr. Oliphant at Stetson agrees. Just over the last couple of years, she says, her students have worked with nearly 50 businesses, performing services as diverse as alerting a distributor of key lime pies that his Web site was about to expire, helping a hair salon relocate and creating a slogan for it, and urging a maker of hurricane shutters to market them as protection against burglars as well as storms.In fact, she said, her program has gotten too popular, forcing her to turn down overtures from would-be entrepreneurs who have neither a business nor a product but only an untested moneymaking idea. “It’s like a physician at a dinner party,” she said. “Everybody wants a free diagnosis.”By contrast, working with an established and growing company like Complete Parachute Solutions rewards students for their work with real-world experience. And, of course, there are the parachute jumps. Ms. Oliphant says the company’s offer to stage the sky diving event was made spontaneously at her first meeting with Mr. Williams, the company’s vice president, in January. “All I wanted him to do was provide an open parachute in a back room so the students could at least see and touch it,” she recalled. “I said, ‘Could you ...,’ and he broke in, ‘Give ’em a jump? Sure. How are they going to understand the business otherwise?’ ”'"
"'08-05-08,'1','The acting administrator, Robert A. Sturgell, said in an interview on Tuesday that operating without long-term legislation would eventually interfere with acquisitions and hiring, but he said his agency was doing well with technology and people.“This is not your grandfather’s F.A.A.,” he said, citing a new computer backbone for air traffic control that is now being installed, and improvements in tracking planes over the oceans.Mr. Sturgell’s interim status is, in a sense, an example of a reform that backfired.Agency administrators used to be appointed and confirmed at the pleasure of the president and the Senate, and served at most until a president’s term expired. But a consensus emerged among aviation experts that their tenure was typically too short to learn their jobs and have an impact, hampering modernization.So in 1994 Congress established a five-year term. Jane F. Garvey, a Democrat appointed by Bill Clinton, served 18 months into the Bush administration, and her successor, Marion C. Blakey, a Republican, held the office for the full five years, ending last September.President Bush nominated Ms. Blakey’s deputy, Mr. Sturgell, a former airline pilot with long experience in aviation safety and a Republican, to succeed her. But the Senate is controlled by Democrats, many of whom expect to see a Democratic president elected later this year, and they have moved slowly.His confirmation is now unlikely because of political objections to changes made to smooth out air control. The agency has been trying to cut delays by untangling the knot of airspace in the New York metropolitan area. When it tried a simpler design, some towns heard airplane noise for the first time and many residents complained to their elected representatives. So both New Jersey senators have suspended action on Mr. Sturgell’s nomination.“Everybody says we need to improve the air traffic control system, reduce the delays and increase capacity,” said Mr. Del Balzo. “And the F.A.A. tries to do that, and that’s the reaction you get.”The Democrats assert, however, that Mr. Sturgell, as understudy to Ms. Blakey, was simply part of a failed leadership.The agency has limited the number of flights at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty airports in the New York area to ease the national gridlock that quickly results when delays occur there.It is trying to auction landing slots at La Guardia. But Congress is debating a provision in the authorization bill that would prohibit the agency from doing that. That bill has been held up for months in a dispute over how the expense of running the air traffic system should be divided among airlines and other users, like corporate jets.The agency’s authorization — its basic approval to operate — expired Oct. 1 and has been temporarily extended since then. It contains a range of other bread-and-butter provisions, including how airlines should have to calculate their pension liabilities and how the agency should regulate aircraft repair stations overseas. Unions are pressing to make it harder for airlines to export maintenance work.Meanwhile, the agency continues to struggle with modernizing its air traffic system.For more than a decade, the agency has talked about moving to a system of satellite navigation, in which airplanes would use G.P.S. to find their position, then broadcast that information to other planes and to controllers on the ground.That technology would eliminate the need for conventional radar, and for radio beacons on the ground used for navigation. But in contrast to radar and navigation beacons, the satellite-based system, known as NextGen, for next generation, requires substantial investment by airplane operators.They are skeptical. The agency has made a cautious proposal that the airlines equip themselves to broadcast the signals, but not until 2020. They would not have to receive such signals until later, although that step would help airplanes fly closer together without increased risk, a move that would reduce delays.The airlines have good reason to avoid embracing agency concepts, said James H. Burnley IV, who was the Transportation secretary from 1987 to 1989.He said the agency has often embraced new technologies, urged the airlines to invest in them, and then dropped them.“I feel like it’s the movie ‘Groundhog Day’ on these issues,” Mr. Burnley said. “In the late 1980s the F.A.A. leadership was extremely aggressive and pushing toward the microwave landing system,” he said. But as often happens, he said, it took the agency too long to approve the technology “and guess what, it was overtaken” by NextGen.Airlines have no confidence that the F.A.A. can pay for its part of NextGen, Mr. Burnley said. And with the agency having to rely on annual appropriations from Congress, he said he did not blame them. One way to pay for the system, he said, would be with bonds repaid with air traffic control fees.NextGen is a joint project with the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, NASA and others. But that may be a problem because it makes consensus harder to reach.Mr. Goldfarb, the agency’s former chief of staff, described it as “a research project that has no heft, no institutional clout, no significant money behind it.” Mr. Sturgell acknowledged that the problem was complex. But, he said, “I haven’t heard anybody say we should not do NextGen.”“It is coming down to how you do it, how fast, and who is going to pay for it,” he said.Patrick Forrey, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the F.A.A.’s biggest problem was with union workers. The F.A.A. declared an impasse in September 2006 with the union, and Ms. Blakey imposed contract conditions, with sharply lowered pay for new hires, with pay caps for many controllers, spending more time on their radar scopes during the day and a host of smaller changes that some controllers say they find infuriating.Those smaller changes include the reduced ability to schedule vacation in advance, inability to leave the building during meal breaks and even the dress codes. The agency also said its union employees had abused sick time and overtime rules, and vowed to crack down.As a result, some controllers are leaving. Most of the controllers now working were hired in the early 1980s, after President Ronald Reagan fired thousands of their predecessors who had gone on strike.Controllers have a mandatory retirement age of 56, and many are eligible sooner. According to the controllers union, nearly all of the thousands who have retired since the contract was imposed have done so before reaching retirement age. One reason, the union says, is that as the controller population declines, mandatory overtime has shot up to keep the air traffic radar scopes staffed.The overtime is unavoidable, Mr. Sturgell said, to accommodate on-the-job training, vacations and other requirements. Most overtime is voluntary, he said. The House has passed a reauthorization bill for the agency that would send the current contract into binding arbitration. A Senate version would make binding arbitration available in future disputes. Even without the early retirements, the F.A.A. has been forced to hire and train controllers quickly to replace those hired after the strike in 1981.The aviation system is facing a dismal summer of delays, but in a perverse way, there is a bright spot, a factor that could limit the number of airplanes in the system for the next few months to a level that the agency can handle.“If we have fuel prices staying in the current range,” said Mr. Burnley, “we’re going to have fewer airplanes in the sky.”'"

"'08-05-09,'0','The hero of “OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies” might be described as a French equivalent of James Bond. Or even a precursor, since the first novel in which he appears predates Ian Fleming’s “Casino Royale” by a few years. But the template is basically the same: a dashing agent seducing, scheming and shooting his way through cold war trouble spots in the service of a fading imperial power.But this film, directed Michel Hazanavicius and starring Jean Dujardin as Agent 117 (also known as Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath), departs from the Bond model by pointedly spoofing its hero and his worldview. Sent to Egypt in the tense prelude to the Suez crisis of 1956, Hubert is blithely ignorant of that country’s history and culture, as well as shockingly retrograde in his treatment of women (perhaps not so shockingly really). The satire to which he is subjected nonetheless has an air of scolding didacticism. Bérénice Béjo, as his local foil and love interest, takes up the pedagogical burden. We’re all fond of Hubert, but we’re also so much more enlightened.In Mr. Hazanavicius’s hands, however, the techniques of action filmmaking appear to have stalled. Not that “Cairo, Nest of Spies” is meant to be a thriller, but even as a self-consciously anachronistic knockabout farce it rarely rises to the level of wit, either verbal or physical, manifested by the old “Get Smart” series. That syndication staple will be updated this summer in a big-screen version starring Steve Carell. If you can’t wait, and you don’t mind subtitles and some rather heavy-handed stabs at contemporary geopolitical relevance, “OSS 117” may tide you over.Opens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.Directed by Michel Hazanavicius; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Jean-François Halin, based on the OSS 117 novels by Jean Bruce; director of photography, Guillaume Schiffman; edited by Reynald Bertrand; music by Ludovic Bource and Kamel Ech-Cheikh; production designer, Maamar Ech-Cheikh; produced by Eric Altmayer and Nicolas Altmayer; released by Music Box Films.

"'08-05-09,'0','Male midlife crisis presents as pathological self-loathing in “Meet Bill,” an imperative to which the only sane response is: No thanks.Harnessing mostly fine actors to a wholly asinine script, the directors, Melisa Wallack and Bernie Goldmann, have created a movie as spineless and dithering as its benighted namesake. A sad-sack executive for his father-in-law’s bank, Bill (Aaron Eckhart) hates his unexciting job, unflattering hair and unwieldy paunch. Discovering his brittle wife (Elizabeth Banks) in flagrante with an oily newsman (Timothy Olyphant), Bill realizes that there’s more to life than a furtive Snickers habit. Following the sugar in his bloodstream, he applies for a doughnut franchise.Supposedly a film about finding your bliss, “Meet Bill” is really about losing your mind. Absorbing most of the punishment is the solid Mr. Eckhart — an actor more suited to corporate shark than bungling cuckold — though even Jessica Alba inspires pity for her glancing role as a lingerie saleswoman. (In one particularly pointless and creepy scene, her character enjoys a private display of women’s underwear — modeled by a teenage boy.)Taking unseemly delight in its hero’s suffering, “Meet Bill” is little more than an extended beat-down. “You have to swallow it,” says his despicable brother-in-law at a family dinner. He’s referring to the buckshot in Bill’s duck, but he could be summarizing his entire life.“Meet Bill” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

"'08-05-09,'0','Several major oil companies have agreed to pay the Suffolk County Water Authority $74 million for the cost of filtering a potentially hazardous additive in gasoline that has leaked from storage tanks into the groundwater, the agency said on Thursday.The money is part of a national settlement involving nearly 160 suits filed by water suppliers in 15 states against various oil companies that sell gasoline.The suits seek compensation for cleaning up the additive methyl tert-butyl ether, known as MTBE. Critics claim that MTBE is potentially carcinogenic, which the companies dispute, but it is now banned in the United States.About 70 percent of the companies that were sued agreed to settle all the suits for $423 million, so Suffolk is receiving about a sixth of the total.But the remaining companies refused to settle and will contest the suits in a jury trial scheduled for September in United States District Court in Manhattan, where the national litigation was consolidated.MTBE contaminated more than 450 water wells in Suffolk over the last two decades, the water agency said. Its chief executive, Steve Jones, estimated that the cost of filtration to ensure the water’s safety was $50 million to $100 million. The agency supplies water to 1.3 million residents, and the entire supply is pumped from the ground.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','But the prosecution did not produce a copy of the confession, and Imam Qatanani’s name was not on a court document the prosecution did provide. In addition, Mr. Guiora testified that it was unclear from the documents whether Imam Qatanani was even present in the courtroom at the time of his conviction.The defense has said Imam Qatanani was tortured in prison — an assertion that the prosecution conceded was likely — and was not aware he had been convicted.The lawyer for Imam Qatanani, Claudia Slovinksy, has contended that the government has denied him permanent residency in the United States because his brother-in-law, who was killed by the Israelis, was a senior Hamas military leader, and because his predecessor at the Islamic center, Mohammed el-Mezain, is awaiting retrial in a terrorism-financing case.But Judge Riefkohl stopped the prosecutor, Alan Wolf, who is with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, when he brought up Mr. el-Mezain. “I don’t want to get into inferences,” the judge said.Earlier Thursday, Imam Qatanani — smiling as he walked into the courtroom in his white robe and skullcap — said he felt beautiful. “I believe that justice will go through,” he said.He embraced almost everyone in the room and joked with the courtroom artist. He was followed by his six children — three of them American-born — and his wife, Sumia Abu Hanoud.By noon the crowd outside had grown to more than 300. The imam’s supporters were lining up in front of a megaphone, where they broadcast personal testimonials about him. The teenagers cheered as if they were at a pep rally — “2-4-6-8, Who do we appreciate?” — and wore T-shirts printed with a big green Q with an American flag inside it, the logo of Americans 4 Qatanani, a group the Paterson mosque founded in March in the support of the imam.The rabbis said they had come to support Imam Qatanani because at one time he had arranged for them to use a halal slaughterhouse in Paterson.One group of supporters, cheering more loudly than the rest, was made up of classmates of the imam’s 16-year-old daughter, Israa, who is a junior at Al-Ghazaly, a Muslim school in Teaneck.“I’ve been with Israa since first grade,” said Marwah Maasarani, 17. “I don’t want her to pick up and leave us all of a sudden.”At precisely 1:12 p.m., when it was time for the third of the Muslim daily prayers, a giant blue tarp was spread over the sidewalk, and a crowd knelt and prayed for 15 minutes. Imam Qatanani normally chants their prayers; this time, they used a recording blasted from a loudspeaker.“Now that’s unity,” said James Lewis, 50, a security guard who lives nearby, as he watched the group.'"

"'08-05-09,'0','BOSTON (Reuters) — The Fortress Investment Group, a hedge fund and private equity firm, reported a quarterly loss on Thursday.Fortress, one of a few publicly traded hedge and private equity firms, said its first-quarter net loss was $69 million, or 74 cents, after payments to its principals, in contrasted to profit of $62.1 million a year earlier.Pretax distributable earnings, which analysts follow more closely, stood at $58 million in the first quarter, below Wall Street estimates and barely a quarter of last year’s $220 million.Fortress shares fell 91 cents, or 6.25 percent, to close at $13.65 on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company listed its shares in February 2007.Demand for the company’s hedge and private equity funds cast the earnings numbers in a more positive light, some analysts said.“If the stock responds negatively to the headline miss, we see this as an excellent opportunity to buy a premier alternative manager at an attractive price,” a Bank of America analyst, Michael Hecht, wrote in a research note.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','“Without an act of the commission, you don’t get the money,” said Kenneth Gross, a campaign finance lawyer with Skadden, Arps.Mr. McCain has already begun returning checks designated for the general election to donors, but if the deadlock over nominees to the commission continues, campaign finance experts said he would need either a court order or an act of Congress to amend the statute so he could receive the public money.President Bush also decided on Tuesday to pull a pending renomination of the current chairman of the commission, David M. Mason, a Republican. Mr. Mason raised questions this year about Mr. McCain’s right to withdraw from the public financing system for the primary.Advocacy groups that work to counter the influence of money in politics immediately assailed the White House action, arguing it could be construed only as a blatantly political act, meant to benefit the McCain campaign.“President Bush’s dumping of Mason can only be viewed as a bald-faced and brazen attempt to wrongly manipulate an important enforcement decision by the nation’s campaign finance enforcement agency,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, an advocacy group, in a statement.Jill Hazelbaker, Mr. McCain’s communications director, did not directly answer when asked specific questions about whether Mr. McCain or his staff had pressed the White House and Mr. McConnell behind the scenes to end the deadlock over the commission.“McCain has consistently and publicly urged the Senate leadership and the White House to take steps to resolve the impasse, and he is glad that Senator Reid, Senator McConnell and the White House have now done so,” she said in an e-mailed statement, referring to Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. “The important thing at this stage is a speedy vote on the new nominations so that the commission can go back to work.”Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell, also declined to say whether Mr. McCain or his advisers had discussed the issue with the Republican leadership, saying only that many had been pressing for a resolution to the dispute.As for whether Mr. McCain lobbied specifically for Mr. Mason’s ouster, Trevor Potter, the campaign’s lawyer and a former F.E.C. chairman himself, dismissed the accusation in remarks posted on an election law blog. “These are the president’s appointments, and not Senator McCain’s,” he said on Election Law Blog, run by Rick Hasen, a Loyola Law School professor.Mr. Potter contended that the campaign had no issue with Mr. Mason, arguing that he had merely told the campaign earlier in the year that he believed the commission needed to vote on Mr. McCain’s withdrawal from the public financing system for the primary, something the campaign’s lawyers disagreed with.Mr. Potter said he believed that if Mr. Mason had remained on the commission once a quorum was restored, he would have ruled in Mr. McCain’s favor.In his letter to Mr. McCain in February, Mr. Mason had raised questions about whether Mr. McCain had used the promise of public financing to secure a $4 million loan he obtained in the fall to keep his campaign afloat, which would have bound him to accepting the public money.Mr. McCain had applied for public financing for the primary when his campaign was struggling, but he decided to bypass the system after his fund-raising improved. The public financing system gives candidates access to millions of dollars in matching money from a taxpayer fund but forces them to abide by strict spending caps before the party conventions. Mr. McCain has by now far exceeded the $54 million cap that he would have been bound by under public financing.The political deadlock over the commission had centered on objections of Senate Democrats to the nomination of Mr. von Spakovsky, whose work at the Justice Department angered civil rights advocates. Senate Republicans, led by Mr. McConnell, a fierce critic of campaign finance regulation, demanded that Mr. von Spakovsky be voted on in a package with other nominees, something the Democrats refused to do.The White House declined on Tuesday to withdraw Mr. von Spakovsky’s nomination but a spokeswoman, Emily Lawrimore, said Republican officials were now willing to allow each of the nominees to be voted upon separately.Bob Bauer, Senator Barack Obama’s campaign lawyer, penned an essay on his own legal Web site that sought to connect the dots with the White House’s announcement.“In this one move, the White House ended McCain’s accountability for his use or abuse of the primary public financing system while putting him in position to take money for the general,” he said, adding: “It is inconceivable that McCain was not informed of the plan. In fact, it is highly probable that he was involved in its formulation or its approval.”At minimum, said several campaign finance experts, Republican officials obviously understood the implications for Mr. McCain.Even Mr. Gross, who represents clients from both parties, said the decision to pull Mr. Mason’s renomination made it difficult to believe that Mr. McCain was not involved in some way.“It is sort of further indicia that Senator McCain’s fingerprints are somehow part of the motivating factor of getting these commission seats filled,” Mr. Gross said. “I didn’t get a license in detective work, but I don’t think you’d have to be a certified detective to figure it out.”Asked how Mr. McCain could go about getting the funds released, without a functioning commission, Mr. Gross said he could apply for a court order for the Treasury Department to release the funds. But he added, “We’ve never had this scenario before.”“From a procedural standpoint, it’s not entirely clear how it would happen,” he said.Congress could also pass some type of rider for Mr. McCain to obtain the money without a functioning commission, but that would force Mr. McCain into the awkward position of making entreaties to a Democratic-led Congress so he could obtain the money needed for his campaign.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','The fare and fee increases are an attempt by airlines to alleviate the latest wave of financial pain afflicting the industry. A number of major carriers posted losses in the first quarter, while a half-dozen smaller carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection or announced plans to cease operations during the past month.High fuel prices are pushing big airlines like Delta and Northwest to merge, while US Airways and United are discussing a deal. Several major airlines have announced plans to eliminate flights over the next few months in a bid to reduce expenses. Fewer seats in the sky give the airlines more power over pricing, allowing them to push through these increases even as the economy softens.It can be hard for travelers to keep track of all the new fees. For example, airlines like American, Delta, Northwest and United now charge $25 to check a second bag, which has long been free.Other airlines, like Spirit, are charging to check bags at all ($10 if space for bags is reserved online, or $20 if a traveler shows up at the airport without a baggage reservation).An in-flight meal, also once free, can add $10 to a trip. JetBlue is charging $10 to reserve seats that have extra legroom, while US Airways will soon charge $5 to $30 to reserve a window or an aisle seat in the front of the plane under its Choice Seats program, according to SmarterTravel.com, a Web site that offers consumers travel advice. Until now, those seats have mainly been reserved for frequent fliers or full-fare-paying passengers.“If summer travelers are expecting to see the same sorts of air fares they saw last summer, they’re going to be very unpleasantly surprised,” said Tim Winship, editor of SmarterTravel.com. “With both the net air fares and what people end up paying because of the additional fees, everything is going to be higher in summer 2008 than in summer 2007.”Leila Stollman of West Bloomfield, Mich., soured on flying after recently spending several days trying to find a reasonably priced flight to Colorado to visit her daughter. She wound up spending $446 round trip, or $150 more than she had planned to pay, based on earlier trips.“I can’t begin to tell you how frustrating that was,” she said. “The airlines are already nickel-and-diming us to death, and now tickets have gone up.”Mr. Winship said many travelers are frustrated by trying to figure out exactly what is included in the price of a ticket. There is no standard practice on airline Web sites for explaining extra fees. They simply have to provide the information in some fashion.“Not only is there no transparency, there is no consistency to the way the airlines are not transparent,” Mr. Winship said. “It adds insult to injury.”Delta.com, for example, breaks out the price in terms of the air fare and the fees when a passenger is quoted a ticket price.But United and American post only the total air fare, meaning passengers have to explore further to find out how much of what they are paying is for the ticket, and which portion is for fees.For example, a $435 ticket on United from Chicago to Los Angeles includes $70 in fees, explained when a passenger clicks on “view price breakdown.”Likewise, American posts the total fare until a passenger clicks through to complete the reservation. Then the price is spelled out in terms of the air fare plus fees and taxes, which were $21 on a trip from Dallas to Chicago.Airlines say fares may rise further, given the steady climb of the price of jet fuel. “Fuel is a substantial hit, and we do need to cover the cost of fuel in our ticket prices in the long run,” said Edward Bastian, Delta’s president and chief financial officer.“We’ll be looking for opportunities” for further fare increases, Gary C. Kelly, chief executive of Southwest Airlines, added last month.At some point, the fares will reach a level where consumers decide to stay home, or drive instead — when they can.Sylvie Foley, who lives in suburban Detroit, has watched the fares to Paris soar for her semi-annual trips home. For instance, she paid about $500 round trip during the summer of 2005. But the best fare she has been able to find for a late summer trip this year is $1,100. “I’ll have to see whether I can afford to go back or not,” she said.Chris Tobias, a steel company representative from Hartford, said his company was pushing its employees to book tickets as far in advance as possible in order to get the cheapest fares. He is paying 20 percent more round trip for the flights he regularly takes to Chicago and Minneapolis.“This could make it harder to do my job,” he said. “The surcharges for gas haven’t helped.”For vacationers, however, there is no one to pick up the extra tab. Stephanie Barga recently paid $350 for a round-trip ticket back home to Houston, about $100 more than she paid in 2007.Said Ms. Barga, a speech pathologist from Toledo, Ohio: “Thank goodness I’ll be moving to Houston soon.”'"
"'08-05-09,'0','Agricultural markets remain deeply unsettled. For several years, farmers have been unable to catch up with rapidly rising demand for food and animal feed, and the world’s grain stocks have been falling. The situation peaked in recent months as prices spiraled out of control, setting off hoarding in many countries and food riots in at least 19 of them.United States corn prices hit yet another record on Thursday, just above $6.30 a bushel, amid fears that rainy weather in the Midwest would suppress yields this summer. Most corn is not used for food; it is used for animal feed and, increasingly, for ethanol production. The high corn prices of recent years have prompted farmers to plant more of it, displacing crops like wheat and contributing to higher food prices.Experts say that shoppers may not see much benefit from the recent price dips. Many retailers and wholesalers around the world had not yet passed the full extent of this spring’s price increases along to consumers.The spot price of a heavily traded good grade of rice exported by Thailand peaked at $1,100 a ton in late April, with a few purchases at even higher prices by buyers demanding huge quantities. But traders said Thursday that the going price was $880 to $920 a ton, although buyers of large quantities could still expect to pay more.“I don’t expect a crash in prices, but I think there is a correction,” said Ben Savage, the managing director for rice at Jackson Son & Company in London, one of the world’s oldest rice brokerage firms.Rice is perhaps the world’s most politically fragile crop. Nearly half the world’s population depends on it as a staple food. An even higher proportion of the world’s poor people depend on it, as imported rice has displaced local crops in cities across Africa and the Caribbean over the last decade, even as the crop retained its primacy in Asia.The latest rice prices are still far above the price of $385 a ton prevailing in mid-January, and even further above the 2003 price of $200 a ton. Even with the slight decline in prices, the cost of rice remains high enough to put considerable strain on poor families in countries like the Philippines and Nigeria, the world’s two largest rice importers.“The market has been a buyer’s market for 40 years and recently it switched to being a seller’s market, particularly in the last few months,” said Vichai Sriprasert, president of the Riceland International Company in Bangkok.While rice prices have fallen in recent days, global rice consumption remains greater than production, he said, adding, “It will remain a seller’s market for years to come.”The recent cyclone in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, heavily damaged rice fields there and sent rice prices soaring in the country. But rice traders said this had not pushed up world prices because Myanmar’s exports were tiny and the country and aid agencies lacked the money to buy large quantities of rice on world markets.“I don’t think the Burmese cyclone is having any significant effect,” said Korbsook Iamsuri, the secretary general of the Rice Exporters Association in Thailand.Experts cite a range of reasons for the dip in commodity prices. Traders said that some speculative money might be moving out of agricultural commodities, putting downward pressure on prices. Additionally, it is clear the price spikes of recent months suppressed some demand. And the increases encouraged farmers to plant more crops on land that is marginally fertile and not worth farming when prices are lower.Moreover, rice exporters, after clinging to inventories as prices climbed rapidly, have begun to sell. Many Thai rice exporters bet on continued increases in rice prices by building up large inventories with borrowed money, but they are now struggling to meet interest payments on their loans, said Mr. Vichai, the president emeritus of the Rice Exporters Association in Thailand.“Now that every one of us has overstocked ourselves, then when there’s a sign that prices have overshot, we all get excited” and become more willing to sell, he said.The government of the Philippines, the largest rice importer, has played a role in the turnaround in market sentiment. Receiving only one bid for a rice tender on Monday, the government decided it had enough rice in its stockpiles and would wait until prices fell before buying more.“We currently have a sufficient supply of rice and are only looking to import supplies to further strengthen our reserves,” the agriculture secretary, Arthur Yap, said in a written reply to questions. “Given this flexibility, we will only purchase from the international market when the price and other terms are suitable, and in this instance, we decided to defer the process and to wait for a better price.”'"
"'08-05-09,'0','WASHINGTON — Did Senator John McCain not vote for George W. Bush in 2000?That question has kicked up a minor ruckus in political circles this week as Arianna Huffington and the McCain campaign have traded he-said, she-said barbs.On her Huffington Post Web site on Monday, Ms. Huffington, the liberal blogger, said she had heard Mr. McCain say at a Los Angeles dinner party shortly after the 2000 election that he had not voted for the president he has now publicly embraced in his own quest for the White House. The McCain campaign swiftly quashed the account and said Ms. Huffington had a book to promote and would make anything up.“She’s a flake and a poser and an attention-seeking diva,” Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest aides, told The Washington Post.Now two other guests at the same dinner, given by the actress Candice Bergen, at her home in Beverly Hills, say they heard much the same thing as Ms. Huffington. Both of them, the former “West Wing” actors Bradley Whitford and Richard Schiff, were asked by Ms. Huffington to speak to The New York Times. Mr. Whitford said he would be supporting the Democratic nominee and had donated to Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama; Mr. Schiff is supporting Mr. Obama.Mr. Whitford, who played Josh Lyman, the deputy White House chief of staff on the NBC series, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that he was sitting across from Mr. McCain and next to Ms. Huffington at the small dinner and that he was startled to hear the senator sharply criticize Mr. Bush. The senator has long blamed the Bush campaign for smear tactics against his family in the 2000 South Carolina primary, but by the end of the campaign Mr. McCain was publicly supporting his rival.“McCain was just sort of going off on how much he disliked Bush and the horrible things that the Bush campaign had done to his family in South Carolina, and his exasperation with Bush about his ridiculous tax cuts and he really wanted to talk to him about it, but he said the guy doesn’t have the concentration, and you talk for 10 minutes and then the guy wants to talk about baseball,” Mr. Whitford said.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','The Speedo representative walked onto a pool deck in South Austin, Tex., a salesman there to try to lead two Nike athletes into temptation. He showed up at a Longhorn Aquatics practice last week with two bags containing an assortment of Speedo swimsuits, including the hotter-than-a-jalapeño LZR Racer, the uniform of choice for swimmers who have accounted for 36 of the 40 world records set this year.Aaron Peirsol, a two-time Olympic backstroker and a four-time medalist, was summoned from the pool by his coach, Eddie Reese, to meet with the Speedo man. He picked out an LZR Racer and disappeared into the locker room to try it on. He was followed by the breaststroker Brendan Hansen, who won three medals at the 2004 Olympics.At an Olympic news media summit in Chicago in April, Hansen had begged to differ with Mark Schubert, the United States national team director, who has said that anybody not wearing the LZR Racer would be at a distinct competitive disadvantage at the Olympic trials this summer in Omaha.“I’ve looked at the research done on both suits, I’ve done testing on both suits, and I don’t see a difference,” Hansen said, referring to the Speedo and Nike brands.He added that the designers of the Nike suits were responsible for the racing uniform worn by the cyclist Lance Armstrong.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of newly laid-off workers seeking unemployment benefits dropped much more than expected last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday.In its weekly report, the department said that applications for unemployment benefits fell to 365,000, a decline of 18,000 from the previous week. Economists expected a decrease of about 5,000.Weekly jobless claims have been exceptionally volatile in recent weeks because of strike-related layoffs in the auto industry and an unusually early Easter, which has played havoc with the government’s seasonal adjustment measurements.Many economists say they believe that the prolonged housing slump and the severe credit crisis have pushed the economy into a recession. For that reason, they expect layoffs to rise in the coming months as the unemployment rate climbs higher.But they also said the downturn might be relatively mild and brief, leading to less-severe job losses than in previous recessions.The report on jobless claims showed the total number of laid-off workers receiving benefits dipped slightly, to 3.02 million, for the week that ended April 26 but remained above 3 million for the second consecutive week.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','Wall Street closed a quiet session with a moderate advance Thursday, with energy and other commodities companies leading the market as oil prices extended their record-breaking run.The price of crude oil swept past $124 a barrel in late New York Mercantile Exchange trading, while gasoline rose to a record of its own at the pump, climbing to a national average of nearly $3.65 a gallon.Although the rising price of oil ignited concerns about inflation on Wednesday, knocking the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 200 points, stocks managed to hold on to their gains even as oil rose Thursday.The Dow rose 52.43 points, or 0.41 percent, to 12,866.78.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 5.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,397.68. The Nasdaq composite index rose 12.75 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,451.24.Companies that would benefit the most from higher commodities prices — the oil companies and metals producers like Alcoa — helped lift the major indexes.'"
"'08-05-09,'0','Rococo was in vogue during a period when decorative arts were considered on a par with fine arts. The style originated in France but quickly spread to countries as far away as Russia.“Rococo was a universal style in Europe,” Reinier Baarsen, curator of decorative arts at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, said. “It was picked up in England, Italy, Portugal and Spain. Only in Germany was it a great original style on its own.”The advantage of studying Rococo at an auction house (as opposed to a museum) is that you can actually look under pieces and touch carvings without setting off alarms.Many examples for sale deserve such scrutiny.Christie’s Lot 300 is a sinuous Louis XV ormolu-mounted black and gilt-japanned desk that was owned by the Rothschilds of Vienna until it was seized in 1938. Stamped by Jacques Dubois, who became a master craftsman in Paris in 1742, the desk incorporates prized chinoiserie landscapes into a curved apron. Fine leafy mounts on the corners descend toward the feet as trailing garlands. Lacquered Rococo furniture was the most prized of all, which may explain the estimate: $700,000 to $1 million.Lot 296 is a complete Louis XV paneled room, circa 1750, estimated at $100,000 to $200,000. The gray-painted panels have frames with carved C-scrolls, acanthus leaves, shells and more vines. Some have openings for fireplaces, doorways and mirrors.Decades ago they were installed in an Upper East Side town house. Edulji F. Dinshaw, a young Parsi from Mumbai, settled in New York with his sister, Bachoo, before World War II. He decorated his house with the panels, 18th-century French furniture (including Marie Antoinette’s cylinder desk from Fontainebleau) and a rock crystal chandelier. Around 1960 the town house — 1081 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street — was pulled down to make way for 1080 Fifth Avenue, and the boiseries were removed.Sotheby’s June 3 sale of French furniture, which goes on view May 29, includes a Louis XV marquetry desk attributed to Jean-Pierre Latz, a German-born craftsman who became a royal cabinetmaker by 1741. The desk has ormolu masks and is estimated at $1 million to $1.5 million.Even Rococo reproductions can be costly. Marvin Alexander Inc., a Manhattan gallery specializing in antique chandeliers, has a pair of exceptional Louis XV-style three-branch bronze sconces, 43 inches high. Gilded in 21-karat gold, each sconce has candleholders that resemble irises in bloom. The pair costs $87,000 because the Paris craftsman who made them said they were so difficult to make that he would never try again.Nearly all the contents of Carter’s Grove, a historic Georgian brick manor on the James River in Virginia, go on view Saturday through Monday at Northeast Auctions in Portsmouth, N.H., for a sale to be held May 17.The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation is selling the furnishings after having sold the house and its 400-acre property, a 1755 plantation that it owned and once operated as a museum. Last December Halsey Minor, the Virginia-born founder of the online media company CNet, bought the plantation for $15.3 million. He plans to breed thoroughbred horses there.The 483-lot sale comprises furniture, paintings, ceramics, mirrors and clocks. They can be seen at northeastauctions.com.“The collection was assembled in the 1930s at the height of the Colonial Revival period, with antiques and reproductions,” said Ronald L. Hurst, the chief curator at Colonial Williamsburg. The museum will keep an East Virginia tea table from 1765 and an 18th-century Philadelphia easy chair, because it retains its original upholstery.“We are selling everything except the pieces Williamsburg decided to keep,” said Ronald Bourgeault, the owner of Northeast Auctions.Archibald and Molly McCrea, who lived at Carter’s Grove in the 1930s and ’40s, furnished the house.Several lots came from Westover Plantation, a 35-minute drive up the James River. Mrs. McCrea bought them in 1921, including a pair of Chinese Chippendale-style mirrors, a four-poster bed and three English 19th-century Gothic-style mahogany bookcases that are 11 feet tall and, together, 15 feet wide.The two top lots, also from Westover, are large allegorical paintings after originals by Luca Giordano from around 1670. Each is estimated at $30,000 to $50,000.The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation hopes to raise a total of $500,000 to $1 million from the sale.'"

"'08-05-10,'0','The McCain-Obama dispute about Hamas began last month, after Ahmed Yousef, a political adviser to the group’s leadership in Gaza, made complimentary remarks about Mr. Obama in an interview with WABC radio in New York. After initially complaining that “everybody tries to sound like he is a friend of Israel” when out on the campaign trail, including Mr. Obama, Mr. Yousef shifted tone.“We like Mr. Obama,” Mr. Yousef said, “and we hope that he will win the election.”“I do believe that Mr. Obama is like John Kennedy, a great man with great principles,” he continued. “He has a vision to change America, to make it in a position to lead the world community, but not with domination and arrogance.”Though Hamas describes itself as both a political party and a movement with an armed wing, the State Department, as well as Israel and several other countries, classifies it as a terrorist organization. The group has sponsored suicide bombings against Israeli military and civilian targets, and its charter calls for the elimination of Israel and its replacement by an Islamic Palestinian state.The United States has pursued a policy of isolating Hamas while trying to strengthen moderate Palestinian leaders.For his part, Mr. McCain has taken pride in the enmity with which he regards Hamas. “I think that the people should understand that I will be Hamas’s worst nightmare,” he said late last month in a conference call with conservative bloggers.Conversely, he has tried to portray Mr. Obama as sympathetic to Hamas.“I think it is very clear who Hamas wants to be the next president of the United States,” Mr. McCain said to the bloggers. “If Senator Obama is favored by Hamas, I think people can make judgments accordingly.”And in a fund-raising letter sent out in April, a spokesman for Mr. McCain wrote: “We need change in America, but not the kind of change that wins kind words from Hamas, surrenders in Iraq and will hold unconditional talks with Iranian President Ahmadinejad.”In particular, the McCain campaign has explicitly linked Mr. Yousef’s statements to Mr. Obama’s repeatedly stated willingness to talk to so-called “rogue states” like Iran, North Korea and Cuba.“Well, Iran is obviously an important supporter of Hamas,” Mr. McCain said Friday.“Senator Obama wants to sit down and have negotiations and discussions with the person who just yesterday called Israel a quote ‘stinking corpse,’ ” he said, referring to Mr. Ahmadinejad, and “who continues to advocate quote ‘wiping Israel off the map.’ ”Susan E. Rice, a former State Department and National Security Council official who is a foreign policy adviser to the Democratic candidate, said that “for political purposes, Senator Obama’s opponents on the right have distorted and reframed” his views. Mr. McCain and his surrogates have repeatedly stated that Mr. Obama would be willing to meet “unconditionally” with Mr. Ahmadinejad. But Dr. Rice said that this was not the case for Iran or any other so-called “rogue” state. Mr. Obama believes “that engagement at the presidential level, at the appropriate time and with the appropriate preparation, can be used to leverage the change we need,” Dr. Rice said. “But nobody said he would initiate contacts at the presidential level; that requires due preparation and advance work.”Mr. Obama has been clear in making a distinction between his willingness to talk “not just to countries we like, but those we don’t,” as he puts it, and Hamas and other political movements similar to it. “Hamas is not a state,” Mr. Obama told a Jewish group last month. “Hamas is a terrorist organization.”Responding to Mr. McCain’s accusations in an interview with CNN on Thursday, Mr. Obama elaborated on that position. He again called Hamas a terrorist group and said that “we should not talk to them unless they recognize Israel, renounce violence and are willing to abide by previous accords” that Israel has negotiated with its neighbors and with the Palestine Liberation Organization.That is not a new position for Mr. Obama. In 2006, he, like Mr. McCain, was a co-sponsor of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which called on “members of the international community to avoid contact with and refrain from financially supporting the terrorist organization Hamas” until it met all of the same requirements that Mr. Obama enumerated again on Thursday.'"
"'08-05-10,'0','“The Fever Chart,” a well-made trilogy by Naomi Wallace exploring that cauldron that is the Middle East, has absorbing characters and sharp, evocative dialogue. Just as important, though, is what it doesn’t have: strap-on bombs or heartfelt hugs.The opening piece brings together an Israeli soldier (Arian Moayed) and a bitter Palestinian woman (Lameece Issaq), and immediately you begin expecting to see what has become a theatrical cliché: they will swap arguments and personal stories, then she will strip off a layer of clothes to reveal the bomb underneath. But Ms. Wallace has a much more subtle tale of loss to tell, and she tells it beautifully.The second work, the program’s most substantive, again brings together Palestinian and Israeli. The Palestinian (Waleed F. Zuaiter) is a father who has lost a son, and the Israeli (Natalie Gold) is a young health clinic worker with an attitude. They spend a lot of time in elliptical conversation — the one familiar aspect of these meet-the-enemy plays that Ms. Wallace doesn’t avoid — but eventually we learn why the man has sought the woman out.It’s a plot device you might find on the Lifetime channel, but the obligatory feel-good embrace, thankfully, never materializes. There are no easy solutions in Ms. Wallace’s world, just as in life.The program ends with an Iraqi soldier’s monologue, sublimely delivered by Omar Metwally.There is an agenda to all these pieces — Israel and the United States are the bad guys, if subtly — but they don’t browbeat you with it. And given that the production is part of Public Lab, a series at the Public Theater that presents new works with minimal rehearsal, the acting, under Jo Bonney’s direction, is exceptional.'"
"'08-05-10,'0','Circuit City, the electronics chain, said Friday that it would allow the video rental company Blockbuster to examine its books, a shift from its initial, highly skeptical stance toward Blockbuster’s unsolicited takeover bid.A letter from the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn, who is Blockbuster’s largest shareholder, seemed to be an important factor in the change. Circuit City said that Mr. Icahn had pledged, with certain conditions, to buy the company on his own if Blockbuster should be unable to finance the deal. Circuit City said in a statement that “this written commitment answers some of its questions with regard to Blockbuster’s and Mr. Icahn’s previous disclosures.”Circuit City shares closed up 28 cents, or 5.85 percent, at $5.07; Blockbuster dropped 2 cents, to $2.66. Blockbuster has said it would pay at least $6 a share for Circuit City.The announcement, which added that Circuit City had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives, indicated some progress for Blockbuster’s bid, which is valued at more than $1 billion in cash. Many on Wall Street have called the deal a long shot, in part because of the difficulty of financing it.The announcement also demonstrated how, in these tight credit markets, having a deep-pocketed partner — like Mr. Icahn, or, in the case of the Mars deal to buy the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, Warren E. Buffett — is a valuable asset in attempting a large takeover.When Blockbuster first made its bid last month, Circuit City said it had “fundamental questions regarding the structure, sources and uses of funds” for the proposed deal.'"
"'08-05-10,'0','IT appears to be a conundrum. Banks tell the Federal Reserve that they are tightening loan standards across the board, and that demand for loans is down from consumers as well as businesses. But the amount of money they are lending has been rising at an unusually fast pace.The explanation appears to lie in the fact that credit is now expanding in the areas where banks are, at least temporarily, powerless to halt loan growth, no matter how much they wish to do so. Both consumers and businesses have access to lines of credit. And in the immediate aftermath of the tightening of credit, they began to use those lines.The result is best seen in commercial and industrial loans from banks. Such loans are the way that businesses finance themselves if they cannot issue securities, or choose not to. The banks say they have been tightening credit standards for more than a year, and anecdotal evidence confirms that is true.But the growth rate of commercial and industrial loans took off last summer, and has only recently begun to slow. It is still growing faster than at any time in recent years before the banks tightened credit, as reflected in the accompanying chart, which shows the annual rate of change in such loans over six-month periods.What happened was that many companies that financed themselves through securities markets, particularly commercial paper, had paid for backup lines of credit. The banks thought few of those lines would ever be used, but suddenly many were.'"
"'08-05-10,'0','“Taxpayers shouldn’t be taking on the risk of foreclosure,” said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.The measure now goes to the Senate, where it faces opposition among Republicans who have tapped into a broad wave of bailout resentment in states less affected by the crisis. And the failure of the House to adopt it by a veto-proof margin is likely to further embolden recalcitrant Republicans in the Senate who have so far managed to block action, Democratic supporters of the measure said on Friday.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who heads the Banking Committee, said Friday that he was hoping to quickly complete negotiations with the ranking Republican on the committee, Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, and have the committee vote on a measure next week.“We’re getting very close to a compromise but I can’t promise it will happen,” Mr. Dodd said. He said any measure that did not have Republican support would almost certainly fail. He also said that if the committee failed to adopt a measure quickly, there was probably not enough time in the Congressional session to try again.Under the voluntary plan that was approved by the House, borrowers at risk of default would be able to refinance their loans at a more affordable 30-year fixed-rate mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration.In exchange for avoiding foreclosure, lenders would have to agree to reduce the principal balance. The borrowers would pay a monthly insurance fee that would go to a fund to protect taxpayers from losses. A consensus was emerging on Friday that if Congress adopted a measure, it would likely be far more modest than the one passed by the House, which itself has been criticized by housing groups for being too small.Still, there is a clear split among Republicans, and perhaps within the administration, over how to proceed. Last month, Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, sharply pivoted and called for government aid to homeowners in danger of losing their homes.His plan was more modest than the Democratic plan. But it was notable because, only a month earlier, he had warned against broad government intervention to solve the mortgage crisis, saying it was “not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers.”Democratic strategists said the change reflected the importance on the electoral map of states like Florida, Ohio and Michigan, all hit hard by the crisis.Other prominent officials, including the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have recently urged Congress to take steps to assist borrowers to avert broader economic problems.Last week, Sheila C. Bair, chairman of the F.D.I.C. and a former assistant secretary at the Treasury Department in the Bush administration, proposed a $50 billion government loan program to help struggling borrowers. The Bush administration publicly distanced itself from the proposal.After administration officials engaged in talks with House Democrats over their measure, President Bush said on Wednesday that he would veto it. The Democrats say they made several changes sought by the administration in an effort to gain its support. But in a statement of administration policy, the White House said the legislation was burdensome and prescriptive.“It would force the Federal Housing Administration and taxpayers to take on excessive risk, and jeopardize F.H.A.’s financial solvency,” the statement said.Even lawmakers who have criticized some elements of the House measure said they were hearing mixed signals from the Bush administration.“I was surprised by the White House threatened veto,” said Senator Mel Martinez, a Florida Republican who served earlier in the Bush administration as the secretary of housing and urban development. “The White House message has not been consistent.”Mr. Martinez said that the “obtuse” nature of the veto threat suggested to him that the administration had issued it as a negotiating tactic.'"
"'08-05-10,'0','Here in Denver, for example, ridership was up 8 percent in the first three months of the year compared with last year, despite a fare increase in January and a slowing economy, which usually means fewer commuters. Several routes on the system have reached capacity, particularly at rush hour, for the first time.“We are at a tipping point,” said Clarence W. Marsella, chief executive of the Denver Regional Transportation District, referring to gasoline prices.Transit systems in metropolitan areas like Minneapolis, Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth and San Francisco reported similar jumps. In cities like Houston, Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Charlotte, N.C., commuters in growing numbers are taking advantage of new bus and train lines built or expanded in the last few years. The American Public Transportation Association reports that localities with fewer than 100,000 people have also experienced large increases in bus ridership.In New York, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reports that ridership was up the first three months of the year by more than 5 percent on the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad, while M.T.A. bus ridership was up 2.3 percent. New York City subway use was up 6.8 percent for January and February. Ridership on New Jersey Transit trains was up more than 5 percent for the first three months of the year.The increase in transit use coincides with other signs that American motorists are beginning to change their driving habits, including buying smaller vehicles. The Energy Department recently predicted that Americans would consume slightly less gasoline this year than last — for the first yearly decline since 1991.Oil prices broke yet another record on Friday, climbing $2.27, to $125.96 a barrel. The national average for regular unleaded gasoline reached $3.67 a gallon, up from $3.04 a year ago, according to AAA.But meeting the greater demand for mass transit is proving difficult. The cost of fuel and power for public transportation is about three times that of four years ago, and the slowing economy means local sales tax receipts are down, so there is less money available for transit services. Higher steel prices are making planned expansions more expensive.Typically, mass transit systems rely on fares to cover about a third of their costs, so they depend on sales taxes and other government funding. Few states use gas tax revenue for mass transit.In Denver, transportation officials expected to pay $2.62 a gallon for diesel this year, but they are now paying $3.20. Every penny increase costs the Denver Regional Transportation District an extra $100,000 a year. And it is bracing for a $19 million shortfall in sales taxes this year from original projections.“I’d like to put more buses on the street,” Mr. Marsella said. “I can’t expand service as much as I’d like to.”Average annual growth from sales tax revenue for the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, a rail service that connects San Francisco with Oakland, has been 4.5 percent over the last 15 years. It expects that to fall to 2 percent this year, and electricity costs are rising.“This is a year of abundant caution and concern,” said Dorothy W. Dugger, BART’s general manager, even though ridership on the line was up nearly 5 percent in the first quarter of the year.Nevertheless, Ms. Dugger is happy that mass transit is winning over converts. “The future of mass transit in this country has never been brighter,” she said.Other factors may be driving people to mass transit, too. Wireless computers turn travel time into productive work time, and more companies are offering workers subsidies to take buses or trains. Traffic congestion is getting worse in many cities, and parking more expensive.Michael Brewer, an accountant who had always driven the 36-mile trip to downtown Houston from the suburb of West Belford, said he had been thinking about switching to the bus for the last two years. The final straw came when he put $100 of gas into his Pontiac over four days a couple of weeks ago.“Finally I was ready to trade my independence for the savings,” he said while waiting for a bus.Brayden Portillo, a freshman at the University of Colorado Denver, drove from his home in the northern suburbs to the downtown campus in his Jeep Cherokee the entire first semester of the school year, enjoying the rap and disco music blasting from his CD player.He switched to the bus this semester because he was spending $40 a week on gas — half his salary as a part-time store clerk. “Finally, I thought this is stupid,” he said, and he is using the savings to pay down a credit card debt.The sudden jump in ridership comes after several years of steady, gradual growth. Americans took 10.3 billion trips on public transportation last year, up 2.1 percent from 2006. Transit managers are predicting growth of 5 percent or more this year, the largest increase in at least a decade.“If we are in a recession or economic downturn, we should be seeing a stagnation or decrease in ridership, but we are not,” said Daniel Grabauskas, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which serves the Boston area. “Fuel prices are without question the single most important factor that is driving people to public transportation.”Some cities are seeing spectacular gains. The Charlotte Area Transit System, which has a new light rail line, reported that it logged more than two million trips in February, up more than 34 percent from February 2007.Caltrain, the commuter rail line that serves the San Francisco Peninsula and the Santa Clara Valley, set a record for average weekday ridership in February of 36,993, a 9.3 increase from 2007, according to its most recent public calculation.The South Florida Regional Transportation Authority, which operates a commuter rail system from Miami to Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach, posted a rise of more than 20 percent in rider numbers this March and April as monthly ridership climbed to 350,000.“Nobody believed that people would actually give up their cars to ride public transportation,” said Joseph J. Giulietti, executive director of the authority. “But in the last year, and last several months in particular, we have seen exactly that.”'"

"'08-05-11,'0','In responding to readers’ questions, I often discuss why a proposed act is wrong. But it is also incumbent on me to suggest more ethical alternatives. Below, I revisit a few recent answers in which I failed to propose a better course of action when one was available — as many of you pointed out, and quite rightly.A young woman wanted to send medicine to a friend in Mali who had malaria. If this woman’s physician father would declare, falsely, that the medicine was for her own use, she could obtain a full course of medicine for $10 through her insurance company rather than spend many times that, the cost to the uninsured, enabling her to send more of it to her friend: clever, altruistic and crooked. I urged her to acquire the medicine honestly. A former physician at the U.S. Embassy in Mali cautioned that medicine sent from the U.S. could arrive too late to help. He (and several other readers) suggested wiring the money so the sufferer could purchase the drugs locally. “A full, curative course of safe and effective malaria treatment is available from the pharmacies in Mali for approximately $10 to $20!” he wrote in an e-mail message — a solution faster, cheaper and better than mine. (And not even the cheapest: other sources claimed lower costs.) This, of course, assumes that the dollar is still strong enough against the West African franc to buy much of anything, but I can dream.J. T. wondered if his neighbor had the right to cut down trees on his own property if doing so deprived J. T. of privacy, shade, oxygen and beauty. Legally, yes, I ruled; ethically, no. Many readers disagreed, arguing that property rights prevail. Some declared that if J. T. wanted these leafy benefits, he should plant his own trees on his own property. I considered that but dismissed it as impractical — saplings take years to reach privacy-producing height — and thus was undone not by my moral reasoning but my arboreal ignorance. Botanically savvy readers suggested varieties of trees, shrubs and ornamental grasses that grow quickly. (A gleefully vindictive fellow proposed planting bamboo that would swiftly overrun the grounds of the tree-slaughtering neighbor.) One person suggested that a landscape architect could design small mounds or terraces to give young trees an instant boost in height. Others pointed out this happy consequence of J. T.’s planting his own trees: they would stand as a verdant rebuke to his neighbor. (As Joyce Kilmer did not write: I think that I shall never see/A poem vengeful as a tree.)On one occasion in March, I erred not only by providing an insufficient answer but by also failing to understand the question: I misconstrued a technical term translated from German to English and thereby broke new ground in getting it wrong. In his original query to me, Karsten Roth, writing from Berlin, asked about placing a towel and bag atop a “sunbed” to reserve it. Astute fact checkers discovered that he meant a poolside lounge chair, something customarily and properly reserved in just this way, as many readers affirmed, often with disconcerting ferocity (perhaps a consequence of overexposure to the sun). Alas, I took Roth’s “sunbed” to be one of those coffin-shaped electric tanning tables: that’s the common American term for them. (So named, presumably, as a sly allusion to “deathbed.”) Because they are used for only a few minutes at a time and are in short supply compared with beach chairs, you ought not render them unavailable for hours. I could have — should have — avoided this bilingual gaffe with a phone call. (Apparently it’s now possible to call someone in a whole other country. Amazing!)

Franzen has a league-high and franchise-record 12 goals in the postseason. He will remain in Detroit for more tests while the team travels to Dallas for Game 3 on Monday night.“It caught everybody by surprise,” Helm told the CBC in an interview during the first intermission.As the game ended, Red Wings goaltender Chris Osgood appeared to poke Stars center Mike Ribeiro with the handle of his stick. Ribeiro then slashed Osgood across the chest from behind the net. Ribeiro was called for a match penalty; Osgood was not penalized.“Even if I did butt-end him, it was an accident,” Osgood said.Dallas Coach Dave Tippett blamed Osgood for the fracas after seeing a replay on video. “Ribeiro is actually letting up on the guy and Osgood just sticks his stick out and butt-ends him,” he said. “Ribeiro is not going to turn around and chop the goalie like that without having something happening.”Osgood made 17 saves to improve to 8-0 as a starter this postseason.

"'08-05-11,'0','Mr. Obama’s campaign is firing up voter-registration efforts and sending troops to Ohio and Pennsylvania, states that he lost in the primaries but that his aides said he must win to capture the White House. Mr. McCain’s advisers said they had tracked Mr. Obama’s struggles with blue-collar voters there and would open campaign headquarters in both states in early June.Beyond that, aides to the two men said Latino voters would be central to victory in a swath of Western states now viewed as prime battlefields, including Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico.These decisions by Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama to look ahead to the fall reflect their conclusion that it is only a matter of time before Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York steps away from the fight for the Democratic nomination.Mr. McCain is looking first to states where President Bush narrowly lost in 2004 and where Mr. Obama lost primaries, starting with New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. Mr. Obama is looking to states where he won caucuses and primaries — including some, like Virginia, that have been solidly Republican in recent presidential elections — as well as others where he has organizations in place.And the two sides have produced television advertisements that will be rolled out as soon as the Democratic contest is officially resolved. These advertisements are directed less at promoting themselves than at undercutting their opponents.The Republican National Committee is planning a $19.5 million advertising campaign to portray Mr. Obama, 46, as out of touch with the country and too inexperienced to be commander in chief, seeking to put him on the defensive before he can use his financial advantage against Mr. McCain, 71, party officials said.“In 1984, Ronald Reagan said, ‘I’m not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent’s youth and inexperience,’ ” said Frank Donatelli, the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee. “Well, we are going to exploit Obama’s youth and inexperience.”On the Democratic side, Mr. Obama’s aides this week put finishing touches on advertisements intended to tether Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush and chip away at his image as a maverick, an identity that the aides said they found remained strong with voters.“By November, every voter will know that McCain is offering a third Bush term,” said Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, David Plouffe.Advisers to Mr. Obama said their research suggested that Mr. McCain, notwithstanding his high profile in American politics for more than a decade, was not well known to many voters. In particular, Mr. Obama’s aides said they would highlight Mr. McCain’s opposition to abortion rights to try to stem the flow of disaffected women who backed Mrs. Clinton in the primaries and whom Mr. McCain’s aides said they would aggressively court.The strategies reflect a lesson from the 2004 presidential campaign, when top aides to Mr. Bush, some of whom are working for Mr. McCain today, began a well-financed television campaign to define and undercut Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, the moment he became his party’s nominee.Mr. Obama’s advisers said they were mindful that he had not yet won the nomination and that six contests remained. Still, they said it was crucial to begin engaging Mr. McCain as soon possible.Independent voters have been critical in presidential elections as the country has become polarized along party lines. What makes this election different is the extent to which Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain have turned to independent voters for support throughout their careers.Historically, independent voters have responded to specific issues and concerns, in particular an emphasis on government reform and an aversion to overly bitter partisan wrangling. Accordingly, Mr. McCain’s advisers said they would present him as a senator who frequently stepped across the aisle, while portraying Mr. Obama as a down-the-line Democratic voter who is ideologically out of touch with much of the country.“We believe America is still a slightly right-of-center country, and that is what McCain is,” said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain. “If you look at Obama’s base and his record, he is a pretty conventional liberal.”Mr. Obama’s advisers, meanwhile, intend to present Mr. McCain as a product of Washington who moved closer to the Bush administration to win the Republican nomination.The two men also have sought to build their candidacies around images of reform, unconstrained by traditional political molds. The rivals are openly discussing staging forums across the country to speak directly to voters, an idea that is by any measure unconventional for a general election campaign.Asked about the idea on Saturday, Mr. Obama told reporters in Oregon, “If I have the opportunity to debate substantive issues before the voters with John McCain, that’s something that I’m going to welcome.”Hispanic voters could find themselves drawing more attention from presidential candidates than ever before. Their votes could prove critical in determining whether Democrats capture states like Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico and whether Republicans have any chance of being competitive in California.Mr. McCain’s identification with legislation that would have permitted some illegal immigrants to attain citizenship, a position he moved away from in the primaries but never renounced, gives him an opportunity to compete for those voters, who except for Cubans in Florida appear to have largely settled into the Democratic camp in recent years.Mr. Obama also supported measures that would have allowed immigrants to attain citizenship but struggled to win over Hispanic voters in his primary fight, signaling a potential problem for him in the fall campaign. Mr. Obama’s aides said the endorsement by Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, one of the nation’s most prominent Hispanic leaders, could prove more critical in the general election than in the primary.Both sides say the states clearly in play now include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.Republicans said they hoped to put New Jersey and possibly California into play; Democrats said African-Americans could make Mr. Obama competitive in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Mr. Obama’s advisers said they had a strong chance of taking Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio and Virginia away from the Republican column.Mr. Obama has a clear financial advantage. By March 31, Mr. McCain had raised about $80 million and reported about $11 million in cash on hand. Mr. Obama had raised three times as much — about $240 million — and had more than four times as much in the bank.But the Republican National Committee, which is permitted to spend money on Mr. McCain’s behalf, has raised $31 million, compared with just $6 million by the Democratic National Committee. And Republican officials said they were not concerned about being outspent between now and the conventions.Mr. Obama’s advisers said that as a result of the five-month series of primaries and caucuses, he had a nearly national campaign apparatus in place and had identified and registered thousands of new voters. That said, they acknowledged that they were at a disadvantage in two important states — Florida and Michigan — because those states had early primaries in defiance of the Democratic National Committee, and the candidates agreed not to campaign there.“Organizationally, we have now built very powerful organizations in every state but Michigan and Florida,” Mr. Plouffe said. “That is one huge silver lining to how long this nomination fight has gone on.”Republicans will seek to portray Mr. Obama as out of touch with many voters on issues like abortion and gay rights. Some of Mr. McCain’s advisers said they also thought that Mr. Obama had displayed a number of vulnerabilities as a candidate that they would seek to exploit: they argued that he was prone to becoming irritated when tired or pressed on tough questions, that he had trouble connecting with voters in smaller settings and that he had run a campaign light on substance.In the eyes of the Obama campaign, Mr. McCain’s chief weaknesses include continuing to embrace the Iraq war, his support for extending the administration’s tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans (he once opposed the idea) and his suggestion that the economy had made “great progress” in the last eight years.Mr. Obama has said he has no intention of making age — Mr. McCain is 25 years older — an overt issue in the general election campaign. Yet in recent weeks, the Obama campaign has made a point of showing their candidate in settings, on the basketball court, as well as surrounded by his young family, that could be seen as telegraphing the message without explicitly raising the issue.'"

"'08-05-11,'0','“Gasoline prices have reached the boiling point in political terms,” said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. “But you have to look at the root causes of this. Spare capacity is very tight. And a very tight market is very vulnerable to crises.”Geopolitics have played a big part in the steep price increases. Nigeria remains in the grips of a militant insurgency bent on crippling its oil industry. The Middle East is mired in familiar crises and conflicts. Oil traders say they fear a possible interruption of Iran’s oil exports or terrorist attacks against Saudi Arabia’s vast oil industry.Then there is Iraq. On the eve of the war, five years ago, oil was trading at about $30 a barrel. On Friday, it closed at $125.96 a barrel. Over that period, Iraq’s oil production has been stuck at about 2.2 million barrels a day, far below its potential.These factors have build “an almost-permanent security premium” into the price of oil, Mr. Yergin said.Dealing with these complex issues is beyond the scope of the current political debate, which in an election year is focused on the immediate concerns of voters. But, election or not, the nation’s energy debate has rarely resulted in a coherent policy. Oil imports have been rising for the past three decades, for instance, while fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks are the lowest among industrialized nations. Attempts to develop biofuels are being blamed for higher food prices.In the long term, there are only two ways to reduce prices: boost supplies or reduce demand. The country’s energy policy does exactly the opposite: it encourages consumption by keeping energy taxes low and discourages exploiting new supplies because of environmental concerns and not-in-my-backyard political objections.“Politicians talk a strong game on energy policy,” said David G. Victor, the director of the program on energy and sustainable development at Stanford University. But, “they focus on bromides like ‘energy independence’ that poll well yet are meaningless or harmful in practice. And then the political system dithers on action that would yield real leverage on oil consumption.”Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, estimated that the nation’s oil import bill would probably reach $450 billion this year, up from $120 billion in 2002. “Our energy policy is bankrupt,” he said. “It is not prudent any more to ignore the supply side of the equation.”In recent weeks, some analysts have started to talk about prices rising to $200 a barrel. But not everyone is so glum. Some experts say that today’s prices have resulted from a speculative bubble that is increasingly disconnected from reality. Energy economists at Lehman Brothers argue, for instance, that oil prices are just as likely to fall to $80 a barrel as they are to rise to $200 a barrel.The investment bank predicts that supplies will increase as a result of new offshore discoveries and that the huge growth in demand from China will begin to slow.“We’re going to see a real falloff in global demand just as the outlook for energy supplies is getting more robust,” said Edward Morse, the chief energy economist at Lehman.Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, said that if today’s higher prices are the result of a speculative bubble, then Congress should raise the bar on how much money investors must set aside before trading oil contracts, and beef up regulatory oversight of some commodity markets.Since investment funds have placed a lot of money in commodities, raising the margin requirements to trade oil, which Congress is currently considering, would discourage speculation. “That is fundamental to how markets work,” said Roger Diwan, an energy analysts at PFC Energy, a Washington-based consulting firm. “Every other measure is knee-jerk.”One proposal Democrats and Republicans could agree on is to insist that the Bush administration stop filling the strategic oil reserves. This month alone, the Energy Department will add 3.8 million barrels to the strategic stocks. That’s not a big amount — representing just 0.6 percent of the 635 million barrels that will be consumed this month in the country. But with triple-digit oil prices, every drop counts.The Bush administration has always refused to use the strategic reserves to increase the supply in order to lower oil prices, preferring instead to safeguard the reserves in case supply shortages result from a geopolitical crisis or a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which disrupted production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005.Another factor in the steep rise in prices has been the slump in the value of the dollar, which recently plummeted to $1.60 against the euro.“Oil has become a financial asset,” Mr. Yergin said. “People are hedging against a falling dollar by buying oil and that hits the price. The most important thing that could be done would be for the dollar to rebound. But that is not something you can legislate.”'"
"'08-05-11,'0','“The problem is that the market for dollar-denominated assets is orders of magnitude bigger than the oil market,” Mr. Diwan says, so this hedging can have a disproportionate effect on oil prices. “It’s like a lake and a pond, and the lake is overflowing into the pond.”While it’s hard to pinpoint the impact, it’s clear that money has been pouring into commodities over the last five years. In the first quarter of 2008 alone, commodity assets under management rose $30 billion, to $225 billion, according to estimates by Barclays Capital.Much of that increase can be attributed to simple price appreciation, but five years ago, total commodity assets under management equaled just $20 billion, according to Barclays.The dollar’s weakness isn’t affecting just oil. Other commodities that are priced in dollars — like wheat, rice and other foodstuffs — are also soaring, with ramifications felt worldwide.“I don’t think there’s any doubt that the devaluation of the dollar is having an impact on all global commodities, including oil,” says James E. Newsome, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where energy and metals are traded.While critics say that short-term investors — some would call them “speculators” — drive up prices unfairly or manipulate the market, Mr. Newsome doesn’t buy it. “The dollar has become a fundamental,” he says. “And the floor of the exchange is littered with former funds and traders who tried to bet against fundamentals and failed.”Based on more traditional fundamentals like the cost of finding, producing and shipping crude, oil should be in the mid-$60s, says William H. Brown III, an independent energy consultant in Chappaqua, N.Y., who monitors investment flows in the energy sector. “I’m not blaming anyone,” he says, “but this price is hard to justify.”In Washington, however, the blame game has begun. In a speech on May 1, Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat who is chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, cited the weak dollar, as well as the role of “speculators” on commodity exchanges.And last Wednesday, Senate Democrats proposed legislation that, among other things, would impose substantially higher margin requirements on oil traders, in an effort to dampen speculation.That might take some air out of the overblown oil market — and help drivers more than a gas-tax holiday would this summer. But it faces fierce opposition from industry advocates like Mr. Newsome, who formerly led the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the Nymex and other exchanges.“The margin issue is one I’m very emotional about because it has absolutely nothing to do with the price of oil,” says Mr. Newsome, previewing arguments that are likely to dominate the debate over links between Wall Street and energy prices in the next few months.The argument over whether traders are to blame for high energy prices has lasted for years, but it has intensified of late. Raising margin requirements — even temporarily — might be worth a try and might at least settle this dispute.'"
"'08-05-11,'0','IT will come as no surprise that a bar was the inspiration for a song called “Tanqueray Tango.”Bob Carr, a singer-songwriter from Montclair, said the country-style tune about a gin-soaked one-night stand was sparked by his former hangout in Bloomingdale that carries the double-entendre name, DT’s Stumble On In.Mr. Carr reflected on his muse recently as he stood outside Café Meow, where a group of songwriters meet monthly for what is known as the Saturday Afternoon Song Swap. He had just finished performing the song, which includes the line, “She had a husband in the U.S.M.C./a saggy couch and a flat screen TV.”Mr. Carr and the other five songwriters who performed that Saturday said that inspiration for their songs comes from many places, but that there were few places where they could perform their works. They said there was a particular magic when a song went from the writer’s solitude to the warmth of an audience.“Music is meant to live among people,” said Deena Shoshkes, a songwriter from Millburn.Ms. Shoshkes and a friend, Rebecca Turner, a songwriter from Springfield, created the Saturday Afternoon Song Swap in January so songwriters could fine-tune their material. Each month features different songwriters, and others are welcome at an open microphone after the program. The swaps are held the second Saturday of every month, and the next one is planned for June 14.'"
"'08-05-11,'0','WINNING isn’t everything, the only thing or even necessarily the main thing to Brent Kephart, the founder of a youth lacrosse program here. He’ll let other youth sports coaches and administrators worry about that. Mr. Kephart would rather emphasize what he considers most important: sportsmanship, teamwork, dedication and treating the most and least talented players exactly the same.That may put Mr. Kephart, who founded the Del Val Jr. Lacrosse program in 2001, out of step with the win-at-all-costs mentality that often permeates youth sports. But he’s not about to change. He never felt a need because his teams are competitive, some of his players go on to area high school teams and they are all learning the values of sportsmanship. And now he is even getting national recognition for how he has played the game.Along with Pomperaug Lacrosse, a program in Milford, Conn., Del Val Jr. Lacrosse was recently named a co-winner of the Honoring the Game Award from the Positive Coaching Alliance, a California-based group dedicated to recognizing sports organizations that create a positive environment for young athletes and teach valuable life lessons. Too many coaches and parents involved in youth sports, the directors of the alliance say, have lost sight of why their children are playing the game.“Among the things Del Val did to distinguish themselves was to put together a scholarship program for student athletes based in part on their essays about the character-building elements of their playing experiences,” said David Jacobson, a spokesman for the alliance. “These guys are so committed to honoring the game that it’s literally written in stone outside their field. Outside their field, they have a big stone with a plaque on it that says ‘Honor the Game.’ ”Timothy Roy, the varsity lacrosse coach at Delaware Valley Regional High School here, said many of his team members come through the Del Val Jr. program.'"

"'08-05-11,'0','“We find kittens in the mailbox, dogs tied to our dumpster,” Ms. Hollywood said. “Some people find it too upsetting to come in. But for care and adoption purposes, we’d at least like to know the animal’s age and vaccination history — whether it gets along with other dogs or cats.”The more a shelter knows about an animal, Ms. Hollywood, the easier it is to find a home for it.Adrienne Stafford, shelter director at PAWS, a privately run shelter in Norwalk, said it has noticed a slight increase in people giving loss of home as a reason for giving up a pet. “We’re also getting more calls from folks worried that they can’t afford to keep their pets.”Ms. Stafford and the volunteers at PAWS collect donations of food and supplies to help, along with information on financial options, such as no-interest medical care credit cards that can help owners pay veterinary bills over time.Municipal shelters must accept surrendered pets, whenever they arrive.“It’s just horrible now — every day,” said Jimmy Gonzalez, animal control officer for Bridgeport. “But honestly, it’s always bad here.” He said that his shelter is the busiest in the state, averaging 5 to 10 “owner releases” a day, and that those numbers have stayed fairly steady over the last few years.Mr. Gonzalez said that half of his shelter’s population was abandoned cruelly and indifferently, on the streets or in vacated dwellings. But lately, during his intake interviews with people bringing in their pets, he has seen more signs of owners feeling guilty about releases attributed to economic problems.“People are coming out and saying that they’re losing their homes and can’t keep the pet,” he said. “It’s such a big problem now, they seem to feel able to tell you the exact reason, beyond a simple ‘I’m moving.’ ”Even the owners showing the steeliest resolve as they fill out the paperwork have difficulty with the questions Mr. Gonzalez gently asks to make sure they want to leave the pet behind. “Usually, they break down,” he said. “Or I find them outside in the back afterward, crying. Really, they’ve just given up a child. I hate to see that pain. I hate to lead the pet away. You can’t imagine the stress in this job.”Mr. Gonzalez and his staff of three must manage adoptions, intake and care for a capacity of 40 dogs and 25 cats (soon to be increased to 80 dogs and 52 cats in a new facility, without any growth in the staff). He said that nearly every day, his team arrives at work to find dogs tied to the fence outside. They field constant calls from panicked landlords and real estate agents. “They’ll send someone in to clean a just-vacated apartment or home and find five cats or three pit bulls inside.”Hope does spring eternal, yipping and purring, within the cages. “Adoptions are high here,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “Yesterday, 62 people came in to look, and we had 13 adoptions.” Still, as the animals continue to arrive, he feels as if he’s trying to plug an ever-weakening dike. “It’s an awful thing to see. I’ve had tough gang bangers come in to look around and go, ‘Man, is it that bad out there?’ ”The Internet has been a boon to shelters and rescue groups trying to place animals.

But I’ve always felt that guys like Riley should have a chance, too.”Max and Riley hit it off, and off they went to a comfortable home with a big fenced yard; two eager children, Alexa, 9, and Nicholas, 15; and Mr. Morreale and his wife, Annamarie.“Riley has been a total gentleman from day one,” Mr. Morreale said. “He’s great with the kids, and we often find him in my daughter’s room.

"'08-05-11,'0','“Dark Elegies” was a psychological ballet of another kind. (Frequently it moves staccato against its music’s legato.) These characters attain individuation only by means of emotional statements. This woman, this man, that couple get to dance aspects of desolation, anger, perplexity while others watch; once somebody has danced, he or she returns to the group and watches collectedly, sometimes participating. Really each is Everyman, or Everywoman, in a different phase of grief. Even when parts of the body are given over to full-stretched emotion, almost always another part stays still or fragmented. Though I find it a tad too ritualistic and unspontaneous to be wholly convincing, it’s never less than a compelling work of dance modernism. For some people it’s the greatest ballet of the 20th century.“Dark Elegies” and “Jardin aux Lilas” alone placed Tudor in the top rank of 20th-century choreographers. He had a wide range that included pure-dance ballets like “Soirée Musicale,” and he was just entering his 30s.An invitation to join the new Ballet Theater, later to become American Ballet Theater, brought him to New York in October 1939. “Jardin” and “Elegies” were among the triumphs of the company’s opening seasons; Martha Graham let her approval be known. New works and other revivals followed, and with “Pillar of Fire” (1942), “Romeo and Juliet” and “Dim Lustre” (both 1943), Tudor’s place in the American pantheon was assured. “Pillar,” the biggest success, was a study of repression and conflict very much along “Now, Voyager” lines, and it made the young Nora Kaye a star very much along Bette Davis lines: intense, fraught, compelling. (In 1952 he made for Kaye “La Gloire,” a ballet directly inspired by another Bette Davis classic, “All About Eve.”)Other works followed, and some survive. But Tudor’s rate of production decreased. His was the intermittent life of a creative freelancer; he went through blocked periods. Few of his ballets stayed in the repertory of any company.In the 1950s and ’60s he became a guru among New York ballet teachers, with his classes attended by many of the city’s most eminent dancers of various disciplines. This phase of his work has recently been described by Carolyn Brown (then a leading dancer with Merce Cunningham) in her memoir “Chance and Circumstance” (Knopf, 2007). The choreographers Paul Taylor and Pina Bausch were among those who, like Ms. Brown, studied with him and whom he used in some of his occasional choreography.Tudor liked to say none of his best choreography came easily, and he seemed to require an idea before he could start a ballet. Yet what startled many of his students was the facility and inventiveness with which he composed dances in the classroom; they felt such virtues surpassed the dance making of most other choreographers. This fluency, however, coexisted with a notoriously harsh tongue and often controlling temperament. Yet he was revered. Many figures in New York dance today recall those classes with awe.He approved few American dancers as true Tudor stylists. A true modernist, he taught that “the movement is the meaning.” That is: Do the steps without adornment or interpretative alternation, and they will prove expressive. A problem, though: If you don’t know what the steps or gestures mean, you probably won’t do them right. I’ve heard that Tudor once told three women in “Jardin aux Lilas” that when they all raised their arms, they should be wishing on the evening star. Then those three dancers wished upon the evening star — and thereby wrecked the moment. But I’ve also heard people complain that “Jardin aux Lilas” too often features women who don’t realize they should be wishing on the evening star. How can a dancer win in such conditions?Some have done so. The late Sallie Wilson, Anthony Dowell, Natalia Makarova, Lynn Seymour, Gelsey Kirkland, Alessandra Ferri and Amanda McKerrow have been among those who have enjoyed Tudor triumphs. Even if “Jardin aux Lilas” is famous for never being done well enough, it remains always rewarding to see — as drama, as poetry, as sociology and, yes, as psychology.Tudor died in 1987, with a legacy of fragments. In 32 years of busy dancegoing that began in his lifetime, I have seen only 12 of his ballets. Most dancegoers have seen fewer.During this centenary year, however, revivals of Tudor ballets are occurring around America and the world, including some works I have hitherto missed. American Ballet Theater will present his “Judgment of Paris” (1938) at the May 19 opening-night gala of its spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, and in its fall season at City Center (Oct. 21-Nov. 2) it will present six Tudor ballets or excerpts. ABT II’s season at the Joyce Theater, including his “Continuo” (1971), closes Sunday. New York Theater Ballet (the only company to honor his centenary last month) has presented four this year, the Joffrey Ballet three; others planning Tudor revivals include the Boston Ballet and, in England, the Rambert Dance Company.Too few of Tudor’s ballets are left for his work ever again to equal the stature of that of his contemporaries Balanchine, Martha Graham and Frederick Ashton. But we can still recognize that he was a major artist and a major influence. Even Balanchine (“Emeralds”) and Ashton (“Enigma Variations”) owe debts to “Jardin aux Lilas”; the choreography of Jerome Robbins and Kenneth MacMillan owes Tudor many more; and so, often, does Paul Taylor’s. After this centenary is over, however, how much Tudor will any of us see again? Catch what you can before the year is out.'"
"'08-05-11,'0','The critics seemed eager to live up to this billing. In the Book Review, the novelist Nancy Wilson Ross praised Kerouac’s descriptions of food and nature but found his “philosophical final statement” in a contemporary “autobiographical sketch” — “I don’t know. I don’t care. And it doesn’t make any difference” — “curiously juvenile.” Was Beat rebellion in the exuberant American tradition of Whitman and Emerson, some wondered, or was it a kind of anti-intellectualism and abdication of adult responsibility? As Time magazine wrote in a review of a 1958 anthology, “The Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men,” “are these self-appointed spokesmen for the 20th-century young moving in a quest for meaning, or a flight from it?”The highbrow New York intellectuals were even harsher in their assessment. They found the Beats intellectually bankrupt and politically incoherent. In “The Know-Nothing Bohemians,” an essay in Partisan Review, the young Norman Podhoretz wrote that “the Beat generation’s worship of primitivism and spontaneity is more than a cover for hostility to intelligence; it arises from a pathetic poverty of feeling as well.” Podhoretz detected a “suppressed cry” of “brutality” in the Beats, which he summarized as “kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time, kill those incomprehensible characters who are capable of getting seriously involved with a woman, a job, a cause.”Yet for all their differences, the Beats and their intellectual critics were both in open rebellion against middlebrow culture and values, which Dwight Macdonald saw epitomized by the Book of the Month Club and the New York Times best-seller list. In the January 1958 issue of Commentary, Macdonald wrote a scathing critique of James Gould Cozzens’s “By Love Possessed,” a literary romance set in small-town Pennsylvania that spent months atop the best-seller list (replacing “Peyton Place”). “He is a ‘serious’ writer, and never more serious than in this book,” Macdonald wrote with scorn. “That so uncompromising a work, written in prose of an artificiality and complexity that approaches the impenetrable — indeed often achieves it — that this should have become what the publishers gloatingly call ‘a runaway best-seller’ is something new.”Macdonald went on to accuse Cozzens of anti-Catholicism and anti-Semitism and a lack of awareness for “the real nature of his characters.” Praise from distinguished literary reviewers like Howard Nemerov in The Nation, Richard Ellmann in The Reporter and Brendan Gill in The New Yorker indicated a “general lowering of standards,” Macdonald wrote. In his view, Cozzens’s critical success also marked “the latest episode in the Middlebrow Counter-Revolution,” in which critics were rebelling against the exclusive elitism and “destructive superiority” of the avant-garde and trying to connect more with popular taste. “The requirements of the mass market explain a good deal of bad writing today,” Macdonald continued. “But such reviews, such enthusiasm, such unanimity, such nonsense!”Macdonald would go on to defend this line even more vigorously in his 1960 essay “Masscult and Midcult,” an exhaustive taxonomy of the American cultural scene, from high literature to middlebrow magazines to low arts like television. This was a moment of uncertainty for critics. The leveling process taking place in the culture “destroys all values, since value judgments require discrimination, an ugly word in liberal-democratic America,” Macdonald wrote. Masscult, he added, “is very, very democratic; it refuses to discriminate against or between anything or anybody.”Macdonald wasn’t the only one weighing in on this transition. In “The Un-Angry Young Men,” an essay in the British monthly Encounter in 1958, Leslie Fiedler wrote that American popular culture “has never been in a duller or less promising condition.” Meanwhile, “everyone, and not least the highbrows, wants to read about popular culture” — to the point that “the study of popular culture threatens itself to become a branch of popular culture.” American sensibility, he argued, needed to rebel against something, starting with the snobbish intellectualism of the critics. (Fiedler later wrote admiring essays on pop cultural subjects including “Tarzan of the Apes,” comic strips and horror films, while Macdonald wrote a movie column for Esquire.)Of course, momentous things were happening outside the journals, too. NASA was founded in 1958, and something else came along that year: integrated circuitry, which paved the way for the microchip, then the personal computer, then the Internet — which collapsed all the old cultural hierarchies. In today’s blog-crazy culture, everyone’s a critic. What would Dwight Macdonald say?'"

"'08-05-11,'0','“There’s always something going on, every night of the week, especially on Soder,” said Darren Hamlin, a D.J. who moved from England to start his own club event called Stockholm Calling.While the city clearly loves live performances, many of the biggest regular events are D.J. nights like Stockholm Calling and Bangers ’n’ Mash (partly set up by Andy Bell, former frontman of the English band Ride and current member of Oasis, or arrivals like Another Sunny Day, which began in April.ON my visit, in late April, I stopped by a Wednesday night club gig, Baba Sonic, where the tracks ranged from contemporary tunes to mop-top Beatles and Joy Division remixes, though surely no one in the crowd could have been born anytime close to Ian Curtis’s death in 1980. Though the soundtrack was international, it was the local music that got things moving: the energy picked up when Peter Bjorn and John’s indie pop tune “Young Folks” came on, and peaked with “Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo” by the ’60s-sounding contemporary indie singer Jens Lekman. At that point, there wasn’t room on the dance floor for one more young body, no matter how slender and blond it might be.“It’s actually quite empty tonight,” said Mattias Valenca, who was holding down the bar with a pint of Spendrups lager after a practice session with his own experimental-rock band, Monolit, in which he plays bass. “Most Swedes get paid at the end of this week, so next Wednesday this place will be packed.”If this was a before-payday crunch, I thought, I wouldn’t want to be around when Stockholm was really cutting loose. In fact, packed venues were the standard throughout my stay, as at Debaser Medis the next night. (There are actually two Debaser addresses in Stockholm, with a third branch in the town of Malmo.) After paying the entry of 190 Swedish kronor (about $31 at 6.13 kronor to the dollar), I pushed into the room to catch a performance from Magnus Tingsek, a magnetic blue-eyed-soul performer reminiscent of both Robert Cray and Jamiroquai, if not Stevie Wonder and Sly Stone.More so than at Baba Sonic, the crowd here reflected Sweden’s celebrated egalitarianism. Though most of those in attendance were young and beautiful, many were middle-aged (though still beautiful) and several were downright old (ditto) — and yet everyone seemed to be in love with Mr. Tingsek’s sweet falsetto and his band’s Carribean-inflected funk and folk. The best moments arrived when a percussionist rocked his cowbell in a Christopher Walkenesque manner and the band jumped into an extended version of Mr. Tingsek’s “World of Its Own.”Like Mr. Tingsek, most of the bands in Stockholm perform in pitch-perfect English. (The ability to communicate in English makes Sweden an attractive destination in all regards, not just music.) But the next night, I caught a local-language show at Debaser Slussen, the second Debaser venue, situated at the lock that connects Sodermalm to the city’s Gamla Stan, or Old Town.After a meal of herring and akvavit at Pelikan, one of the historic old pubs in Sodermalm, it turned out I was too late for the opening act, Lacrosse, an indie-pop group whose English lyrics are almost disturbingly optimistic. But I was just in time to see Alf.Unlike Mr. Tingsek’s global funk band, Alf’s classic four-piece was firmly rooted in the American rock vernacular. When Alf — in red jeans and a white T-shirt — played bright riffs on his Telecaster guitar, I thought of Tom Petty; when the bass jumped into a high register and the rhythm was pushed forward by the floor tom, “No Pocky for Kitty”-era Superchunk came to mind.Nearing the end of his set, Alf switched his American Telecaster for a beautiful Swedish Hagstrom twelve-string, and quickly launched into a song I thought I recognized. After a second, however, I realized that the song wasn’t a familiar English-language number at all, but just another catchy tune in Alf’s native southern Swedish.Though I couldn’t understand a word, somehow it all made perfect sense.IF YOU GOAffordable lodgings can be found at the Langholmen hostel (Langholmsmuren 20; 46-8-720-8500; www.langholmen.com), converted from a 19th-century prison.

OARS, which offers a range of rafting trips throughout the West — from raging rapids for thrill-seekers to gentle floats suitable for 5-year-olds — said bookings by May 1 for this year were up 22 percent compared with the same time last year.OARS said the highest demand is for the rivers of the Colorado Plateau, where runoff is expected to be high. Its trips on the Green River through the Gates of Lodore in Dinosaur National Monument, which straddles Utah and Colorado, were more than 88 percent full for the year by May 1 and its rafting trips were sold out.While all this water is good news for boaters and floaters, there is a downside. All the moisture can mean outdoors enthusiasts may have to wait to enjoy certain land-based activities like and camping.Muddy roads and slow-melting snow “can limit accessibility to places,” said Mike Strobel, director of the National Water and Climate Center. He added, “It’s hard to make plans for even camping over Memorial Day weekend when you don’t know how that site will be impacted.”In , for example, has experienced some opening delays owing to lingering snow. Because of snow-covered campsites, the Sol Duc campground, which was scheduled to reopen April 18, is now estimated to open by May 23 for the Memorial Day weekend. And trails in the high country are expected to be accessible later than normal.“Hikers should be ready to consider low-elevation hikes as an alternative,” Barb Maynes, a park spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail message. (Visitors can call 360-565-3100 for current trail reports.)Outdoors-lovers who don’t want to rely on Mother Nature to determine their getaway plans have a new option in . Adventure Sports Center International, a white-water course that was built about three hours west of Washington in McHenry, Md., opened a year ago. The center uses technology to control the rapids on its course, adjusting them several times a day to accommodate paddlers of all skill levels.“We’ve eliminated all the big dangers that occur on natural rivers, from being remote to entrapment,” said Matt Taylor, the center’s executive director.While customers must still take safety precautions while enjoying the artificially built course, the ability to control the rapids enables family members who might not otherwise be ready to tackle difficult rapids to enjoy appropriate levels, including intermediate rapids, that might not be easily found in the wild. “Our families are looking to plunge in and unplug,” Mr. Taylor said.'"

"'08-05-12,'1','To hear some in Congress tell it, the federal government urgently needs to expand its electronic employment verification system, E-Verify, to all corners of the country and force every business to use it. But a hearing in the House last week raised serious questions about the costs and collateral damage of that expansion, the latest scheme by hard-liners to slam the door shut on unauthorized immigrant workers.E-Verify is a voluntary program in which employers can check workers’ names against databases kept by the and the . About 61,000 employers have signed up. A bill by Heath Shuler, a Democrat, and , the Republican anti- extremist from , would require each of the 7.4 million employers in the to participate in E-Verify — and to fire anyone, citizen or otherwise, who cannot prove that he or she has the right to work.Barbara Kennelly, a former Democratic representative from and president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and , warned at the hearing that forcing Social Security to take on the enormous burden of immigration enforcement would be a harmful diversion from its core mission and could strain the bureaucracy to the breaking point.That would have frightening implications for millions of people who are supposed to be served by the Social Security Administration, particularly the elderly and those who are disabled. With Social Security struggling to provide existing services and the sunset of the baby boom approaching, Ms. Kennelly said, now is no time to pile on more responsibilities. The backlog of pending disability cases at the initial level is more than 500,000, and more than 750,000 people who have appealed rejected claims are awaiting decisions. As of February, the average wait on an appeal was more than 500 days.Critics have noted other problems with the bill: the staggering costs to the — about $40 billion over 10 years, both from increased spending and falling tax revenue as workers are driven off the books — as well as the expense to businesses and the inconvenience and pain for workers caught by its flaws. Because the Social Security database is rotten with errors, the crackdown could force millions of Americans to battle a computerized bureaucracy that tells them, unjustly, that they cannot work. And the has cited evidence of employers abusing E-Verify, forcing workers who are tentatively flagged as unauthorized to take pay cuts or work longer hours until they can clear their names.Supporters of Mr. Shuler’s and Mr. Tancredo’s hard-edged immigrant-deportation strategy have been pushing to get their bill to the floor. With any luck, testimony from experts like Ms. Kennelly will raise enough alarms to slow things down. If and when the government imposes a national employment verification scheme, it must be done with a serious commitment to fairness and accuracy, with ample protections for workers who fall into bureaucratic cracks, and for all who depend on the government to provide other critical services.'"
"'08-05-12,'1','ESPN and the Tennis Channel have separate deals for Wimbledon, and ESPN sublicenses the French Open from the Tennis Channel.All of ESPN’s live match coverage will be seen on ESPN2, where it carries the three other Grand Slam events.Over all, ESPN and the Tennis Channel will increase the number of hours of United States Open cable coverage by 50 to 60 hours over USA’s schedule. Part of the Tennis Channel’s portfolio will include outer-court coverage.CBS Sports will continue to broadcast about 40 hours of the Open.Arlen Kantarian, the U.S.T.A.’s chief executive of professional tennis, said that despite the Open’s long, successful run on USA, it was important to move the tournament to ESPN.“We’ve measured the properties ESPN has taken on, and they take on a younger audience,” Kantarian said. “We need that in our sport. We think more sports fans will find tennis than ever before.”Except for being a part of NBC Universal’s multinetwork Olympic coverage, USA has been moving away from sports and increasingly producing more original series. It no longer has early-round coverage of the PGA Tour, a former network mainstay, or the Masters, which is now on ESPN. It still shows the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and World Wrestling Entertainment’s “Raw.”“I don’t know if USA let it go because they’re reducing a commitment to sports,” Kantarian said, referring to the United States Open. “But they’ve been great for 24 years and they’ll go out first class.”USA’s lead analysts, Mary Carillo, who already works for ESPN, and John McEnroe, are expected to follow the Open in its network changeover. They also work for CBS Sports.ESPN and the Tennis Channel will also share coverage of the United States Open Series, the six-week schedule that includes nine ATP Tour and WTA Tour events. During the series, players accumulate points based on their performances and can collect bonuses of up to $1 million depending on their United States Open finish.“This is the end of our five-year mission to reinvent the TV and digital side of tennis,” Kantarian said. “It gives us much more consistency.”The series has been on a hodgepodge of TV outlets (originally, in 2004, it was on ESPN, CBS, NBC and Fox Sports Net). Currently, the series is shared by ESPN and the Tennis Channel. Under their new contracts, ESPN and the Tennis Channel and CBS, which will have coverage of select finals, will carry 200 hours of the series, twice as many as in the existing TV schedule.ESPN’s and the Tennis Channel’s deals will also allow them to carry studio programs and highlights shows. Their Web sites, including espn360.com and tennischannel.com, along with usopen.org, will have video streaming rights.“We’ve been very open,” DeLuca said. “We wanted to be in the Grand Slams and we thought the U.S. Open Series was a good product, and we’ve capped it with the jewel, the U.S. Open itself.”While ESPN2 viewers have little trouble finding the network on cable or satellite, the Tennis Channel is harder to see. More than half of its 25 million subscribers are from DirecTV and the Dish Network, with the rest from cable. Some cable operators like Time Warner place it on their digital sports tier, but Solomon said the Tennis Channel’s audience more than doubled during free previews of the French and Australian Opens.'"

"'08-05-12,'1','LOS ANGELES — The Screen Actors Guild on Friday pulled its members, including the stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Biel, from a movie being directed by David O.

Mr. Gyllenhaal received an Oscar nomination for his performance in “Brokeback Mountain,” and Ms. Biel has been a fixture in studio films like the Universal Pictures comedy “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry.”Word of the production’s troubles was reported on Deadlinehollywooddaily.com over the weekend.Mr. Russell is known for off-center comedies like “I Heart Huckabees” and “Three Kings.” A spokesman for the Endeavor agency, which represents him, had no immediate comment.The movie, which began shooting in South Carolina in mid-April, is expected to wrap by mid-June. Co-written by Kristin Gore, the daughter of former vice president Al Gore, it tells the story of a waitress who falls into Washington misadventures, sexual and otherwise, after accidentally getting a nail lodged in her head.Ms. Gore was among the writers of “Arctic Tale,” an animal-themed documentary released by Paramount Vantage last year.

"'08-05-12,'1','Some of the most compelling evidence of global warming comes to us from NASA. No longer do we need to rely on guesswork and computer modeling, because satellite images reveal a dramatic disappearance of glaciers, Antarctic ice shelves and polar ice sheets. And I've seen some of this evidence up close. A few years ago I traveled to the area of Svalbard, Norway, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean. I was shown the southernmost point where a glacier had reached twenty years earlier. From there, we had to venture northward up the fjord to see where that same glacier ends today -- because all the rest has melted. On a trip to Alaska, I heard about a national park visitor's center that was built to offer a picture-perfect view of a large glacier. Problem is, the glacier is gone. A work of nature that took ages to form had melted away in a matter of decades.Our scientists have also seen and measured reduced snowpack, with earlier runoffs in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. We have seen sustained drought in the Southwest, and across the world average temperatures that seem to reach new records every few years. We have seen a higher incidence of extreme weather events. In the frozen wilds of Alaska, the Arctic, Antarctic, and elsewhere, wildlife biologists have noted sudden changes in animal migration patterns, a loss of their habitat, a rise in sea levels. And you would think that if the polar bears, walruses, and sea birds have the good sense to respond to new conditions and new dangers, then humanity can respond as well.We have many advantages in the fight against global warming, but time is not one of them. Instead of idly debating the precise extent of global warming, or the precise timeline of global warming, we need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters, and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring. We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great. The most relevant question now is whether our own government is equal to the challenge.There are vital measures we can take in the short term, even as we focus on long-term policies to mitigate the effects of global warming. In the years ahead, we are likely to see reduced water supplies, more forest fires than in previous decades, changes in crop production, more heat waves afflicting our cities and a greater intensity in storms. Each one of these consequences of climate change will require policies to protect our citizens, especially those most vulnerable to violent weather. Each one will require new precautions in the repair and construction of our roads, bridges, railways, seawalls and other infrastructure. Some state and local governments have already begun their planning and preparation for extreme events and other impacts of climate change. The federal government can help them in many ways, above all by coordinating their efforts, and I am committed to providing that support.To lead in this effort, however, our government must strike at the source of the problem -- with reforms that only Congress can enact and the president can sign. We know that greenhouse gasses are heavily implicated as a cause of climate change. And we know that among all greenhouse gasses, the worst by far is the carbon-dioxide that results from fossil-fuel combustion. Yet for all the good work of entrepreneurs and inventors in finding cleaner and better technologies, the fundamental incentives of the market are still on the side of carbon-based energy. This has to change before we can make the decisive shift away from fossil fuels.For the market to do more, government must do more by opening new paths of invention and ingenuity. And we must do this in a way that gives American businesses new incentives and new rewards to seek, instead of just giving them new taxes to pay and new orders to follow. The most direct way to achieve this is through a system that sets clear limits on all greenhouse gases, while also allowing the sale of rights to excess emissions. And this is the proposal I will submit to the Congress if I am elected president -- a cap-and-trade system to change the dynamic of our energy economy.As a program under the Clean Air Act, the cap-and-trade system achieved enormous success in ridding the air of acid rain. And the same approach that brought a decline in sulfur dioxide emissions can have an equally dramatic and permanent effect on carbon emissions. Instantly, automakers, coal companies, power plants, and every other enterprise in America would have an incentive to reduce carbon emissions, because when they go under those limits they can sell the balance of permitted emissions for cash. As never before, the market would reward any person or company that seeks to invent, improve, or acquire alternatives to carbon-based energy. It is very hard to picture venture capitalists, corporate planners, small businesses and environmentalists all working to the same good purpose. But such cooperation is actually possible in the case of climate change, and this reform will set it in motion.The people of this country have a genius for adapting, solving problems, and inventing new and better ways to accomplish our goals. But the federal government can't just summon those talents by command -- only the free market can draw them out. A cap-and-trade policy will send a signal that will be heard and welcomed all across the American economy. Those who want clean coal technology, more wind and solar, nuclear power, biomass and bio-fuels will have their opportunity through a new market that rewards those and other innovations in clean energy. The market will evolve, too, by requiring sensible reductions in greenhouse gases, but also by allowing full flexibility in how industry meets that requirement. Entrepreneurs and firms will know which energy investments they should make. And the highest rewards will go to those who make the smartest, safest, most responsible choices. A cap-and-trade reform wi ll also create a profitable opportunity for rural America to receive market-based payments -- instead of government subsidies -- for the conservation practices that store carbon in the soils of our nation's farms.We will cap emissions according to specific goals, measuring progress by reference to past carbon emissions. By the year 2012, we will seek a return to 2005 levels of emission, by 2020, a return to 1990 levels, and so on until we have achieved at least a reduction of sixty percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050. In the course of time, it may be that new ideas and technologies will come along that we can hardly imagine today, allowing all industries to change with a speed that will surprise us. More likely, however, there will be some companies that need extra emissions rights, and they will be able to buy them. The system to meet these targets and timetables will give these companies extra time to adapt -- and that is good economic policy. It is also a matter of simple fairness, because the cap-and-trade system will create jobs, improve livelihoods, and strengthen futures across our country.The goal in all of this is to assure an energy supply that is safe, secure, diverse, and domestic. And in pursuit of these objectives, we cannot afford to take economic growth and job creation for granted. A strong and growing economy is essential to all of our goals, and especially the goal of finding alternatives to carbon-based technology. We want to turn the American economy toward cleaner and safer energy sources. And you can't achieve that by imposing costs that the American economy cannot sustain.As part of my cap-and-trade incentives, I will also propose to include the purchase of offsets from those outside the scope of the trading system. This will broaden the array of rewards for reduced emissions, while also lowering the costs of compliance with our new emissions standards. Through the sale of offsets -- and with strict standards to assure that reductions are real -- our agricultural sector alone can provide as much as forty percent of the overall reductions we will require in greenhouse gas emissions. And in the short term, farmers and ranchers can do it in some of the most cost-effective ways.Over time, an increasing fraction of permits for emissions could be supplied by auction, yielding federal revenues that can be put to good use. Under my plan, we will apply these and other federal funds to help build the infrastructure of a post-carbon economy. We will support projects to advance technologies that capture and store carbon emissions. We will assist in transmitting wind- and solar-generated power from states that have them to states that need them. We will add to current federal efforts to develop promising technologies, such as plug-ins, hybrids, flex-fuel vehicles, and hydrogen-powered cars and trucks. We will also establish clear standards in government-funded research, to make sure that funding is effective and focused on the right goals.And to create greater demand for the best technologies and practices in energy conservation, we will use the purchasing power of the United States government. Our government can hardly expect citizens and private businesses to adopt or invest in low-carbon technologies when it doesn't always hold itself to the same standard. We need to set a better example in Washington, by consistently applying the best environmental standards to every purchase our government makes.As we move toward all of these goals, and over time put the age of fossil fuels behind us, we must consider every alternative source of power, and that includes nuclear power. When our cap-and-trade policy is in place, there will be a sudden and sustained pursuit in the market for new investment opportunities in low-emission fuel sources. And here we have a known, proven energy source that requires exactly zero emissions. We have 104 nuclear reactors in our country, generating about twenty percent of our electricity. These reactors alone spare the atmosphere from about 700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released every year. That's the annual equivalent of nearly all emissions from all the cars we drive in America. Europe, for its part, has 197 reactors in operation, and nations including France and Belgium derive more than half their electricity from nuclear power. Those good practices contribute to the more than two billion metric tons of carbon dioxide avoided every year, worldwide, because of nuclear energy. It doesn't take a leap in logic to conclude that if we want to arrest global warming, then nuclear energy is a powerful ally in that cause.In a cap-and-trade energy economy, the cost of building new reactors will be less prohibitive. The incentives to invest in a mature, zero-emissions technology will be stronger. New research and innovation will help the industry to overcome the well known drawbacks to nuclear power, such as the transport and storage of waste. And our government can help in these efforts. We can support research to extend the use of existing plants. Above all, we must make certain that every plant in America is safe from the designs of terrorists. And when all of this is assured, it will be time again to expand our use of one of the cleanest, safest, and most reliable sources of energy on earth.For all of the last century, the profit motive basically led in one direction -- toward machines, methods, and industries that used oil and gas. Enormous good came from that industrial growth, and we are all the beneficiaries of the national prosperity it built. But there were costs we weren't counting, and often hardly noticed. And these terrible costs have added up now, in the atmosphere, in the oceans, and all across the natural world. They are no longer tenable, sustainable, or defensible. And what better way to correct past errors than to turn the creative energies of the free market in the other direction? Under the cap-and-trade system, this can happen. In all its power, the profit motive will suddenly begin to shift and point the other way toward cleaner fuels, wiser ways, and a healthier planet.As a nation, we make our own environmental plans and our own resolutions. But working with other nations to arrest climate change can be an even tougher proposition. One of the greatest difficulties is to gain the cooperation of China. That nation today is dealing with a catastrophic earthquake and the loss of thousands of citizens, including many children and students. The United States government has offered to help in any way possible, and all of us hope that rescuers will be able to save more lives at a terrible time for the people of the Sichuan Province.In addressing the problem of climate change, cooperation from the government of China will be essential. China, India, and other developing economic powers in particular are among the greatest contributors to global warming today – increasing carbon emissions at a furious pace – and they are not receptive to international standards. Nor do they think that we in the industrialized world are in any position to preach the good news of carbon-emission control. We made most of our contributions to global warming before anyone knew about global warming.This set of facts and perceived self-interests proved the undoing of the Kyoto Protocols. As president, I will have to deal with the same set of facts. I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears. I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges. I will not accept the same dead-end of failed diplomacy that claimed Kyoto. The United States will lead and will lead with a different approach -- an approach that speaks to the interests and obligations of every nation.Shared dangers mean shared duties, and global problems require global cooperation. The United States and our friends in Europe cannot alone deal with the threat of global warming. No nation should be exempted from its obligations. And least of all should we make exceptions for the very countries that are accelerating carbon emissions while the rest of us seek to reduce emissions. If we are going to establish meaningful environmental protocols, then they must include the two nations that have the potential to pollute the air faster, and in greater annual volume, than any nation ever in history.At the same time, we will continue in good faith to negotiate with China and other nations to enact the standards and controls that are in the interest of every nation -- whatever their stage of economic development. And America can take the lead in offering these developing nations the low-carbon technologies that we will make and they will need. One good idea or invention to reduce carbon emissions is worth a thousand finely crafted proposals at a conference table. And the governments of these developing economic powers will soon recognize, as America is beginning to do, their urgent need for cleaner-burning fuels and safer sources of energy.If the efforts to negotiate an international solution that includes China and India do not succeed, we still have an obligation to act.In my approach to global climate-control efforts, we will apply the principle of equal treatment. We will apply the same environmental standards to industries in China, India, and elsewhere that we apply to our own industries. And if industrializing countries seek an economic advantage by evading those standards, I would work with the European Union and other like-minded governments that plan to address the global warming problem to develop effective diplomacy, effect a transfer of technology, or other means to engage those countries that decline to enact a similar cap.For all of its historical disregard of environmental standards, it cannot have escaped the attention of the Chinese regime that China's skies are dangerously polluted, its beautiful rivers are dying, its grasslands vanishing, its coastlines receding, and its own glaciers melting. We know many of these signs from our own experience -- from environmental lessons learned the hard way. And today, all the world knows that they are the signs of even greater trouble to come. Pressing on blindly with uncontrolled carbon emissions is in no one's interest, especially China's. And the rest of the world stands ready to help.Like other environmental challenges -- only more so -- global warming presents a test of foresight, of political courage, and of the unselfish concern that one generation owes to the next. We need to think straight about the dangers ahead, and to meet the problem with all the resources of human ingenuity at our disposal. We Americans like to say that there is no problem we can't solve, however complicated, and no obstacle we cannot overcome if we meet it together. I believe this about our country. I know this about our country. And now it is time for us to show those qualities once again.'"

"'08-05-13,'0','When first asked by a reporter about the outcome of the selection process, Ms. Patterson said that officials were “still evaluating.” She later acknowledged that they had already chosen a winner, but said that information about the bids would not be available until after the city’s Franchise and Concession Review Committee and the comptroller’s office had approved a contract for the operation of the heliport.The contract became available when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey decided last year to stop operating the heliport, which occupies a pier in the East River adjacent to the financial district. The Port Authority, which operates the three biggest airports in the metropolitan area, said the heliport no longer fit with its “core mission.” It will continue to operate the heliport until a successor takes over.After several companies bid for the concession, officials of the development corporation narrowed the field to two finalists, according to people involved in the bidding. One of those companies was Atlantic Aviation, which operates the heliport at the east end of 34th Street. The other was FirstFlight, which charters private planes and operates hangars and fueling facilities at a few small airports.After a second round of bids, the officials chose FirstFlight, a decision that aroused suspicion because one of the company’s directors is Alvin S. Trenk, and his son Jeffrey was once a director. Mr. Trenk and his family control another company, Air Pegasus, which operates the city’s third heliport, at the west end of 30th Street. FirstFlight’s chairman is William Wachtel, a Manhattan lawyer who owns one of the Hudson River commuter ferry services that operates under the banner of New York Waterway.Mr. Trenk has been mired in controversy for years over the way Air Pegasus has operated the West Side heliport, which sits within the boundaries of the Hudson River Park and handles dozens of corporate and sightseeing flights daily. The Friends of Hudson River Park, a group that raises money to support the park, is suing to shut down the heliport on the grounds that it is a nuisance to park visitors and that its location violates the state law that created the park.This month, lawyers for the Friends group asked a judge to postpone the case while they attempt to conclude a settlement with Air Pegasus, said Albert K. Butzel, until recently the president of the group. He said he hoped that a settlement would lead to a ban on sightseeing flights at the West Side heliport within a couple of years.Some sightseeing tour operators said they would prefer not to have a company affiliated with Mr. Trenk operating two of the city’s three heliports. John Kjekstad, president of Helicopter Flight Services, which flies tours from the downtown heliport and previously used the West Side heliport on weekends, is among the critics.Ron Ricciardi, vice chairman of FirstFlight, said that Alvin Trenk was a director and that he and his son owned small stakes in the company, but that Jeffrey Trenk was otherwise uninvolved. Mr. Ricciardi said that while FirstFlight was “not a heliport operator, per se,” it does fuel and service helicopters at an airport in Garden City, Kan., and another near Scranton, Pa.Asked how his company managed to beat out companies with more experience running heliports in the region, Mr. Ricciardi declined to comment, saying, “It’s just not appropriate for me to fill in blanks for you right now.”'"
"'08-05-13,'0','No one really knows how the African-American preference for menthol cigarettes developed in the first place.Some scientists speculate that cultural and taste preferences provide a partial explanation. The Rev. Jesse Brown, an antismoking advocate in Philadelphia, calls it a “chicken and egg” conundrum.But tobacco industry marketing has played a role. The migration of African-Americans to urban manufacturing centers after World War II, coupled with the emergence of black-oriented newspapers and magazines, created various opportunities for niche marketing. In the case of cigarettes, with research showing a slight black preference for Kools, a menthol brand, the industry saw an opening to appeal to black smokers.Or at least that is the explanation central to a paper on the history of menthol marketing by Phillip S. Gardiner, the research administrator of a tobacco disease program at the University of California, Oakland.The paper notes that Elston Howard, who became the first black player for the New York Yankees in 1955, was hired as a Kool spokesman. By 1978 Lorillard, Newport’s maker, had borrowed the singer James Brown’s hit single, “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” for its marketing message, “Newport is a whole new bag of menthol smoking.”'"

"'08-05-13,'0','The Republican candidate, Greg Davis, said in an interview he was not raising racial issues, but was instead pointing out that his conservative values made him a better fit for the district.“We’ve run ads against him with John Kerry and Nancy Pelosi,” said Mr. Davis, referring to Mr. Childers. “Just because one of them happens to be African-American has no bearing on it.” Mr. Davis, 42, is a former state representative who is now mayor of Southaven, a fast-growing Memphis suburb.On Monday, Vice President Dick Cheney stumped here for Mr. Davis, making no mention of Mr. Obama.The race will fill the seat left open when Representative Roger Wicker, a Republican who was first elected in 1994, was appointed to succeed former Senator Trent Lott.The two parties have poured millions of dollars into the race, a potent indicator — like Mr. Cheney’s presence here — of its symbolism as a Republican bastion the Democrats could overrun. Mr. Childers came within 400 votes of winning the seat last month but was forced into a runoff because he received less than 50 percent, a near-victory that startled Republicans used to expecting an easy triumph in a district President Bush carried with 62 percent in 2004.Since then the attacks on Mr. Childers have intensified, particularly the would-be association with Mr. Obama. “Records prove Obama endorsed Childers!” said one advertisement for Mr. Davis. The Democrat takes “Obama’s endorsement over our values,” proclaims another. Some feature Mr. Obama’s picture.Republican test runs using the Obama connection have not been uniformly successful. Last week, after using similar tactics, the party lost a special election in Louisiana to a Democrat with the support of a large black turnout.But there are signs that here in Mississippi, with its tortured legacy of race-based politics, the tactic may be working, particularly in a district with a comparatively smaller black population than in Louisiana, 26 percent. Mr. Childers’s campaign said his negative rating among voters has risen acutely, internal polls show a sharp narrowing in the contest, and interviews with voters indicated the supposed Childers-Obama link could influence votes.“It probably would,” said Bill Chism, a refrigeration mechanic. Asked to elaborate, he ducked his head and said, “I’d rather not say,” nodding to a black customer approaching his wife’s flea market stall in Tupelo on Sunday.James Wiggins, shopping at a nearby gun show, said he saw a connection between the two Democrats.“I don’t agree with the liberal viewpoint, and he’s as liberal as they get,” said Mr. Wiggins, who services medical imaging equipment, referring to Mr. Obama.For some voters, the Obama connection muddied Mr. Childers’s claim to be an independent conservative. “If he doesn’t stand for the Democratic Party, why is he trying to distance himself from the Democratic Party?” wondered Larry Blake, a vendor at the gun show.Mr. Childers, 50, a local court official in the district’s rural section, said voters believed that the effort to link him to Mr. Obama was about race.“When I’ve been out in the district, people tell me, ‘They’re trying to play the race card.’ ” he said.The Childers campaign is counting on that reaction, as well as an increased black turnout, focusing pre-election efforts on rallying African-American voters scattered through the small towns of the district’s 24 mostly rural counties. Mr. Davis, on the other hand, is counting on Mr. Cheney to help rally his base in DeSoto County, which has about 20 percent of the district’s population, abuts Memphis and is the fastest-growing in Mississippi.Many voters here are already motivated.“Folks in Mississippi just don’t want Obama in there,” a Davis supporter, Ken Franklin, said at a barbecue restaurant in Hernando, a Memphis exurb. “He’s too liberal.”Referring to Mr. Childers and Mr. Obama, he added: “He can’t get rid of him. They’re hooked up together.”'"
"'08-05-13,'0','Moktada al-Sadr’s movement and the main Shiite coalition within Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki’s government formally signed an agreement on Monday to end fighting in Sadr City, saying they hoped it would end seven weeks of violence.It is unclear whether a cease-fire will take hold. Officials in Mr. Sadr’s movement said they would permit confiscation of heavy weapons and arrests of wanted men, but they warned against any attempt to detain all Mahdi Army fighters.According to an American military official, who declined to be identified because the military has not publicly announced the attack, the attempt to shoot down an Apache occurred about 7:20 p.m. Saturday. An American patrol had been struck by a roadside bomb in Sadr City, and two Apache helicopters flew to the scene to investigate and provide protection for the troops.The missile, described as an SA-7 shoulder-fired missile, was fired at one of the helicopters. It exploded in midair and neither aircraft was damaged.Soldiers from an American Army civil affairs unit in Sadr City saw the missile ascending and reported that it seemed to have been launched from north of Al Quds Street, where the American military is building a large concrete wall to prevent militia fighters from infiltrating south.The missile was also seen by Iraqi volunteers in the “Sons of Iraq” program who provide security in Adhamiya, a nearby neighborhood. They found the missile’s body, which was turned over to American troops.Despite the agreement to end the fighting, there was no sign of a cease-fire along Al Quds Street. Militia fighters fired at Iraqi forces near the wall that the Americans are building. The Iraqi soldiers shot back, and an Apache helicopter fired a missile at a militia position.American military officials released figures on Monday showing more than 700 attacks a month in Baghdad in March and again in April, primarily at American and Iraqi troops — nearly triple the level in February, before the Sadr City clashes began.There have already been more than 200 attacks in May. Col. Allen Batschelet, the chief of staff of the military division securing Baghdad, said overall attacks are still down 42 percent since a peak of 1,200 last June.Colonel Batschelet said that since American and Iraqi troops began the operation to curb the firing of rockets from Sadr City, more missiles are now being fired from areas outside that district. He also said the militias are also using more 122-millimeter weapons, whose 12-mile range is double that of 107-millimeter rockets, which account for most attacks against the Green Zone.Many of the rockets and mortar shells fired by the militias have fallen wide of their intended targets. Of the 285 people killed or wounded by mortars and rockets in Baghdad since March 23, Colonel Batschelet said, 144 were Iraqis, 89 were coalition troops, 20 were Iraqi security troops, 15 were American civilians and 17 were of other nationalities.Officials from hospitals in Sadr City said casualties declined over the weekend. At noon on Monday, however, ambulances were still delivering the wounded.In some sections of Sadr City, residents seemed relaxed, walking on the street and shopping. Lines of cars were waiting for gas. The lines vanished a couple of weeks ago, because people were afraid to remain in the street for long periods of time.'"
"'08-05-13,'0','Scores of new mines have been opened in the last six years, and many old ones have been reactivated. Bluestone, which had shrunk to little more than memories — is now a $100 million-a-year industry, located mostly in economically depressed Delaware and Broome Counties in the Catskills.At the same time, the state hoped that by issuing permits it could assert some control over the bluestone industry, rein in renegade miners from out of state, and change the habits of the fiercely independent quarrymen.State officials consider the effort so successful from both economic and environmental perspectives that they have taken the unusual step of openly lobbying to extend the two-year measure, which expires at the end of July. Legislation to make it permanent has passed the State Senate and is expected to come up for a vote in the Assembly this month.“Rather than go in wholesale with guns blazing and multiple enforcement against the industry, we decided to first undertake an education program with them saying, ‘This is what you’ve got to do,’ and then give them time to come into compliance,” said Bradley J. Field, director of the division of mineral resources at the Department of Environmental Conservation.That softer approach has convinced some quarrymen that the state does not mean to harass them. Even those who have never gotten a permit before find themselves siding with the department and asking for the law to made permanent. Environmental groups are more tentative. “The state says it’s a win-win situation because the law will improve the economy of the region, and at the same time give regulators the ability to keep an eye on what’s happening,” said Ramsay Adams, executive director of the Catskill Mountainkeeper, an environmental group. “If that’s the case, then it’s something worth looking at. But I’m just not sure that the law they are trying to pass permanently is strong enough.”The link between the Catskill Mountain bluestone quarries and New York City is as durable as the stone slabs themselves. Some of New York’s first sidewalks laid in the early 19th century were made of Catskill bluestone, and in parts of the city they are still in place, though Mr. Hennessey said he had never seen one because he has never been to New York. The rock, a kind of sandstone found only in New York and eastern Pennsylvania, usually is light blue, but it can be gray, green or red.By 1870, cutting the slabs out of mountain ledges became such big business that William M. Tweed, the political boss, finagled a partnership out of the New York and Pennsylvania Bluestone Company. He profited greatly by then arranging for the company to supply bluestone for city sidewalks.By the end of the 19th century, an estimated 10,000 men worked bluestone in New York. The Catskills were riddled with quarries.As concrete sidewalks replaced bluestone, the industry declined. Then, in 1996, Pennsylvania tightened its restrictions on bluestone mining. Pennsylvania quarrymen flooded into New York, apparently misreading New York’s bluestone mining law.The law requires quarrymen to have a permit if they extract more than 1,000 tons of minerals in a year. The Pennsylvania quarrymen assumed that meant 1,000 tons of bluestone, and they simply never bothered to get their permits. But officials said that “overburden” — the dirt and rock that have to be moved to get at the bluestone — was meant to be included in the 1,000 tons.Harry S. Triebe Sr., owner of Sonny & Sons Stone Co. in Downsville, N.Y. and a past president of the New York Bluestone Association, said that quarrymen usually have to remove ten times as much overburden as bluestone when they mine a deposit. He said they could exceed the 1,000 ton threshold in as little as a day.“Until we actually work a quarry, we don’t know what’s there,” Mr. Triebe said. That meant going through the process of getting a full scale mining permit, and putting up a $5,000 to $10,000 reclamation bond, without knowing if there was enough good quality bluestone to even recoup the cost of the permit. An average quarryman can make about $25,000 to $35,000 a year, Mr. Triebe said.Most bluestone quarries are nothing like the big sand and gravel excavation pits commonly seen in New York. Bluestone quarries typically cover less than five acres and are worked by one to five men. Most are invisible, hidden in hollows or at the far end of back country roads.There are now 85 fully permitted bluestone mines in New York. Many more continue to operate without permits. In 2002, New York amended its mining law to give quarrymen more flexibility in exploring for bluestone. Instead of forcing them to get a full mining permit before they could start working, the state issued less costly exploration authorizations. These permitted Mr. Hennessey and other quarrymen to work on less than one acre for a year to see if there was enough bluestone in a new ledge, or in an abandoned one, to turn a profit.But there’s more. The permitting process allows state officials to get onto the quarries, where they can work with the men, as they did with Mr. Hennessey, to clean up and better protect the environment.“Earl’s quarry is a perfect example of what the state wanted to accomplish,” said Thomas P. Decker, a geologist who works with the quarrymen. “Before, the state didn’t have knowledge of places like this. Now they know where they are, and they can make sure that after the quarrymen are done, they put these places back the way they were.”The authorizations can be renewed for a second year. After that, they must either be converted to a full five-year mining permit, or surrendered, and the one-acre site restored. There are now 85 fully permitted bluestone mines in New York. Many more continue to operate without permits.Blood ties to land and stone are strong in this region. Mr. Hennessey’s father first brought him to the quarry when he was 3, and rock dust has been in his blood since then. Even during the 20 years he served in the Navy, he dreamed of coming back to the mountain.“It’s kind of like farming; it’s a way of life,” Mr. Hennessey said. His days start at sunrise, summer and winter, and when he is on the ridge, alone or with his brother-in-law Gerald Wormuth, there is no phone, no electricity, no water. The work is back-breaking hard, and the material pleasures are few.But at 2,500 feet above sea level, Mr. Hennessey can see across several valleys without spying a house or a road. Deer and hawks come close, and it’s awesome, he says.“It’s a hard way to make a living,” he said, “but it’s a good way to live.”The quarrymen have won the support of Senator John J. Bonacic, an upstate Republican who sponsored the bill to make the exploration authorization laws permanent. He did the same three years ago when the law expired for the first time, but the effort stalled in the Assembly.Assemblyman Robert K. Sweeney, a Long Island Democrat who is chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee, said the state’s endorsement of the measure this time should make the difference. “Without that, we wouldn’t be making it permanent,” he said.Mr. Hennessey said he did not look forward to changing the way he had done things since he was a boy, but he realized that change may be necessary, and he was willing to give it a try.“I’m not saying it’s bad, the stuff they want us to do,” he said. “You’ve just got to do things different than you did them years ago.”'"
"'08-05-13,'0','Wall Street rallied on Monday as oil prices fell, easing some investors’ concerns about accelerating inflation. The Dow Jones industrials gained more than 130 points.Light crude briefly reached a new trading high of $126.40, after gaining nearly $10 last week, but ended the day down $1.73 to settle at $124.23 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Investors also got some encouraging news about the credit crisis from HSBC Holdings, the global banking company based in London, which said its first-quarter profit was up from a year ago although it took a $3.2 billion write-down on subprime mortgage assets in the United States. The company echoed other assessments, however, that the United States was likely to fall into recession this year.JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said at a conference Monday that he estimated the credit market crisis was 75 percent over, but that the recession was just beginning.Monday’s gains showed investors were still willing to lay some bets.

"'08-05-13,'0','OTTAWA — General Motors of Canada interrupted labor contract negotiations on Monday to announce the closing of a plant that makes automatic transmissions and has 1,400 employees.The factory, in Windsor, Ontario, across the Detroit River from G.M.’s global headquarters, will close in about two years. It will be the first time since 1919 that the city, which historically was Canada’s automotive capital, will be without a G.M.-owned plant. The withdrawal by G.M. comes on top of the shutdown of some Ford operations in Windsor and employee reductions at a large Chrysler plant that builds minivans for that company as well as Volkswagen.The closing also renews concern in Canada about the country’s automotive industry, which is almost entirely based in Ontario. Most of the industry’s production is sold in the United States, where demand from Detroit-based manufacturers continues to decline. At the same time, the rise of the Canadian dollar to near parity with its American counterpart has eliminated a crucial cost advantage for factories in Canada.In a statement, G.M. Canada said the company was unable to find a new product for the plant to replace the four-speed automatic transmissions it makes. Those transmissions are being phased out in favor of models that improve fuel efficiency by offering two more gear ratios.“We have worked extensively with our labor and government partners but have been led to the unavoidable conclusion that there are no available replacement products in the relevant timeframe for this location,” Arturo Elias, the president of General Motors of Canada, said in a statement.'"
"'08-05-13,'0','In a large randomized trial of human lactation, researchers have found evidence that prolonged breast-feeding is associated with improved scores on some intelligence tests in childhood.The results, published in the May issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry, appear to confirm those of previous observational studies.Researchers in Belarus trained 8,457 mother-infant pairs with an extensive breast-feeding educational program, while a control group of 7,856 received standard care. At three months, 73 percent of the trained mothers, but only 60 percent of the controls, were still exclusively breast-feeding. By six months, exclusive breast-feeding had declined substantially in both groups, to 7.9 percent for the education group and 0.6 percent for the controls.At 6 ½ years, the breast-fed group scored significantly higher on tests of vocabulary, word matching and verbal I.Q., although the differences in several other tests of intelligence were not significant. Teacher ratings of the children were consistently higher for those who were breast-fed.It is unclear whether the differences were caused by a constituent of breast milk or by the associated physical and social interactions between mother and child. But the lead author, Dr. Michael S. Kramer, a professor of pediatrics at McGill University in Montreal, said the results could not be explained by characteristics of the mother or the way she related to her baby. “It’s the breast-feeding that’s doing it,” he said.'"

Consult a genetic counselor if you are concerned about your family history, and inquire about being tested for the genetic mutations that increase breast cancer risk (more common among Ashkenazi Jews). Do not forget that breast cancer genes come from both sides of the family, not just your mother’s.Among relatives, “the special red flags” are premenopausal breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer (cancer that appears in both breasts) and ovarian cancer, said Dr. Larry Norton, deputy physician in chief of breast cancer programs at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. But even if no one in the family had breast cancer, that is no guarantee that you are safe, said Dr. Runowicz; in fact, only 10 percent of breast cancer patients have a family history.Cut down on alcohol, or avoid it altogether. When it comes to breast cancer, studies have been pretty consistent: there is no safe amount of alcohol. Even one glass of wine a day can increase your risk slightly, and the risk climbs with each additional drink. “This is something you can control,” said Jasmine Q. Lew, a student at the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago who recently completed a National Institutes of Health study that is one of the largest on the subject. “Women can choose not to drink.”Exercise, exercise, exercise. Obesity after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer, so try to keep your weight down. But exercise is beneficial regardless of weight, and even a small amount of physical activity may be helpful. “Women who are overweight and exercising are at lower risk than those who are overweight and not exercising; women who are lean and exercising are at lower risk than women who are lean but not exercising,” Dr. Feigelson said. Risk drops with increased hours and strenuousness of exercise, and studies have found that women who do an average of three hours of strenuous exercise a week reduce their risk of breast cancer by 20 percent.Breast-feed if you can. Early menstruation, late menopause, postponing pregnancy and never having gone through a full-term pregnancy increase the risk of breast cancer, but those factors cannot be changed easily. If you do have a baby, however, you may want to breast-feed, and the longer the better; studies have found that breast-feeding reduces the risk of breast cancer.Try not to take combined hormone therapy. The recommendation for all hormone therapy is to take the lowest dose for the shortest period necessary. A Women’s Health Initiative study found a slightly higher risk for breast cancer among women who took estrogen with progestin after menopause, and a drop in breast cancer diagnoses since then has been attributed to the fact that many women quit using hormones. (In the same study, women on estrogen-only therapy, which is used by those who have had hysterectomies, did not have a higher breast-cancer risk.) A woman who has recently used birth control pills is also at greater risk; Dr. Norton urges women to find alternative contraceptive methods and avoid so-called natural or herbal hormones as well.Have regular mammograms, but if you have very dense breast tissue or are at high risk of breast cancer for other reasons, insist on an M.R.I. as well. Having high breast-tissue density can drastically raise your risk of developing breast cancer, as does finding atypical hyperplasia, or abnormal cell growth, which is confirmed by a biopsy. After a mammogram, discuss the results with your physician. “Everyone just wants to hear that it’s negative,” Dr. Runowicz said. But important information can be gleaned even from a negative screening, she said. “Learn about your breast density. If a biopsy shows hyperplasia, your doctor can put you on a chemoprevention program.”Become familiar with your personal risk factors. Your breast cancer risk could be higher than normal if you are above average height, upper middle class (probably related to the tendency to postpone childbearing and having fewer children), never had a full-term pregnancy or you had children after age 30, or if you ever had endometrial, ovarian or colon cancer or ever had high-dose radiation to the chest, your risk for breast cancer could be higher than average.'"
"'08-05-13,'0','In his address on Monday, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican president nominee, renewed his support for a “cap-and-trade” system in which power plants and other polluters could meet limits on heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from more efficient producers.Mr. McCain’s break with the Bush administration means that the three main presidential candidates have embraced swifter action to fight global warming.The two Democrats seeking their party’s presidential nomination, Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, criticized the McCain plan as too timid, because their plans would reduce emissions more quickly. Leaders of several environmental groups were also sharply critical and noted Mr. McCain’s Senate votes against incentives for energy conservation and alternative energy sources like wind and solar power.Other environmental advocates offered qualified praise for Mr. McCain, who was among the first in Congress to introduce legislation to address the carbon emissions that scientists blame for the warming of the planet.Mr. McCain said on Monday that the problem demanded urgent national and international action.“Instead of idly debating the precise extent of global warming, or the precise timeline of global warming, we need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters, and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring,” he said at a Vestas wind turbine manufacturing plant in Oregon, where the environment is a central issue for voters. “We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great.”The senator’s remarks were a clear criticism of Mr. Bush, who in his first term questioned the scientific basis for global warming and who has remained opposed to mandatory caps on emissions, which he says would be bad for the American economy. The administration also rejected the international Kyoto protocol, which limits emissions of heat-trapping gases.Mr. McCain’s speech, a compilation and sharpening of many of his existing proposals, was most notable as a political document that sought to appeal to the independents he is wooing for November. It put him slightly to the right of center in the environmental debate.Mr. McCain simultaneously released a television commercial in Oregon about his position on climate change, and startled audience members at his speech by praising and sharing the stage with Ted Kulongoski, the Democratic governor of Oregon who has endorsed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for president.Mr. McCain is the only Republican presidential candidate this year to call for mandatory limits on heat-trapping gases, but his target for reducing emissions is lower than that of Senators Clinton and Obama, and even lower than that in a bill proposed by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia.In his speech, Mr. McCain advocated cutting emissions 60 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2050; Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama propose cutting them by 80 percent in the same time frame while the Lieberman-Warner bills calls for a 70 percent reduction. Scientists say reductions of that magnitude are needed to slow and then reverse production of the gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, which are heating the atmosphere and causing long-term climate changes.Mr. McCain said the United States must seek new, cleaner sources of energy to replace the burning of coal and oil, which produce the bulk of the gases that are blamed for the warming of the planet. “As we move toward all of these goals, and over time put the age of fossil fuels behind us,” he said, “we must consider every alternative source of power, and that includes nuclear power.”Mr. McCain has long advocated nuclear power as a way to cut emissions, and frequently promotes it in his campaign appearances as an alternative energy source. His view is shared by many utility executives and many Republicans in Congress, but it puts him at odds with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, who have expressed skepticism about the cost and safety of nuclear power plants.There are no incentives for building new nuclear plants in the Lieberman-Warner legislation now before the Senate that his Democratic rivals have endorsed, and Mr. McCain suggested on Friday that he would not support the measure unless it contained some nuclear power subsidies.Mr. McCain’s proposal in his prepared remarks to impose tariffs on industrializing countries like China and India is also made in the Lieberman-Warner bill and reflects concerns by both industry and labor in the United States and elsewhere in the industrialized world. It would mandate punitive duties on products from any country that did not participate in a global carbon-reduction system, to balance the lower cost of producing goods using dirty-energy sources.In another contrast with Mr. Bush, Mr. McCain also sought to persuade voters that he had a personal concern and first-hand experience with climate change, which has emerged as a major issue in the 2008 presidential race.“A few years ago I traveled to the area of Svalbard, Norway —it’s a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean,” Mr. McCain said. “I was shown the southernmost point where a glacier had reached twenty years earlier. From there, we went northward for miles, up the fjord to see where that same glacier ends today, because all the rest, all the rest, has melted.”Reaction to Mr. McCain proposals from environmental advocates was lukewarm. Several environmental groups said that his plan did not go far enough but that they were grateful to hear a Republican recognizing what they consider an urgent problem and offering a detailed plan to solve it. But Mr. McCain came under considerable criticism for repeatedly opposing federal programs to encourage energy conservation and alternative fuel sources.Daniel J. Weiss, who heads the global warming program at the Center for American Progress in Washington, said Mr. McCain had often voted with Democrats on environmental bills but at other times had taken contrary positions.'"
"'08-05-13,'0','PORTLAND, Ore. — Senator John McCain sought to distance himself from President Bush on Monday as he called for a mandatory limit on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States to combat climate change.Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also pledged to work with the European Union to diplomatically engage China and India, two of the world’s biggest polluters, if those nations refused to participate in an international agreement to slow global warming.In what his campaign promoted as a major speech on climate change, the Arizona senator renewed his support for a “cap-and-trade” system in which power plants and other polluters could meet limits on greenhouse gases by either reducing emissions on their own or buying credits from more efficient producers.“Instead of idly debating the precise extent of global warming or the precise timeline of global warming, we need to deal with the central facts of rising temperatures, rising waters and all the endless troubles that global warming will bring,” Mr. McCain said at a wind power plant in Oregon, a state that is expected to be a political battleground in the general election and where the environment is a central issue for voters. “We stand warned by serious and credible scientists across the world that time is short and the dangers are great.”Mr. McCain added pointedly: “I will not shirk the mantle of leadership that the United States bears. I will not permit eight long years to pass without serious action on serious challenges.”'"
"'08-05-13,'0','Mr. Ghosn was not always enthusiastic about alternative-fuel technology. In a 2005 speech to the National Automobile Dealers Association, he called gas-electric hybrids “niche products” useful only to meet strict fuel-economy and emission standards in states like .“It wasn’t long ago that Carlos Ghosn was a big naysayer about the role of electric vehicles,” said John O’Dell, senior editor at the auto Web site . “Obviously, something has opened his eyes.”Other automakers like and Fuji Heavy Industries are testing versions of electric cars, and and are working on battery-powered vehicles that have small gasoline engines for recharging. G.M. plans to start producing the Chevrolet Volt in 2010, while Toyota expects to offer a similar, so-called “plug-in” hybrid around the same time.But Nissan, which a decade ago was on the brink of bankruptcy, is the first manufacturer to say it will sell mass market, all-electric vehicles worldwide. The zero emissions refers to those from the car’s tailpipe and not those from the production of electricity used to power the car.Still, Mr. O’Dell said: “Nissan is upping the ante tremendously. They are the first to put it on the line and say we’re going to have an all-electric vehicle for a certain market by a certain date.”Mr. Ghosn declined to disclose details of the electric products and said initial quantities would be small. “We’re talking about hundreds of vehicles first,” he said.But he said that the company was determined to achieve “zero-emission-vehicle leadership.”With customers in emerging markets like China and India clamoring for cars, the industry has a responsibility to invest in the cleanest vehicles possible, he said, adding, “The question is how we participate in the growth of emerging markets, while doing it in a way that is not in contradiction with the fact that a lot of people are sensitive to the emission levels and the preservation of the planet.”Early this year, Nissan and its French alliance partner, , signed a deal with the California-based Project Better Place to produce electric cars for sale in and .Renault will provide the cars and Nissan will supply lithium-ion battery packs. Mr. Ghosn, who also serves as chief executive of Renault, said the Israeli government would encourage sales of electric cars by sharply cutting taxes to levels below those on gasoline-powered vehicles.“We would never have done this if the Israeli government was not encouraging it,” he said. “Whoever puts the most incentive on the table is going to get the technology first.”The goal to sell electric vehicles is part of a new five-year business plan, called Nissan GT 2012, also to be announced Tuesday. It contains goals that are among the most ambitious set by Mr. Ghosn since he took the reins at Nissan in 1999.In previous plans, Mr. Ghosn set strict targets for cost cuts, profit and return on investments to turn around the company’s lagging fortunes.But now Nissan is healthier. It is expected to report a profit in the most recent fiscal year of $4.1 billion.The next five years, Mr. Ghosn said, would focus on growth and trust. “Trust is about sustainability,” he said. “It’s about return, it’s about loyalty. In our industry, the companies that are performing best are the ones that have established a high level of trust with the different stakeholders.”The goals also call for Nissan to match the best industry standards in vehicle quality and to increase its revenue by an average of 5 percent each year.The company plans to introduce 60 models worldwide by 2012. Several new products are planned for the United States market, including a new Maxima sedan, the Cube small car and a new version of the Z-family sports cars.Renault and Nissan have also joined with an Indian carmaker, Bajaj Auto, to produce a $2,500 car by 2011.The new business plan and electric-car pledge represent a comeback effort of sorts for Mr. Ghosn, whose status as an industry superstar was tarnished in an aborted effort to extend the Nissan-Renault alliance to General Motors in 2006.The alliance talks were spurred by the investor , who was then a major G.M. shareholder. Though Mr. Ghosn was willing to conclude a deal, G.M. management rebuffed him.Nissan recently struck joint ventures with the now-private to build vehicles in each other’s plants, but Mr. Ghosn played down the chances of bringing the American automaker as a full partner into the Nissan-Renault alliance.“We’re not in a hurry,” he said, “but if we feel there is a good opportunity for us to add a North American partner, we need to take it seriously. For now, we have to be very cautious.”But Nissan is being more aggressive about its electric-car efforts. Mr. Ghosn declined to say how much an electric vehicle would cost, but stressed that they would be affordable and comparable with other vehicles in the marketplace.“We are not interested in some ‘Stars Wars’ prototype,” he said, “but in really bringing a mass market product that everybody can buy. It’s really a new chapter in the life of this industry.”He said that as many as 10 million of the 69 million vehicles produced each year worldwide could ultimately be electric-powered, with a concentration in urban areas. “We think that cars sold in cities are the obvious first starting point,” he said.Electric cars are typically recharged by plugging the vehicle into an electrical outlet at home or elsewhere overnight. But previous attempts at electric vehicles were hampered by the length of time needed to recharge the battery, and the limited distances the cars could travel on a single charge.How customers will respond to a mass market electric car is still unknown, Mr. O’Dell said. Concerns about driving range and reliability, he said, would generate a “healthy skepticism.”'"

"'08-05-14,'1','Mimicking a strategy that proved successful in 2006, Democrats ran staunch conservatives in both this and the Louisiana race, forcing their Republican opponents to attack national party figures as surrogates.Mr. Davis had been hoping for a large turnout in his home of DeSoto County, where roughly 15 percent of the district’s voters live, and which is solidly Republican and mostly white. But a last-minute appearance for him by Mr. Cheney on Monday apparently failed to rally his base sufficiently; indeed a modest room at a local convention center was hardly packed.“There are indications that the normal Republican turnout is just not there,” Mr. Black said. “If they can’t win up there, where are you going to win?”Both Mississippi candidates depicted themselves as down-the-line conservatives on social issues, and there was little difference between them on abortion and gun rights: staunchly against the first, and for the second.But the Republican strategy of trying to link Mr. Childers to more liberal national Democratic figures fell short, as it did in Louisiana. Indeed, voters here were bombarded by advertisements equating Mr. Childers with Senator Barack Obama, a tactic intended to turn conservative whites away from Mr. Childers and which some politicians said played on white racial resentments. Mr. Childers, for his part, fiercely resisted the connection, calling himself over and over a “Mississippi Democrat.”The defeat is certain to put a damper on plans by Congressional Republican plans to roll out their new policy agenda this week in an effort to turn around their fortunes.Several House Republicans, who were already scheduled to meet on Wednesday, have said privately they do not see a wholesale leadership shake-up or an overhaul of their campaign operation as a strong option, given that the election is just six months away. But they are likely to consider some changes in response to the Mississippi defeat. Former Speaker Newt Gingrich warned last week that Republicans need a major shift to forestall heavy losses in November.When Mr. Childers is sworn in, the House will have 236 Democrats to 199 Republicans. The seat was vacated when Representative Roger Wicker, a Republican, was appointed to succeed former Senator Trent Lott.In the end, tying the white Democrat to the black presidential candidate may have helped Mr. Childers more than it hurt him, as campaign aides reported heavy black turnout, heavier than in a vote three weeks ago when he came within 400 votes of winning.“I like what Childers was saying: he was more truthful and down to earth,” said Mary Shelton, an African-American who had just voted for him at the Yalobusha County courthouse here.And Mr. Childers’s association with the party that might nominate Mr. Obama didn’t hurt either. “We need a change, we really do,” Ms. Shelton said.Mr. Childers won Yalobusha, having lost it in the April vote.And even in this district, it is not difficult to find conservative voters dissatisfied with the administration in Washington. “There’s a lot of people that are mad at Bush,” said Jim Jennings, a retired businessman, sitting at a table with Republican voters at a barbecue restaurant in DeSoto County.Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the party was disappointed and needed to be better prepared to deal with conservative Democratic candidates, but he warned that time is short.“Voters remain pessimistic about the direction of the country and the Republican Party in general,” Mr. Cole said. “Republicans must undertake bold efforts to define a forward-looking agenda that offers the kind of positive change voters are looking for.”'"
"'08-05-14,'1','Consumer prices in Britain rose 3 percent in April compared with a year earlier, propelled by rising prices for home gas, electricity and heating oil, the government said. The increase magnifies the contrary pressures on the Bank of England, which has been cautiously cutting rates to stimulate a slowing economy while seeking to hold inflation in check. Underlining that challenge, the British Retail Consortium reported that sales fell 1.5 percent in April, the second consecutive monthly decline. The consumer inflation rate, which was 2.5 percent in March, is now a full point above the government’s target.'"

"'08-05-14,'1','Mr. Nikolic said before the election that he would offer Mr. Kostunica the top post in a new coalition. The president of Serbia, Boris Tadic, who is in favor of aligning with Western Europe, broke with Mr. Kostunica in February. He said he would never have Mr. Kostunica as prime minister again.To form a majority government, Mr. Nikolic and Mr. Kostunica need support from the Socialist Party of Slobodan Milosevic, who was ousted in 2000 when Mr. Kostunica came to power.Mr. Nikolic said he and Mr. Kostunica would meet on Wednesday to see if his terms were acceptable to the Socialists.“If they are, we’ll have a government,” he told the Beta news agency. “If not, the Radicals will be in opposition.”But two days after voters gave the Socialists 20 parliamentary seats in the election, which was prompted by the collapse of the Tadic-Kostunica coalition, the Socialists were keeping their options open.They are also being courted by Mr. Tadic’s Democratic Party bloc, which came out on top in the voting on Sunday, earning 39 percent of the vote compared with the Radicals’ 29 percent.The newspaper Politika said that if the Socialists backed Mr. Tadic, “no one in the West would be able to call them ‘the forces of the past’ anymore, while Tadic would benefit from the Socialist image as fighters for social justice.”Mr. Tadic’s Democratic-led Coalition for a European Serbia also said that it had entered coalition talks on Tuesday.It did not say with whom, but in an unmistakable overture to the Socialists, Mr. Tadic pledged he would “work for the good of absolutely all citizens, on the principles of social justice, protection of workers’ rights and creation of new jobs.”In Brussels, Javier Solana, the European Union’s foreign affairs chief, said he wanted to see a stable coalition in Serbia that was in favor of strengthening Serbia’s ties with Western Europe. He made it clear that he would not object if the coalition included the Socialists.Mr. Solana was head of NATO in 1999, when the alliance went to war over Kosovo, bombing Serbia for 11 weeks until Mr. Milosevic gave in and withdrew his forces from Kosovo.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','NORTH BEND, Wash. — Senator John McCain intensified his criticism of President Bush and the administration’s environmental polices on Tuesday, taking a walk in the cold, rain-drenched foothills of the Cascade Mountains and asserting that in the effort to stem climate change, “America can lead and not obstruct.”At an outdoor news conference in the Cedar River Watershed east of Seattle, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, declared that “the president and I have disagreed on this issue for many years — it isn’t a recent disagreement.” He added, “There is a longstanding, significant, deep, strong difference on this issue between myself and the administration.”Mr. McCain was on his second day of a trip to the Pacific Northwest, a potential swing region in the November election, to promote his plan to slow global warming and appeal to the region’s many independent voters who view the environment as an election issue of critical concern. Mr. Bush, who questioned the scientific basis for global warming in his first term, is deeply unpopular, and Mr. McCain, whom the president endorsed at the White House in March, has been sprinting away from him this week.The senator has proposed mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States — Mr. Bush is opposed — but Mr. McCain’s Democratic competitors, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, have offered plans to reduce emissions more quickly.Asked at his news conference why voters who are concerned about the environment should support him over Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton, Mr. McCain said that his proposal was “doable” and that his rivals “have never to my knowledge been involved in legislation nor hearings nor engagement in this issue.”He did not mention that in 2007, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama were co-sponsors of an emissions-curbing bill that he introduced with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut. In addition, Mrs. Clinton went with Mr. McCain and other senators on a 2004 trip to Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago, to see the effects of global warming. Mr. McCain mentioned that journey in a speech Monday on climate change, but he did not mention that Mrs. Clinton was one of those who went along.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','“These are welcome signs, of course, but at this stage conditions in financial markets are still far from normal,” he said.For instance, there are still strains involving a widely used interest rate called the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, Mr. Bernanke said. And “funding pressures” have also been evident in the “strong participation” of commercial banks in a Fed auction program that has made billions of dollars available in short-term cash loans, he said.Mr. Bernanke said the Fed policy makers were ready to further increase the size of these loans in the future if warranted by financial developments.Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in a separate speech Tuesday, offered a similar assessment of financial conditions. “There are some rays of hope that the strains may be easing a bit,” she said. The Fed’s efforts, she said, “have mitigated the worst effects of the credit crunch. But they have not resolved it.”In his speech, Mr. Bernanke did not talk about the Fed’s next move on interest rates or the broader state of the economy, which many fear is on the edge of a recession or in one already.Many economists say they believe the Fed will hold steady on interest rates and focus more on its various efforts to relieve stressed credit markets.Ultimately, financial companies will need to raise new capital and improve risk management to address the fundamental sources of financial strains, Mr. Bernanke said. “This process is likely to take some time,” he added.And once financial conditions become more normal, the extraordinary provisions to provide ready sources of cash to financial institutions will no longer be needed, he said.Even as the Fed has stepped in to provide such help, it also is mindful of creating a “moral hazard,” where financial institutions might be more inclined to take certain risks if they think the Fed will be there to bail them out.“The problem of moral hazard can perhaps be most effectively addressed by prudential supervision and regulation that ensures that financial institutions manage their liquidity risks effectively in advance of the crisis,” Mr. Bernanke said.The Fed is reviewing its policies on this front to see if improvements can be made, he said.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','Dottie Rambo, a singer and prolific songwriter who was one of the most successful women to write songs in gospel music, died early Sunday when her tour bus ran off a highway near Mount Vernon, Mo. She was 74 and lived in Nashville.Her death was announced by her daughter, Reba Rambo-McGuire, who is also a singer.With songs recorded by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Vince Gill and Whitney Houston, and a busy recording and touring career of her own, Ms. Rambo has been ubiquitous in gospel since the early 1960s. Many of her songs have become hymnal standards, including “I Go to the Rock,” “We Shall Behold Him,” “I Will Glory in the Cross” and “He Looked Beyond My Fault (and Saw My Need),” which uses the tune of “Danny Boy.”The audience for Ms. Rambo’s style of Southern gospel is chiefly white. But she broke through the genre’s racial boundaries as one of the first white artists to use black backup singers. Her 1968 album of spirituals, “It’s the Soul of Me,” became one of her most successful solo projects, but it caused a stir in the gospel world when it won a Grammy Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance, a category whose winners were usually black.Born Joyce Reba Luttrell in Anton, Ky., she left home at 12 and married Buck Rambo at 16. While still a teenager she made a publishing deal with Jimmie Davis, a two-time governor of Louisiana who was both composer and singer of “You Are My Sunshine” and other hits.In her group with her husband, the Singing Rambos (later the Rambos), she sang inspirational lyrics in a folksy alto and helped develop a sound that had links to both country music and black gospel.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','KUWAIT (Agence France-Presse) — Sheik Saad Abdullah al-Sabah, briefly the emir of Kuwait, has died after a long illness, the royal court announced on Tuesday in a statement broadcast by state television. He was 78.Sheik Saad was already ailing when he succeeded to the throne in 2006 after the death of his predecessor, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah. He stepped down nine days later, after rivals from another branch of the family and opposition within Parliament created a political crisis.Born in 1930, Sheik Saad was the eldest son of Sheik Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah, the 11th emir of Kuwait. He was Kuwait’s crown prince from 1977 to 2006. He was also prime minister from 1977 to 2003, when he gave up the post because of poor health.Sheik Saad received his basic education in Kuwait, then took courses at Hendon Police College in London until 1954.He held various posts in the Kuwaiti police and public security services until 1959, when he was appointed deputy director of the police and public security department. He remained in that post until 1961.In January 1962, Sheik Saad was appointed interior minister in the first Kuwaiti cabinet after it became independent from Britain.

"'08-05-14,'1','Jeff Nelligan, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said on Tuesday that the Medicaid program was “reeling” financially, and that “one of the reasons that it’s reeling is that states have operated a kind of shell game with Medicaid funding.” He said that using Medicaid money for graduate medical education “is not even authorized in the statute,” but that “states have taken it upon themselves to divert funds to that end.”“In a time of limited federal and state resources,” he added, “it is important to prioritize Medicaid spending and target it to its primary purpose: directly improving the health outcomes of Medicaid beneficiaries.”In 2006, 40 percent of all Medicaid funds for medical training nationwide, or $1.36 billion, went to New York State. The Medicaid money also accounted for 40 percent of the $3.4 billion spent on graduate medical education in the state.Of the nation’s 107,000 medical residencies, 16,500, or 15 percent, are in New York State, and 12,200 of them in New York City according to the Independent Budget Office.Mr. Raske of the hospital association estimated that because of demographic changes, the nation needs to produce at least 30 percent more physicians by the year 2020, noting that because medical education takes 7 to 11 years, training programs need to expand now, not shrink.The Independent Budget Office analysis found that the proposed cut would cost the city’s public hospitals about $390 million in federal and state funds, about 7.5 percent of their overall budget. It would cost the city’s private hospitals about $790 million, 4.4 percent of their total revenue, the report said.Some of the worst-hit public hospitals in New York City would be Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx, Woodhull Medical Center in Brooklyn, Metropolitan Hospital and Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, and Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, the report says.Ultimately, the analysis suggested, the state’s consumers would feel the cuts in the form of higher salaries for the smaller number of doctors being trained. The budget office argued that contrary to the Bush administration’s contention that it was focusing Medicaid resources on poor people, the cut would hurt health care in poor neighborhoods, where doctors in training are a major source of medical care.Although New York receives by far the largest amount of money for teaching hospitals, other states also get substantial amounts, like California, which stands to lose $180 million, and Florida, which would lose $150 million.The report warned that “an abrupt termination” of the financing “could cause severe disruptions to the finances of both public and voluntary hospitals, to patient care and to the city’s economy.”'"
"'08-05-14,'1','TOKYO (AP) — Nissan became the latest major Japanese automaker to report booming earnings for the fiscal year that just ended, and it was also the latest to forecast a plunge in profit for the current year, blaming a rising yen and soaring material costs.“There is no way we can overcome these headwinds,” Nissan’s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, told reporters Tuesday at company headquarters in Tokyo.Nissan Motor, Japan’s third-biggest automaker, expects profit for the fiscal year through March 2009 to drop 30 percent, to 340 billion yen ($3.3 billion). Last fiscal year, its net profit rose 5 percent, to 482.3 billion yen ($4.6 billion).Its bigger rivals Toyota and Honda also announced strong annual earnings and dismal forecasts amid worries about the slumping United States economy and strong yen. Toyota Motor expects its fiscal-year profit will fall 27 percent, while Honda Motor foresees an 18 percent drop.For the January-March quarter, Nissan’s net profit rose 67 percent, to 137.6 billion yen ($1.3 billion). That includes one-time “fifth-quarter” numbers from overseas subsidiaries that were added to the previous year’s fourth quarter to put all global units on the same calendar. Without those numbers, quarterly profit jumped 95 percent.Nissan sold 3.77 million vehicles worldwide for the fiscal year that ended March 31, up 8.2 percent from the previous year. In North America, Nissan’s sales totaled 1.35 million vehicles, up 1.3 percent on the year.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','Re “Top Colleges Dig Deeper in Wait Lists for Students” (news article, May 9):The report that highly selective colleges are admitting more applicants from their wait lists is good news for thousands of students. But it raises doubts that abandoning early admission programs increases access and reduces stress for lower-income students.In fact, such students may be more disadvantaged during this prolonged admission season.They and their counselors are generally unaware of the sophisticated tactics that can move their applications from the wait list piles to the admit piles. And their families may be less willing to spend their much-needed tax rebates, perhaps arriving on the same day as their new admission offers, on yet another tuition deposit.Reforming admission practices to attract more low- and moderate-income students is the right goal for the nation’s most elite colleges. But merely shifting uncertainty and apprehension from the beginning of senior year to the few weeks before beginning college is the wrong answer.The writer served as an admission officer at Stanford University and as a college counselor at a high school near Boston.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','“The Adirondacks,” a two-hour special on most PBS stations on Wednesday night, offers a little history, a little culture and a whole lot of gorgeous, gauzy travelogue: misty mountain lakes, organic arugula at luxury resorts and straight-faced eco-spiritual narration (“the great green empire of leaves that took all spring and summer to build”). Watching it, some city dwellers will want to gag, and quite a few others will want to book a weekend on Saranac Lake.The producers of the documentary, which include the PBS station WNED in Buffalo and Toronto, are clearly trying to drum up some business for the economically stagnant towns of New York State in the 6.1 million acres of Adirondack Park, the largest in the continental United States. (A graphic demonstrates that it could contain Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier and Grand Canyon National Parks with room to spare.)And therein lies a paradox: if too many of us hopped in our cars and headed up the Thruway, we would threaten the unusual balance between publicly protected wilderness and private land that — along with the advent of cheap air travel — has preserved the park as an idyllic backwater for decades.If the development issue is what interests you, tune in during the second hour, when the film looks at the fight over a proposed condo-and-resort complex near the town of Tupper Lake. You’ll learn that the park was created, and its public areas mandated to be “forever kept as wild,” for commercial rather than aesthetic reasons. Furious logging in the late 1800s threatened to play havoc with water levels downstream in the Hudson River and the Erie Canal.More than a century later, neighbors argue at public hearings about the spirit of the law and the future of their shrinking towns. Viewers can decide which of the film’s talking heads is right: the environmentalist and writer Bill McKibben, who expresses optimism, or the public radio reporter Brian Mann, who is based in the Adirondacks and worries that in 20 years the towns will have vanished.The rest of the film, which suffers from a Chamber of Commerce-level script but looks great, treats us to shots of picturesque main streets, lavish new museums, the “great camps” of 19th-century industrialists and a panoply of outdoor pursuits, including an annual 90-mile boat race (no motors allowed). We also hear an adage that just might keep you from doing your part for the local economy: the Adirondacks have two seasons, winter and the Fourth of July.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','“The truth of the matter is that in order for there to be a substantial change either consumers have to change their habits — which we’re encouraging through alternative tax of automobiles — or there has to be an increase of supply,” he said in the interview.Estimates of the impact of suspending the deposits varied. Some economists predicted the impact would be negligible, while Speaker Nancy Pelosi, citing others who have studied the issue, said prices could drop 5 to 24 cents a gallon.But Representative Joe L. Barton of Texas, the senior Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, said the measure was meaningless. “If all the members of the House would go out onto the steps and clap our hands three times and say, ‘Down prices, down prices,’ that would have as much impact as passing this bill,” he said.In any event, lawmakers cautioned that any price decline from suspending the oil deposits would be temporary and that the plan pushed by Democrats was not a long-term solution.“They have just a one-shot bill here, and it’s pretty good, but it isn’t an energy policy,” said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.Before the Senate voted to halt the deposits into the reserve, which is now near 97 percent capacity, lawmakers voted 56 to 42 against a Republican energy proposal that pushed for greater domestic production of oil by opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other coastal areas to drilling. The measure fell 18 votes short of the 60 needed, with 6 Republicans joining Democrats in opposing the measure.Republicans said that they had been willing to back some investment in alternative energy and higher automobile mileage standards, but that Democrats refused to consider tapping new domestic sources of oil as part of a broad energy approach.“We have offered a plan that would increase supply,” said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas. “And it would be from our own resources, so that America would not have to depend on foreign sources for our energy needs.”But Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, said it was too late for “us to produce our way out of the problems that we now have.”Mr. Reid said he hoped, within the next week, to start consideration of a Democratic energy plan. But even if he can bring it to the floor, the proposal is unlikely to overcome a filibuster by Republicans objecting to new taxes on oil company profits to pay for alternative energy investment. And Mr. Reid said he was not inclined to pursue separately another idea that has bipartisan support — an effort to rein in speculation in the oil markets.A group of Democratic senators also sought to put pressure on Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Bush will be visiting this week, as they called on the Saudis to increase their oil production or face the possibility of Congress blocking a pending arms deal.“We are saying to the Saudis that if you don’t help us, why should we be helping you?” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. “We are saying that the relationship has to be a two-way street. We are saying that we need real relief and we need it quickly.”'"
"'08-05-14,'1','Analysts have compared Mr. Brown to the hapless John Major, the last Conservative prime minister, who was ousted in the Labor landslide of 1997.Many of Mr. Brown’s political woes can be traced to economic problems associated with the credit crunch on both sides of the Atlantic. Britain has faced accelerating inflation, a weakening pound, upheaval in the banking sector and falling home prices. And he has not escaped a personal accounting for much of what has gone wrong, in part because he was chancellor of the Exchequer during the years of fast-rising public and personal debt that preceded the current economic turbulence.After a hopeful beginning last summer, when Mr. Brown was widely praised for his handling of Britain’s worst floods in a generation, failed terrorist attacks in London and Glasgow, an outbreak of potentially disastrous foot-and-mouth disease among cattle and an accelerated drawdown of British forces in Iraq, his fortunes have plunged amid a welter of policy miscues and economic setbacks.The most damaging of these has been Mr. Brown’s decision as chancellor, in his final budget last year, to abolish a 10 percent income tax rate for certain workers — a change that critics, many of them within the Labor Party itself, say will hurt more than five million of Britain’s poorest people. On Tuesday, public anger over the tax issue led the Brown government to announce what amounted to a $5.3 billion tax cut for anyone earning less than $80,000 a year.The latest salvos began exploding around Mr. Brown last weekend with the newspaper serialization of the memoirs of Cherie Blair, the wife of the former prime minister. In her book, “Speaking for Myself,” due for publication in the fall, she wrote that Mr. Brown had been “rattling the keys” to Downing Street over Mr. Blair’s head in the period before his third election victory, in 2005.Mrs. Blair’s accounts of the feuding by the two were compounded when memoir excerpts from another veteran of the Blair years, John Prescott, were also published over the weekend. Mr. Prescott, who was deputy prime minister, said he had sought unsuccessfully for years to broker peace between the men, participating in “what must have been hundreds of phone calls, meetings, pre-summits, summits and dinners” with them.In an excerpt from her book published on Monday, Mrs. Blair hinted that Mr. Brown might have leaked word to newspapers when she was pregnant with her fourth child, Leo, in 1998, suggesting that perhaps Mr. Brown, then still a bachelor in his mid-40s, wanted to spread the impression that Mr. Blair was too distracted by family matters to be effective as prime minister. A spokesman said Mr. Brown, now married with two small children, was “totally baffled” by the suggestion.Perhaps more damaging was Mr. Prescott’s assertion that Mr. Brown was subject to repeated fits of anger, something Downing Street insiders have also suggested since he became prime minister. Mr. Prescott described Mr. Brown as “frustrating, annoying, bewildering and prickly,” and said that at times he could “go off like a bloody volcano.”Together, the memoirs offered an unflattering portrait that seemed likely to reinforce the widespread sense that Mr. Brown was no match for the easygoing charisma of Mr. Blair — and perhaps for the 41-year-old Conservative leader, David Cameron. Many who have met Mr. Brown, including senior American officials, say he is more charming in person than the dour, somewhat grumpy figure he often seems on television.For the Labor Party, the spectacle of some of the party’s most prominent figures feuding bitterly in public has been almost as damaging as the grim characterizations of Mr. Brown, drawing more comparisons to the last years of Mr. Major, when he presided over a government whose public support evaporated amid Conservative infighting, scandals and economic blunders.Publishing industry insiders have said Mrs. Blair sped up the serialization of her memoir to take advantage of the turmoil embroiling Mr. Brown. British newspapers have said Mrs. Blair received an advance of $3 million for the book, plus hundreds of thousands of dollars for the serialization rights.The dissension has exposed continuing fissures between the reformist “New Labor” wing associated with Mr. Blair, and a left-wing contingent that accepted Mr. Blair because of his ability to win elections but saw Mr. Brown, a Scot with strong leftist links, as a reluctant New Laborite who would return the party to a more socialist stance. Some of the harshest criticism of Mr. Brown has come from former Blair loyalists still bristling over the way Mr. Brown pushed their man to resign halfway through the term he won in 2005. They have pointed to one recent poll suggesting that 55 percent of people who voted Labor in 2005 favor Mr. Brown’s quitting the Labor leadership now.Mr. Brown, stoic in the face of the attacks, has drawn some analogies of his own from the Conservative years in power, noting that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Mr. Major overcame poor opinion poll showings between elections to win new mandates in general elections. In the House of Commons, Mr. Brown has dismissed Mr. Cameron and the Conservatives as substituting political showmanship for substance, and predicted that British voters will turn back to Labor as his government introduces new social and economic policies.He has also vowed not to quit.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','In legal parlance, severance of a case can mean that it could proceed separately.Mr. Qahtani has sometimes been referred to as the 20th hijacker because of evidence that he tried to enter the United States a few days before Sept. 11, 2001, and that he was in touch with the men who became the hijackers.Mr. Qahtani’s military lawyer, Lt. Col. Bryan Broyles of the Army, said he believed that Ms. Crawford’s decision meant that efforts to try Mr. Qahtani were over. “It is unlikely that they are ever going to try him,” Colonel Broyles said.He said he believed Ms. Crawford might have concluded that evidence against Mr. Qahtani was “derived by torture,” which could undermine the prosecution’s case.The decision permitted the prosecutors to proceed with the case against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the self-professed planner of the attacks, and four other men held at Guantánamo whom officials describe as “high-value detainees.” The five were held in secret C.I.A. prisons until they were transferred to Guantánamo in 2006.Mr. Mohammed’s lawyer, Capt. Prescott L. Prince of the Navy, said the effort to press ahead with the charges against those detainees was political. He said prosecutors were trying to rely on evidence obtained through coercion or torture that would not be admissible in civilian or regular military courts.Mr. Mohammed is one of three former C.I.A. prisoners government officials have said were questioned using the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding.Military lawyers for several of the five detainees said they expected to begin extensive legal challenges to the military commission system. “Given the political nature of the entire process,” Captain Prince said, “I just don’t see how my client can get a fair trial before military commissions.”Lawyers said it was difficult to analyze the significance of Ms. Crawford’s decision, particularly since the charges were originally announced in February in a news conference by her legal adviser, Brig. Gen. Thomas W. Hartmann.Questioned about the decision, the spokesman, Captain Kok, said commission rules “do not require the Convening Authority to explain her decisions.”Ms. Crawford is a quasi-judicial official with broad powers, including the power to reduce or reject charges brought by prosecutors.But lawyers involved with the defense said they had seen a memorandum to Ms. Crawford from General Hartmann that could help explain the decision. They said General Hartmann had concluded that seeking the death penalty was appropriate for Mr. Mohammed and the other four detainees, who have been described as high-level planners and facilitators.But the lawyers said General Hartmann concluded that prosecutors should not seek the death penalty for Mr. Qahtani. One lawyer who saw the memorandum said it did not include a reason why.But other lawyers noted that Mr. Qahtani might have been only a low-level plotter, and an unsuccessful one at that.Other lawyers said a factor might have been the long record of Mr. Qahtani’s treatment at Guantánamo. Gitanjali Gutierrez, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing Mr. Qahtani, said it appeared that officials were pressing for quick trials and that the issues of Mr. Qahtani’s treatment might have been an obstacle. “There’s no question about what happened to him,” she said.The timing of the announcement was unexpected, coming days after a military judge in another case disqualified General Hartmann from participating in that case, saying the general was so closely aligned with the prosecution that it was not clear he could carry out his role with the required neutrality. That case is against a detainee who was a driver for Osama bin Laden.On Tuesday, several of the military defense lawyers said they would seek dismissal of the charges against the five detainees in the Sept. 11 case because of General Hartmann’s involvement. Several lawyers said they were perplexed about why Ms. Crawford would proceed when it was clear that General Hartmann’s participation would bring new legal challenges.But Maj. Jon S. Jackson, the defense lawyer for one of the men charged, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, said the decision to proceed despite the general’s involvement was “illegal because he has acted outside his role as a neutral and detached legal adviser.”'"
"'08-05-14,'1','In his book “Jerusalem Countdown,” Mr. Hagee accused the Vatican of collaborating with Hitler in the Holocaust. In addition, some critics have interpreted Mr. Hagee’s references to “the great whore” prophesied in the Book of Revelation as a slur on the Roman Catholic Church. Mr. Hagee now says that was never his intention.Mr. Hagee has focused on raising money and building support for Israel among evangelical Protestants, and his letter places his regrets in that context.“In my zeal to oppose anti-Semitism and bigotry in all its ugly forms,” he wrote, “I have often emphasized the darkest chapters in the history of Catholic and Protestant relations with the Jews.“In the process, I may have contributed to the mistaken impression that the anti-Jewish violence of the Crusades and the Inquisition defines the Catholic Church. It does not.”Mr. Hagee’s letter, dated May 12, was addressed to William Donohue, president of the Catholic League for Civil and Religious Rights, who drew attention to Mr. Hagee’s remarks after he endorsed Mr. McCain in February.Mr. Donohue said of Mr. Hagee’s letter: “Well, miracles do happen. If I wasn’t a believer before, I sure am now.“Republican activists have been working with him over the last several weeks, giving him books and articles and getting him up to speed and away from the black legends about the Catholic Church. I have to assume he’s acting sincerely, and now understands” that he has been recycling conspiracy theories.At a news conference on Tuesday afternoon in North Bend, Wash., outside Seattle, Mr. McCain praised Mr. Hagee’s letter. “The fact that he has made an apology I think is very helpful,” Mr. McCain said. “Whenever someone apologizes for something they did wrong, then I think that that’s a laudable thing.”Asked if he or his campaign were involved in the apology, Mr. McCain replied, “I certainly wasn’t.”Mr. Hagee and his wife held a meeting on Friday to mend fences with about 12 Catholic political conservatives over lunch at a restaurant in Washington, said several attendees.Deal W. Hudson, a member of Catholics for McCain and the director of the Web site InsideCatholic.com, said he had helped broker the meeting.Mr. Hudson said that at the lunch Mr. Hagee explained that in his eschatology of the end times the Catholic Church could not possibly be the “whore” mentioned in Revelation and that he had been misunderstood. Mr. Hudson said the lunch ended on a positive note.The Democratic National Committee pointed out that Mr. Hagee has never apologized for other remarks offending Muslims and gay men and lesbians.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','The debate over bottled water began two years ago, when three members pointed out the environmental costs of bottled water and argued that as a matter of principle, the organization ought to stop selling it. In the pages of the co-op’s newsletter, The Linewaiters’ Gazette, the debate raged.“I just feel that taking bottled water away from consumers is forcing an agenda on people,” Yachet Lebovits wrote in a letter. “Don’t demand totality in a world where it doesn’t exist.”To those who said the sale of bottled water was simply a matter of giving the members a choice, David Barouh, one of the sponsors of the proposal to ban it, said that missed the point. After all, he wrote, “Should the Co-op provide Twinkies or Ring Dings or, for that matter, cigarettes? Shouldn’t the members have those options, too?”Conspicuous earnestness, of which there is no shortage in Park Slope, can be exhausting, but the use of bottled water, when tap water is a reasonable alternative, commands serious consideration.On average, a resident of North America consumes about 80 liters, or 21 gallons, of bottled water per year, according to an exhibit now being presented at the Museum of Natural History. By the time shipping and manufacturing are toted up, about a quarter-bottle of oil is needed to produce each bottle of water. And a gallon of bottled water costs about 1,000 times as much as a gallon of tap, $10 as opposed to a penny.Still, the matter was not simply resolved. Was city water really better or just as safe? Isn’t fluoride in public water supplies really an offshoot of the Manhattan Project rather than an anti-tooth decay measure? What about the exercise value of lugging water, and what about lead pipes, and could a filter at home really do the job of purifying tap water?And what about that beef, which leaves the Finger Lakes every week looking very much like a cow but on its way to Brooklyn is transformed into scores of shrink-wrapped packages — how could that be O.K. while bottled water was being voted off the island?At a meeting on April 29, about 180 members voted overwhelmingly to end the bottled water sales, including distilled water, which some people use in their clothes irons. The ban did not, however, extend to soda or seltzer water.“You don’t turn on your faucet and get carbonated water,” Mr. Holtz explained.As for the bottled water being guzzled by the truckload at NewYork-Presbyterian’s Milstein building in Washington Heights, it turns out that no one has been allowed to use the tap water since 2005, when two patients died from Legionnaire’s disease. It came from a common bacterium that grows rapidly in industrial-sized water systems.Three years later, the hospital is still trying to get the bacteria in its water supply system down to a level that will not make people sick. “Until that is resolved, we will not be serving tap water,” a hospital spokesman, Bryan Dotson, said on Tuesday.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','They have created a growing network of aid groups, spending countless hours navigating a byzantine system that they feel unnecessarily keeps their allies in harm’s way. There is, they say, a debt that must be repaid to the Iraqis who helped the most. To them it is an obligation both moral and pragmatic.“It’s like this disjointed underground railroad that exists,” said Paul Rieckhoff, who served with the Army in Iraq as a first lieutenant in 2003 and 2004. Mr. Rieckhoff is now executive director of Iraq and Veterans of America, which has more than 85,000 members and a Web site at .Leaving an interpreter behind, Mr. Rieckhoff said, is “like leaving one of your soldiers back in Iraq and saying, ‘Good luck, son.’ ”The risk taken by interpreters in Iraq is considerable and widely documented. Those who work for the Americans are often accused of being apostates and traitors. Their homes are bombed. Death threats are wrapped around blood-soaked bullets and left outside their homes. Their relatives are abducted and killed because of their work. And of the interpreters themselves, hundreds have been killed.But many work in spite of the repercussions, and that dedication resonates clearly for many American soldiers and marines.While there is no detailed tracking of the total number of Iraqis who have worked as interpreters, their advocates estimate that more than 20,000 people have filled such roles since 2003. In the last quarter of 2007 alone, 5,490 Iraqis were employed by the multinational force as interpreters, according to the Department of Defense.Nearly 2,000 interpreters in Iraq and Afghanistan have applied to the State Department for a special immigrant visa, which was begun in 2006 as a last resort for those fearing for their lives. So far 1,735 cases have been approved, though it is unclear how many interpreters have come to the United States.In its first year the visa program for interpreters was limited to only 50 spots. Since then it has expanded to 500 spots a year.But the numbers tell only part of the difficulty. The program does little to minimize the visa bureaucracy. The process, complicated for anyone, is especially hard for interpreters.They are considered refugees, and refugees cannot apply from their native countries, in this case Iraq. But and have closed their borders to the flood of . Passports issued by the government of are not valid, often making it impossible to cross borders legally.Among service members who have served in Iraq, there is no dispute that the number of interpreters in danger is far greater than the number of those who have won visas. Many veterans are angry about the bureaucratic hurdles faced by the Iraqis who often came to work with a price on their heads. Many others have for years expressed frustration with the Bush administration for not doing more to help Iraqis who aid American forces, even as other advocates criticize the overall low numbers of Iraqis generally granted visas to the United States.Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman, said the government’s hands were initially tied by the lack of federal legislation allowing special visas for interpreters. Now that more visas have been made available, he said, President Bush has directed Secretary of State and the homeland security secretary, , to “make sure the visa process for translators and others moves as quickly as possible.”Lt. Col. Steven Miska, an Army infantry officer, has had more than 50 interpreters work for him during his years in Iraq. After looking into the visa process, he decided that “no Iraqi would ever figure that thing out,” and set his staff members to establish a network. They pair Iraqis with American veterans who help shepherd them out of Iraq, through Jordan and Syria and into the United States.“Not only is it the right thing to do from a moral perspective, it’s the way to win,” Colonel Miska said, stressing that the assistance will help reassure Iraqis that they can trust Americans despite the risk in helping them.Jason Faler, 30, a captain with the National Guard, was an intelligence liaison officer embedded in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. After returning from Iraq in 2006 and learning that the lives of two interpreters he had worked with were in danger, Mr. Faler got involved, paying their visa application fees.To broaden assistance to other interpreters, Mr. Faler established the Checkpoint One Foundation, based in Salem, Ore. The group, whose Web site is at , has helped two Iraqi families and one Afghan couple make it to the United States, spending most of the $25,000 it has raised. Even Mr. Faler’s parents have lent a hand, housing both Iraqi families for several weeks.The foundation has become a second job that at times takes him away from work and family, Mr. Faler said. But he is unwavering in his support of interpreters. “There is a sense of loyalty that is almost impossible for me to articulate,” he said.Will Bardenwerper, a 31-year-old graduate, was an Army captain responsible for reconstruction projects in Anbar Province from 2006 to 2007. His interpreter, whom he called Jeff, became a friend and adviser.Mr. Bardenwerper was so struck by the danger Jeff faced that he began the visa application process for him even before returning to the United States last year. Like others, Mr. Bardenwerper ran into a thicket of red tape. He was particularly frustrated by the requirement that interpreters produce a letter from a general on their behalf. This, he said, was like a junior associate at a Fortune 500 company asking the chief executive for a letter of recommendation.“Over the course of a year, I might have met two generals,” Mr. Bardenwerper said. “I mean, we were out in a wasteland in Anbar.”But after a year of follow-up, Mr. Bardenwerper and Jeff finally had a breakthrough. Jeff arrived in America in March and has gotten to visit with Mr. Bardenwerper and other service members who took up his cause.Although some veterans have succeeded in bringing their interpreters safely to the United States, the experience of Colonel Zacchea and Jack shows that a visa, while a substantial advantage, does not guarantee a happy ending to a war story.Colonel Zacchea, who served with the Marines, said he spotted Jack immediately. Jack studied diligently and absorbed the complexities of military translation quickly. An enduring friendship grew around the training regimen and the combat missions. When the sun set each day, they drank chai, or tea, and often talked for hours.In 2005, after the Colonel Zacchea left Iraq, Jack applied for a Fulbright scholarship. He had been a physics tutor before the war and wanted to teach high school students in the United States, but he did not qualify.Within a week of the Fulbright rejection, Colonel Zacchea heard about the start of the special visa program. He wrote a recommendation for Jack, who also had a petition filed on his behalf by his American supervisors. But Jack was not accepted.In March 2006, Colonel Zacchea learned that Arkan, another translator who had worked with them, was killed by insurgents. Two previous attempts on his life had failed, but not the third.Colonel Zacchea kept pushing, and he resubmitted Jack’s paperwork. He stayed in constant contact with Jack, hoping to make sure he did not share Arkan’s fate.After nearly two more years, Jack’s application made it through, and in September 2007 he landed at Liberty International Airport.But Jack struggled in the United States. The only safety net he had was the one Colonel Zacchea had created. Jack lived in the basement of his home and spent his days searching for work, but satisfaction was elusive. He worked at briefly, then in the maintenance department of a hotel.But because Jack was an Arabic speaker who had been vetted by the military and the , both men held out hope for more — for a career as an interpreter or teacher in the United States.When Jack finally got a job offer, in April, it was one he felt he could not refuse — even though it meant going back to Iraq. The military offered him a one-year contract, loaded with incentives, to return and work as an interpreter again.After one year, he could return to the foundations he and Colonel Zacchea had laid in — all with no change in his visa status.The decision was wrenching: roll the dice in Iraq one more time for a life-changing payout, or continue foundering here.Reluctantly, and against the advice of people close to him, Jack took the offer. On a rainy night in April they drove to a hotel at the airport in . Jack’s flight was early the next morning.Over dinner, Jack tried to explain why he could not stay. “If I had found a job here, a good job when I came, I would, probably,” Jack said, searching for the right words. “I would not go back.”Six hours later, Jack’s bags were checked and his ticket was in his hand. He and Colonel Zacchea exchanged a few words of farewell, hugged and then parted ways.'"
"'08-05-14,'1','But when a man from the decidedly friendly crowd asked Mr. Obama if he would take Mrs. Clinton as his running mate, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, said he was in no position to answer.“Senator Clinton is still competing — we haven’t resolved this nomination,” he said. “It would be presumptuous of me to pretend like I’ve already won and start talking about who my vice president’s going to be — I’ve still got some more work to do.”Sure enough, Mr. Obama, wearing a flag lapel pin for the second day in a row, walked out of the building to the announcement of Mrs. Clinton’s victory and headlines calling it a blowout.He did what he could to shrug off the results: He held no rally and gave no speech conceding his loss or vowing to fight on Tuesday night.At least publicly, Mr. Obama’s aides exuded a “What, me worry?” demeanor, saying they were confident that his near-nominee status could withstand a new spate of news reports after Tuesday’s results citing his weakness with some white voters or — less likely even in the charged atmosphere of cable news — highlighting new paths to a Clinton comeback.“It just doesn’t change the key underlying fundamentals of the race,” said Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama’s communications director.For good measure the campaign sent a memorandum to reporters playing down Mrs. Clinton’s expected victory and noting Mr. Obama’s delegate lead.“Would it be ideal to leave the field uncontested? Sure,” Mr. Gibbs said. But, he said, the campaign is now following a schedule that “allows us to continue to campaign but still begin to plant the flag in what will be competitive states in November.”In the next week, Mr. Obama is to campaign in states with coming Democratic contests, including South Dakota and Oregon — his wife, Michelle, goes to Puerto Rico on Wednesday — as well as the expected general-election battlegrounds of Michigan and Florida.Campaign aides say they would clearly rather be where they are now, as the “almost nominee,” than where they were a couple of weeks ago, when they were coming off a loss in Pennsylvania and were dogged by questions about the inflammatory statements of Mr. Obama’s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., and about Mr. Obama’s low bowling score.Mr. Obama has exhibited an easier manner and a renewed confidence this week than the man who a few weeks ago complained that reporters’ questions were keeping him from eating, happily joking with reporters that he was better at pool than at bowling, something he demonstrated in a West Virginia pool hall this week.His aides told local reporters he would return to Missouri again this month, but aides emphasized that they knew there were steps to go.“We are still keeping our eye on the primary ball,” said his traveling press secretary, Jen Psaki. “We have great respect for the process, and for Senator Clinton.”'"

"'08-05-15,'1','The threat from a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan has been greatly reduced but not eliminated. U.S. and NATO forces remain there to help finish the job, and continue operations against the remnants of al Qaeda. The Government of Pakistan has cooperated with the U.S. in successfully adapting the counterinsurgency tactics that worked so well in Iraq and Afghanistan to its lawless tribal areas where al Qaeda fighters are based. The increase in actionable intelligence that the counterinsurgency produced led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden, and his chief lieutenants. There is no longer any place in the world al Qaeda can consider a safe haven. Increased cooperation between the United States and its allies in the concerted use of military, diplomatic, and economic power and reforms in the intelligence capabilities of the United States has disrupted terrorist networks and exposed plots around the world. There still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since September 11, 2001.The United States and its allies have made great progress in advancing nuclear security. Concerted action by the great democracies of the world has persuaded a reluctant Russia and China to cooperate in pressuring Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions, and North Korea to discontinue its own. The single greatest threat facing the West -- the prospect of nuclear materials in the hands of terrorists -- has been vastly diminished.The size of the Army and Marine Corps has been significantly increased, and are now better equipped and trained to defend us. Long overdue reforms to the way we acquire weapons programs, including fixed price contracts, have created sufficient savings to pay for a larger military. A substantial increase in veterans educational benefits and improvements in their health care has aided recruitment and retention. The strain on the National Guard and reserve forces has been relieved.After efforts to pressure the Government in Sudan over Darfur failed again in the U.N. Security Council, the United States, acting in concert with a newly formed League of Democracies, applied stiff diplomatic and economic pressure that caused the government of Sudan to agree to a multinational peacekeeping force, with NATO countries providing logistical and air support, to stop the genocide that had made a mockery of the world's repeated declaration that we would ""never again"" tolerant such inhumanity. Encouraged by the success, the League is now occupied with using the economic power and prestige of its member states to end other gross abuses of human rights such as the despicable crime of human trafficking.The United States has experienced several years of robust economic growth, and Americans again have confidence in their economic future. A reduction in the corporate tax rate from the second highest in the world to one on par with our trading partners; the low rate on capital gains; allowing business to deduct in a single year investments in equipment and technology, while eliminating tax loopholes and ending corporate welfare, have spurred innovation and productivity, and encouraged companies to keep their operations and jobs in the United States. The Alternate Minimum Tax is being phased out, with relief provided first to middle income families. Doubling the size of the child exemption has put more disposable income in the hands of taxpayers, further stimulating growth.Congress has just passed by a single up or down vote a tax reform proposal that offers Americans a choice of continuing to file under the rules of the current complicated and burdensome tax code or use a new, simpler, fairer and flatter tax, with two rates and a generous deduction. Millions of taxpayers are expected to file under the flat tax, and save billions in the cost of preparing their returns.After exercising my veto several times in my first year in office, Congress has not sent me an appropriations bill containing earmarks for the last three years. A top to bottom review of every federal bureaucracy has yielded great reductions in government spending by identifying programs that serve no important purpose; and instigating far reaching reforms of procurement and operating policies that have for too long extravagantly wasted money for no better purpose than to increase federal payrolls.New free trade agreements have been ratified and led to substantial increases in both exports and imports. The resulting growth in prosperity in countries from South America to Asia to Africa has greatly strengthened America's security and the global progress of our political ideals. U.S. tariffs on agricultural imports have been eliminated and unneeded farm subsidies are being phased out. The world food crisis has ended, inflation is low, and the quality of life not only in our country, but in some of the most impoverished countries around the world is much improved.Americans, who through no fault of their own, lost jobs in the global economy they once believed were theirs for life, are assisted by reformed unemployment insurance and worker retraining programs. Older workers who accept lower paying jobs while they acquire new skills are provided assistance to make up a good part of the income they have lost. Community colleges and technical schools all over the country have developed worker retraining programs suited to the specific economic opportunities available in their communities and are helping millions of workers who have lost a job that won't come back find a new one that won't go away.Public education in the United States is much improved thanks to the competition provided by charter and private schools; the increase of quality teachers through incentives like merit pay and terrific programs that attract to the classroom enthusiastic and innovative teachers from many disciplines, like Teach for America and Troops to Teachers. Educational software and online teaching programs endorsed by qualified non profits are much more widely in use, bringing to the smallest classrooms in America some of the greatest math, English, and science teachers in the country. This revolution in teaching methods has especially benefited rural America. Test scores and graduation rates are rising everywhere in the country.Health care has become more accessible to more Americans than at any other time in history. Reforms of the insurance market; putting the choice of health care into the hands of American families rather than exclusively with the government or employers; walk in clinics as alternatives to emergency room care; paying for outcome in the treatment of disease rather than individual procedures; and competition in the prescription drug market have begun to wring out the runaway inflation once endemic in our health care system. More small businesses offer their employees health plans. Schools have greatly improved their emphasis on physical education and nutritional content of meals offered in school cafeterias. Obesity rates among the young and the disease they engender are stabilized and beginning to decline. The federal government and states have cooperated in establishing backstop insurance pools that provide coverage to people hard pressed to find insurance elsewhere because of pre-existing illness.The reduction in the growth of health care costs has begun to relieve some of the pressure on Medicare; encouraging Congress to act in a bipartisan way to extend its solvency for twenty-five years without increasing taxes and raising premiums only for upper income seniors. Their success encouraged a group of congressional leaders from both parties to work with my administration to fix Social Security as well, without reducing benefits to those near retirement. The reforms include some form of personal retirement accounts in safe and reliable index funds, such as have been available to government employees since their retirement plans were made solvent a quarter century ago.The United States is well on the way to independence from foreign sources of oil; progress that has not only begun to alleviate the environmental threat posed from climate change, but has greatly improved our security as well. A cap and trade system has been implemented, spurring great innovation in the development of green technologies and alternative energy sources. Clean coal technology has advanced considerably with federal assistance. Construction has begun on twenty new nuclear reactors thanks to improved incentives and a streamlined regulatory process.Scores of judges have been confirmed to the federal district and appellate courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, who understand that they were not sent there to write our laws but to enforce them and make sure they are consistent with the Constitution. They are judges of exceptional character and quality, who enforce and do not make laws, and who respect the values of the people whose rights, laws and property they are sworn to defend.Border state governors have certified and the American people recognize that after tremendous improvements to border security infrastructure and increases in the border patrol, and vigorous prosecution of companies that employ illegal aliens, our southern border is now secure. Illegal immigrants who broke our laws after they came here have been arrested and deported. Illegal immigration has been finally brought under control, and the American people accepted the practical necessity to institute a temporary worker program and deal humanely with the millions of immigrants who have been in this country illegally.Voluntary national service has grown in popularity in part because of the educational benefits used as incentives, as well as frequent appeals from the bully pulpit of the White House, but mostly because the young Americans, no less than earlier generations, understand that true happiness is much greater than the pursuit of pleasure, and can only be found by serving causes greater than self-interest. Scores of accomplished private sector leaders have joined the ranks of my administration for a dollar a year and have instituted some of the most innovative reforms of government programs ever known, often in partnership with willing private sector partners. A sense of community, a kinship of ideals, has invigorated public service again.This is the progress I want us to achieve during my presidency. These are the changes I am running for President to make. I want to leave office knowing that America is safer, freer, and wealthier than when I was elected; that more Americans have more opportunities to pursue their dreams than at any other time in our history; that the world has become less threatening to our interests and more hospitable to our values; and that America has again, as she always has, chosen not to hide from history but to make history.I am well aware I cannot make any of these changes alone. The powers of the presidency are rightly checked by the other branches of government, and I will not attempt to acquire powers our founders saw fit to grant Congress. I will exercise my veto if I believe legislation passed by Congress is not in the nation's best interests, but I will not subvert the purpose of legislation I have signed by making statements that indicate I will enforce only the parts of it I like. I will respect the responsibilities the Constitution and the American people have granted Congress, and will, as I often have in the past, work with anyone of either party to get things done for our country.For too long, now, Washington has been consumed by a hyper-partisanship that treats every serious challenge facing us as an opportunity to trade insults; disparage each other's motives; and fight about the next election. For all the problems we face, if you ask Americans what frustrates them most about Washington, they will tell you they don't think we're capable of serving the public interest before our personal and partisan ambitions; that we fight for ourselves and not for them. Americans are sick of it, and they have every right to be. They are sick of the politics of selfishness, stalemate and delay. They despair when every election -- no matter who wins -- always seems to produce four more years of unkept promises and a government that is just a battleground for the next election. Their patience is at an end for politicians who value ambition over principle, and for partisanship that is less a contest of ide as than an uncivil brawl over the spoils of power. They want to change not only the policies and institutions that have failed the American people, but the political culture that produced them. They want to move this country forward and stake our claim on this century as we did in the last. And they want their government to care more about them than preserving the privileges of the powerful.There are serious issues at stake in this election, and serious differences between the candidates. And we will argue about them, as we should. But it should remain an argument among friends; each of us struggling to hear our conscience, and heed its demands; each of us, despite our differences, united in our great cause, and respectful of the goodness in each other. That is how most Americans treat each other. And it is how they want the people they elect to office to treat each other.If I am elected President, I will work with anyone who sincerely wants to get this country moving again. I will listen to any idea that is offered in good faith and intended to help solve our problems, not make them worse. I will seek the counsel of members of Congress from both parties in forming government policy before I ask them to support it. I will ask Democrats to serve in my administration. My administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability. I will hold weekly press conferences. I will regularly brief the American people on the progress our policies have made and the setbacks we have encountered. When we make errors, I will confess them readily, and explain what we intend to do to correct them. I will ask Congress to grant me the privilege of coming before both houses to take questions, and address criticism, much the same as the Prime Minister of Great Britain appears regularly before the House of Commons.We cannot again leave our problems for another unluckier generation of Americans to fix after they have become even harder to solve. I'm not interested in partisanship that serves no other purpose than to gain a temporary advantage over our opponents. This mindless, paralyzing rancor must come to an end. We belong to different parties, not different countries. We are rivals for the same power. But we are also compatriots. We are fellow Americans, and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association. I intend to prove myself worthy of the office; of our country; and of your respect. I won't judge myself by how many elections I've won. I won't spend one hour of my presidency worrying more about my re-election than keeping my promises to the American people. There is a time to campaign, and a time to govern. If I'm elected President, the era of the permanent campaign will end. The era of problem solving will begin. I promise you, from the day I am sworn into office until the last hour of my presidency, I will work with anyone, of either party, to make this country safe, prosperous and proud. And I won't care who gets the credit.'"

"'08-05-15,'1','Harvey L. Schein, who led the Sony Corporation of America in the 1970s and doubled its size in spite of championing the failed Betamax video recording system and clashing with Sony’s top Japanese executives, died Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 80, and had homes in Manhattan; Washington, Conn.; and Sanibel, Fla.The cause was lymphoma, said his son Justin.It was in 1967 that Mr. Schein — a former protégé of William S. Paley at CBS who helped build CBS’s international record business — negotiated an agreement as president of CBS International for a new record company, CBS/Sony Records, with Akio Morita, the visionary co-founder of Sony, who at that time was its executive vice president. By 1971 Mr. Morita was president of Sony, and the next year, believing its American subsidiary needed American leadership, he turned to Mr. Schein, naming him president and chief executive.Among the first Americans to reach the upper echelons of a major Japanese company, Mr. Schein led Sony America from 1972 to 1978, and his tenure was both successful and stormy. In the middle of it in 1976, Sony brought to market the Betamax, its first portable videocassette recorder. The machine, and its recording-and-playing format, initiated a famous corporate battle that the company lost after a rival company, JVC, developed a different format, the Video Home System (or VHS), which became the industry standard.But Betamax also initiated a legal battle that essentially paved the way for the entire home video boom. In 1976, alarmed by what they saw as the parasitic nature of the home recording of television programs and fearing that people who recorded television shows to watch later would never tune in to reruns, MCA/Universal and Walt Disney Productions filed suit against Sony, charging copyright infringement and asking for an injunction against sales of the Betamax.The suit was highly public. Mr. Schein appeared on Walter Cronkite’s nightly newscast with Sidney Sheinberg, the president of MCA/Universal, who called him a “highwayman.” And even though the publicity did not ultimately save the Betamax, it did help build consumer enthusiasm for new possibilities in home entertainment.'"
"'08-05-15,'1','WASHINGTON — Cindy McCain, the wife of the Republican presumptive nominee for president, has sold off at least $2 million she held in funds with investments in Sudan businesses.The mutual funds — American Funds Europacific Growth and American Funds Capital World Growth and Income — have investments in companies with business in Sudan, according to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, an advocacy organization that has been working to persuade states, universities and other organizations to divest.“As soon as she was made aware, she sold it,” said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. “Senator and Mrs. McCain are committed to doing everything possible to end the genocide in Darfur.”Both funds were listed by her husband, Senator John McCain, on his financial disclosure forms. The investments and the divestiture were first reported by The Associated Press, and confirmed by the McCain campaign.Humanitarian groups and some politicians — including Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas — have criticized organizations, government entities and investors, including pension funds, for putting money into companies doing business in Sudan.Several Democratic and Republican candidates sold similar investments during the primary season.In Mr. McCain’s home state, Arizona, Gov. Janet Napolitano followed the lead of other states and governors by signing into law a measure in March that would “divest pension funds from those targeted corporations that materially assist the Sudanese government in carrying out the genocide in Darfur.”'"
"'08-05-15,'1','WASHINGTON — A Secret Service supervisor who until recently was a leader of Senator Barack Obama’s security detail sent several colleagues an e-mail message in 2005 that included a crude sexual joke about blacks and American Indians, according to documents disclosed last week as part of a lawsuit by black Secret Service agents.The supervisory agent, Victor Erevia, sent the Jan. 26, 2005, e-mail message to five other Secret Service supervisors with what he described as a “joke,” one that referred to “popular myths of sexuality” and ridiculed several racial and religious groups. It appears that Mr. Erevia was not the author of the joke, but shared the message after it had been sent to him.Eric Zahren, a Secret Service spokesman, said on Wednesday that while the agency did not condone offensive material, the e-mail message was “apparently an attempt at humor” and should be viewed in that context.At the time of the message, Mr. Erevia was an assistant agent in charge of the agency’s office in Atlanta. Later, he was assigned as one of three “detail leaders” to protect Mr. Obama during his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Erevia has since been promoted to head the agency’s technical security division.Douglas DeLeaver, president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, said the e-mail message was unfortunate, but not aimed at individuals. “Were they insensitive? Yes,” Mr. DeLeaver said. “But should you ruin someone’s career for something that happened five years ago. I don’t think so.”'"
"'08-05-15,'1','The city’s parks department said that it had installed 77 turf fields since 1997 and that it planned on putting in 23 more.Betsy Gotbaum, the city’s public advocate, and organizations including New Yorkers for Parks, Riverkeeper, the Natural Resources Defense Council and New York Lawyers for the Public Interest said Wednesday that after reading the report they had decided to continue to call for a moratorium on installing new turf fields.In a statement, the health department said it was “conducting a review of scientific studies to better understand the potential health effects for people who use artificial turf fields.”“The department is still reviewing comments from staff and colleagues in the scientific community and expects the report to be released by the end of the month,” the statement said.Stuart Gaffin, an associate research scientist at the Center for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University, who has read the draft report and whose research has focused on the heat that synthetic turf fields generate, said the analysis was less than authoritative.“It seems that it was a good college-student level Internet database report,” Dr. Gaffin said. “It is not definitive and should not be the final answer on this.”TRC Companies referred questions to the health department on Wednesday.The draft report was obtained by The New York Times from an advocacy group, NYC Park Advocates.At the heart of the dispute is whether synthetic turf, particularly crumb rubber fields made from recycled tires, places athletes at risk because of the presence of lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have caused cancer and organ damage in animals and may be a cancer risk to people if they are exposed over a long period.Researchers, however, have not determined conclusively how easily the hydrocarbons — which are also found in toys and other materials — can be absorbed by the human body.Critics of the fields also say turf creates “heat islands” that can climb as high as 170 degrees because the synthetic surface absorbs sunlight and emits heat. There are also concerns that the fields may exacerbate the risk of serious sports-related injuries.Legislation banning new turf fields has been introduced in the State Legislature, and earlier this week the California State Senate approved a bill ordering a health and environmental study of the fields.The New York City study — or more precisely, a “literature review” — titled “A Review of the Potential Health and Safety Risks From Synthetic Turf Fields,” was ordered last year by the health department after it received a $100,000 grant from the New York Community Trust.The 180-page report stops short of making sweeping statements about the health risks of turf. Instead, it found that available data either did not support claims about many of the health and safety hazards attributed to artificial turf or that existing research was inconclusive.For instance, while discussing one of the most hotly debated claims — that crumb rubber might be harmful, especially to children — the report states, “In this review, a health risk was not identified as a result of ingestion, dermal or inhalation exposure to crumb rubber.”At another point, the report says, “There is little information regarding the outdoor air concentrations of chemicals of potential concern at synthetic turf fields.”The report, however, identifies several potentially harmful chemicals found in turf fields, including arsenic, lead and chrysene.“Aromatic hydrocarbons, including toluene and xylene isomers, were among the chemicals detected at the highest concentrations,” the report stated.Toluene is listed on the Web site for the United States Department of Health and Human Services’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. The Web site says that “breathing very high levels of toluene during pregnancy can result in children with birth defects and retard mental abilities, and growth.”'"
"'08-05-15,'1','The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.78, or 0.11 percent, to 736.07.Light crude oil fell $1.58, to settle at $124.22 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Major indexes are approaching their highs of the month, but one sector of stocks — financials — is still being left behind.Steve Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company, said he remained troubled about the financial industry’s underperformance. While the financial sector has been pulled higher by the market’s recent overall rise, he said, it is not out front as would be needed to lead a bona fide rally.“They tend to outperform the S.& P. by a 50 percent margin, but we’re not seeing that at all,” he said of financial companies.Concerns that major investment banks and retail banks will have more write-downs in coming quarters has put pressure on their stock prices. Lehman Brothers is down about 8.5 percent from its highs this month, while the S.& P. is down by only 1 percent.“They led us into the crisis, but they’re not yet leading us out of it,” Mr. Goldman said. “That’s what needs to happen.”Leadership on Wednesday went to technology stocks; the Nasdaq, which is heavy on technology stocks, at one point was up 1.3 percent. Investors collected profits during the last hour of trading, however, and sent big tech names sharply lower. Apple stock fell $3.70, or 2 percent, to $182.26, after trading as high as $192.24 during the session.In corporate news, Macy’s reported it lost $59 million in the first quarter because of weaker sales and costs tied to combining businesses. But the results surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, and the stock rose 87 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $24.93.Deere said its fiscal second-quarter profit rose 22 percent as higher crop prices drove global demand for farm equipment.

"'08-05-15,'1','CLIFTON, N.J. — When her fellow golf professionals heard that Annika Sorenstam would retire after this season, there was sadness over losing the L.P.G.A. Tour’s dominant player over the last decade. There was also agreement that the mantle would pass to Lorena Ochoa, a 26-year-old from Mexico who had become Sorenstam’s main rival.Ochoa did not turn away. In a news conference Wednesday at the Upper Montclair Country Club, where she and Sorenstam are among the 144 professionals who will play in the $2 million Sybase Classic starting Thursday, Ochoa accepted the challenge of being the next Annika.“That’s why I’m here,” Ochoa said. “I started to play a long time ago, and my goal was to be the best and dominate the game. I’ve tried to learn from her. It’s sad that we will be losing a big name. She is the best player. She’s been up there so long. The Annika era, to me, was an honor. I admire her career very much.”Ochoa’s career has evoked admiration, too. After she brought her drive under control, she won six tour events in 2006 and eight in 2007. This year, she has won 5 of 11 tournaments. Sorenstam has won three. Ochoa has won this tournament the last two years.Natalie Gulbis seemed especially affected by Sorenstam’s retirement.“Annika is my closest friend on tour, so I’m obviously very excited and very sad for her decision,” Gulbis said. “I think it’s going to be very emotional for her.”'"
"'08-05-15,'1','More than 1.5 million people live in nursing homes. Nationwide, about one-fifth of the homes were cited for serious deficiencies last year.“Poor quality of care — worsening pressure sores or untreated weight loss — in a small but unacceptably high number of nursing homes continues to harm residents or place them in immediate jeopardy, that is, at risk of death or serious injury,” the report said.Nursing homes must meet federal standards as a condition of participating in Medicaid and Medicare, which cover more than two-thirds of their residents, at a cost of more than $75 billion a year.The study was done at the request of Senators Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, who is chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging.Mr. Grassley and Mr. Kohl have introduced a bill to upgrade nursing home care and increase the penalties for violations of federal standards. The maximum fine, now generally $10,000, would be increased to $25,000 for a serious deficiency and $100,000 for one that resulted in a patient’s death.The senators are pushing to have their bill included in a package of Medicare changes that Congress is expected to pass next month.But the American Health Care Association, a trade group for nursing homes, opposes the Grassley-Kohl bill in its current form.Bruce A. Yarwood, president of the association, said: “We should not be increasing fines, adding auditors and encouraging a ‘gotcha’ mentality. We should be testing new, less punitive ways to measure and improve the quality of care.”Influential consumer groups support the bill. David P. Sloane, senior vice president of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said it was “one of the most significant nursing home reform initiatives” in two decades.Under the bill, nursing homes would have to provide consumers and the government with more information about their owners and “affiliated or related parties,” including any individual or company that had a role in managing their operations.Lewis Morris, chief counsel to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, said he had often been frustrated in trying to identify the owners of nursing homes that provided substandard care.“We have found nursing home residents who were grossly dehydrated or malnourished,” Mr. Morris said. “We’ve found patients with maggot infestations in wounds and dead flesh. We’ve found residents with broken bones that went unmended.”After discovering such problems, the federal government has required some companies to sign compliance agreements, monitored by outside experts. “Our experience shows that such compliance programs do improve the quality of care,” Mr. Morris said.The Bush administration said it agreed with the findings of the accountability office and would supervise state inspectors more closely.“We fully endorse and will implement all the G.A.O. recommendations,” Vincent J. Ventimiglia Jr., an assistant secretary of health and human services, said in written comments on the report.'"

"'08-05-15,'1','If you are between the ages of 13 and 87, the last time you met anyone who described herself as a loyal viewer of daytime soap operas you were probably still hoarding quarters for pay phones and maintaining a casual position on sunscreen. Soaps have been shedding audiences for years now. The young, especially, have found their absurdities elsewhere; there is almost nothing put forth by the writers of “All My Children” that could, in a stupidity contest, outrank a single moment of “The Hills.”“All My Children” might as well be “Mad Money,” as it happens. On Friday, in an effort to fatten its ratings, the ABC serial featured a guest appearance by Warren Buffett, who visited Susan Lucci’s Erica Kane in prison and advised her to take up bridge. Erica has been serving a sentence on a charge of insider trading.A cameo by Mr. Buffett, the 77-year-old chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is probably not the obvious path to a younger audience and advertisers for products that have nothing to do with incontinence. Over the past seven months all but one daytime soap has lost viewers between 18 and 34. That one is the historically stodgy CBS drama “As the World Turns,” which has been chronicling the ecstasies and miseries of life in the fictitious town of Oakdale, Ill., for 52 years.Since its introduction of a gay-theme story line last summer “As the World Turns” has actually gained viewers, specifically younger viewers, some of whom turned to the show, unpredictably enough, after following the romance of the college-age characters Luke (Van Hansis) and Noah (Jake Silbermann) via YouTube clips posted by fans — new media reviving fossil media.Nearly every moment of Luke and Noah’s interaction has been featured on YouTube, most notably their initial kiss, the first gay kiss in daytime soaps, captured in a video that has received more than a million hits. The relationship garnered further attention as the subject of protest by the conservative American Family Association, which is opposed to the “promotion of the gay lifestyle,” and by fans who have written Procter & Gamble (which owns “As the World Turns”) demanding that Luke and Noah kiss more, kiss all the time, kiss the way the show’s heterosexual couples do. Last month, after a 211-day period that fans described as a drought, Luke and Noah (“Nuke” in the entertainment press) kissed for the third, momentous time.In almost every way, however, Luke and Noah have been treated as preposterously as any couple on daytime television, with all the requisite obstacles keeping them from happiness. First Luke pined in vain, thinking Noah was straight. Noah thought he was too and began to date Maddie, a girl he met at work, who also watched a lot of old movies and was probably the only other person in Oakdale to know that Preston Sturges isn’t the name of a dry-goods store. Noah kept trying and trying to convince himself that he was straight, asking Maddie to stay in town in a stealth maneuver to keep his true libido in check. She had plans to go off to Wesleyan University — because it’s been “a dream of mine since I knew what college was” — but Noah begged her to enroll at Oakdale U., no matter what its U.S. News & World Report ranking.'"
"'08-05-15,'1','Riverhouse, a 264-unit condominium in Battery Park City being marketed as the latest in environmental sustainability, has amenities like photovoltaic cells that generate solar power and an ultraviolet light that kills bacteria in the pool, reducing the need for chlorine. It also has a 2,000-square-foot model apartment with an unusually ornate take on green design. Thom Filicia, the designer, who stars in “Dress My Nest,” a show about fashion-inspired interiors, maintains that “the green look doesn’t have to be a green minimalist look.” The space he created for a fictional pair of empty-nesters relocating from the Upper East Side is filled with tribal art objects and patterned textiles — all antiques, recycled materials or sustainable materials, he said. The bedroom has a bamboo mattress, a throw pillow filled with kapok and a bamboo knitted throw that he said feels like cashmere. “When people hear the word kapok or the word bamboo, they don’t think of a luxurious feel, but the way things are woven and spun now, bamboo can go from the floor to the bed,” he said.'"
"'08-05-15,'1','“The message that we’re getting from core inflation has been rather friendly from the Fed perspective, in terms of giving them greater latitude to respond to mishaps without fueling fears on the inflation side,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. “The data should undercut thoughts that the Fed will tighten again.”Wall Street took stock in that reading, sending markets higher.But most American households do not have the luxury of excluding gasoline and food from their budgets. The details of the report offered clear signs that much of the country is grappling with rising prices, just as the job market is shrinking and many companies are cutting working hours, eroding the purchasing power of American paychecks.Food prices rose at a 0.9 percent annual rate in April — the largest jump since 1990 — and 5.1 percent compared with the same month a year ago.“This is a fine inflation report if you don’t need to eat, drive or depend on your paycheck,” said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute in Washington and author of the recently released book, “Crunch: Why Do I Feel So Squeezed?” (Berrett-Koehler).Housing costs, which make up 40 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose by 0.3 percent. Clothing prices rose by 0.5 percent, and medical care by 0.2 percent.Transportation costs dipped by 0.7 percent in April, and recreation costs dropped by 0.1 percent.A primary factor holding down the inflation rate was a surprising dip in gasoline prices — at least in the way the government tracks the data. The Labor Department calculated that gasoline prices actually increased 5.6 percent in April, but when seasonal fluctuations for demand were factored in, that increase was penciled in as a 0.2 percent dip.“I wonder if they can read the minds of very skeptical American motorists who are not fooled by this statistical sleight of hand!” said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in a note to clients. He said the report would give the Fed’s policy makers “some apparent (but not necessarily real) breathing room as they monitor the economy for signs of inflation.”Several economists said they expected record oil prices, filtering through the economy, to apply upward pressure to the inflation rate in future months.But the most important takeaway from the numbers was the overall picture, many analysts asserted: as the economy slows, eliminating jobs and diminishing corporate profits, it is at least providing some built-in relief by cooling the pace of higher prices.“With virtually every major developed and emerging economy now in the process of slowing, odds are inflation pressures will continue to abate in the second half of the year,” said Bernard Baumohl, managing director of the Economic Outlook Group, in a note to clients.This could help compensate for the diminished purchasing power of many American households as the economy slows.'"

"'08-05-16,'0','Christian Petzold’s enigmatic thriller “Yella” offers a surreal X-ray vision of cutthroat capitalism in 21st-century Germany. Yella Fichte (Nina Hoss), a sleek young businesswoman on the make, is an ardent student of that world. One of the first lessons she is taught is how to strike the “broker pose.” The technique, which her instructor says he learned from a John Grisham movie, requires that at the opportune moment during a business negotiation she lean over and whisper something in his ear.That instruction begins not long after Yella relocates from her hometown, Wittenberge in the former East Germany, to Hanover in the former West Germany. It is a move, the film suggests, from a comfortable semi-rural existence with roots to an ominous exurban no man’s land of glassed-in conference rooms, rental cars and anonymous business hotels. Here Yella embraces her talent as a deceitful wheeler-dealer in meetings that have the tension of high-stakes poker games.As the film begins, Yella travels back to Wittenberge from Hanover, where she has landed a job as an accountant. Immediately, she is accosted by her desperate ex-husband and former business partner, Ben (Hinnerk Schönemann), who pleads with her not to abandon him now that he is bankrupt. The morning of her return trip, he offers her a lift in his S.U.V. and drives off a bridge into the Elbe River.After a long, agonizing moment in which the only sounds are the wind in the trees and the ominous cawing of crows, Yella pulls herself to shore. Ben follows seconds later and collapses. She staggers to her feet and dashes to the station in time to catch the train.The implications of the crash resound through the rest of the film, as Yella tries to forget the past and adjust to a faster, colder world in which her guide and eventual lover, Philipp (Devid Striesow), tutors her in corporate mind games. As the process erodes her humanity, she has frightening flashbacks to the crash in which she once again hears the water guzzling, the wind blowing and the crows crying.'"
"'08-05-16,'0','During his primary battle, Mr. McCain accused his rival Mitt Romney of setting a timetable for withdrawing troops from Iraq, even though Mr. Romney was merely speaking generally about timetables that might be set in private discussions among Iraqi and American leaders. Since then, Mr. McCain himself has come under repeated fire from the Democrats for his support of the war and for offhand comments that he could envision a United States peacekeeping presence in Iraq for 100 years.Despite his mention of a specific year for the end of American combat operations, Mr. McCain and his aides strenuously argued afterward that his remarks should not be interpreted as promoting a timetable for withdrawal, even implicitly, and that he was simply projecting victory. “I am certainly not putting a date on it,” Mr. McCain said with exasperation during a circular, semantic debate in the back of his campaign bus.Mr. McCain took issue when a reporter said the candidate had asked everyone to go along on a “magic carpet ride” to 2013. “I don’t think it has anything to do with fantasy,” Mr. McCain said pointedly. “I think it has everything to do with setting goals and achieving.”In Afghanistan by 2013, Mr. McCain predicted in his speech, intelligence will have led to the capture or death of Osama bin Laden. In addition, Mr. McCain forecast, the threat from the Taliban will have been “greatly reduced”; there will be no place in the world that Al Qaeda can consider a safe haven; and “there still has not been a major terrorist attack in the United States since Sept. 11, 2001.”Mr. McCain also projected that “concerted action” by the world’s democracies would have persuaded Russia and China to cooperate in persuading Iran to abandon its nuclear ambitions and North Korea to discontinue its own.The speech was written over the last several weeks by Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s closest adviser. If Mr. Salter employed the futuristic device as a way to avoid “Fact Check” rapid response e-mail from the Democrats — there were no real checkable facts in Mr. McCain’s divination — it did not stop opponents from issuing swift dismissals of his remarks.“While Senator Obama agrees with many of the sentiments Senator McCain expressed today, he believes you cannot embrace the destructive policies and divisive political tactics of George Bush and still offer yourself as a candidate of healing and change,” said a statement from Senator Barack Obama’s campaign.Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement that “this is not the first time Senator McCain has predicted victory in Iraq” and that he had “promised more of the same Bush policies that have weakened our military, our national security and our standing in the world.”Mr. Obama has called for a monthly withdrawal of one or two American brigades from Iraq to finish within 16 months, while Mrs. Clinton has called for troop removals beginning within 60 days of her taking office, with most troops out by the end of 2013.In his speech on Thursday, Mr. McCain, who has been critical of President Bush’s environmental policies this week, implicitly criticized him on three other issues: Refusing to admit mistakes, running a permanent political campaign from the White House and attaching comments to legislation called signing statements that claim the president’s constitutional right to ignore or bypass parts of bills passed by Congress.“When we make errors, I will confess them readily, and explain what we intend to do to correct them,” Mr. McCain said.He also said: “I won’t spend one hour of my presidency worrying more about my re-election than keeping my promises to the American people. There is a time to campaign, and a time to govern. If I’m elected president, the era of the permanent campaign will end.”Discussing the signing statements, Mr. McCain said, “I will not subvert the purpose of legislation I have signed by making statements that indicate I will enforce only the parts of it I like.”Mr. Bush has asserted his right to bypass more than 1,000 sections of bills he has signed into law, including an amendment sponsored in 2005 by Mr. McCain to ban cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of American prisoners in custody.On domestic policy, Mr. McCain projected that in the fifth year of a McCain presidency the United States would have experienced several years of “robust economic growth,” a reduction in the corporate tax rate, the beginning of a phase-out of the alternative minimum tax, and “much improved” public education.In addition, Mr. McCain said, health care will have become “more accessible to more Americans than at any other time in history” because the federal government and states will have cooperated in establishing insurance pools to provide coverage for the sickest who cannot get insurance elsewhere. Meanwhile, he said, a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders will have worked with his administration to “fix Social Security.”There will be mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, Mr. McCain added, and construction will have begun on 20 new nuclear reactors. There will also have been “scores” of new judges appointed to the federal courts who understand, Mr. McCain said, “that they were not sent there to write our laws but to enforce them.”In addition, he said, “our southern border is now secure, illegal immigrants who broke our laws after they came here have been arrested and deported,” but there is a program for temporary foreign workers in place.Mr. McCain pledged to appoint Democrats to his administration, hold weekly news conferences and take questions in Congress, much as the Britain’s prime minister does in Parliament.'"
"'08-05-16,'0','The lawsuit is guaranteed to raise eyebrows in the close-knit swimming world. Lawrence Hilton, TYR’s lawyer, said that Steve Furniss, a company co-founder, reluctantly decided to file suit only after attempts at an amicable resolution failed. When reached by telephone Thursday, Furniss, a two-time Olympian who won a bronze medal and set a world record in the 1970s while wearing Speedo suits, declined to comment.TYR estimated that the loss to its brand value over time could reach $500,000, roughly equal to the sale of 1,000 of the high-tech suits. Money is not the driving motivation for pursuing the lawsuit, according to Hilton.“TYR felt like it needed to take action because of what’s going on in the swimming community,” he said.The company, he said, is especially troubled by Schubert’s advocacy of the LZR Racer. Hilton suggested the issue was not unlike the head of the Federal Aviation Administration advising the public to fly one domestic airline over another.“This is about TYR, but it’s bigger than TYR,” Hilton said. “The issue of whose product is better should be resolved by an independent and neutral party — the athletes in the pool.”In a telephone interview Thursday, Schubert scoffed at the notion that his word would be treated as the final verdict by American swimmers.“I should have that power,” he said, adding that he called Furniss earlier in the week and suggested that they meet for lunch in Los Angeles later this month. According to Schubert, Furniss said, “I’d really like to do that, but it’s too late because we’re filing a lawsuit today.”Vendt was included in the lawsuit for allegedly breaching his contract because he wore a Speedo suit at a meet in Southern California earlier this year. The swimsuit wars are dragging in other swimmers. At a Longhorn Aquatics practice in Texas earlier this month, the United States national team members Aaron Peirsol and Brendan Hansen were seen trying on Speedo suits even though they are under contract with Nike.And at Stanford this week, a member of the men’s team said that he would like to wear a LZR Racer at the Olympic trials but had been told by a Speedo representative that swimmers who do not have endorsement deals with the company must procure the suits through their coaches, which would surely put Stanford Coach Skip Kenney in a bind, since Stanford is sponsored by Nike.Ben Wildman-Tobriner, who trains at Stanford but has access to Speedo suits because he is a national team member, won the 50-meter freestyle at the world championships in Melbourne, Australia, last year wearing a suit that covered his body from the waist down. He has avoided full-body suits because, he said, he does not feel comfortable in them.Yet he is resigned to wearing a LZR Racer at the trials next month in Omaha. Why? “Because apparently,” he said, “if you wear the body suit, you’re going to break a world record.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation’s industrial output plunged in April, reflecting big cutbacks in automaking and other manufacturing industries.The Federal Reserve reported on Thursday that industrial production dropped 0.7 percent last month, more than double the decline that economists had expected.Manufacturing output fell by 0.8 percent. Half of that weakness came from large cutbacks in auto production because of falling demand for new cars and problems related to a strike at a parts supplier for General Motors.The drop in overall production matched a 0.7 percent decline in February and followed a weak 0.2 percent increase in March. It pushed the industrial operating rate to its lowest point in more than two years. Factories, mines and utilities operated at 79.7 percent of capacity last month. It was the first time the operating rate had been below 80 percent since October 2005, when it stood at 79.8 percent because of disruptions from the Gulf Coast hurricanes.Output in the mining sector declined by 0.8 percent last month, while output at utilities edged up by 0.3 percent.'"
"'08-05-16,'0','The stock market notched a second consecutive daily advance Thursday as oil prices fell slightly and some economic data came in better than expected.Wall Street has been worried about consumers paring back their spending, so it was pleased that the energy markets gave up early gains that briefly drove crude oil above $125 a barrel. Oil settled at $124.12 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchanged, a decline of 10 cents.The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that regional manufacturing activity was contracting in May, but at a much slower pace than in April, while major companies including General Electric and CBS were making deals.“The encouraging news is that the markets have become more functional, and large companies are able to make strategic purchases and sales, which previously was a very difficult thing to do,” said Alan M. Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management.But, Mr. Gayle said, “what we’re left with now are cyclical credit strains, and those are likely to linger for a while.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','Six million people in Afghanistan, out of a population of about 32 million, are already receiving food aid, and the World Food Program is gearing up to help more.It has agreed with the government to reopen an assistance plan through bakeries for the urban poor, a program that it ran during the years of the Taliban government but discontinued after the American-led invasion in late 2001. The government is also asking for help in providing food aid to 172,000 teachers countrywide, some of whom are not coming to work because they cannot make ends meet. That alone is an indication that things are getting harder, he said.“Every school we went to, in every classroom, the teachers were saying we need more salary or food,” Mr. Banbury said.“The people are dying of hunger,” said a beggar, Sardar Muhammad, 80, squatting in a Kandahar flour shop. His two sons worked as day laborers in the market and they did not earn enough to feed the family, he said.Flour and bread prices suddenly doubled in the space of two weeks in May, after neighboring Pakistan blocked wheat and flour exports. The traders said they smuggled in the flour via mountain roads. Government distribution of flour in Kandahar city and outlying districts has since eased fears slightly and the price of flour has dropped a bit.Yet with inflation at 22 percent prices remain too high for many.Hajji Hayatullah described how one customer came to his shop and asked the shopkeeper to load a sack of flour onto his bicycle. “Then he said: ‘Don’t ask me to pay. All my life I did not take bribes, I did not take anything from anyone, and now I am forced to take it without paying. My children have not eaten,’ ” the shopkeeper recalled the man saying.“He said, ‘I will return it if God gives me money,’ ” he continued.The episode was unusual because the man was a respectable, educated person and it is deeply shameful in Afghan culture to take something like that, the shopkeeper said. “I realized he had a real problem,” he said.“Things like this will get worse and worse, because what do you do if you have no money and have a wife and children?” he said.The Afghan government was among the first to see the looming food crisis, and in January appealed for help from the World Food Program, which raised $75 million for six months of supplementary assistance, Mr. Banbury said. The government is spending $50 million on general distribution of flour. Planning is under way to increase World Food Program assistance for the next six months.World Food Program officials said food aid was not a long-term answer to Afghanistan’s hunger.Despite the billions spent in Afghanistan over the last six years, international donors have failed to invest substantially in agriculture, the sector on which the majority of the population survives, Mr. Banbury said.He called for a large-scale, countrywide program to distribute improved seeds and tools to farmers to help increase food production. “Farmers are the most rational people in the world,” he said. “If you give them the seeds, they’ll do it.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','The XO laptop weighs 3.2 pounds and comes with a video camera, microphone, game-pad controller and a screen that rotates into a tablet configuration. About 600,000 have been ordered since last fall, with Peru, Uruguay and Mexico making the largest commitments. The alliance between Microsoft and O.L.P.C. comes after long stretches of antagonism, punctuated by occasional talks, between them.Mr. Negroponte, a former computer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a new-media pioneer, said he first talked to Bill Gates, Microsoft’s chairman, three years ago.But at the time, Microsoft was fiercely opposed to anything that might promote the use of open-source software like Linux. Since then, Microsoft has become more comfortable in competing against Linux, at times running its products on the same machines in data centers, desktops and laptops, Mr. Negroponte noted.Back then, he added, the nonprofit laptop project did not have a working machine.Last year, Mr. Negroponte said, he contacted Mr. Gates again, and this time the Microsoft chairman was receptive. He instructed Craig Mundie, Microsoft’s chief research and strategy officer, to work out a deal with Mr. Negroponte. Those talks began in January in private meetings, when both men were attending the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.“Customers have come to us and said they really like the XO laptop and they would like to see Windows on it,” said James Utzschneider, manager of Microsoft’s developing markets unit.The first of the project’s child-friendly XO laptops running Windows XP will be tested next month in limited trials in four or five countries. Mr. Utzschneider declined to identify the countries, but he said XO laptops running Windows would be generally available by September.The pact with Microsoft is not an exclusive agreement. The Linux version will still be available, and the group will encourage outside software developers to create a version of the project’s educational software, called Sugar, that will run on Windows.Windows will add a bit to the price of the machines, about $3, the licensing fee Microsoft charges to some developing nations under a program called Unlimited Potential. For those nations that want models that can run both Windows and Linux, the extra hardware required will add another $7 or so to the cost of the machines, Mr. Negroponte said.The laptops now cost about $200 each, and the project’s goal is to eventually bring the price down to about $100.O.L.P.C. led the way in designing inexpensive laptops for children in poorer nations, but others have followed, notably Intel with its Classmate PC, which runs Windows and is $400 or less.The project’s agreement with Microsoft involves no payment by the software giant, and Microsoft will not join One Laptop Per Child’s board. That contrasts with the approach of Intel, which joined the project last July, took a board seat and pledged an $18 million contribution — only to quit in January amid squabbling over Intel’s aggressive sales tactics with the Classmate PC.Of the Microsoft arrangement, Mr. Negroponte said: “We’ve stayed very pure.”But the alliance with Microsoft has created some turmoil within the project. Walter Bender, the president who oversaw software development, resigned last month. His departure, Mr. Negroponte said, was “a huge loss to O.L.P.C.”Inside the project, there have been people who, Mr. Negroponte said, came to regard the use of open-source software as one of the project’s ends instead of its means.“I think some people, including Walter, became much too fundamental about open source,” Mr. Negroponte said.In an e-mail message, Mr. Bender wrote that he left the project because he decided his efforts to develop and support the Sugar open-source learning software “would have more impact from outside of O.L.P.C. than from within.”Outside the constraints of working on a single hardware platform, like the XO laptop, his work, he wrote, should “lead to a broader base, more options, and a better set of tools for children.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','“Gas Prices Send Surge of Riders to Mass Transit” (front page, May 10) is only a portent of what is to come.Given the ceiling on daily global oil production, the rise of demand in countries such as China and India and the lack of careful planning in the United States to deal with oil shortages, prices are bound to keep increasing. We could be paying $5 to $6 per gallon by midsummer.We need to change our view of transportation and start changing our behavior now. We need to mandate new and higher fuel economy standards now; we need to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles now; we need to plan our trips better now.But above all, we need to start investing now in new and less polluting energy sources for transportation that do not rely on oil. By this fall we will look back at $4-per-gallon gasoline with nostalgia, wishing for the good old days that price reflected.The writer is an associate with the Futures Strategy Group.As a transit expert, I find it painful to watch local and state agencies cut back mass transit service just when demand is surging because of skyrocketing gas prices.'"

"'08-05-16,'0','Rights organizations have accused the Russian government of persecuting the Sakharov Museum in Moscow by charging its director, Yuri Samodurov, above, with inciting “religious hatred” and “offending human dignity” when he mounted a 2007 exhibition, “Forbidden Art,” which outraged some members of the Orthodox Church, Agence France-Presse reported. “The Russian authorities are irritated at the social and political activity of the Sakharov Museum,” said Lev Ponomarev, executive director of the group For Human Rights. “This accusation against Yuri Samodurov is connected with the constituent assembly of a new democratic movement which could be held in the Sakharov Museum.” Ludmilka Alexeyeva, who leads the Moscow Helsinki Group rights movement, accused the state of “persecution of the museum.” The exhibition at the heart of the dispute comprised works deemed by other museum directors to be too shocking for display during the previous year.

"'08-05-16,'0','A wildlife conservationist? A union supporter? It’s sometimes hard to believe that Theodore Roosevelt was a Republican. But he was never one to reflexively conform to party ideology, as Michael O. Smith demonstrates in his informative one-man show, “The Bully Pulpit,” which he also wrote.Set almost a decade after Roosevelt left office, in 1918, at Sagamore Hill, his estate in Oyster Bay, N.Y., the play gives us a Roosevelt who, entertaining visitors in his study, reminisces about his upbringing, his adventures in the American West and with the Rough Riders in Cuba, and his political achievements.Mr. Smith bears an astonishing resemblance to his subject and has an unforced ease. (He has toured widely with the production since its debut in Florida in 2004.) He certainly conveys Roosevelt’s gregariousness and prodigious energy, his speech punctuated with “Bully!” and “By Godfrey!,” followed by a brisk hand clap. (That energy also infuses the play’s pacing; its two-hour running time sails by.) Helping inestimably to evoke the era are Charles Corcoran’s effective period set and Tom Shread’s sound design, which subtly adds echo to Roosevelt’s voice as he orates from a small balcony.Of course, Roosevelt’s conservative side is evident: in his disdain for President “Puddin’-Head Wooden-Head” Wilson; his passionate militarism (Mr. Smith has him quoting John Hay’s description of the Spanish-American War as “a splendid little war”); his unilateralism (“I stole Panama and let Congress debate”); and his cowboylike exuberance, fortified in his years as a rancher in the Dakota Territory.“The Bully Pulpit” also explains how Roosevelt proved such a dissident that he switched allegiances, joining the Progressive Party, known as the Bull Moose Party (after his proclamation “I’m fit as a bull moose”), in his failed bid to unseat his presidential successor, William Howard Taft.The play tries to soften his image by ignoring some of his more specious notions about race and civilization, and by underscoring his despair at the death of his son Quentin in World War I. But it’s not necessary. “The Bully Pulpit” is most winning when it reminds us of Roosevelt’s insatiable intellectual hunger, unrelenting optimism and resistance to pigeonholing. Alas, what was rare for a politician in his time still very much is.'"
"'08-05-16,'0','Huge deliveries of new rice seeds are needed, too. Thailand is the likely source for the seeds, Mr. Tongul said. Traditionally, delta farmers have used seeds from rice grown the year before.New livestock — pigs, ducks, chickens and fish fingerlings in addition to buffaloes — and seeds are among the priority items for aid groups working in rural development in the delta.“The agricultural cycle is so critical,” Mr. Agland said Thursday. “We’ve got to avoid a hunger gap, and we’ve got very little time.”Aid officials continued to express concern about the government’s reluctance to let in assistance. “They’re restricting, they’re hiding, they’re not allowing us to import, almost nothing,” Mr. Tongul said. “I need 50,000 tons of rice to feed people for the next six months. I’ve got 3,000 on hand. This is what keeps me awake at night.”On Thursday, the government’s count of the dead rose nearly 5,000, to more than 43,000, with 27,838 missing, The Associated Press reported. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has estimated the death toll at 68,833 to 127,990, The A.P. said.United Nations agencies and other international relief groups held an emergency, closed meeting on Thursday afternoon to plot strategies for getting the delta farmers back to their farms and back to work.Many families have sought shelter in Buddhist monasteries, old buildings or schools, and the government has been trucking the displaced people to military-run refugee settlements far from their farms.But the aid agencies say the farmers need to get back to whatever is left of their farms in order to rebuild houses — even rudimentary ones — drain waterlogged paddies and get on with plowing and planting.Unless they can do that work, the aid groups say, the country will need another 50,000 tons of rice six months from now, Mr. Tongul said.The Yangon River, which was blocked by sunken ships and storm debris, reopened Thursday afternoon, an encouraging development for relief officials. It means that larger shipments — especially of rice — can now be delivered by boat into the port at Yangon if the government loosens its restrictions on imports.The World Food Program delivered thousands of high-energy biscuits to the south, but the agency has heard that some have been stolen or replaced with cheap crackers, Mr. Tongul said. He said the United Nations had begun an investigation.On Thursday, The A.P. reported, Myanmar’s junta warned in a state radio address that legal action would be taken against people who traded, hoarded or misused international aid intended for cyclone survivors.The junta also announced the approval of a new Constitution in a referendum it pressed ahead with just a week after the cyclone, though it delayed voting in the hardest-hit areas. The Constitution, intended to perpetuate military rule, passed with more than 90 percent of the vote on May 10, the authorities said, according to The A.P.The coastal area and Yangon are to vote on May 24, but analysts said the yes vote had already surpassed the level necessary for final approval.Heavy rains continued to drench Yangon and the delta on Thursday, further complicating deliveries of supplies as bridges and roads washed out. Trucks have so far been used to get most of the aid from the Yangon region to the delta, and groups like Save the Children, World Vision and CARE have had some success in delivering food to the south.But many townships and villages deep in the delta are still largely out of contact, and it is likely that the death toll will jump once counts in those areas can be taken, regional experts say.“We’ve been using small boats and motorbikes to get to places,” Mr. Agland said, “and we’re finding villages where 200 people used to live, and now there’s 5 or 10.”Still, amid the uncertainty over casualty numbers, Mr. Agland cautioned that just because people were reported missing did not necessarily mean they were dead. “For example, there have been a lot of lost kids reported, but we’re also finding groups of kids on their own” in rural, storm-damaged areas, he said.“The death toll is quite high, and I don’t know if we’ll ever find out the real number. The focus now is stopping more deaths.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','Nearly 100 vendors under different colored tents cluster every Saturday around the historic Ferry Building, which is situated where Market Street, the city’s main thoroughfare, meets the glimmering San Francisco Bay.For the best experience, try to arrive at about 8:30 a.m. and stay for breakfast. Start off on the pier side of the building, where the smell of rotisserie chicken rises above a saluting Gandhi statue and the arching Bay Bridge frames the view.Whet your palate with a slightly sinful sugar-covered doughnut muffin from the Downtown Bakery. Then tour the stands. To indulge fully, delve into asparagus fried in beer batter, spoon tangy-sweet plum butter from June Taylor onto crisp bread, and don’t miss the blissful semisoft artisanal goat cheese from Andante Dairy. Sample, sample, sample.When the crowds start to thicken at 10:30 a.m., break for a breakfast of Mexican eggs or smoked salmon at the ferry pier. Then hit the homestretch — the row of vendors at the building’s front and the gourmet food purveyors with permanent shops inside.If you make it to lunch, try to snag a pier-side table at the Hog Island Oyster Company, where the fresh catch pairs well with a grilled Gruyère sandwich and a bottle of California white. Just when I thought I couldn’t eat another bite on a visit this spring, a friend offered me a tasty oyster baked with fresh oregano and bread crumbs. As the sun burnt off the last of the morning clouds, I barely resisted the urge to clink glasses with everyone in sight.At 7:30 a.m. on a spring Saturday, clusters of Chinese shoppers were already jostling for the freshest bok choy and choy sum at the market on Alemany Boulevard. Others headed for Maria del Carmen Flores’s grilled pupusas, a tasty El Salvadoran corn cake filled with beans and cheese. Danny Grossman, a shopper, discussed his morning finds — a bouquet of rainbow-stemmed chard for $1, organic strawberries for $3 a pint.If the Ferry Plaza is the prince of the city’s markets, displaying its produce like buffed jewels, Alemany is its down-home uncle — a place where a panoply of fresh food and flowers are sold in a bustling parking lot. “No porcini ravioli here,” Mr. Grossman said. “There’s still dirt on the leaves.”The scene is San Francisco eclectic. As sweatpants-clad shoppers mingled, the Prairie Rose Band, its lead singer dressed in cow-pattered fake fur chaps, twanged bluegrass tunes on a banjo and fiddle. Patrons in knit caps joined impromptu drum circles. Asian grandmothers stared at a tattooed man with a giant iguana on his bicycle handlebars. Hand-painted murals of produce, flowers and the Buddha adorned the selling stalls.Founded in 1947 and run by the city, the Alemany Market consists of two parallel rows of light blue truck stalls and a third row of vendors under white and green awnings. Sorting through the more than 100 stalls, you’ll find tangy October-pressed olive oil, honey so rich it won’t fit through the squeeze bottle, navel oranges with an unusually sophisticated flavor and fresh cheddar cheese infused with sage. Don’t miss Café GoLo’s flaky, sugar-encrusted pastries, or a loaf of its yeasty olive bread for a picnic, so weighty and warm it feels like just came off a kitchen windowsill.Open from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. each Saturday, the market is south of the city’s Bernal Heights neighborhood, just off the junction of Highway 101 and Interstate 280. It is difficult to get to without a car, and parking can be tight. If you have any questions, “just ask the farmer,” said Carla Borelli, 43, another Alemany devotee. “It’s more like a community here.”San Francisco’s downtown Civic Center district is often overlooked, known as a place of grit and concrete, but on Wednesdays and Sundays, there’s an expanded oasis of green. The Heart of the City Farmers’ Market, founded in 1981 by Quakers as a community improvement project, draws 30 farmers and food makers. Customers include neighborhood residents, employees from nearby City Hall and a smattering of tourists. The market is open Wednesdays from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and on Sundays from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.On the Sunday of my most recent visit, a large western tiger swallowtail butterfly landed on a purple orchid at the flower stand, gracefully opening its yellow and black wings with turquoise and orange tips. Nearby, a steady line of patrons picked up three-pound bunches of fresh asparagus for $6. Early-bird shoppers purchased live quail and chickens, which they took home to butcher themselves.The busiest time at this market is Wednesday at lunchtime, when the local office workers filter in to do their weekly shopping and enjoy the sunshine at outdoor tables. Locals reverently unwrap corn and green chili tamales from the popular All Star Tamales stand. A devotional fan base mobs the Belgian Waffle Mania truck, which imports its flour from Belgium. The tasty waffles are crisp on the outside and slightly gooey within.The market sits on the red brick expanse of United Nations Plaza at Market Street between Seventh and Eighth Streets. Overhead, a flag flutters to mark the location where the United Nations Charter was signed in 1945. Just below ground is the Civic Center transit stop, and the Asian Art Museum is across the plaza.Sandwiched between high-rise insurance offices and banks, the Galleria, an upscale three-story shopping arcade, is an unusual place to find farmers fresh from the fields. Indeed, the market suffered a bit of an identity crisis when it opened in 2005, and the first winter brought few customers.Today, however, it has hit its stride. The 15 or so farmers who stand under their sun umbrellas each Thursday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. casually field questions from bankers about what would go well with sinfully sweet homemade apple syrup. Pints of bright-red strawberries and other easy-to-carry produce sells briskly, and there are also prepared snacks ideal for visitors, like homemade granola bars laden with almonds and pistachios and German-style pretzels.Instead of country music, there’s light jazz from a one-man-band player named Chaz. Vendors adjust to the professional vibe. Sahar Ibrahimi, 23, who sells inventive Afghan breads and dips, replaces the fleece jacket she wears at Alemany with stylish outfits and gracefully styles her long black hair. “Have you had a quesadilla? This is like an Afghan quesadilla,” she called out on a sunny afternoon, sweeping some tangy eggplant dip onto a spinach-filled piece of Afghan bolani bread and offering a taste to a customer.Few tourists seem to know about this young market; to some, it’s a lucky find. It’s right in the center of the financial district at 50 Post Street, near many hotels and above the Montgomery Street transit stop.Helen Kramer, a visitor from Florida, had caught a glimpse of fresh salad greens from the street and wandered in with her husband and son. They had just come from the Ferry Building, not realizing the market there was closed on Thursdays.“I wish we had known about this,” she said, as she tried her second bite of Afghan bread. “It’s actual farmers selling their products.” She gave her son $10 to buy some garlic mint cheese and spinach flatbread from Ms. Ibrahimi, and pronounced it satisfactory: “It tastes very fresh.”'"
"'08-05-16,'0','This year, the decision in California could at the very least have resonance with socially conservative voters in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania. Even if Mr. McCain does not wield it as part of his fall campaign — and his political associates said he almost certainly would not — history suggests that independent conservative advocacy groups would seize on the ruling to try to define Mr. Obama and his party as culturally out-of-step. Presumably, it is just a matter of time until voters across the country see advertisements including same-sex couples taking their vows on the steps of San Francisco City Hall.There is considerable debate whether the marriage issue helped Republican candidates in 2004. And it seems questionable if voters are going to find it compelling this year, at a time when the country is facing a prolonged war, an ailing economy and skyrocketing gasoline prices, the issues that Mr. McCain and the two Democratic candidates are confronting on the campaign trail every day.“At best, it doesn’t move voters, and at worst for Republicans, it moves them against them,” said Matthew Dowd, who was chief strategist for Mr. Bush’s campaign in 2004. “Not so much on the issue, but it becomes, ‘Why are we having a discussion on this issue when we should talking about things that matter, like the economy, or health care, or the war?’ ”Joe Solmonese, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, said: “Regardless of where the American people have moved on marriage, what you have to look at is where it places in their priorities. I don’t see it being the same kind of issue that it was in 2004.”If there is to be a national debate over the merits of same-sex marriage, the presidential candidates may not be the best proxies to carry out these arguments.Mr. McCain supports marriage “between a man and a woman” and opposes any legal recognition of a same-sex relationship. But he is against an amendment to the Constitution, backed by many conservatives, that would ban same-sex marriage. More pressingly, he is at a point in his campaign now where he is seeking to appeal to moderates and Democrats uncomfortable with Mr. Obama; Mr. Dowd argued that emphasizing social issues would repel those groups.Mr. Obama and Senator Clinton are more explicit in their support of civil unions, but both campaigns were quick to restate their views that the candidates believe the act of marriage should be between a man and a woman, a formulation that seems to have succeeded in taking the sting out of the issue.Yet there are differences of nuance in how the Democratic and Republican candidates talk about the issue that could have resonance with socially conservative voters. For example, Mr. Obama’s campaign explicitly said that he “has always believed that same-sex couples should enjoy equal rights under the law, and he will continue to fight for civil unions.”In California, Mr. Brown is leading an effort to force a voter initiative that would overturn the court decision. If Mr. McCain decides to back such an initiative, it could provide a point of contrast that conservatives could use to hurt Mr. Obama. And an initiative could bring out more conservative voters at a time when Mr. McCain’s advisers see a small hope of putting California in play.But if Mr. McCain were to actively support such an initiative, it would put him in the uncomfortable position of working against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican whose success at appealing to moderates is part of the model of Mr. McCain’s national campaign. Mr. Schwarzenegger said he would uphold the court ruling and oppose any such initiative.A survey taken by the Pew Research Center last October found that 55 percent of respondents said same-sex marriage would be not at all important or not too important to their decision of whom to support for president; 43 percent said it would be somewhat important or very important.And that was at a time when gasoline prices seemed low and the economy seemed stable. So the California Supreme Court may have created a laboratory to test once and for all just how powerful this issue really is.'"

"'08-05-17,'0','Cashman said the Yankees would have preferred to reschedule the game for Monday, when both teams are off, but that would have given the Mets 31 days in a row without a day off. The Mets also play a doubleheader in Atlanta on Tuesday.The Yankees said fans holding tickets for Friday’s game could use them for the makeup game or exchange them at Yankee Stadium for any regular-season home game within 12 months of the postponement, subject to availability.RETURN TO ALL-STAR GAME It is one of the enduring images of the interleague series between the Yankees and the Mets: Mike Piazza taking a fastball from Roger Clemens off his helmet.It happened on July 8, 2000, the Saturday before the All-Star Game in Atlanta, and it knocked Piazza out of the game.Joe Girardi was hitting .302 for the Chicago Cubs, and he had planned a retreat with his wife and 9-month-old daughter, Serena. But Serena had a cold and the trip was canceled, so Girardi was at home when a league representative called.“They said, ‘Do you want to come to the All-Star Game?’ and my first question was, ‘As a player?’ ” Girardi said Friday, after being named an American League coach for this summer’s game at Yankee Stadium.“They said: ‘Yeah, as a player. We’re going to make arrangements.’ I said: ‘Don’t worry. I’ll make my own arrangements. I will be there on time.’ So I got there Monday night, probably about 10 o’clock. I was ecstatic.”Girardi did not play in the game; Jason Kendall and Mike Lieberthal split the catching for the National League.But the record shows that Girardi was an All-Star, and now he will be on the staff of A.L. Manager Terry Francona for the game on July 15. Girardi said he would give the manager’s office in the home clubhouse to Francona for the day.“He didn’t want me to move,” Girardi said. “I said, ‘It’s your office, you earned it.’ ”Mets Manager Willie Randolph was also named as an All-Star coach on the staff of Colorado Rockies Manager Clint Hurdle.KENNEDY GETS ANOTHER CHANCE Ian Kennedy will get another turn in the Yankees’ rotation, despite a disappointing return Thursday against the Rays, when he allowed five runs in five innings in a 5-2 loss. He will start Thursday against Baltimore.“We’ve got to get him going,” Joe Girardi said.INTRIGUING MATCHUP IN MINORS Extended spring training games are usually sleepy affairs played on back fields in front of family members and friends. But Saturday’s game between the Yankees’ and Rays’ minor leaguers will have some buzz.The Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez will be starting a rehabilitation assignment as he recovers from an injury to his right quad. And one of the scheduled pitchers for Tampa Bay is David Price.Like Rodriguez, Price is a former No. 1 overall pick. He has been recovering from shoulder soreness, but Price, a left-hander out of Vanderbilt, struck out the side in a March exhibition against the Yankees and is considered a future star.ANOTHER SCORELESS INNING Edwar Ramírez did it again Thursday, pitching a scoreless inning for the Yankees late in their loss to Tampa Bay. Ramírez has not allowed a run in 15 combined appearances for the Yankees and Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this season.Ramírez had his moments for the Yankees last season, with 31 strikeouts in 21 innings, but his earned run average was 8.14.SEEING THE FUTURE Mark Melancon, a highly regarded reliever coming off elbow surgery, made his debut for Class AA Trenton on Thursday, allowing a run in two innings with no walks and four strikeouts. The Yankees hope Melancon can help their bullpen late this season the way Joba Chamberlain did last year.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Mr. McCain, who was received with warm but not wild applause, has not always been a favorite of the country’s largest gun lobby, and was once branded by it as “one of the premier flag-carriers for enemies of the Second Amendment.” The gun lobby still disagrees with Mr. McCain because he favors background checks for firearm sales at gun shows and pushed through campaign finance regulations that restricted political advertising by groups like the N.R.A.But this week the N.R.A.’s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, told The Louisville Courier-Journal that there were “vast numbers of areas” in which Mr. McCain and the gun lobby agreed. In 1994, the senator voted against a ban on assault weapons because he considered it, as he told reporters on Friday, an “encroachment” on the Second Amendment. Last year Mr. McCain told The Associated Press, “I strongly support the Second Amendment and I believe the Second Amendment ought to be preserved — which means no gun control.”And this year, Mr. McCain was one of 55 senators to sign a brief urging the Supreme Court to declare the District of Columbia’s strict gun-control law “unconstitutional per se.” The brief, a major new cause for the N.R.A., was not signed by Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama.In his speech, Mr. McCain acknowledged his differences with the N.R.A., but said they should not detract from his “long record of support” for the Second Amendment.“For more than two decades, I’ve opposed efforts to ban guns, ban ammunition, ban magazines and dismiss gun owners as some kind of fringe group unwelcome in modern America,” Mr. McCain told the group. “The Second Amendment isn’t some archaic custom that matters only to rural Americans, who find solace in firearms out of frustration with their economic circumstances. The Second Amendment is unique in the world. It guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. To argue anything else is to reject the clear meaning of our founding fathers.”He added: “The clear meaning of the Second Amendment has not stopped those who want to punish firearms owners, and those who make and sell firearms, for the actions of criminals. It seems like every time there is a particularly violent crime, the antigun activists demand yet another restriction on the Second Amendment.”At a town-hall-style meeting in Watertown, S.D., on Friday, Mr. Obama responded that he supported the Second Amendment, but that he believed in “common-sense gun laws so that we don’t have kids being shot on the streets of cities like Chicago.”The N.R.A.’s position, he added, is that “any law related to gun ownership is a potential camel’s nose under the tent, and that if we allow even, you know, the smallest concession, that somehow guns are going to be taken away from everybody.”Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton support limits on gun sales and extending the ban on assault weapons.Mr. McCain was preceded in the cavernous Kentucky Exposition Center on Friday by a long list of Republican speakers, including the former Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney; Karl Rove, the former top political aide in the Bush White House and now a commentator for Fox News; John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations; and Oliver L. North, the Reagan-era official who secretly sold weapons to Iran to support the anti-Marxist rebels of Nicaragua.Earlier on Friday, before Mr. McCain’s appearance at the N.R.A. convention, Mr. McCain and a clutch of camera crews dropped in on the St. Albans Gun & Archery shop near Charleston, W.Va. But Mr. McCain avoided the guns. Instead, he and his wife, Cindy, looked for a scale to weigh catfish — the shop did not have one — and bought a $40 fishing rod, plus bobbers, hooks, sinkers and bait.It was unclear why Mr. McCain drew a line at walking down the aisle of rifles at the shop, although such a stroll would have generated endless loops on cable news. On his campaign bus Friday morning, Mr. McCain told reporters that he did not own a gun, although he carried a pistol as a Navy pilot.After the stop at the gun shop, Mr. McCain’s traveling press secretary, Brooke Buchanan, said that Mr. McCain would use his new fishing rod on the artificial lake at his 10-acre Arizona spread in Sedona.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','“In light of the statements made by Jonathan Schwartz reported today that he acted irresponsibly in his professional duties as an actuarial consultant, I have determined that the Assembly cannot have confidence in any of the fiscal notes prepared by Mr. Schwartz for legislation that is currently before us,” Mr. Silver said in a statement.To critics of the Legislature, Mr. Schwartz’s role in analyzing the pension legislation underscored what they perceived as the lawmakers’ overly cozy relationship with labor.In addition to the Assembly’s move, the office of the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, said on Friday that the Senate would consider a bill to make clear the source of financial analyses that accompany legislation.In the interview Thursday, Mr. Schwartz called his job “a step above voodoo” and acknowledged that he erroneously claimed that a controversial early retirement bill now pending in the Legislature would have no cost. “I got a little bit carried away in my formulation,” Mr. Schwartz said.The bill would have offered members of District Council 37, an umbrella group of municipal unions, a second chance to buy into an early retirement plan. The council paid Mr. Schwartz $10,400 last year, according to United States Department of Labor records.John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said that in addition to more transparency, the Senate wants to make clear to the public that legislation is subjected to multiple financial reviews and that projections by the city are taken into account for city pension bills.Unions are widely considered the most powerful interest group in Albany, and those who have pushed for more fiscal restraint say Mr. Schwartz’s involvement is the latest example of labor’s inappropriate influence.“Why aren’t they using the New York City pension system’s actuary for these fiscal notes?” said John J. Faso, who was the Republican nominee for governor in 2006 and a former minority leader of the Assembly. “To me, it’s a real conflict of interest to use anything but the pension system itself as the actuary.”“The tendency is to view the pension systems as a giant honey pot that no one has to pay into, and that is clearly not true,” he added. “That is why you need to have independent actuarial assumptions.”Actuaries project what municipalities or corporations will have to pay to cover benefits in future years, based on a variety of factors, including life expectancies. But Mr. Schwartz suggested on Thursday that the analysis was not scrupulously objective.“What people call actuarial science is at least as much as an art as a science,” said Mr. Schwartz, a former actuary for New York City.“Back in my days as city actuary, I would go to that part of the range that would make things look as expensive as possible,” he added. “As consultant for the unions, I go to the part of the range that makes things as cheap as possible, but I never knowingly go out of the range.”'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Missouri lawmakers ended their legislative session on Friday without completing action on a proposed constitutional amendment that would have enabled election officials to require proof of citizenship from people registering to vote.The bill failed to go to the Senate floor for a vote in part because of pressure by the secretary of state and grass-roots groups, said a Republican lobbyist who worked for the measure.The lobbyist asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for the backers. Sponsors of the amendment, which would have required voter approval to go into effect, say it is part of an effort to prevent illegal immigrants from affecting the political process. Critics say it could lead to disenfranchising tens of thousands of legal residents who would find it difficult to prove their citizenship.After passing the House last week, the measure had more than enough votes for approval in the Senate. This week, Gov. Matt Blunt and Senator Christopher S. Bond, both Republicans, expressed strong support for the measure.Democrats had threatened to filibuster if the bill was brought to debate in the Senate. Republicans said they were willing to use a rare procedural motion to undermine a filibuster if it came to that. It never did.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Mr. Avella’s proposal comes as lawmakers across the country, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, call for gas-tax holidays during the summer travel season. Republican state senators in Albany, noting that New York has the nation’s third-highest motor-fuel taxes, want to suspend three state gas taxes, amounting to about 32 cents a gallon, from Memorial Day to Labor Day.The idea of switching from a percentage-rate tax to a flat fee on each gallon is not new: Two years ago, a law change invited counties in New York to do just that and cap their sales taxes on motor fuel at 8 cents a gallon. Fourteen counties — but not New York City — made the switch, to ease the burden on consumers.But several of those counties found the change fell short of its promise. Prices at the pump barely budged, while tax receipts fell. Some county officials accused oil companies of soaking up the tax breaks that were meant to benefit drivers. Half of the 14 counties have reinstituted percent-based taxes.“You’re kidding yourself if you think that an industry that makes as much as it can will pass along the savings to the public,” Michael F. Conners II, the comptroller in Albany County, which abandoned its flat-fee tax after six months. “The oil companies say they would never take this tax away, but it’s absorbed into the price.”Mr. Conners said that his county would have lost $4.6 million in taxes had it kept its cap in place for a full year. That would have amounted to 3.4 percent of the county’s total receipts from all sales, property and other taxes. “This was not help for the driving public,” he added, “but a transfer gift to the oil industry.”Next month, Onondaga County will scrap its flat tax and return to the percentage system. A study by the budget office compared gas prices in Syracuse, which is in Onondaga County, to those in Buffalo and Rochester, whose counties did not change their formulas, and found Syracuse stations consistently charged 2 to 5 cents less before and after Onondaga switched systems. So Onondaga stood to lose an estimated $10.3 million a year in taxes without saving drivers any money at the pump.“The bulk of our budget is funded on property taxes, which have been escalating and strangulating people,” said Benjamin T. Dublin, the director of intergovernmental relations in the Onondaga County executive’s office. “If we got the $10 million, we wouldn’t have to tax them as much.”The experiences in these counties have only bolstered Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s resistance to changing New York City’s gas taxes to a flat fee. Speaking to reporters earlier this month, Mr. Bloomberg said a gas-tax holiday was “about the dumbest thing I’ve heard in an awful long time from an economic point of view.”He added, “We’re trying to discourage people from driving, and we’re trying to end our energy dependence.”A spokesman for the mayor, John Gallagher, said that the extra money being pocketed by the city in gas taxes as prices go up is not nearly enough to offset the slowdown in revenue from commercial real-estate transactions and profits on Wall Street. “Any characterization that this is a windfall is misleading,” he said.While a precise correlation is impossible to calculate, because of fluctuating patterns in gas purchases among other factors, the 8.6 percent increase in tax receipts this winter compared to last winter is dwarfed by the estimated 31 percent jump in gas prices in the city over the same period. Part of that is probably because higher prices lead people to buy less gas, especially in a city where public transit is a viable option: A 75-cent-a-gallon tax the city charges on behalf of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority amounted to $4.5 million over the December-February period this year, 15.4 percent less than the same three months the year before.Each gallon of gas sold in New York actually includes eight different taxes. In addition to the city’s 4 percent sales tax, and the transportation authority surcharge, there is a federal excise tax of 18.4 cents. The state also collects an 8-cent excise tax, an 8-cent sales tax and a petroleum business tax of 16.4 cents a gallon.In addition, drivers pay a “spill tax” of 0.3 cents a gallon for environmental preservation and a petroleum testing fee of 0.05 cents.Drivers in New York welcomed the idea of a flat gas tax.“Of course it’s a good idea, come on,” said Dogan Soylemez, 32, who spends $600 a week filling up his Mister Softee truck, which was parked one afternoon this week near an On the Run gas station at Fort Hamilton Parkway and McDonald Avenue in Brooklyn where regular unleaded was $4.07 a gallon. “They have to explain to the people why they have to sell at that price.”'"
"'08-05-17,'0','OTTAWA — Atomic Energy of Canada will continue to rely on a 51-year-old reactor to produce most of the world’s radioactive medical isotopes after deciding Friday to abandon two troubled replacement units.The aging reactor was temporarily closed by Canada’s nuclear regulator in November because it lacked some required safety equipment. That provoked a worldwide shortage of isotopes as well as a controversy in Canada about the independence of the regulator after the government fired its head.The two Maple reactors scrapped on Friday had been intended to replace the aging National Research Universal, or N.R.U., reactor near Ottawa at Chalk River, Ontario. Since the announcement of their construction in 1996, the reactors have faced millions of dollars in cost overruns, seemingly insurmountable technical issues and litigation. While the new reactors are more or less complete, a design problem makes it impossible to safely control the nuclear activity within them.“Our board of directors and senior management have concluded that it is no longer feasible to complete the commissioning and start-up of the reactors,” said Hugh MacDiarmid, the chief executive of Atomic Energy, which is owned by the government.The new reactors would have been the first in the world devoted to producing medical isotopes.The company did not disclose how much had been invested in the two reactors nor did it respond to requests for comment. Political parties and environmental groups estimate that about 500 million Canadian dollars have been spent on the project and that opening the reactors would have required several hundred million additional dollars.The company and the Canadian government said they were confident that isotope production could be reliably sustained by the N.R.U., which was reopened after Parliament overrode the regulator through special legislation.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest source of home financing, said on Friday that it was lowering the amount of down payments required on mortgages that it purchases in areas where home prices are falling.Starting on June 1, the new requirements of 3 percent or 5 percent, which replace rules set in December, will apply nationally to loans on single-family primary residences, it said.The rule change comes as many in the housing industry call for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the second-largest federally chartered company for home financing, to make more affordable housing available.Fannie Mae “will be equalizing the down payment requirements for borrowers in all parts of the country, regardless of local market conditions,” Marianne Sullivan, senior vice president for single-family credit policy and risk management, said in a news release.Fannie Mae will accept up to 97 percent loan-to-value ratios for conventional, conforming mortgages through its automated underwriting system, and ratios of up to 95 percent for other loans.A conforming mortgage meets the requirements for loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can purchase.The size of these loans was temporarily increased in March by their regulator to as high as $729,000 in high-cost areas from $417,000 to try to stimulate lending in one of the worst housing markets since the Great Depression.Fannie Mae also said it would continue to allow loans with Community Seconds, an assistance program, for up to 105 percent combined loan-to-value ratio.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Mr. McCain has criticized such groups — called 527 political organizations — because they operate outside the limits on campaign contributions and any coordination with a campaign can draw legal penalties. Diana Banister, Mr. Shirley’s partner, said their firm stopped working for the McCain campaign by mutual agreement in light of its new policy.On Thursday, the campaign removed one of its energy policy advisers, Eric Burgeson, because he was also a paid lobbyist for energy companies.Last weekend, the McCain campaign accepted the resignations of two other lobbyists, Doug Goodyear, previously charged with planning for the Republican convention, and Doug Davenport, a regional campaign director. Both had previously worked for the military junta governing Myanmar, which is now under fire for blocking humanitarian relief to cyclone victims.“Obviously, I didn’t like it,” Mr. McCain told reporters Friday when asked about the two aides’ ties to Myanmar. “Saw a problem, fixed it.”Still, eliminating potential conflicts may be complicated. Highlighting the issue, the new policy was disseminated by a former lobbyist: Mr. McCain’s top campaign adviser, Rick Davis, a longtime aide who is on leave from a lobbying firm whose clients included major telecommunications companies with business before a Senate committee that Mr. McCain led. Mr. Davis’s clients included a Russian aluminum magnate and a Ukrainian political party; United States officials suspect both of corruption and ties to antidemocratic groups.Another top strategist, Charlie Black, was one of Washington’s best-known Republican lobbyists until he joined the campaign. Mr. Black is on leave from his firm, which has ties to a host of business clients and several foreign governments.About a sixth of the campaign’s 106 top fund-raisers — dubbed innovators and trailblazers — are lobbyists. Mr. McCain’s fund-raising chairman, Tom Loeffler, founded a lobbying firm that bears his name, and the campaign’s deputy finance chairman, Wayne Berman, is a major Republican lobbyist as well. A McCain campaign official said Friday that Mr. Loeffler was expected to give up his position to comply with the new rules. It was unclear if Mr. Berman would relinquish his role, the official said.Mr. McCain’s most likely Democratic opponent, Mr. Obama, of Illinois, is another outspoken advocate of tighter ethics rules who has tried to walk a fine line on the subject of lobbyists and influence-seekers. He has pledged to reject contributions from federally registered lobbyists but has accepted money from former lobbyists, partners of lobbyists and business executives who hire lobbyists. His campaign includes lobbyists among its unpaid policy advisers as well as staff members who represent private clients before the government in less direct ways.Mr. Obama’s top campaign adviser, David Axelrod, is a partner in ASK Public Strategies, a firm that helps companies influence government policy by trying to shape public opinion. Its clients have included AT&T, Cablevision and a unit of the energy company Exelon.Bill Burton, a spokesman for Mr. Obama, drew a distinction between trying to sway public opinion and directly lobbying federal officials. “Senator McCain has some of the most powerful lobbyists in Washington running his campaign,” Mr. Burton said, “and if given a chance, they would run his White House.”Jill Hazelbaker, a McCain spokeswoman, called Mr. Obama’s position laughable. “In his world, a lobbyist can’t contribute financially to his campaign,” Ms. Hazelbaker said, “but they can advise him on matters of national security.”The policy Mr. Davis distributed late Thursday spells out the McCain campaign’s new rules. It bars active federal lobbyists or foreign agents from working full time for the campaign. It requires part-time volunteers to disclose any potential conflicts and excludes any lobbyists from discussions of policies they lobby about. It also forbids lobbyists who may volunteer for the campaign from lobbying Mr. McCain’s Senate office or committee staff. And it excludes anyone who works for independent political groups from working for the campaign. But it does not bar lobbyists from donating or raising money.In addition, Mr. Davis reminded the staff, Mr. McCain has pledged that if elected he will end the usual revolving door between serving in the White House and lobbying it from outside.“Anyone serving in a McCain administration must commit not to lobby the administration during his presidency,” Mr. Davis wrote.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Suddenly, Big Brown separated from the herd and walked toward me. I patted his neck and stroked his face, cooing sweet nothings in his ear for at least a minute. Shanda handed me a halter. As if on cue, Big Brown bolted away again.I looked across the arena and saw Marie-Claude Stockl, the executive director and co-owner of the Horse Institute, flash a knowing smile. “Horses are like people,” she said. “They introduce themselves at their own pace.”That was just the first of many insights to come from my executive pursuit of “equine-assisted learning.” Unlike a dude ranch, the Horse Institute does not give riding lessons. Its mission is to give people who normally manage other people a chance to improve their communication skills, teamwork and creativity by observing and performing exercises with horses.During my one-day training session with the hospital nurses, Marie-Claude, a former Bristol Myers executive, made striking comparisons between horses and humans that left me wondering which species was more intelligent.“The biggest problem in the corporate world is that we don’t live in the present,” she said. “When we come to the workplace, we bring in grudges and things from the past and worries about the future. Horses live in the present. They don’t hold grudges. They’re happy to try something new, unlike many of us who remain stuck in the past. Living in the present works for horses. I think it works for humans, too.”In addition to Marie-Claude and the equine “faculty,” the staff of so-called facilitators at the institute includes her husband, Larry Stockl, a former American Express executive; Caroline Carrington-Phipps, an experienced horsewoman doing graduate work in holistic health care at Columbia University; and Jerry Michaels, a psychotherapist who formerly specialized in the study of human phobias.“The purpose of working with horses is to take you out of your normal environment and put you in an environment that makes you feel a bit uncomfortable,” Jerry told us. “Horses are big. They can be intimidating, but they can also be intimidated. Because the environment is unusual, you’re forced to be in the present.”The Horse Institute, founded in 2005 on a 28-acre horse farm owned by the Stockls, is a specialized offshoot of the nonprofit Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association. The association provides education and certification for professionals in the field of equine-assisted therapy.But unlike therapists who use horses to treat people with mental disorders, physical disabilities or substance abuse problems, the institute focuses exclusively on training corporate and individual clients to cope with workplace issues. Fees for a one-day session, which can consist of 6 to 45 people, start at $7,500.The catch-and-halter exercise in which I was paired with Shanda was part of programs customized for Columbia Memorial Hospital staff members at the request of their president and chief executive, Jane Ehrlich, an accomplished dressage rider. The themes of the day were how to train new employees and how to retain and motivate those who passed muster during their three-month probationary period.Rounding up the four horses representing our “new hires” wasn’t easy. At least 10 minutes passed before Shanda and I realized that we could (and indeed should) call on the expertise of the institute’s staff and seek help from the other pairs of nurses. The paint appeared especially unwilling to be caught, so we decided to focus our collective efforts on the others. We managed to halter Big Brown, the white and the second brown, but after another five minutes or so, we gave up on the paint.Marie-Claude gave us deservedly mixed reviews. “You were fairly quick to ask for help, and you developed a strategy, which was to separate the other horses from the paint,” she noted. “But one of you thought the exercise was a competition. As a result, the implementation of your strategy was a little rocky and lacking in teamwork.”We moved on to “appendages,” an exercise that called for three-person teams to link arms and try to saddle a horse. The rub was that the so-called “brain” in the middle of the threesome could give instructions but not use his or her hands, while the outside links could use their hands but could not talk.Other exercises included a relay race involving horses and eggs on spoons, a game of charades in which we had to figure out how to use horses to express various emotions and training a horse to complete an obstacle course without the guidance of a lead line.I may live and write by touch and feel, but I’m not a touchy-feely kind of guy. I’d secretly suspected from the beginning that the value of all this horse play would be minimal. But to my surprise, the group debriefing with Marie-Claude and the Horse Institute staff at the end of the day yielded testimonials that ranged from the predictably mundane to the sacred.A nurse coordinator with more than two decades of hospital experience said she would literally start to look outside her box-shaped office for more creative problem-solving techniques. One of her longtime colleagues said she’d realized that “trying to make everybody happy is an impossible task.” Another nursing coordinator said he was now more aware of the ambiguous messages he had been sending to co-workers with his body language.“The problem is, I’m 40 years old and I don’t know how I’m going to change after all these years,” he said.“The reality is that all of us are changing all the time,” Jerry, the psychotherapist, replied. “I think all of us have this sense of, ‘Who are we going to be when we really grow up?’ Perception is literally the truth, and it has nothing to do with the facts. If you want to change the way you’re perceived, pick one or two traits to exhibit, not 9 or 10, and be consistent in exhibiting those one or two traits.“Be like a horse,” my former partner, Shanda, interjected. “Live in the moment.”Marie-Claude flashed another knowing smile. I kicked at the floor of the arena, silently counting the ways in which I ought to emulate Big Brown.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Dick Netzer, an economist who advised mayors of New York City and governors of New York State and served on the first board of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which pried New York City out of bankruptcy in the 1970s, died on May 7 in Manhattan. He was 79 and lived in Brooklyn and in East Hampton, N.Y.His death came after a long illness, his wife, Carol, said.Mr. Netzer, who spent much of his career at New York University and became dean of its Graduate School of Public Administration (now the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service), was an expert in public finance, especially as it pertains to state and local government. He wrote widely and voluminously on the arcana of how people are, should and should not be taxed and how the government should, should not and does spend the money. In the 1950s he wrote about tolls, toll roads and highway finance. In the 1960s he wrote a comprehensive analysis of property tax.In the 1970s, his book about public support of the arts, “The Subsidized Muse” (Cambridge University Press, 1978), argued that government arts financing was generally a good thing but needed to be applied prudently, that money simply flung at arts organizations was both fiscally and culturally irresponsible.He served, in the late 1960s, as an adviser to Mayor John V. Lindsay, in the 1970s, to Mayor Abraham D. Beame and Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and in the 1980s, to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. And in June 1975, when the financier Felix Rohatyn and others recommended that the State Legislature create the Municipal Assistance Corporation, an agency with the power to issue bonds backed by portions of the city sales tax, Mr. Netzer joined the board, his deep academic background providing a fiscally conservative anchor. He remained until 1995.“He provided continuity and perspective and placed the crisis in terms of both the city and state’s long term financial evolution,” said Peter Goldmark, who was the state budget director at the time. “The thing about Dick is that he was a continuing iconic figure. When I first went to work with Mayor Lindsay, Dick Netzer was a god. He was the guy we all looked up to. And he was still that guy in 1985 and 1990.”Dick Netzer, who was named for his mother, Sue Dick, was born in Brooklyn on May 14, 1928. His father, Solomon, was a doctor who specialized in the treatment of tuberculosis. He attended New York City public schools and the University of Wisconsin and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard. He served stateside in the Army during the Korean War.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Each New Jersey community is represented by a particular craft or activity and by a specific practitioner. These are communities formed by immigrants and natives, by displaced persons and once-endangered peoples. The practitioners can range from virtuosic professionals (the origami paper dolls by Fusaye Kazaoka are extraordinary) to devoted amateurs. And while some crafts are broadly familiar (South Jersey basket weaving), others have been rescued from oblivion (like the embroidery of Ukraine) or relative obscurity (Bengali painting).The selections can be both inspiring and relatively pointless. The display of a rudimentary Jewish sukkah, or harvest festival hut, hardly reflects the crafts of New Jersey Jews, and photographs of Italian St. Joseph’s tables — with their ritualistic display of sculptured foods — do not show enough about either the custom’s artfulness or its purpose.Still, the exhibition is true to its intentions: it is a “tapestry” celebrating diverse cultural activity. The effect is actually more like that of a quilt, with some pieces demanding more attention and others deserving less. But the point was to cover the varied constituencies of the state, while celebrating the contribution of each. The miscellaneous effect and the surveylike approach also reflect the ambitions of many local museums in the early 21st century: honoring a region’s eclectic communities and welcoming their visitors.Perhaps that point seems so emphatic here because so little else is on view, but it does not seem an accident that this kind of survey was chosen as the first major show for the new era of an old museum. Very different kinds of ambitions were apparent when the New Jersey State Museum was established in 1895 by the State Legislature. (The institution is still dependent on the government for its budget, $2.5 million this fiscal year.)The museum’s initial collection grew out of a cabinet of minerals and geological finds displayed in the State House since 1832. The collection expanded during the ambitious geological surveys of the 19th century, eventually documenting what the legislature called, in 1890, “the natural history of the State.”The institution began with a focus on natural history, archaeology and industrial history. Its exhibitions were local, but the subjects — and implications — were broader. In its early decades the museum published natural-history surveys of New Jersey and instituted a field research program in archaeology. Later, the cultural life of residents and their history came into play as the museum expanded into the decorative arts in the 1920s and into ethnographic materials and Native American objects in the ’30s. In the ’60s the museum began to explore the fine arts with a variety of ambitions, including the acquisition of works by artists with some connection to New Jersey (including, for example, the complete graphic works of Ben Shahn).Throughout much of this history, the museum seems to have selected an object for attention partly because it was local — state pride, after all, is one reason for a state museum. But the claim was also made that the object deserved wider attention for historical, intellectual or aesthetic reasons. Collect locally, think globally, might have been the maxim.Today, in the smaller displays of objects in spaces outside the main building — of fossils or flags — that approach may still exist. But with shifts in attitude by regional museums during the last few decades, the “think globally” aspect of the formula is often transformed: collect locally, but each local group determines the kind of thinking it deserves. The museum must not impose a perspective. It does not select; it represents.Those are the attitudes the New Jersey State Museum seems to affirm by scheduling this grand opening the way it has. Collect locally, yes, it seems to say, but also think locally. This is limiting. Had the opening show focused on a specific culture or explored cultural similarities and differences, or examined particular types of rituals or crafts, the local would have expanded into the global. But in explicitly and cursorily trying to represent the state’s diversity — even while spotlighting some extraordinary objects — the exhibition actually seems more parochial.What does this mean for the rest of the museum? Are delays partly due to uncertainties about this very issue?The current exhibition may not be typical of the institution’s complete plan — and the storerooms show just how many riches could be put on display — but in adopting this approach and in being uncertain about its role, the museum is not alone.'"

"'08-05-17,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — President Bush’s contentious nominee for the Federal Election Commission withdrew his name from consideration Friday, potentially ending a lengthy stalemate that had paralyzed the work of the agency.The nominee, Hans von Spakovsky, a former Justice Department official who did not have Democratic support to win confirmation, withdrew his nomination, saying it was time for the deadlock to end.Democrats have objected to Mr. von Spakovsky’s tenure at the Justice Department, where he oversaw voting rights matters. The standoff has held up other Senate confirmations to the six-member commission, which is without a quorum and has been unable to conduct business.In a letter to Mr. Bush, Mr. von Spakovsky said the long-stalled process had been extremely hard on his family. “And quite frankly,” he wrote, “we do not have the financial resources to continue to wait until this matter is resolved.”Mr. von Spakovsky added: “The agency that is tasked with policing our campaign finance system needs to be operational during a presidential election year.

"'08-05-17,'0','Paul Krugman (“The Oil Nonbubble,” column, May 12) refers to a statement I made two and a half years ago that the oil surge was a “huge bubble.” It was — and still is.And it is not only oil — we are experiencing a commodity bubble not seen since the 1970s and early ’80s. The cause of the commodity bubble then, and now, was excess money creation by the Federal Reserve.When the dollar is debased, commodity prices go up. In the current case, the bubble began in 2004, when the Fed continued to provide excess liquidity long after the economy was back on track from the 2000-1 recession. Gold surged to more than $400 an ounce, far above its $350 average of the previous 12 years, and today sits at almost $900 an ounce. Oil also went up, as did virtually all other commodities.John Maynard Keynes in 1919 observed that when inflationary forces are unleashed and the destruction is felt, not one person in a million will understand the inflationary process in play. And so today everyone is pointing fingers at India, China, greedy oil companies and powerful speculators.Supply and demand as the primary cause of high oil prices? Last August when the credit crisis hit, the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, began flooding the banking system with liquidity, like throwing money out of a helicopter. Since then, the American economy has ground to a halt, and global economic growth rates have slowed. Yet the price of oil since August has zoomed from around $70 a barrel to more than $120.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Art is a puzzle. How is it that a performer can look mysterious and intriguing — a conduit to a whole other world — while not doing very much? Nina Winthrop’s “Minority,” which opened at the Flea Theater on Thursday night, accomplishes this feat in its first moments with ambient sounds of chattering, a half-lighted stage and one woman who walks on slowly, only to slump forward, gradually straighten and tip her head backward.The movement is minimal, but those first moments are resonant with compressed intimations of meaning and the promise of its discovery. And Ms. Winthrop (who gives additional choreographic credit to Renée Archibald, Charlotte Gibbons, Jennifer Lafferty and Jessica Ray) builds on it by adding, at unpredictable intervals, dancer after dancer, until 21 figures fill the stage, each performing a variation on the original sequence. (Her press materials, which promised “many guest artists,” did not lie.)All dressed (by Naomi Luppescu) in shades of gray, the women form a strange contemporary corps de ballet, moving similarly yet never exactly alike or with the same rhythms. Like the electron cloud that surrounds the nucleus of an atom, they look like independently shifting particles but also like parts of an invisible structure that exerts an inexorable pull. At times they seem to be forming lines or gathering in pairs; then those patterns imperceptibly dissolve.Later, as Jon Gibson’s sound score layers accordion music over the chatter, individual dancers emerge briefly from the crowd only to be implacably reabsorbed; the symbolism of individuality is made clear as the dancers loosen their clothes to reveal patches of bright color (lime green, shocking pink, orange) on their backs, shoulders and stomachs.It’s a nice touch, the color also feeding into the overall picture created by Jared Klein’s patchy, evocative lighting, and the loose, swirling movement of the dancers. Ms. Winthrop doesn’t entirely sustain the focus and mystery she engendered at the outset, although this second half contains the marvelous images of Ms. Gibbons herding the group like sheep across the stage, and Ms. Ray crashing into clusters of dancers, scattering them like balls on a pool table.But “Minority” feels like real exploration, the beginnings of the creation of something new. Ms. Winthrop may have formed her company in 1991, but this work starts at the beginning, taking nothing for granted.'"
"'08-05-17,'0','So as I take on the Your Money column (and later this year, a companion personal finance site at nytimes.com), I want to devote some space to treating the subject in much the same way that this newspaper’s critics treat new films or restaurants. Important new offerings — whether mutual funds or a shopping search engine — will merit a review. And one by one, we will figure out what is worth using and what is best to ignore.Until then, here are five basic guidelines. Think of them as the first principles of Your Money, guidance that can be useful in making just about any financial decision.INVESTING IS SIMPLE The author Michael Pollan offered an elegant seven-word mantra in his best-selling book “In Defense of Food” that provides clarity amid the bounty of choices on supermarket shelves: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.”Boiling down investing is a similar exercise: Index (mostly). Save a ton. Reallocate infrequently.For most of us, investing in index mutual funds and similar vehicles — and sticking with them — is the hardest part of the mantra to accept. There are about 7,500 stocks on the three major exchanges in the United States and roughly 8,000 mutual funds. It would seem that with such an array of choices, we should be able to create portfolios that can outperform the market averages.The fact is, however, besting the overall market in most investment classes is nearly impossible over long periods of time. Sure, it may be fun to try. But if you enjoy that sort of thing, do it with a tiny piece of your portfolio. And remember to call it what it actually is: gambling.The rest of us should save as much as we can in a collection of low-cost index funds. Divide the money among stocks, bonds and other investments according to your time horizon and risk tolerance. Then adjust that allocation occasionally. Opinions vary on the frequency, but most experts agree that adjusting the mix more often than every 6 to 12 months is unnecessary and possibly costly.IT STILL MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR HELP Investing, however, is only one small part of your financial life. Mortgages, taxes, college savings, insurance and debt are a few of the hugely important tasks we have to figure out.Perhaps the best thing a versatile professional — whether it is a financial planner, accountant, stockbroker or lawyer — does is provide discipline. It is difficult to get most of this stuff right. And to get it done at the right time. Professionals help make sure it all happens on schedule.Most of us would rather avoid paying for help. Many financial planners charge 1 percent of a client’s assets annually for advice on anything and everything, including investing. So if you have $200,000 saved for retirement, that is $2,000 a year.The best defense I have ever heard for this level of compensation comes from Roger Streit, a financial planner at Key Financial Solutions in Roseland, N.J. He says that only 1 percent of us are wise enough and regimented enough to manage our own financial affairs. The other 99 percent, meanwhile, could almost certainly improve their investment performance at least 1 percent, thus justifying the annual fee.Sure, this sounds self-serving. But it is also probably true. For people without large portfolios or those who need help with something specific, planners affiliated with the Garrett Planning Network can help. All members are financial planners who agree to offer hourly rates.PEERS MAY KNOW MORE THAN PROFESSIONALS Financial planners may not have all the answers, or the best answers, all of the time. Moreover, they tend to be stronger on core areas of money management like insurance and taxes and less so on day-to-day financial decisions.Thankfully, a number of Web communities and blogs have grown up around almost every aspect of spending and saving. Travelers and collectors of frequent-flier miles have FlyerTalk. FatWallet is terrific on credit cards. Another site, the Bank Deals blog, is a great resource for new high-rate account offerings. A separate site, Consumerist (both the blog posts and the comments), is strong on advice for anyone who feels as if they have gotten a bad deal from a particular retailer or service provider. And committed index-fund investors hang out at the Bogleheads investment forum.Reading all these sites regularly is impossible. But they are great for researching particular questions, and most of the expert consumers who congregate there are open to inquiries from newcomers (as long as you search the archives first to make sure the answer isn’t there already).EVERYTHING CAN (AND SHOULD) BE AUTOMATED One of the great consumer-friendly innovations in the world of money in recent years has been the automation of bill paying. Practically every utility, mortgage lender and credit card company now has a way of getting its money each month without you lifting a finger. Most will take the money directly from a bank account, and many also allow payment with a credit or debit card.As a result, I do not need a monthly bill-paying session anymore. The electric and mortgage companies debit my bank account each month. The cable, cellphone and other companies charge my credit card, which helps me to collect piles of rewards. Then the credit card companies pull the full balance from my bank account, too, just as the mortgage company does.This has a number of advantages: no stamps, no envelopes, no late fees. But the real gift is that I do not have to worry about getting it all done. And with the time I win back, I can do things that are a lot more fun.Automating the payments can have some hitches. It is tempting to neglect to look at the bills once they start paying themselves. It is a pain to turn the whole bill-paying machinery off and on again if you switch bank accounts. And you need to be sure you have enough of a cash cushion in your primary checking account to prevent overdrafts.HAVE THE TALK As fewer people have pensions and more retirees live longer, an increasing number of people may need financial help from their children. The question is whether your parents will be among them.Trying to pry financial information out of your parents does not make for a pleasant conversation. But the fact is, we are entitled to demand some answers if our parents do not initiate the discussion themselves.This is not a case for callousness. They took care of us for 20 or so years, and we will take care of them, too, if it comes to that. But it is not fair of them to withhold warnings of deteriorating finances.

He portrayed them as being not only inflexible, but also “naïve and irresponsible,” the characteristics they ascribe to him.The remarks were made a day after Mr. Bush, addressing the Israeli Parliament, spoke of what he called a tendency toward “appeasement” in some quarters of the West, similar to that shown to the Nazis before the invasion of Poland.Mr. Bush also said he rejected negotiations with “terrorists and radicals,” implying that Democrats favored such a position. Mr. Obama said he found the remarks offensive.“After almost eight years, I did not think I could be surprised by anything that George Bush says,” Mr. Obama said, criticizing Mr. Bush for raising an internal issue on foreign soil. “But I was wrong.”Mr. McCain endorsed Mr. Bush’s remarks, saying, “The president is exactly right,” and adding that Mr. Obama “needs to explain why he is willing to sit down and talk” with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran.Mr. Obama at first joked that he wanted to respond to “a little foreign policy dustup yesterday.” But he quickly made it clear that he regarded the exchange as anything but funny, criticizing Mr. Bush and saying Mr. McCain “still hasn’t spelled out one substantial way in which he’d be different from George Bush’s foreign policy.”“In the Bush-McCain world view, everyone who disagrees with their failed Iran policy is an appeaser,” Mr. Obama said.Mr. McCain’s campaign answered quickly and sharply on Friday. A spokesman, Tucker Bounds, called the remarks a “hysterical diatribe in response to a speech in which his name wasn’t even mentioned.”Mr. McCain, speaking to the National Rifle Association in Louisville, Ky., said he welcomed a debate with Mr. Obama over national security and threw the naïve description back at Mr. Obama.“It would be a wonderful thing if we lived in a world where we don’t have enemies,” Mr. McCain said. “But that is not the world we live in, and until Senator Obama understands that reality, the American people have every reason to doubt whether he has the strength, judgment and determination to keep us safe.”For nearly a month, Republicans have stepped up attacks on Mr. Obama’s foreign policy perspective, highlighting a Hamas official’s complimentary comments about him in mid-April, as well as Mr. Obama’s statements that he is willing to meet with leaders of so-called rogue states like Iran, Syria, North Korea and Venezuela “without preconditions.” On Friday, Mr. Obama tried, not for the first time, to deflect and counter the criticisms by articulating his view of foreign relations, one in which military might is accompanied by diplomatic engagement with all countries, including enemies. His most specific example was a significantly changed policy toward Iran, one that would be equal parts carrot and stick.“It’s time to present Iran with a clear choice,” Mr. Obama said. “If it abandons its nuclear program, support for terror and threats to Israel, then Iran can rejoin the community of nations. If not, Iran will face deeper isolation and steeper sanctions.”The administration’s policy has merely “empowered Iran,” he said, with its unmitigated hostility. As a result, it is now Iran, not Iraq, he added, that “poses the greatest threat to America and Israel in the Middle East in a generation.”“Our Iran policy is a complete failure,” Mr. Obama said. “And that’s the policy that John McCain is running on.”Mr. McCain responded by saying: “I have some news for Senator Obama. Talking, not even with soaring rhetoric, in unconditional meetings with the man who calls Israel a ‘stinking corpse’ and arms terrorists who kill Americans will not convince Iran to give up its nuclear program. It is reckless to suggest that unconditional meetings will advance our interests.”As a setting for a major statement of Mr. Obama’s views on how the United States should deal with some of the most problem-laden areas in the world, the venue here was an unlikely one. Although Mr. Bush issued his criticism from the Israeli Knesset, Mr. Obama stood in what was grandly called a “livestock arena,” with wood chips and even cow chips scattered on the floor.The Obama campaign said it wanted to move strongly and swiftly, guided by lessons learned from the 2004 campaign.“There is no question that when the president on foreign soil launches a political attack we need to respond with the facts and with force,” said Bill Burton, national spokesman for the campaign.Mr. Burton said he expected many such confrontations between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain. “The truth is that there are many, many real differences,” Mr. Burton said.In a news conference after the forum, Mr. Obama’s criticisms of his Republican adversaries were even more pointed.“This White House, now mimicked by Senator McCain,” he said, “replaces strategy and analysis and smart policy with bombast, exaggeration and fear mongering.”He also said Mr. Bush’s speech on Thursday in Israel “wasn’t about a foreign policy argument — it was about politics.”To maintain, as the White House and the McCain campaign have done, that Mr. Bush’s remarks about appeasement were not aimed at administration critics like him is “being disingenuous,” Mr. Obama said.He addressed Republican contentions that he was willing to meet unconditionally with Mr. Ahmadinejad. Mr. McCain has said several times recently that he could not conceive of sitting down and talking with a foreign leader who has called for Israel’s extinction, and he has described Mr. Obama as all too willing to do so.The criticism is clearly meant to stoke unease that some Jews have expressed over Mr. Obama’s candidacy, a problem Mr. Obama has been trying to address.But Mr. Obama drew a distinction between his administration beginning negotiations with Iran “without preconditions” and getting directly involved himself. For that to take place, he said, Iran would have to meet certain benchmarks or conditions.That reiterates remarks he has made numerous times in the past year, though not in a YouTube debate last July that the McCain campaign has repeatedly cited.Agreeing to begin talks without preconditions “does not mean we would not have preparations,” Mr. Obama said.“Those preparations would involve starting with low-level diplomatic contacts” like National Security Council or State Department emissaries, he said.In addition to defending his concept of diplomatic engagement, Mr. Obama said it was Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain who have strayed from what he described as a robust tradition of bilateral support for resolving conflicts through direct negotiations, a tradition that ran from John F. Kennedy to Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan.“What’s puzzling is that this in any way would be controversial,” he said. “This has been the history of U.S. diplomacy until very recently.”'"
"'08-05-17,'0','Members of the League of Democracies opened the New Year’s ceremony with their pledge to “fight a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the small-d-democratic way.” Wearing their colorful terrorism-fighting costumes were French President Nicolas Sarkozy, now better known to the planet by his nom de guerre of Pâté Man, and Germany’s green-haired Angela (EcoGirl) Merkel, accompanied as always by her sidekick, Icy the Polar Bear. Silvio Berlusconi of Italy wore a business suit, but still wowed the crowd with his trademark power of shooting molten-gold bullion at his assailants.On the one hand, it’s always helpful to hear a candidate’s broad vision. On the other, the vision loses some of its import if you can’t get there from here. Pressed for details on his foreign-policy strategies, McCain said the secret was “setting goals and achieving.” You can just hear the Democrats of 2013 kicking themselves: Goals and achievements! Why didn’t we think of that?While McCain was unveiling his great expectations in Ohio, back in Washington Congress was voting by overwhelming majorities to pass an enormous, wasteful, ridiculous farm bill that provides massive subsidies to wealthy people who grow wheat, corn, soybeans, rice and cotton — along, of course, with Senator Mitch McConnell’s famous tax break for breeders of thoroughbred horses. McCain said he’d veto the bill if he were president, a threat that loses some of its wow quotient when the bill in question just passed both chambers by veto-proof majorities. (Both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama dived into the tank and supported the package.)Among the smaller subsidies was one for goat mohair. This was a target for the Clinton administration’s big efficiency drive, partly because the nation’s well-being does not really require a secure supply of mohair, and partly because it has the disadvantage of sounding silly. Mohair price supports were eliminated with great fanfare and effort. Then Congress promptly reinstated them as an emergency measure. (I have fond memories of Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, yelping: “Mohair is popular! I have a mohair sweater! It’s my favorite one!”) Special breaks for mohair were cemented back into agriculture policy under George Bush, even though Bush really did seem to want to do something about wasteful farm spending.All of which explains why presidents who run for office promising to cut the fat out of the budget wind up sighing and learning to live with goats on the dole.The farm bill is one big hairball of accommodations and trade-offs, and cheers to McCain for taking a principled stand against it. But unless he’s been serving on a U.S. Senate in an alternate universe, he knows that getting rid of even a small sliver of the unnecessary programs beloved by somebody’s constituents would be a Herculean challenge. It would be good to have a president willing to try. It would be scary to have one who builds his entire economic plan on the presumption that by 2013 he could wring “great reductions in government spending” that way.And if his domestic vision is that far removed from reality, what does that say about the goals-and-achievements stepladder to international peace and harmony via military interventions and a League of Democracies?Although if the costumes were neat enough. ...'"

"'08-05-18,'0','And so, as Qua-Daishia’s friends jumped rope down the street, as people sat on hard wooden chairs on the pavement or watched the street scene from rickety porches, the easy thing to see was what had gone hideously wrong. Harder to see was how to make it right.In the fire-damaged house next door, Ralph Johnson took a break from taking a chain saw to charred two-by-fours to speak for many of the others who hurried by rather than say something that could get them in trouble.“No, people aren’t going to talk,” he said. “It’s human nature. They’re afraid. Maybe if you live in an upper, upper neighborhood you might talk to the police, but here you see what happens and you keep to yourself. And think about it. You’re not the police. You don’t have a gun strapped on to protect yourself. It’s their job to solve crimes. I say let them do it.”The lure of reward money in hard times is producing increased tips to the police in some areas, but that doesn’t always extend to gang-infested neighborhoods where the adage that “snitches wear stitches” is often an understatement.That’s certainly true in Trenton, a place where gangs seem to be one of the few growth industries and where the price of cooperation and the price of silence have become a persistent quandary. So before there was Qua-Daishia Hopkins there was Tajahnique Lee, a 7-year-old girl caught in the middle of a gang shooting in 2006 near 20 witnesses who seemed not to have seen anything; she was seriously injured by a bullet to the face. There was Jeri-Lynn Dotson, a gang member who was shot twice in the head in front of her 2-year-old daughter after witnessing a kidnapping.Maybe Qua-Daishia’s death will make a difference. Andrew Bobbitt of a local community group, the Never Give Up Foundation, has called for a protest march on Wednesday from City Hall to Walnut Avenue that he hopes will bring out thousands of people to honor her memory and lead people to see there are more of them than there are of the gangs.“When you got a 10-year-old child killed, that touches a lot of people,” he said. “Yes, lots of people are scared, but we want to show people that they can come together from lots of different groups and really do something about it.”Last week the police were out in force on Walnut Avenue, a show that many appreciated and that others greeted with strings of expletives. The children jumping rope drew a crowd, and people paraded up and down the street to the liquor store and deli up the road.Mrs. Person, whose granddaughter used to play kickball and soccer with Qua-Daishia in the vacant lot next to her house, came by again, clutching a religious jigsaw puzzle depicting the Adoration that a friend had given her.“The kids are missing their friend,” she said. “They don’t know what death is; they want to know where she is, why it happened to her, and you don’t have too many answers. I say we can’t stop everything, but we can do our best to try. We can do our best to try.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','DETROIT — The auto industry’s longest strike in more than 40 years, a walkout at a parts supplier that disrupted production at 32 General Motors plants, will end within days if the picketing workers ratify a tentative agreement reached late Friday with their employer, American Axle and Manufacturing.Negotiators from the United Automobile Workers union and American Axle reached the deal on the 81st day of the strike, which began Feb. 26 when about 3,650 workers at five factories in Michigan and New York walked off the job.People involved in the negotiations have said they expect the agreement to call for closing two or three plants, offering buyouts worth as much as $140,000, and drastically reducing the wages and benefits of workers who remain with the company, in exchange for a $5,000 signing bonus for all workers. Neither side released any details after announcing the tentative settlement.“Going into this, everybody knew it was going to be ugly,” said Adrian King, the president of U.A.W. Local 235 in Detroit. “There’s going to be a lot of people that are going to be upset, but this is the best that we could get from this company at this time and keep jobs in America.”The picketing workers, most of whom earned about $28 an hour, have been receiving $200 a week in strike pay from the union. Union officials plan to start informing workers about the deal on Sunday in Detroit.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','By Wednesday, so many reporters had ignored the government’s instructions that the Propaganda Department rescinded its original order, replacing it with another, more realistic one, reflecting its temporary loss of control. “Reporters going to the disaster zone must move about with rescue teams,” it said, giving tacit, retroactive approval to freer coverage.One reporter from The Oriental Morning Post, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified because the workings of the propaganda system are often treated as state secrets, described the widespread defiance as “stepping beyond the boundaries collectively.”He described with pride the proliferation of articles that had suddenly appeared, adding, “clearly they were not just from Xinhua,” China’s official news agency, which under propaganda rules generally has a monopoly on firsthand reporting of major breaking news events.Another Shanghai reporter, who arrived early on the scene and also spoke on condition of anonymity, described his trepidation at having violated the censors’ orders. He initially asked his editors to keep his byline off his dispatch. “I was afraid they would track me down,” he said. “But then I found it was fine, not just me, a lot of reporters were actually doing the same thing. Everybody was free to move and free to write whatever they could.”China’s censors operate in secret. Their orders are issued verbally to senior editors at thousands of newspapers, Web sites and television outlets so that there is no written record of their mandates, editors say. The Propaganda Department does not have a public address or phone number and does not answer queries about its operations.A handful of publications consistently skirt the edges of censorship on delicate topics, like land disputes, environmental problems and corruption. But editors who regularly defy the letter or the spirit of propaganda guidance are punished, replaced or sometimes prosecuted.Coverage of major accidents, epidemic diseases and natural disasters has long been a source of contention. Editors and some officials have argued publicly that overly restrictive propaganda controls can result in deaths if people remain uninformed about risks.Even so, efforts have been made in recent years to restrict the leeway the news media have to report on major events viewed as having the potential to “disrupt social order,” reporters and editors say.When China’s worst railroad accident in a decade occurred last month, killing 72 people, propaganda officials jumped in quickly, barring reporters from all but the central government’s tightly controlled main news organs from providing original reporting. With few exceptions, Chinese newspapers limply complied.Similarly, during a prolonged storm that buried much of usually clement southern China in snow and ice last winter, the country’s news media were slow to pick up on the scale of the crisis and initially provided little aggressive reporting from swaths of the countryside that were essentially paralyzed.But there have been antecedents to last week’s blush of independent reporting. The clearest example of defiance in the face of clear orders from the Propaganda Department may have occurred during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Many Chinese news organizations, including the leading state television outlets, reported freely on those student demonstrations until they were crushed by Chinese troops and strict censorship was restored.If last week’s events and those of 1989 have little in common politically, they do share a deep and wide claim on people’s attentions and emotions throughout China. An editor with the Shanghai Media Group, a television company, conveyed the intensity of interest in earthquake news in terms of viewership, saying interest levels were too high to heed orders from above to discourage frontline reporting.“This is about China,” said Shi Hong, the coordinator of the network’s news program on the earthquake. “Our rating right now is at four. That’s not doubling the usual rate, it’s 400 percent of the norm. The executives have instructed us to go deep into the frontline and send back vivid images of Shanghai people participating in the damage relief up there.”For all of this aggressive reporting, nearly all of China’s news coverage has shied from exploring politically delicate questions related to the earthquake, such as the widespread collapse of school buildings, preferring to stick instead to the safer story lines of heroic rescues and human tragedy.“So many criticisms that one can see online have not been reflected in the mainstream media, such as why the air force was activated so late and why foreign rescue teams were not allowed in earlier,” said Li Datong, former editor of the weekly newspaper Freezing Point, who was removed for his outspokenness.Gu Zexu, a commentator in Guangzhou, who wrote a column in the newspaper Xin Kuai Bao urging the opening of the country to foreign aid teams, said there had been no real breakthrough by the Chinese media in the current crisis.“You still cannot have criticism in the opinion pages, but you can advise,” Mr. Gu said. “How you phrase things also matters. You touch upon something and leave it, or you must make circumlocutions.” The media have been faster and more efficient in this crisis than in many others, “but there has been no big difference in content,” he said.Indeed by midweek perhaps the most prominent story line had become a celebration of the prime minister, Wen Jiabao, who moved many Chinese with his shows of sympathy for the victims throughout the crisis, spending long hours traveling in the quake zone and listening to the stories of some of those who had been hardest hit.Although it has been consistently pro-government, the coverage of Mr. Wen may have broken new ground, when online messages from someone who seemed to be a news reporter covering the prime minister’s relief work made their way from the Internet into a newspaper, the Guangzhou Daily.Information about China’s leaders, including seemingly trivial details, is traditionally the most tightly controlled news of all. The Guangzhou Daily report said Mr. Wen had hurt himself in a fall and was bleeding, but refused medical assistance.“The premier is shouting into the phone,” the reporter’s account of a conversation between Mr. Wen and army generals said: “ ‘I don’t care how you do it. I just want those 100,000 people out of danger. That is an order.’ ”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','St. Joseph’s Coach Phil Martelli referred to the case of the former U.S.C. football player Reggie Bush, whose family was accused of accepting as much as $300,000 in cash and goods from a potential agent.“It’s shocking that the situations that occurred in football and basketball are just coming out right now,” Martelli said.Although the report about Mayo helped highlight a change in enforcement by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, delivered headlines and raised more questions about the U.S.C. athletic department, it was greeted with a shrug by many college basketball coaches.Illinois’s Weber recalled with a laugh that Glenn Robinson, then a Purdue star, once called from his dorm room in the early 1990s to say that an agent was outside his door and would not leave.Kevin Garnett opened the door for this generation of high school players to go straight to the N.B.A. in 1995, and agents soon entered the world of high school basketball.It became commonplace over the next decade for agents and runners to become involved with elite high school players. That led to agents’ sponsoring summer basketball teams. Then summer basketball coaches started becoming registered agents, and their clients, not surprisingly, were usually former players.In turn the recruitment of high-profile high school players often went through an agent, with the college coaches having to agree to keep the players shielded from competing agents while on campus.“In the high-level kids, that element is around them,” Notre Dame Coach Mike Brey said. “When I’m recruiting in one of those situations, I’m trying to figure out if it’s going to be clean. It’s part of the equation.”The N.C.A.A., in hopes of finding a solution, will assign three of its enforcement officers to work specifically in college basketball. To enable the officers to stay on the front lines, they will not have to follow the cases through the committee on infractions, said David Price, the vice president for enforcement.The group will be headed by LuAnn Humphrey, an N.C.A.A. veteran who spent part of last fall touring colleges and looking into accusations against Kelvin Sampson, the former Indiana coach, and William Wesley, a basketball power broker.Considering that agents have long been a problem, the N.C.A.A. enforcement staff is not exactly feared. The association has been unable to resolve the case against Bush for more than two years. Myles Brand, the N.C.A.A. president, was quick to say that the legal system had not yet ruled on Bush’s case either.Brand also played down the presence of agents in summer basketball.“One should not generalize that this is endemic of all basketball without evidence and proof,” he said. “We need to avoid rumor and myth and innuendo.”But veteran college coaches are more skeptical. The relationship among agents, runners and players is mutually beneficial, so there is little inducement to change.“There’s no question that people are getting closer to these kids at a younger age; that’s just the way it is,” Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. “But it’s hard to find that out. You can suspect whatever you want, but proving it is very difficult until someone comes out and blows the whistle because he got left out.”Part of the N.C.A.A.’s problem is that agents are not under its purview. That is the job of the National Basketball Players Association, which would not say whether it was investigating the role of Duffy’s agency in the Mayo case. There is little or no precedent for punishing agents because the union has a small staff that is not equipped for large-scale investigations.N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said Thursday that he had urged the union to look into two proposals that “we think would alleviate the problem, but never totally eliminate it.”The first would set 20 as the minimum age to enter the N.B.A. That would keep many players in college for two years. The second involves the union’s taking “a more aggressive role in the monitoring in the activities of agents,” Stern said.The players union is hesitant to set a minimum age for a few reasons, including its effect on the league’s salary structure for players older than 36.Boeheim and Brey said the N.B.A. could mimic baseball’s system, in which prospects can sign professional contracts straight out of high school. If they choose not to, however, they must spend three years in college or be at least 21 before re-entering the draft.Two years in college may be more realistic for basketball. But the N.B.A., which raised its minimum age two seasons ago to essentially force players to go to college, would probably not go along with that.Potential answers will be discussed through the summer recruiting period, but no solution is imminent.“From my perspective, there is no silver bullet to all this,” said Jim Haney, the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. “It’s all about ethics and character. You can’t legislate that.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','“I’m in a bind, I’m really in a bind,” she told the hot-line operator. “There’s a lot of stuff I know, but I didn’t open my mouth. If I weren’t in a bind, I wouldn’t open my mouth.”When she learned the money was not available, she said she would call back with the whereabouts of another suspect whom she had just seen “going down the road.”Elaine Cloyd, the president of Crime Stoppers U.S.A., a national organization of local tip programs, said that not all of the 323 programs in the country had reported an increase in calls, and that some, like those in Lafayette, La., and Broward County, Fla., attributed most of their spike to increased publicity or technological improvements like accepting tips by text message. But there was no doubt, Ms. Cloyd said, that the faltering economy was a significant factor.“When the economy gets rough, people have to be creative,” she said. “They might give a tip where they wouldn’t have in the past.”For tips that bring results, programs in most places pay $50 to $1,000, with some jurisdictions giving bonuses for help solving the most serious crimes, or an extra “gun bounty” if a weapon is recovered. In Sussex County, the average payment for a tip that results in an arrest is $400, Sergeant Beller said.“Usually you deliver the money in an unmarked car and meet them somewhere,” he said. “But these people come right to the office and walk right through the front door.”Some Crime Stoppers coordinators say their program appeals to community spirit and emphasize that not everyone who calls is after money. But their advertising makes no bones about the benefits of a good tip.“Crime doesn’t pay but we do,” say the mobile billboards cruising Jacksonville, Fla. A poster in Jackson, Tenn., draws a neat equation: “Ring Ring + Bling Bling = Cha-Ching.” The bling, in this case, is a pair of handcuffs.Some coordinators suggest that rising crime rates might be driving up the number of tips. But in Jackson, Tenn., Sgt. Mike Johnson said his call volume had gone from two or three a day to eight or nine. He theorized that rising crime there was not a factor because the program advertises steadily regardless of trends. “People just need money,” Sergeant Johnson said.Sergeant Johnson has been a Crime Stoppers coordinator for 15 years, watching crime rates and tips fluctuate. But, he said, “I’ve never seen an increase like it is now.”Crime Stoppers programs strictly protect the anonymity of callers. Each tip is assigned a number, and if the tip results in an arrest, the caller can collect a cash reward, usually by going to a designated bank. Some programs pay tipsters within hours of an arrest; others have monthly meetings to approve reward amounts.Not only have the number of tips increased, several program coordinators said, but people are also more diligent about calling back to find out if and when they can collect.Jim Cogan, director of the Silicon Valley Crime Stoppers program in California, said most of the rewards offered by his program used to go unclaimed. But with large numbers of foreclosures and heavy job losses, Mr. Cogan said, “now we’re seeing rewards get picked up right away and our tipsters being frustrated when tips aren’t available as quickly as they need the money.”Karen Keen, the tips coordinator for First Coast Crime Stoppers in Jacksonville, said she had, on occasion, been given approval to pay tipsters early, if they persuaded her that they needed the money to pay a light bill or some other necessity.Some people have made a cottage industry of calling in tips. Although repeat callers do not give their names, operators recognize their voices.“We have people out there that, realistically, this could be their job,” said Sgt. Zachary Self, who answers Crime Stoppers calls for the Macon Police Department.“Two or three arrests per week, you could make $700, $750 per week,” Sergeant Self said. “You could make better than a minimum-wage job.”He said that his program typically averaged 215 arrests per year, but that this year it had already hit 100, and he projected it would make more than 300, a record, by year’s end.In some cases, the quality of the tips is lagging as people grasp for any shred of information that might result in an arrest. A woman in Macon, for example, recently called to report that a family member — who was wanted for burglary and whose name and address were already known to the police — was at home. His home.Such a tip might seem worthless on its face, said Jean Davis, who took the call. But many police departments do not have the personnel to watch a suspect’s comings and going. In that case, the young man was arrested.Typically, the greatest number of calls comes in response to news coverage of a specific crime or a weekly list of wanted suspects. At other times, people call to report a crime the police might not even be aware of. Or, they might just call to report the whereabouts of someone with an old warrant. Warrant tips for minor crimes generate the lowest rewards, but that has not stopped people from turning in suspects.“We’re getting a lot more calls related to wanted persons,” said Sgt. Tommi Bridgeman, who coordinates the Beaufort County Crime Stoppers program. “People who know that these people have warrants out for their arrest are calling to turn them in.”Sergeant Bridgeman said her calls were up 25 percent even though the program’s one advertisement, a patrol car emblazoned with the hot-line number, was out of commission.“Folks around here need the money,” she said. “There’s not a lot of jobs here. We try to pay out every two weeks because we know they need the money.”Places with quick payments and particularly bleak economic conditions tended to report increases in call volume. Lee County, Fla., had the highest rate for home foreclosures in the United States in February and March, and its once-plentiful construction jobs have dried up.Last week, the Crime Stoppers coordinator there, Trish Routte, got a call from a man reporting drug activity, a tip that paid him $450. It was his second call in a week, said Ms. Routte, who recognized the caller’s voice.“He told me he really didn’t want to call but he just had a new grandbaby and he needed the money,” Ms. Routte said.Economic problems for families, Ms. Routte acknowledged, were good business for Crime Stoppers. “We’re kind of banking on that, really,” she said. “If it helps put dinner on the table for somebody, that’s wonderful.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','Sharapova said one of the problems is that players do not want to take any risks so close to a Grand Slam. If she were at the French Open instead of the Italian Open, Sharapova said, she would have tried to play.“Last year, I basically played without a shoulder, and I got to the semifinals,” she said. “In a Grand Slam, you do whatever it takes, whether that’s taking a few extra painkillers or whatever.”The second-seeded Sharapova had been scheduled to play Jelena Jankovic, the defending champion.Sharapova said she first felt the injury in the second set of her 6-7 (3), 7-5, 6-2 quarterfinal victory over Patty Schnyder, a match that ended near midnight Friday.“Last night, I had two and a half to three hours of treatment and it felt good, but when I woke up this morning it was really sore,” Sharapova said. “I took a little jog and it didn’t go well. It was really uncomfortable.”In Sunday’s final, Jankovic will meet either sixth-seeded Anna Chakvetadze or the French qualifier Alize Cornet, who were playing later on Saturday.Sharapova had a flight booked to Paris on Saturday.“I hope in two days I’ll be able to be on the court and be normal,” she said.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','A video of Mr. Azizuddin, taken in early March about a month after he was captured, and broadcast on an Arabic language television channel in Dubai in April, showed him in mountainous terrain surrounded by Pakistani Taliban militants with black turbans wrapped around their faces. They carried Kalishnikov rifles.In the video, Mr. Azizuddin, wearing a newly grown beard, appealed to the Pakistani government to meet the demands of his captors as soon as possible. He said that he had high blood pressure and a heart ailment.Mr. Azizuddin was traveling by car through the Khyber Agency tribal area on the main road toward the border with Afghanistan when he was kidnapped on Feb. 11. He was going to the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul with no escort vehicle, government officials said.In an interview with Dawn, an English-language television channel, Mr. Azizuddin said he had been grabbed from his car by 16 militants, carrying an arsenal of weapons, including a suicide bomber’s jacket.“They were all very angry, very violent, all in a hurry to put me in their vehicle,” he said. During his captivity, he was taken to three different places, all inside the tribal area of Pakistan, but was always surrounded by the same people, he said. His final holding place, according to government officials, was in South Waziristan, the area controlled by Mr. Mehsud.His Taliban captors referred to him as a “big fish” and told him they were making demands of the Pakistani government according to his status, he said. He added that he had been instructed “word for word” on what to say on the videotaped appeal.His release was part of the “larger game” of a peace deal between the government and the Pakistani Taliban, said Khalid Aziz, a former chief secretary of the North-West Frontier Province.The leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Mr. Mehsud, had succeeded in the negotiations to free dozens of his fighters, Mr. Aziz said. “He’s better placed than before,” Mr. Aziz said.But a senior Interior Ministry official, Rehman Malik, denied that Mr. Azizuddin’s release was part of any deal. “This is a total law enforcement action,” the official said.The pending agreement, which calls for the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army from parts of the tribal areas in exchange for the militants’ ending hostilities, has dismayed the Bush administration, which considers the deal too lenient toward militants.The militants will remain free to cross the border into Afghanistan, where they will launch attacks against NATO and United States troops, American officials say.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','The vice president’s visit was last Monday, the centerpiece of a get-out-the-vote rally in DeSoto County, a G.O.P. stronghold. “We’ll put our shoulders to the wheel for John McCain,” the vice president promised as he bestowed his benediction on Mr. Davis. Well, he got out the vote all right. In the election results the next day, the Childers total in DeSoto County increased 142 percent, while the Davis count went up only 47 percent.The district as a whole is the second whitest in Mississippi. (Its black population is 27.2 percent.) It’s the sole district Mr. Obama lost to Mrs. Clinton in the state’s Democratic primary in March. Yet even in this unlikely political terrain the combination of a race-based Republican campaign and the personal intervention of Mr. Cheney energized enough white moderates and black voters to flip the district to the Democrats. Keep in mind, it’s the Deep South we’re talking about here. Imagine how the lethal combination of the Bush-Cheney brand and backlash-inducing G.O.P. race-baiting could whip up a torrential turnout by young voters, black voters and independents in true swing states farther north and west.Just 36 hours after the Mississippi debacle, Mr. McCain tried to distance himself from the administration by flip-flopping on his signature issue, , suddenly endorsing just the kind of timetable for withdrawal he has characterized as “surrender” when proposed by Democrats or . (When Mr. McCain proposes it, he labels it “victory.”) But hardly had Mr. McCain spoken than his message was upstaged by Mr. Bush’s partisan political speech in . The president implied that Mr. Obama would have enabled the Nazis even more foolishly than his own grandfather, Prescott Bush, did in the 1930s when he maintained “investment relationships with ’s ,” as Kevin Phillips delicately describes it in “American Dynasty.”Mr. McCain’s Iraq stunt was his second effort in a week to flee Mr. Bush, following a speech bemoaning administration inaction on . These gambits were in turn preceded by Mr. McCain’s attack on the White House response to . Too bad he took this strong stand nearly three years after it might have sped relief to those suffering in .The McCain campaign is hoping that such showy, if tardy, departures from Bush-Cheney doctrine will constitute a galaxy of Sister Souljah moments, each with headlines reading “McCain Breaks With Bush on...” and the usual knee-jerk press references to Mr. McCain as a “maverick.” Enough of these, you see, and those much-needed independent voters might be flimflammed into believing that the G.O.P. candidate bears no responsibility for the administration’s toxically unpopular policies.You can’t blame him for trying. Independents favor Democrats over Republicans on most issues, according to the April New York Times/CBS News poll, including the economy (by 30 points), Iraq (by 13 points) and health care (48 points).But are independents suckers? They’d have to be to fall for the pitch that Mr. McCain is an apostate in his own party in 2008. He has been an outspoken Bush defender since helping him sell the Iraq war in 2002 and barnstorming for him in 2004. Despite Mr. McCain’s campaign claims to the contrary, he never publicly called for the firing of . He is still one of the president’s most stalwart supporters in Congress, even signing on to the president’s wildly unpopular veto of an expansion of children’s .Mr. McCain’s one major domestic policy rebellion, over the Bush tax cuts, has long since been ditched. Last Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” his economic surrogate, , implied that Mr. McCain would make budgetary ends meet by cutting earmarks — federal pork that, in her inflated estimate, amounted to $42 billion over the past two years. But even if he cut all $42 billion, total federal spending would still be reduced by only 0.78 percent.Hard as it is for Mr. McCain to run from the Bush policies he supports, it will be far harder to escape from Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney themselves. When Mr. McCain accepted Mr. Bush’s endorsement at the White House in March, he referred three times to the president’s “busy schedule,” as if wishing aloud that the lame-duck incumbent would have no time to appear at, say, get-out-the-vote rallies. Alas, Mr. Bush and company are not going gently into retirement.Just look at Mr. Rove. Some Democrats are outraged that he is now employed as a pundit by Newsweek and The as well as Fox News. Instead of complaining, they should be thrilled that Mr. Rove keeps inviting Republican complacency by constantly locating silver linings in the party’s bad news. His ubiquitous TV presence as a thinly veiled McCain surrogate has the added virtue of wrapping the Republican ticket in a daily and suffocating Bush bearhug, since Mr. Rove is far more synonymous with his former boss than Mr. Obama is with his former pastor.The Democrats can only hope that Mr. Rove will be a color commentator, so to speak, at the conventions. The parties’ weeklong infomercials are shaping up as quite a study in contrasts. For all the fears of a Democratic civil war, the planets may be aligning for a truce, and possibly a celebration. As fate has it, the nominee’s acceptance speech is scheduled for the night of Aug. 28, exactly 45 years after the Rev. Dr. electrified the nation with “I Have a Dream.”The next day brings another anniversary: Mr. McCain turns 72. And then, on Sept. 1, comes the virtually all-white G.O.P. vaudeville in . You’ll be pleased to know the show will go on despite the fact that the convention manager, chosen by the McCain campaign, had to resign last weekend after being exposed as the chief executive of a lobbying and consulting firm hired by the military junta in .The conventioneers will arrive via the airport whose men’s room was immortalized by a Republican senator still serving the good people of . This will be a most picturesque backdrop to the party’s eternal platform battles over family values, from same-sex marriage to .For good measure, antiwar demonstrators from within the G.O.P. — devotees — could provide at least a smidgen of the 1968-style disruptions the Democrats may avoid. In April, the Republican state convention abruptly adjourned in midsession after the Paul forces won rule changes. The Los Angeles Times reported last week that other Paul cadres, operating below the national press’s radar, have also been fighting guerrilla battles “at county and state conventions from and to and Mississippi.”Already one of the national convention’s de facto hosts — ’s endangered Senator — is frantically trying to save his seat by disowning his record as an Iraq war booster and disentangling himself from the president. Good luck! But how can Mr. McCain escape the dread specter of this White House at the convention? Surely Mr. Bush will exercise his prerogative to address the nation in prime time.Unless, of course, Labor Day week just happens to be the perfect moment for a second Bush daughter to tie the knot in Crawford.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','And China has taken a different reform path, in effect offering its people robust economic growth, with a degree of responsiveness when problems can be blamed on local officials, in exchange for continued one-party rule. Playing up the response to the earthquake, even as China restricts coverage of repression in Tibet, could prove a shrewd move, rather than one that cascades into instability.Still, it is worth recalling a time when a little openness flew out of control.As a correspondent and bureau chief for The New York Times in Moscow in the late 1980s, I had a ringside seat to observe the slow disintegration of the Soviet Union under Mr. Gorbachev. The collapse of the Soviet empire and dissolution of the Communist Party were not exactly what he had in mind when he took power in 1985 and launched his twin policies of glasnost (greater openness) and perestroika (political reform).As events unfolded, it was like watching a scientist start a nuclear chain reaction that races out of control, eventually consuming him and all those around him.Mr. Gorbachev realized his country was rotting from within, paralyzed by repression and ideological rigidity, a backward economy and a deep cynicism among Russians about their government. “We can’t go on living like this,” he told his wife, Raisa, hours before he was named Soviet leader, he recalled in his 1995 memoirs.But he clearly had no inkling of where his initiatives were headed when, shortly after taking office, he broke new ground for a Kremlin leader by mingling with citizens in Leningrad and giving unscripted interviews.In those early days of glasnost, it was hard to tell whether the changes were purely superficial or the start of something more profound.One day in late 1985, Allen Ginsberg, the American beat poet, unexpectedly turned up at the Moscow bureau of The Times, bearing a package from Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the Soviet poet. It was the text of a speech that Mr. Yevtushenko had given to the Writer’s Union.Serge Schmemann, my colleague, described it a few days later in a front-page story: “The session was a closed one, but even so the poet’s strong words against distortion of history, against censorship, self-flattery, silence and privilege in the world of letters were strikingly bold.”As glasnost gathered force in the years that followed, it ripped away the layers of deceit that were the foundation of the Soviet state. Each step undermined the authority of the party and the government.The explosion of a nuclear reactor at Chernobyl in April 1986 shattered the Kremlin’s credibility — and gave a powerful impetus to glasnost. The Kremlin, like the Burmese leaders after the cyclone, seemed paralyzed by the accident. The first government announcement — an innocuous 44 words — came more than a day after the reactor meltdown, and hours after Sweden detected alarming levels of radiation in its air, 800 miles north of Chernobyl.The glacial flow of information imperiled thousands of people living in the accident area. Mr. Gorbachev, embarrassed by the debacle, redoubled his efforts to make the government and party more transparent.The truth about Stalin’s brutality, and even Lenin’s, was exposed as a bright floodlight illuminated the hidden recesses of Soviet history. Newspapers and journals wrote honestly for the first time about government corruption and mismanagement. Artists, playwrights, filmmakers and writers looked unsparingly at the abuses of the Soviet system.“Children of the Arbat,” a long-suppressed, unvarnished novel about life under Stalin by Anatoly Rybakov, was the sensation of Moscow when it was published in 1987. “Repentance,” a bitingly satirical film about Stalinism, was freed from the censors the same year.Unflinching coverage of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in Ogonyok, a spirited magazine, gave Russians their first glimpse of a ruinous conflict that had previously been depicted by the Kremlin-controlled news media as a Soviet triumph. It was not long before opposition to the war began to grow.Last week, Svetlana Savranskaya recalled the electrifying days in 1987 and 1988 when the truth about Soviet history trumped the distortions that had long been taught at Moscow State University, where she was a student.But resistance to the accelerating change grew as the rivets that held together Soviet society started to snap. Ms. Savranskaya, now an analyst at the National Security Archive, a research institution at George Washington University, challenged the traditional history textbooks used at the Moscow high school where she taught history. She was soon forced to teach English instead.“Gorbachev thought he could control glasnost, and use it, but in the end, even he turned against it,” she said.The scale of opposition became clear in March 1988 when an obscure chemistry teacher named Nina Andreyeva attacked Mr. Gorbachev’s reform agenda in Sovetskaya Rossiya, a prominent newspaper. The attack, which filled a full page, and its timing — while Mr. Gorbachev was traveling in Yugoslavia — had the hallmarks of a Kremlin mugging.That was all but confirmed when several members of the ruling Politburo defended the article at a meeting convened when Mr. Gorbachev returned to Moscow.“A split was inevitable,” Mr. Gorbachev wrote in his memoirs about the Politburo gathering. “The question was, when?”A striking moment of glasnost came with the killer earthquake in Armenia in December 1988. Faced with the deaths of tens of thousands of Soviet citizens, and desperate for outside aid, the Kremlin lifted restrictions on travel to Armenia. Western reporters in Moscow were stunned to discover that they could just go to the airport and catch a flight to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, no advance government approval required. Foreign relief flights, including American military planes carrying food, water and medical supplies, were welcomed in Yerevan.As the old regime frayed, Mr. Gorbachev wasn’t prepared for the assault of long-repressed political forces let loose by his reforms. The most potent was nationalism, the fierce pride in nationhood that Stalin and his successors had tried to suffocate in places like Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia; Armenia and Georgia; and throughout Eastern Europe.Once uncorked, nationalism essentially overwhelmed Mr. Gorbachev, who, to his credit, choose not to try to hold together the Soviet empire by force.He was rewarded for his efforts with the clumsy but wrenching coup attempt in August 1991 that gravely weakened him and empowered Boris Yelstin, who had broken with Mr. Gorbachev in 1987. Within months, the Soviet Union dissolved and Mr. Gorbachev was out of work.Russia today, despite the restoration of authoritarian rule by Vladimir Putin, enjoys a degree of freedom that was inconceivable at the height of Communist rule. Glasnost helped make it that way.China’s leaders may not take comfort in that thought.As Mr. Matlock said last week, “If you remove the power of repressive state organs while stirring up a nation with many problems, you will get a process you can’t control.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','The parents of a 17-year-old girl who died in a fall while competing in the Olympic equestrian sport of eventing have sued the sport’s governing body, her former trainer and others in a California court, claiming that the death was caused in part because the course was made more dangerous to make it more “thrilling” to spectators.The lawsuit, filed May 6 in a Riverside County court, seeks an unspecified amount in damages over what it contends was the wrongful death of the girl, Mia Eriksson, who died in November 2006 after her horse fell at the Galway Downs Three-Day Event in Temecula, Calif.The lawsuit names the United States Equestrian Federation, the governing body, as well as the United States Eventing Association, which oversees competitions in this country.“Mia for the U.S.E.A. is a statistic, but she is really so much more than that,” said her mother, Karan Eriksson.“I stepped forward to file a lawsuit trying to voice in a way all of the concerns we’re feeling at the level of eventing to press for change.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','The report, issued in October, said that military recruiters and civilian brokers scour train stations, markets and other public places for boys and coerce them to volunteer. The new chaos of refugee camps offers particular opportunities for such brokers.“That’s a deep concern because unscrupulous recruiters will certainly take advantage of the situation,” said David Mathieson, an expert on Myanmar with Human Rights Watch.Already, news has circulated among aid groups of two brokers who were arrested as they tried to recruit children at a shelter, said Anne-Claire Dufay, the chief child protection officer for Unicef in Myanmar, formerly Burma.The school year starts in two weeks. But relief workers say that 85 percent of all schools are in ruins and that many of the teachers are gone. The destruction of schools illustrates the scale of the challenge in Myanmar: about 2,700 schools will have to be rebuilt, according to Unicef.In the shelters, many children must fend for themselves. “It’s survival of the fittest,” said Fred Bemak, a professor of counseling at George Mason University in Virginia, who was in Yangon training counselors when the cyclone hit.“Their schools are gone, their homes are gone, their parents are often dead or lost,” he said. “Many children are wandering around, separated from their families and communities, and they are highly vulnerable right now.”The youngest may not know their surnames, parents’ names or the names of their villages, Ms. Conradt said — and no system for reuniting families exists.“Our experience is when resources are very scarce and the relief operation is on, the unaccompanied children are the ones who pay the toll,” said Alex Kreuger, a child protection specialist with Unicef.Child protection workers are trying to offer some refuge by setting up what they call child-friendly spaces where children can mingle safely.“They get a bit of informal education and they play with each other and have fun,” said Laura Blank, a spokeswoman for World Vision, which is opening 37 centers in Yangon, the main city of Myanmar. “Through that process, we are bringing a little bit of joy into their lives.”Citing a United Nations estimate Friday, Unicef said that as many as 40 percent of those affected were children and that “there may be as many as one million children in urgent need of assistance.” Based on a different United Nations estimate of 1.6 million people who have been “severely affected,” World Vision estimated Wednesday that half a million children survived the cyclone and urgently needed help.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','Aerion’s 10-year business plan envisions sales of 300 of the new jets, which are designed to fly over oceans at Mach 1.6. (Mach 1 is the speed of sound, about 770 miles an hour.) The plane will fly at slightly under the speed of sound, at Mach 0.98, overland in the United States, where supersonic flight by civilian aircraft is prohibited because of the annoyance of sonic booms. (These thunderclap-like noises can be heard on the ground as a result of a high-altitude shock wave created when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound.)Elsewhere in the world, where regulations are more lax, the plane will fly overland at Mach 1.1, with a wing and airframe designed to alleviate sonic boom problems.“Our shock wave at 1.1 or 1.2 over land is imperceptible,” Mr. Barents said. “We’re going to obviously have to demonstrate that to the various authorities, but we expect to be allowed to fly supersonically over land masses.”A nonmilitary supersonic aircraft has not been in the skies since the Concorde, flown by British Airways and Air France, was retired in 2003, a victim of high operating costs and old technology that limited supersonic flight to trans-Atlantic routes.The 12-seat Aerion jet will be able to fly from New York to Tokyo in 9 ½ hours, including a one-hour refueling stop. That’s four to five hours faster than the speediest commercial airliner flying nonstop.But big hurdles remain. The biggest is that Aerion has not yet secured an air-frame manufacturer. The current state of the business-jet and commercial-airliner market means that manufacturers are working overtime to produce their own planes, and not actively looking for more work.But Mr. Barents said that by year-end, Aerion expects to announce a joint venture with various partners, including an air-frame manufacturer, to meet the 2014 delivery timetable.The Aerion jet is being marketed worldwide by the ExecuJet Aviation Group, a Swiss company, and in the Americas by Aero Toy Store, a big private-aircraft sales and service company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.Aero’s clients account for 12 of the existing Aerion orders, said C. Steven McMillan, Aero’s chairman. Mr. McMillan, a former chief executive of the Sara Lee Corporation, said that worldwide demand for big, long-haul business jets was leading the industry’s growth, but that there was a limit to what a subsonic business jet could do.“I WAS at Sara Lee for 30 years in various executive capacities, and in most of that time I had access to private aircraft” including long-haul jets, he said, adding: “Yet I flew the Concorde more than 75 times — just because if you’ve got to be in two meetings in a short period of time, each one on a different continent, you can do that efficiently only by flying supersonic.”Mr. McMillan describes himself as a firm believer in the global supersonic business jet market. Of Aerion, he said: “We’re pretty comfortable with what they’ve done. Actually, I think their analysis of the market potential might be a little light.”'"

"'08-05-18,'0','Consider the periodic surges in prices for computer memory hardware. Because its price is declining over the long run — a result of new technologies and automation — innovators tend to stay away from the field, leaving it to a few large, established companies.For decades, declining prices for food had the same chilling effect. In the United States and Europe — the world’s two biggest consumers of new technologies — food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive. Innovators turned their attention elsewhere.With higher food prices possibly here to stay, clever people can now try things that simply weren’t cost-effective before.“I don’t pay attention to inflation, but I do pay attention to big problems,” says Bill Gross, chairman of Idealab, the business incubator based in Pasadena, Calif. “If you can beat the price of the big gorilla in the marketplace, there’s big opportunity.”One clearly “big opportunity” lies in changing the relationship between food and energy. Fertilizer lets farmers raise production but is energy-intensive to make. Transporting food great distances also requires much energy. So does processing. Finally, some foods are now being valued in relation to oil because of their potential use in fuel.For some years now, innovators have trained their attention on alternative energy; they are now likely to concentrate on food production as well.For Americans, that would be going back to the future. Seventy years ago, farming was the technological high frontier.In the 1930s, after the Depression wiped out so many small farmers, the federal government introduced “price supports,” which lifted the return to farmers on basic crops. Higher prices got the attention of innovators in farm equipment, seeds and other so-called inputs.Sally Clarke, a historian at the University of Texas, has found in a study that higher prices enabled Midwest farmers, then reliant chiefly on animal-drawn plows, to justify investment in tractors, raising efficiency. A study in the 1950s by the economist Zvi Griliches of American farmers’ adoption of more productive varieties of corn showed how higher prices reduced the cost of adopting new technologies.For the new agricultural innovators, these are early days. It will take time for the pipeline to fill with ambitious projects. Monsanto and BASF are among the relatively few big companies that remain active in agricultural innovation. And the most creative researchers can’t immediately drop their other projects in response to price signals.Given time, priorities change. Tomorrow’s most intense technological battles will involve a range of agricultural topics, including these:Using water and fertilizer more efficiently, so farmers can grow more with less.Finding new ways to suppress weeds, whose growing resistance to traditional herbicides is raising the cost of farming.Designing better seeds, either through conventional means or genetic modification.Finding ways to meet the needs of the eat-local movement, promoted by the food writer Michael Pollan, among others, which requires innovative “small batch” processing techniques as well as a shift in values.“We need to pull out all the stops and do everything we can to improve farm productivity,” says William Dyer, a plant biologist at Montana State University in Bozeman.To be sure, engineering a new “green revolution” that will yield, say, cheaper wheat and rice — all while meeting the concerns of various special interest groups — will be much harder than designing a better music player. After all, we don’t eat iPods. The food fabricator of the 1960s television show “Star Trek” remains an elusive dream, but not merely because of limits on human ingenuity. In agriculture, safety requirements can trump the need for productivity gains.A new herbicide can cost $100 million to commercialize — less than the amount needed for a new drug, but more than for many a new cellphone. Government regulations, however, need only raise the cost of innovation, not halt it.Ultimately, higher food prices give innovators room to cover the cost of protecting human health. But prices are a democratic signal: when all innovators see them, their ability to sneak up on an opportunity, while others nap, vanishes.“The bigger the prize people are chasing, the more people go after it,” says Paul Romer, a theorist on sources of economic growth. “As people pile into an area, the expected return to any one innovator goes down.”Yet, fortunately, the return to society goes up.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','The shift represents a change in city policy: a de-emphasis of the intake center, and of large shelters, in favor of outreach teams that find homeless people, along with smaller “safe havens,” shelters with few barriers to entry.According to Robert Hess, the Homeless Services commissioner, the chronically homeless prefer the smaller havens. “They voted against the shelter system — that’s why they’re on the street,” he said. “They’ve had the opportunity to come into the shelter system each and every night, and they said, ‘No, the best place for me is on the streets.’ That’s a pretty strong statement.”Mr. Markee commended the outreach teams, but said he did not believe that they could replace a central intake center, a “front door” to the homeless services system, where people know they can go when they need help. Nearly 3,000 men new to the municipal shelter system walked into Bellevue this year, he said. The center serves about 40 people a day, according to a spokeswoman for the city’s homeless services. That figure rises significantly in colder weather.On Tuesday, some of the homeless men at the center of the storm, standing on the sidewalk near the shelter as mild day turned into chilly night, tried to make sense of it all.A few of the men staying in the shelter said that they had come straight from living on the streets. One said he had been displaced in a fire, another said he had lost his job and apartment because of a medical condition, and a third said he had a minimum-wage job delivering free newspapers, but did not earn enough to afford a single-room occupancy hotel. As he spoke, rats from a nearby construction site scurried along the curb.Some of the men had not heard about the city’s plans, and those who had reacted with cynicism. Ray Ramos, 58, predicted that more people would end up on the street or in crowded rooming houses, adding, “Politicians know this will happen.”“They don’t give a damn,” he said. “They’ll put you in a bird cage. All they want is the premises.”The shelter at Bedford-Atlantic has long had a reputation among the homeless for violence and drugs, according to Mr. Ramos and others. Some of the homeless men outside the Bellevue shelter said that they would rather sleep on the street than go there. But the man with the delivery job fidgeted with a cigarette, shrugged, and said people would go wherever there was shelter.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','Late last summer, the couple started to examine the market by researching the sales of similar apartments in the neighborhood, and they settled on Bellmarc Realty to represent them. “They always have prominent ads,” Mrs. Goldstein said, “and they have an office right around the corner.”The apartment was put on the market in mid-August for $819,000. Like most sellers, the Goldsteins decided to start with a price higher than they thought they might get to see what would happen. Still, the Goldsteins and their broker, Richard M. Silverman, felt justified because they thought previous sales in the building had been undervalued.The 16-story white-brick building, built in 1959, has a doorman, a parking garage, a laundry, a shared roof deck and a liberal pet policy. “Plus, we’re in a great area, close to transportation and Bloomingdale’s,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “Well, maybe a little too close to Bloomingdale’s,” she conceded, smiling at her husband.Mr. Silverman felt the apartment was in great shape and didn’t need any major renovations before being listed. The Goldsteins had painted and added crown molding when they bought it three years ago, and the previous owners had already renovated the kitchen.Other than cleaning and removing clutter, Mr. Silverman suggested adding a few more lamps to brighten the east-facing apartment during afternoon open houses.The open houses last fall were well attended, but the offers that came in were low, ranging from only $700,000 to $750,000.“We had a lot of players,” said Mr. Goldstein, a chiropractor and clinical nutritionist in private practice, referring to prospective buyers, but the couple held on.Finally, in January, with the news about the economy and the mortgage crisis unrelentingly bad, Mr. Silverman and the Goldsteins decided to reduce the price to $799,000.One couple who passed through the apartment early this year, Carol and Ira Fishman of Roslyn on Long Island, were shopping for a pied-à-terre. “We were very interested in that neighborhood, and we liked the space,” Ms. Fishman said. “I remember talking about opening up the kitchen.” Still, the couple opted to keep looking. “It was the first place we saw,” she said. “It would have been too impulsive.”Matthew Schiller and his fiancée, Laura Greenberg, stopped by in late January the weekend before the Super Bowl. The apartment became one of the couple’s three favorites.“We looked at it twice,” Mr. Schiller recalled, talking on his cellphone while he was on his way to a co-op board interview for another apartment.“It was a very nice unit,” he said of the Goldsteins’ apartment, “but we ended up going with a place nearby that was slightly more refurbished — it had newer appliances — and it was a little closer to the subway.”Another home seeker, Vivian Oliver, had been looking for several months. She had recently sold her three-story town house of 39 years in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, Brooklyn, where she and her late husband raised their two children. The price was $999,000.In January, she visited the Goldsteins’ apartment. Because she had already seen dozens of apartments, Ms. Oliver was in the habit of writing down comments on the handout sheets. “You start to mix them up in your head,” she explained.On the 56th Street handout, the Goldsteins’ apartment, she had noted, “Good space, great layout and great location.” It was the only property she had seen that “had no negative comments,” she said.She visited the apartment three more times, taking her son and daughter-in-law along once to hear their opinions. “I could really see myself walking out that building, going any place I wanted and coming back at night, never having a fear,” she said.In late February, the Goldsteins accepted her all-cash offer of $760,000 and signed a contract.“We were lucky she didn’t need a mortgage,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “We knew she would be approved by the board and we wouldn’t have the headache of going through the whole sell again.”Mr. Silverman said: “I would say we saw 300 to 400 prospects — most of them looking for a giveaway — and my sellers were looking for a fair price.”Incidentally, he said, the two dozen open houses were a personal record.“The Goldsteins’ No. 1 asset was tolerance galore,” Mr. Silverman said. “They were willing to wait it out. With that attitude, they had a big edge over most people.”Did all those Sunday afternoons away from home drive them crazy? “We made the best of it,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “We basically used those days to go to Long Island and visit family.” But Mr. Goldstein conceded, “Toward the end it was a bit of a pain.”The two of them think Manhattan homeowners shouldn’t be too forlorn about the current market. “I still think that apartments in Manhattan hold their value,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “It’s a little slower, but if you’re in a good building, in a good location, someone is going to want your apartment.”Reached by phone recently at her parents’ home in Syosset, Long Island, where the family is staying, Mrs. Goldstein said she and her husband had been house hunting in and around Port Washington, Syosset, Jericho and Plainview.“We’ve looked at a lot of places, but for the money we want to spend we’d have to settle,” she said. “Either the house is too small, or it’s on a main road.”But now, the Goldsteins are thinking about building a place.This, of course, would mean a longer layover at her parents’ home, but they’re up for it. “We’re lucky, because we all get along,” Mrs. Goldstein said. “My mother’s going to have a heart attack,” she joked, loud enough so her mother could hear her. “But so far it’s been good.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','THE Swinging Set Jazz Collaborative does a lot more than swing. It shifts. Performing in and around Peekskill, it might appear as a duo for one gig, a quartet for another, or a sextet for the next, with changing combinations of musicians.Christine A. Sotmary, a bass player who lives in Crompond, started the group about a year ago. Her goal was to gather enough musicians for players to spell one another based on availability. Its members, 10 men and 2 women, range in age from 39 to 72; all but one live in Westchester.Among the players are John DiGiulio, a drummer who tours with Little Anthony and the Imperials; Rick Kriska, a saxophonist who has played with the Four Tops and the Temptations; and Craig Purpura, a saxophonist and flutist who has played with Charles Mingus and Cecil Taylor. The group also includes music teachers in the Lakeland and Yorktown school districts, and Andy Polay, a drummer who can be spotted on his beat as a member of the Peekskill Police Department.Ms. Sotmary, 56, said the band books six to seven gigs a month, with regular evening performances at Tenampa in Croton-on-Hudson and Ruben’s Mexican Cafe in Peekskill. This week they will be at Ruben’s on Thursday and at the Division Street Grill, in Peekskill, on Saturday (from 7 to 10 on both nights).The band will also perform in Peekskill at the Jan Peek Square gazebo as part of the First Friday celebration on June 6, starting at 6:30 p.m., and during the 11th annual Open Studios weekend on June 7 and 8, from 3 to 4 p.m. An evening performance on June 8, from 6:30 to 9:30, will take place in the sculpture garden at Maxwell Fine Arts, 1204 Main Street.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','When she asked how he intended to deodorize his gear, Oliver began searching online for a solution. He came across a Canadian company, Esporta, that cleans bacteria and contaminants from sports equipment.That concept immediately washed over Oliver, who at the time was a senior vice president for a financial services company.“I thought it could be a fun business to get into, a way of staying close to my favorite sport,” said Oliver, 46. “My company was just being sold at that time, so I was looking to make a change.”Oliver, who was working in Lower Manhattan, had a close call on Sept. 11, 2001. That experience made him think about moving back near relatives in Wisconsin — he had grown up in Brookfield, his wife in Glendale.As Oliver began to think seriously about making a clean start, he could not stop thinking about the soot- and ash-covered firefighters at the World Trade Center site.“I thought about all the toxins their uniforms absorbed, and how unhealthy it was for them to be breathing all of that stuff in,” he said. “I started wondering if anyone out there was in the business of cleaning firefighting gear as well.”By October 2002, Oliver was in that business. He was living in Whitefish Bay, Wis., and had opened GearWash in Milwaukee. Though much of the operation is focused on cleaning the equipment of firefighters and other emergency service workers, Oliver has a steady load of hockey laundry to clean and mend. His clients include recreation, high school and college hockey teams from around the country, as well as the members of the Milwaukee Admirals, a minor league affiliate of the Nashville Predators, his favorite team.In recent years, Oliver has replaced the palms of gloves, stitched the sweaters, and washed the pads and socks of a number of Admirals who have gone on to play in the N.H.L, including Jordin Tootoo, Greg Zanon and Ryan Suter, all with Nashville, and Scott Upshall, now with the Philadelphia Flyers.“He has quite an amazing operation over there,” Dave Randolph, the Admirals’ equipment manager, said. “Half the time our players get stuff back so quickly and so professionally cleaned and mended, they have no idea it was ever missing or that anything was ever wrong with it.”In Oliver’s shop, a giant washing machine known as the extractor can tackle 300-pound loads of bulky hockey gear like shoulder, elbow and knee pads in pools of detergent. Oliver puts the equipment in mesh bags, then places them in eight compartments that rotate like a Ferris wheel.Three smaller washing machines are constantly at work, tossing and tumbling emergency service uniforms. Oliver’s shop also has a dozen sewing machines and a station for replacing hardware like suspender buttons, snaps and rivets.He has clients in 38 states, including New York, where hockey equipment once wrinkled his wife’s nose.“Andy’s gear has a new home,” Giesen said with a snicker. “It lives here, in the shop, and never, ever needs to come back home with us.”'"
"'08-05-18,'0','Not all of McCain’s fellow veterans subscribe to the theory that the singularity of his war experience has anything to do with his intransigence on Iraq. (Bob Kerrey, for one, told me that while he was aware of this argument, he has never believed it.) But some suspect that whatever lesson McCain took away from his time in Vietnam, it was not the one that stayed with his colleagues who were “in country” during those years — that some wars simply can’t be won on the battlefield, no matter how long you fight them, no matter how many soldiers you send there to die.“McCain is my friend and brother, and I love him dearly,” Max Cleland, Georgia’s former Democratic senator, told me when we talked last month. “But I think you learn something fighting on the ground, like me and John Kerry and Chuck Hagel did in Vietnam. This objective of ‘hearts and minds’? Well, hello! You didn’t know which heart and mind was going to blow you up!“I have seen this movie before, and I know how it ends,” says Cleland, who lost three of his limbs to an errant grenade during the battle of Khe Sanh. “With thousands dead and tens of thousands more injured, and years later you ask yourself what you were doing there. To the extent my friend John McCain signs on to this, he is endangering America’s long-term interests, and probably his own election in the fall.”If it is true that McCain’s Vietnam experience left him with a different attitude about foreign wars from the one held by those who were on the ground, then it certainly wasn’t apparent earlier in his political career. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, after he arrived in the Senate, McCain was, in fact, an outspoken opponent of American intervention in faraway lands — at least in cases where the country wasn’t willing to lose thousands of lives to achieve its aims. But during the post-cold-war 1990s, as America’s foreign-policy establishment struggled to define the nation’s obligations to the rest of the world, McCain went through his own kind of inner journey, seeking some balance between the legacy of Vietnam and the pull of new crises around the globe — crises born of savagery and rife with human consequence. That journey led him inexorably toward Iraq, where McCain’s resolve hardened to the point that now, as he prepares to run the climactic campaign of his life, he finds himself carrying the weight of another war, one that has divided the country and devastated his party. One way or the other, Iraq will determine this last phase of McCain’s political life, as surely as the war in Vietnam defined its beginning.WHEN CAPTAIN McCAIN returned home from Hanoi in 1973, a grateful Navy gave him and his fellow P.O.W.’s their choice of assignments. McCain rather audaciously chose one normally reserved for higher-ranking officers: study at the prestigious National War College. The war in Vietnam collapsed during the five-plus years of his imprisonment, and McCain needed to understand what happened. He absorbed the writings of military historians, most notably Bernard Fall, a veteran of the French resistance who was a sharp critic of the American military in Vietnam. Fall, who lived (and died) among American troops in Vietnam, didn’t quibble with America’s strategic decision to intervene in the country, but he did lambaste its tactics: hunting down guerrillas in search-and-destroy patrols, trying to draw the Vietcong into traditional military battles. Fall believed the Americans did not learn from the failure in Indochina of the French, who insisted on fighting a jungle insurgency as if it were the Second World War.In his book, Chuck Hagel writes of listening to declassified tapes from the mid-1960s in which Lyndon Johnson admitted to advisers that Vietnam probably couldn’t be won but rued that withdrawal would make him the first American president to lose a war. “I wish someone had told me when I was sitting on a burning tank in a Vietnamese rice paddy that I was fighting for a lost cause just to save a president’s legacy,” Hagel observes acidly. Although McCain was held and tortured for the same cause, he never saw the situation the way Hagel did. In his view, the American effort began to turn around with the promotion in 1968 of Gen. Creighton Abrams, who adopted the tactics favored by counterinsurgency experts like Fall. Abrams pulled back the search-and-destroy teams and instead focused on winning the “hearts and minds” of South Vietnamese villagers. His goal was to encourage the South Vietnamese military to take over their own defense — the process that came to be known as “Vietnamization.” McCain maintains that Abrams’s strategy was working, but it was undercut by the fact that, by that point, the American public had already rendered its verdict, and the drawdown of troops continued until the war’s chaotic end.The lesson McCain and other conservatives took away from this version of history is that America was driven from Vietnam principally because the voters, discouraged by dire reports from a skeptical media, lost their will. McCain has said in the past that he felt the war could have been won had the right strategy been followed sooner. When I met with McCain last month for a far-ranging conversation about Vietnam and Iraq, I asked him whether he still felt this was the case. “These are all hypotheticals,” he replied. “But I think that if we had employed the strategy that Creighton Abrams put into effect when he relieved General Westmoreland” — that is, if the Abrams strategy had been used years earlier — “then at least the casualties would have been dramatically different.”As a new congressman in 1983, among the first of his generation of vets to serve in Washington, McCain brought with him an attitude toward American intervention similar to what would later come to be known as the Powell Doctrine, for its author, Colin Powell: simply put, if you were going to use the American military to end a dispute or displace a foreign government, then you had to have the American public firmly on your side and you had to be prepared to use overwhelming force to achieve your aims. Late that year, when his party’s popular president, Ronald Reagan, proposed to extend the deployment of the Marines in Beirut, McCain was one of just 27 Republican representatives to object. The soldiers didn’t have a clear mission, McCain said, nor enough numbers to affect the outcome of the conflict. (Ultimately, 241 American servicemen died when a suicide bomber struck the Marine compound there, and American forces were withdrawn.)McCain strongly supported other operations, like the American-led invasion of tiny Grenada in 1983, as well as the first gulf war in 1991. But his first term in the Senate, which began in 1987, was marked mostly by extreme caution when it came to inserting American troops into foreign wars. As a newly arrived senator serving on the Armed Services Committee, McCain opposed Reagan’s plan to fly the American flag on Kuwaiti oil tankers that were coming under fire from Iranian forces in the Persian Gulf. In August 1992, when the Bush administration and its allies were trying to get humanitarian aid to Bosnians caught in a multiethnic civil war, McCain broke with the majority of Republicans and voted against a resolution that authorized “demonstrations of force” in the region; he called it recklessly provocative. After the ambush in Somalia that claimed the lives of 18 American soldiers in October 1993, a frustrated McCain introduced a resolution to bring the troops home immediately. Bob Dole, a staunch internationalist and then the Republican minority leader, persuaded other senators to defeat it.McCAIN’S CRITICS HAVE pointed to this early part of his political career to make the case that he later underwent a radical change in his philosophy, veering from a cautious approach to military force to a more hawkish, even bellicose mentality. His own aides, meanwhile, contend that McCain’s philosophy has been entirely constant; they say his opposition to limited and ill-defined operations like Somalia and Bosnia wasn’t at all inconsistent with his willingness, later, to use overwhelming force against a tyrant like Saddam Hussein.The problem with these narratives is that neither reflects the context of the time. As two former national security officials in the Clinton administration, Derek Chollet and James Goldgeier, explain compellingly in “America Between the Wars,” a book to be published next month, the period between the cold war and the war on terror — the 90s, roughly speaking — was a decade when foreign-policy thinkers across the ideological spectrum were groping about in darkness, trying to feel out the limits of American power and to balance the twin risks of action and inaction. During that time, the United States bounced from one unforeseen crisis to another, undertaking a military intervention every 18 months, on average — a staggering pace compared with that of the years that came before. Old ideological alliances in Washington were shattered and reformed, as pacifists lined up with conservative isolationists to battle liberal hawks and neoconservatives. New terms — “failed state,” “humanitarian intervention,” “ethnic cleansing” — entered the American lexicon. It’s fair to say, then, that McCain did evolve in his views on when and how to use American force over the course of the decade, but it’s misleading to separate his evolution from the larger transformation that was happening all around him.During the cold war, the guiding framework for military intervention was built around a pretty straightforward set of questions: were American forces needed to stop the expansion of Soviet ideology or territory, and if so, were the potential casualties worth the risk? When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, however, that framework disappeared almost overnight. Ecstatic policy makers slashed the size of the military and hoped for a “peace dividend.” In a famous article in 1989, Francis Fukuyama posited that we were witnessing “the end of history”; from that time forward, the theory went, mankind would drift inexorably away from totalitarianism toward individual freedom and democracy. Fukuyama didn’t actually advocate that the United States retreat from its assertive global role, but that’s what many in Washington — and especially conservatives — chose to hear. The long war was over, and America could now focus on defending its own borders, using technologies like missile defense, rather than sending its soldiers abroad to “police the world.”McCain explicitly rejected this idea, and yet he wasn’t eager to commit American troops to humanitarian missions that could easily turn into military nightmares like Somalia. For him, as for others, the defining dilemma of this new terrain was Bosnia. In July 1995, after years of debate in Washington about how to stop Serbian forces from wiping out the Bosnian Muslims, the Serbs overran the town of Srebrenica and, while Dutch peacekeepers stood by, mowed down thousands of Muslim boys and men. Coming not long after the mass killings in Rwanda, the slaughter in Srebrenica again brought the moral implications of inaction home to American politicians — especially those who, like McCain, previously opposed armed intervention.NATO responded with a series of airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs, which ultimately pushed the Serbian president, Slobodan Milosevic, to negotiate a settlement to the war. Clinton then urged Congress to approve the deployment of 20,000 American troops to help enforce the agreement. At the time, McCain was supporting the presidential campaign of his friend Phil Gramm, who was running against Dole in the Republican primaries. Gramm opposed the intervention, and he pleaded with McCain to stand by him; instead, this time, McCain decided to partner with Dole to ensure passage of the supporting resolution, stifling significant Republican opposition. It was a turning point, both for McCain and American consensus as a whole. “The Bosnian intervention was life-changing for a lot of people,” Bob Kerrey told me. “It caused even some liberals to go from opposing intervention to supporting it.”Throughout the late ’90s, McCain criticized what he called Clinton’s “feckless photo-op foreign policy,” but he also emerged as an important bulwark for the administration against Republicans who reflexively opposed Clinton’s every move as commander in chief. McCain strongly supported airstrikes against Sudan and Afghanistan, in retaliation for terrorist attacks on two American Embassies, and against Iraq, where Saddam Hussein was obstructing weapons inspectors. In 1999, McCain took the lead in supporting the bombing of Serbia to prevent another genocide in Kosovo. His tone had changed considerably since the days before Srebrenica. “Our interests and values converge clearly here,” McCain said in a speech from the Senate floor. “It seems clear to me that Milosevic knows no limits to his inhumanity and will keep slaughtering until even the most determined opponent of American involvement in this conflict is convinced to drop that opposition.”By the time McCain ran for president in 2000, he was the one arguing in debates for a more robust military presence in humanitarian crises, while George W. Bush forswore “nation building” and vowed a more “humble” foreign policy. During that campaign, McCain introduced the closest thing he had found to a doctrine for foreign intervention: the “rogue-state rollback,” under which he proposed arming and training internal forces that might ultimately overthrow menacing regimes in countries like Iraq, Iran and North Korea.McCain’s more ambitious view of American power made him a natural ally of neoconservative thinkers like William Kristol, the editor of the fledgling Weekly Standard (now a New York Times columnist), and Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Empowered during the Reagan era, the neocons were largely shoved aside during the ’90s by the more isolationist, anti-Clinton voices who dominated Republican politics. By the time McCain expanded his circle of influence to include Kristol and other neocons in the late ’90s, they had rallied around a single unifying cause: the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. In 1998, McCain was one of the sponsors of the Iraq Liberation Act, signed into law by Bill Clinton, which officially changed American policy from containing Hussein to deposing him, and he became a leading figure in the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, a lobbying group founded by Randy Scheunemann, who is now his chief foreign policy adviser. McCain met with Ahmad Chalabi, the smooth Iraqi dissident who was a favorite of the neocons, and supported him publicly.After the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the sudden elevation of Al Qaeda as a defining national security threat, McCain never had any doubt that Iraq, with its supposed capability to unleash or share weapons of mass destruction, posed an existential threat to the United States. Reading his statements from the time, there is no indication that he ever judged the invasion of Iraq by the standard he had used earlier in his career — whether it had the potential to become another Vietnam. Instead, as American troops swarmed Baghdad, McCain repeatedly compared Hussein to Adolf Hitler and predicted that the occupation of Iraq would be remembered in much the same way that history celebrated the liberation and rebuilding of Europe and Japan.I ARRANGED TO TALK with McCain during the last week of April, before a fund-raising event at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Tampa. When he strode, an hour late, into the conference room his campaign had reserved, his gait was rushed and purposeful and his manner decidedly businesslike. Having survived the sadism of the Vietcong and, more recently, skin cancer, McCain these days shows the wear of his 71 years. His face is more topographically interesting than it was when he first ran for president eight years ago, the skin folding into small craters and valleys as it runs into his neckline. His eyes look warier and less mischievous than they did back then. You can imagine, looking at him, how McCain spent much of these last few years: beseeching and indulging Republican power brokers, many of whom he does not like, all the while tolerating their lectures, bridling his infamous temper, keeping the irritation pent up. Perhaps repression exacts its cost.Sitting down at the end of a long granite table, he greeted me warmly, and then, before I could ask a question or even introduce the subject at hand, he dove headlong into a five-minute soliloquy. He told me that he had just driven in from the airport on Eisenhower Boulevard, and that Eisenhower was a man he very much admired, because Eisenhower understood the costs of war and strove to keep America out of it. He then made reference to a “rather hysterical” column by Fareed Zakaria in that morning’s Washington Post about McCain’s views on foreign policy. His voice was tight and measured.“I’ve seen other stories and I’ve seen comments about my national-security speech,” McCain said, referring to an address he gave in Los Angeles a few weeks earlier. “The story line is as follows: ‘McCain’s not the same McCain. He’s changed, and now he’s become a hawk, and he is dramatically different from what he was.’ ” He recited this narrative as if repeating the nonsensical words of dullards. “And anybody is free to write whatever they want and form whatever opinions they want to form. But facts are facts. And the fact is that I know war, and I know the tragedy of war. And no one hates war more than veterans.”From here, McCain went on to list for me some of the military actions he supported (Grenada, Panama) and some that he opposed (Beirut, Somalia). He had always followed the same set of values, he said, grounded in the premise that all people, not just Americans, were created equal and had inalienable rights. And when America could intervene militarily to further those values around the world without needless sacrifice in lives and money, he was all for it, and where we couldn’t, he was not, and there was nothing extreme about that.“As far as people who advise me,” McCain went on, though I still hadn’t asked a question, “probably one of my most trusted advisers for the last 30 years is Henry Kissinger, not known as a hawk or a neocon.” McCain infused the word with sarcasm. “I also remember the days when Ronald Reagan was portrayed as a hawk and a neocon. I remember the near hysteria in response to his ‘tear down this wall.’ I remember the ‘Oh, you can’t do that, when you call the Soviets an evil empire.’ I remember all those things. Same people who are now saying — ” He stopped himself midsentence, then began again. “I’m always open to new ideas and new thoughts, but my principles were grounded many years ago in places like the National War College and other places where I have learned and studied and talked to people I admire and respect.“So,” McCain said finally, “with that preface, I’d be glad to answer any questions you might have, and again, it’s always good to be with you.”It’s rare to see a presidential candidate vent in quite this way, but clearly some of the criticism over his policies on Iraq and foreign policy in general — mild criticism, to this point — had wounded McCain. When he looks in the mirror, he does not see a reckless or belligerent leader, and yet that was the man his detractors claimed to see. A few weeks earlier, the liberal radio host Ed Schultz made headlines by calling McCain a “warmonger” and then happily repeating the charge on CNN. As McCain and I talked, the Democratic National Committee had begun broadcasting an ad that repeatedly showed him saying at a New Hampshire campaign event that he would be fine with keeping American troops in Iraq for 100 years. The quote had been ripped out of context — he went on to say that such a troop presence would be possible only without casualties, in the same way that American soldiers had remained quietly for decades in South Korea and Europe — but it had already become a staple of Democratic attacks, and McCain could expect to see it about half a million more times before November.McCain’s major Los Angeles address seemed to have been written in part to reverse this perception. The speech began with McCain’s hatred of war, then moved on to stress his commitment to multilateralism and to ending global warming. McCain called, again, for a “League of Democracies” to foster cooperation among free nations. Only in the final minutes did he get around to even mentioning Iraq. Clearly, the campaign was starting to worry about McCain being Reaganized in this way — that is, of having the fall campaign become a referendum on whether he was stable and rational enough to be trusted with the nation’s nuclear codes.McCain described himself, in that speech and in his preamble to our interview, as a “realistic idealist” — a phrase meant to bridge a divide inside his party. While there haven’t really been neat camps into which you can divide Republicans in the post-cold-war era, some rough labels did emerge throughout the ’90s. On one extreme were the isolationists, led most noisily by Pat Buchanan, who essentially believed that the end of the cold war should also have meant the end of America’s military involvement in distant lands. In the middle were the group known as realists, who were willing to use force, but only where the country’s vital strategic interests were at stake and where an international consensus could be forged. The realists identified with leaders like Kissinger and James Baker, the former secretary of state, who famously declared of Bosnia, “We do not have a dog in that fight.” And then, on the other end of the spectrum, you had the idealists, including most of those known as neocons. The idealists believed that American force could and should be used to promote American values abroad, whether or not the countries involved posed an immediate danger to national security and whether or not the rest of the world agreed.McCain has never been confused for an isolationist, but neither can he be confined to either of the other factions. One reason is temperamental; McCain just doesn’t like labels, and he isn’t very good at sticking to orthodoxies — a personality quirk he has tried hard to control during the campaign. “He’s not a guy who drinks Kool-Aid easily,” says Gary Hart, the former Democratic senator who was once close enough to McCain to have been a groomsman in his wedding. “He’s suspicious of any group who sees the world that simply.” Lorne Craner, a foreign-policy thinker who worked for McCain in the House and Senate in the 1980s, told me that McCain had a standing rule in his office then. All meetings were to be limited to half an hour, unless they were with either of two advisers: Jeane Kirkpatrick, the Reaganite idealist, or Brent Scowcroft, the former general who was a leader in the realist wing. McCain loved to hear from both of them at length.It’s clear, though, that on the continuum that separates realists from idealists, McCain sits much closer to the idealist perspective. McCain has long been chairman of the International Republican Institute, run by Craner, which exists to promote democratic reforms in closed societies. He makes a point of meeting with dissidents when he visits countries like Georgia and Uzbekistan and has championed the cause of Aung San Suu Kyi, the imprisoned leader of the Burmese resistance. Most important, as he made clear in his preamble to our interview, McCain considers national values, and not strategic interests, to be the guiding force in foreign policy. America exists, in McCain’s view, not simply to safeguard the prosperity and safety of those who live in it but also to spread democratic values and human rights to other parts of the planet.McCain argues that his brand of idealism is actually more pragmatic in a post-9/11 world than the hard realism of the cold war. He rejects as outdated, for instance, a basic proposition of cold-war realists like Kissinger and Baker: that stability is always found in the relationship between states. Realists have long presumed that the country’s security is defined by the stability of its alliances with the governments of other countries, even if those governments are odious; by this thinking, your interests can sometimes be served by befriending leaders who share none of your democratic values. McCain, by contrast, maintains that in a world where oppressive governments can produce fertile ground for rogue groups like Al Qaeda to recruit and prosper, forging bonds with tyrannical regimes is often more likely to harm American interests than to help them.As we spoke in Tampa, I asked McCain if it was true, as his friend Joe Lieberman and others suggested to me, that he had been brought to a more idealist way of thinking partly by the genocides in Rwanda and Srebrenica. “I think so, I think so,” he said, nodding. “And Darfur today. I feel strongly about Darfur, and yet, and this is where the realist side comes in, how do we effectively stop the genocide in Darfur?” He seemed to be genuinely wrestling with the question. “You know the complications with a place that’s bigger, I guess, than the size of Texas, and it’s hard to know who the Janjaweed is, who are the killers, who are the victims. It’s all jumbled up.“So I’ve always tried to make a case for the realist side,” he continued. “And I think it was pretty clear that in Kosovo, we could probably benefit the situation fairly effectively and fairly quickly. And yet I look at Darfur, and I still look at Rwanda, to some degree, and think, How could we have gone in there and stopped that slaughter?”McCain is known for being a gut thinker, averse to overarching doctrines or theory. But as we talked, I tried to draw out of him some template for knowing when military intervention made sense — an answer, essentially, to the question that has plagued policy makers confronting international crises for the last 20 years. McCain has said that the invasion of Iraq was justified, even absent the weapons of mass destruction he believed were there, because of Hussein’s affront to basic human values. Why then, I asked McCain, shouldn’t we go into Zimbabwe, where, according to that morning’s paper, allies of the despotic president, Robert Mugabe, were rounding up his political opponents and preparing to subvert the results of the country’s recent national election? How about sending soldiers into Myanmar, formerly Burma, where Aung San Suu Kyi remained under house arrest by a military junta?“I think in the case of Zimbabwe, it’s because of our history in Africa,” McCain said thoughtfully. “Not so much the United States but the Europeans, the colonialist history in Africa. The government of South Africa has obviously not been effective, to say the least, in trying to affect the situation in Zimbabwe, and one reason is that they don’t want to be tarred with the brush of modern colonialism. So that’s a problem I think we will continue to have on the continent of Africa. If you send in Western military forces, then you risk the backlash from the people, from the legacy that was left in Africa because of the era of colonialism.”The United States faced a similar obstacle in Myanmar, McCain went on, shaking his head sadly. “First of all, you’d have to gauge the opinion of the people over time, whether you’d be greeted as liberators or as occupiers,” McCain said. “I would be concerned about the possibility that if it were mishandled, we might see an insurgent movement.” He talked a bit about Aung San Suu Kyi, whom he called “one of the great figures of the 20th century,” but then wondered aloud if the American public would support a military intervention.“It goes back to the Vietnam thing,” McCain told me. “I’m just not sure the American people would support a military engagement in Burma, no matter how justified the cause. And I can’t tell you exactly when it would be over. And I can’t tell you exactly what the reaction of the people there would be.”Most American politicians, of course, would immediately dismiss the idea of sending the military into Zimbabwe or Myanmar as tangential to American interests and therefore impossible to justify. McCain didn’t make this argument. He seemed to start from a default position that moral reasons alone could justify the use of American force, and from there he considered the reasons it might not be feasible to do so. In other words, to paraphrase Robert Kennedy, while most politicians looked at injustice in a foreign land and asked, “Why intervene?” McCain seemed to look at that same injustice and ask himself, “Why not?”“I think we’ve learned some lessons,” McCain told me. “One is that the American people have to be willing to support it. But two, we need to work more in an international way to try to beneficially affect the situation. And you have to convince America and the world that every single avenue has been exhausted before we go in militarily. And we better think not a day later or a week later, but a year and 5 years and 10 years later. Because the attention span, unfortunately, of the American people, although pretty remarkable in some ways, is not inexhaustible.”WHAT WAS STARTLING about this conversation was that, while McCain was talking about the dangers of intervening in a Zimbabwe or a Burma, he might just as well have been talking about the invasion of Iraq. Didn’t that country, too, have a colonial history that had been carelessly considered, to say the least? Didn’t the war’s proponents fail to plan more than a few weeks out or to ask the hard questions about how their soldiers might be greeted in the streets?“Yes, I agree with you,” McCain said, nodding again, when I put this question to him directly. “It was one of the penalties that we paid. But remember, the major reason to go into Iraq were the weapons of mass destruction. That was the conventional wisdom at the time, not only held by the United States but certainly many other nations.”This was, of course, an arguable point, and that argument, with the benefit of hindsight, will probably continue to rage in Washington and in political-science departments around the country for decades. But the invasion of Iraq is now five years past, and the question at the heart of the 2008 campaign — or one of them, anyway — is bound to revolve around a more current dilemma. Why, given all the lessons of military intervention that McCain himself had just laid out, does he think it still makes sense to stay? Having bemoaned the impact of Vietnam on the nation, why is McCain — alone among the veterans of that war in the Senate — determined to settle in for another long and costly counterinsurgency?The parallels between Vietnam and Iraq can be too readily overstated. The very nature of the wars is markedly different, for better or worse; Vietnam was a Communist uprising against an autocratic government, while Iraq represents a multiparty, ethnic conflict more similar to that of the Balkans. The casualties, to this point, aren’t nearly analogous, either. The United States lost some 58,000 soldiers in Vietnam, compared with a death toll, after five years in Iraq, of about 4,000.Still, in this current conflict there are echoes of Vietnam that have grown too loud to easily ignore. Both conflicts were entered into under pretenses that were later widely discredited. Reports from the front in Iraq depict American soldiers who find it difficult to discern friends from enemies as they try to navigate an unfamiliar culture, language and landscape. American leaders are talking yet again about transferring responsibility for the war to local forces and the police, but Iraqization doesn’t seem to be faring a whole lot better than Vietnamization did; last month, some 1,000 Iraqi troops deserted during a crucial battle in Basra. Veterans return from their tours with missing limbs and deep psychological trauma. Pro-war officials frame the conflict as a central front in a longer struggle against an evil ideology, and they warn ominously of the proliferation of terrorist cells that will ensue if the insurgents aren’t defeated in Iraq, just as the architects of Vietnam once promised a lethal fall of dominoes throughout Southeast Asia.Like the war planners themselves, McCain made some assumptions before the invasion that turned out to be seriously flawed. He spoke in favor of the de-Baathification of the Iraqi government and military, a decision now widely considered to have been a disaster, and he predicted that American soldiers would be hailed as conquering heroes in Baghdad. But to his credit, he was also the first of the Iraq hawks to sound the alarm on the flailing occupation, singling out Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld for stinging criticism. After visiting Baghdad and Basra in the summer of 2003, McCain labeled Rumsfeld’s military strategy a failure and began a long and lonely crusade for an influx of new troops to secure the capital and outlying areas — the tactic that came to be known as “the surge” when the president finally changed course three and a half years later and ordered another 20,000 troops into the theater.The surge is unpopular with a lot of military leaders, mainly because of what they call “strategic stretch” — the resulting shortage of troops available to fight unforeseen conflicts in other parts of the globe. (There are now about 160,000 American troops tied down in Iraq, and those troops are already facing both extended tours and shorter intervals in between redeployments.) Some of the Pentagon’s top commanders — most recently Richard Cody, the vice chief of staff of the Army, who testified before Congress last month — have voiced concern about the military’s overall readiness at a time when the troop level in Afghanistan may soon reach 40,000 and when leading politicians, McCain prominently among them, have vowed to use military action if necessary to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weaponry. McCain maintains that the military can increase its ranks by offering cash and other incentives to recruits, but it has already significantly lowered its recruiting standards and may not be able to stoop much lower. As Gen. James Jones, the former NATO commander and a close friend of McCain’s, told me, “You can buy the numbers of troops, but you may not be able to buy the quality you need.”Even so, McCain insists that the surge and the Pentagon’s new counterinsurgency strategy, which centers on a “hearts and minds” approach, can ultimately drive out insurgents and reduce American casualties in Iraq to virtually nothing. “Is it long and hard and tough? Yes,” McCain told me. “Has Al Qaeda been beaten? No, but they certainly have been diminished.” (To the dismay of many of his critics, McCain often uses “Al Qaeda” as a shorthand for the Iraqi insurgent group that calls itself Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.) “And it’s obviously not just Al Qaeda,” he went on. “It’s Shiite militias. It’s former Baathists who are still unhappy. It’s corruption within the police that we have to worry about.“All I can say is, the surge is succeeding,” he said. “If someone wants to disagree with that, they’re free to, but I have statistics — whether they be instances of violence, whether it be U.S. casualties, whatever it may be — that prove that this new tactic is succeeding. So I’m willing to stick with it.”A LOT OF McCAIN’S fellow veterans in Washington seem confounded by what they see as his obvious failure to absorb the lessons of Vietnam. Jack Murtha, the Pennsylvania congressman and decorated Vietnam vet who became an early and outspoken critic of the war, told me that watching Iraq unfold convinced him, for the first time, that American troops could never have prevailed in Vietnam, no matter how long they stayed. “These kinds of wars cannot be won militarily,” he said flatly. Another Democratic congressman with a Purple Heart, Mike Thompson of California, told me that promises of victory in Iraq sounded painfully familiar. “When I was in Vietnam, the members of Congress knew that we weren’t going to be there forever, that we would have to redeploy, and in the time between when they knew that and when we redeployed, a lot of boys were injured and killed,” Thompson said. “I think Senator McCain has been an outstanding public servant, but I think he’s wrong on this.”In McCain’s mind, however, there is a different kind of symmetry linking Vietnam and Iraq. Talking to him about it, you come to understand that he has, indeed, applied lessons from the first war to the second — but they are the lessons that he learned not in combat or in the Hanoi Hilton but in the pages of the books he read at the National War College in the 1970s. To McCain, the first four years of the Iraq war, as prosecuted by the Bush administration, seem strikingly similar to the years in Vietnam before Creighton Abrams arrived on the scene.“It’s a little bit eerily reminiscent, in that search-and-destroy is basically the same tactic that Rumsfeld, Casey, Sanchez, et al. employed,” McCain told me, referring to George Casey and Ricardo Sanchez, the two previous generals to command coalition forces in Iraq. “Go out, kill bad people and then go back to base. That’s basically what search-and-destroy was. We obviously failed to learn that lesson in history.” In McCain’s war, then, David Petraeus, the more innovative general who took over in 2007, is now playing the part of Abrams, pursuing a winning strategy that needs only the patience of the American people and their government to ultimately succeed.“After nearly four years of a failed strategy, the difference in one year is dramatic,” McCain says. “If they make that same progress in the next year,” he predicts, “I think it’s going to be quite impactful on American public opinion, as well as, more importantly, events on the ground.”The lesson McCain drew from Vietnam all those years ago is that you cannot turn your back on a war when at last you figure out how to win it, and he is determined not to let that happen again. Far from having failed to internalize the legacy of Vietnam, as some of his friends in the Senate suspect, he is, if anything, entirely driven by it. “I don’t think you can isolate John’s views in Iraq from his experience in Vietnam,” Gary Hart told me. “Whether he is aware of it or not — and I want to tread carefully here, because I don’t like psychologizing people — I don’t think he can separate those things in his mind. In a way, John is refighting the Vietnam War.”JOHN McCAIN HAS NEVER been very good at political artifice. Like every politician I’ve known, McCain will sometimes surrender to the cheap ploy or prevarication when the moment demands it, but it is often with a smirk or a wince, some hard-to-miss signal that he knows he’s up to no good. In the more serious instances when he knows he has put expedience over principle (his reversal on the Bush tax cuts just in time for the campaign season may well turn out to be one of them), he has an almost therapeutic need to acknowledge it later, as he did when he told South Carolinians, weeks after losing the brutal primary there in 2000, that he had been wrong to defend the Confederate flag just to win their votes. And so, whether you agree with him or not, there is a notable honesty to his position on the war in Iraq. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have spent the primary season competing over who’s more eager to ship out of Iraq, but everyone associated with their campaigns knows that withdrawal will not happen quickly or without peril. McCain’s pitch, on the other hand, is as straightforward as it is stripped of political charm. We made a mess in Iraq, he says, but it’s our mess now, and we have to stay on and fix it.Ultimately, McCain is relying on the same strategy to achieve success both in Iraq and in the November election. In each endeavor, McCain is staking everything on the notion that the public, having seen the success of a new military strategy, can be convinced that the war is, in fact, winnable and worth the continued sacrifice. Absent that national retrenching, McCain admits that this war, like the one in Vietnam, is probably doomed. Near the end of our conversation in Tampa, I asked him if he would be willing to change course on Iraq if the violence there started to rise again. “Oh, we’d have to,” he replied. “It’s not so much what McCain would do. American public opinion will not tolerate such a thing.”The problem is that there’s actually no evidence to suggest that a reduction in casualties in Iraq will translate into a greater public tolerance for a protracted engagement there. According to Gallup, Americans’ confidence that the surge is improving the situation on the ground rose sharply between last summer and this spring; 40 percent of those polled in March said the surge is working, compared with 22 percent last July, while 38 percent said it was making no difference, down from 51 percent last year. For McCain, that’s no small measure of vindication. And yet, during the same period, even as optimism about the new strategy grew, the percentage of Americans who say they want a timetable for gradual withdrawal — those, in other words, who agreed primarily with the two Democratic candidates — remained almost exactly the same, rising to 41 percent from 39 percent. (Another 18 percent have consistently said they want to get out right away.) Nor has the success of the surge in reducing American casualties done a thing to convince the public that the invasion made sense in the first place. According to another Gallup poll released a few weeks ago, 63 percent of Americans now believe it was a mistake to go to war — an all-time high.It doesn’t help that McCain has never put his argument for staying into some larger context that might explain what he really means by “winning” the war in Iraq. If you ask him to define victory, his answer is that Americans soldiers will have stopped dying, and that the Iraqi military and government will be functioning on their own. That would be a great day, no doubt, but surely the overarching purpose of a war can’t be to stop more soldiers from dying in it. (On the one notable occasion when McCain tried to put a more hopeful spin on progress in Iraq, during a visit there last spring, the result was an unqualified public-relations debacle: strolling through an outdoor market in Baghdad market wearing a flak jacket and surrounded by what seemed liked a regiment of U.S. soldiers, McCain declared that life for Iraqis was at last returning to normal. The next day, by some accounts, 21 Shiite workers at the market were abducted and killed.) McCain’s main reason for continuing on in Iraq seems to be that we’re already there and must not accept defeat, and that’s an argument that probably feels all too familiar to many Americans who lived through a decade of aimless war in Vietnam, to no discernible end.Undaunted, McCain soldiers on toward November and what could be his final campaign. When he ran in 2000, his philosophy of national greatness — the importance, as he always puts it, of “serving a cause greater than one’s self” — found its expression in ideas like national service and campaign reform, proposals that independents and even many liberals could embrace. For a time then, McCain, adrift within his own party, was almost certainly the most popular politician in America. This time, his theme of selflessness is bound up, irrevocably, with Bush’s unpopular war. Democrats, alarmed over their own disunity, can hardly wait to start pummeling McCain with Iraq. While I was working on this article, the Center for American Progress, the left’s leading policy center in Washington, took the liberty of sending over a 10-page litany of McCain’s selected comments on Iraq since 2002, delineated by helpful subheadings like “The War Begins — Rosy Outlook” and “The Critical Time Is Always Right Around the Corner.”McCain shrugs this off and insists that he will never waver from his support of the war, no matter what the personal cost. “As I said a year ago,” he told me, “I would rather lose a campaign than a war.” If he doesn’t make the most persuasive argument of his life, he risks losing both.'"
"'08-05-18,'0','When in Rome, why not eat as the Romans (really) do? One of the surest ways to get off the tourist grid is to read local guidebooks. Never mind if you don’t speak their language — a handful of guides to Italy and France have symbols, numerical ratings and pictures that will steer you toward your next discovery. “Osterie d’Italia,” from Slow Food Italy, recommends restaurants, organized geographically, with a snail icon to indicate that they follow Slow Food principles. If you like nonna-in-the-cucina places, it’s worth the weight. Another Italian bible, “Ristoranti d’Italia del Gambero Rosso,” groups restaurants, trattorias and wine bars regionally. A numerical score is based on a 100-point scale, and a meter indicates value for your money. But the most important symbols are the forks (for restaurants) and shrimps (for wine bars): if you see a place with three, go. In France, “Carnet de Route Omnivore” is for anyone serious about 21st-century French cuisine. The annual book lists 200 experimental restaurants and highlights the best dish at each (under the heading “Le Plat qui Change Tout”). Accompanying recommendations of nearby hotels are a bonus. The same publisher also recently released “Carnet de Vigne Omnivore,” a guide to 200 small, artisanal vineyards, with handy regional maps. And for architecture, art and history lovers, there’s “Ouverts au Public: Le Guide du Patrimoine en France,” which provides visiting information, photos and maps for more than 2,500 state-protected monuments.

"'08-05-18,'0','Denmark may never completely escape the shadow of Arne Jacobsen’s Egg chair, but at street level in Copenhagen today, where the creative energy flows no less freely than it did 50 years ago, young artistic types are hardly hooked on the classics.The city has evolved into an exciting scramble of ideas about everything from furniture to food. “The funny thing about Copenhagen is that everyone sort of knows each other,” says the graphic designer Anders Arhoj. “You bump into your friends, who introduce you to their friends, and suddenly you find yourself at 2 in the morning at some disco planning a project with aguy you met two hours earlier.” Such is the collaborative spirit here — among people who weren’t yet born when Jacobsen died in 1971 — that being creative in Copenhagen means having a hand in art, design, music and cuisine, all at the same time. “When an architect talks to a musician, or when a carpenter joins a project with a graphic designer,” Arhoj says, “they respect each other from the start and have no prejudgments about disciplines — all that stuff that often seems to hinder collaborations.” BY STEPHEN WHITLOCKHAY: Copenhagen is easily one of Europe’s best cities for interior design shops.

"'08-05-18,'0','In coastal Kerala, spices have been trafficked since the Romans rode in on the winds of the monsoons seeking cardamom and pepper: black gold. Women wear their saris differently here than they do up north, draping them like togas. And when the first monsoon blows in from the Arabian Sea — and it always seems to arrive during the first week of June, extinguishing the scorching rays of the summer sun and ushering in a joyful verdant renewal — the modest women of Kerala rush out into the rain, “and the saris cling close to the body. Very érotique,” says Ellena.Bollywood films often feature bosomy romantics carelessly cavorting through such torrential downpours in scenes designed to thwart the censors. For this same reason, Muslim boys are not allowed out of the house during the first week of the monsoon.From a distance, Ellena inhales the virtually undetectable chlorine vapor rising from the resort’s shoreline infinity pool and escapes to one of the ubiquitous canopied rice barges (kettu vallam) tooling around Vembanad Lake. In the back-country waterways, a network of rivers, canals and estuaries, we pass pole-operated canoes with curling prows like Viking longboats. A thousand ducklings pour over one embankment, herded like sheep by a local “duck boy.”Ellena recalls being handed a glass of ginger-spiked limeade on his first trip to Kerala, the a-ha moment that almost died back at the lab. But on the body, cool and spontaneous Indian lime turns out to have “a very cheap smell.” Grated fresh ginger plays strangely like vegetable soup when applied to the skin.The boat lets us off close by Alleppey’s outdoor market, where there are popcorn necklaces of jasmine for sale, offerings to India’s cantankerous gods. But jasmine can be overpowering, even vulgar — and it has a hint of the mothball, with which it shares certain molecules, Ellena says. He mentions turmeric, which has a licorice bite he only wishes he’d discovered before whisking up Brin de Réglisse last year. The terraced tea fields of the south were off limits, too, as inspiration; he’d been there already, for Bulgari’s Eau Parfumée au Thé Vert, a best-selling formulation whose sophisticated smoky scent remains much imitated by mass-marketers, who’ve dumped it into things like shaving cream. Not that Thé Vert ever actually smelled like tea.“I don’t give a damn about reality,” Ellena says. A colleague telephoned to needle him: “My green tea smells more like tea than yours.” He was missing the point. “I tried to give the feeling of the tea,” Ellena says. “This is not perfumery; this is something else.” For this fragrance, Ellena would fool the hippocampus, intimating the fragrance of the monsoon through hints of ginger and lime. In the end, Un Jardin Après la Mousson is confected with vetiver and kahili ginger, which isn’t a ginger at all but a white flower that gusts like a rogue hybrid of jasmine, tuberose and gardenia. Because illusion is not a lie, and he is nothing if not an artful conjurer.Ellena is in no rush to head back to the resort for any of the oleating ayurvedic massages that some swear by, even as others find they leave the body smelling like a hamburger. Or the pleasures of a steam cabinet (ayurvedic medicine’s cousin to the sauna) that looks as if it had been invented by Torquemada’s henchmen. That night, on his cottage’s veranda, he opens his black doctor’s bag of 40 bottles and fishes out a recipe book he is readying for publication. A skinny blotter paper suffused with the rosy chemical geraniol and layered with a second blotter dipped in mothbally indole yields lily of the valley, which otherwise would require bales of tender white buds for just a few grams of essential oil. Ellena brews some tea on four blotters, one seemingly infused with someone’s boozy breath. Then, another parlor trick: frangipani plus the animal-note castoreum equals the smell of black olives — green olives are also available, upon request.“I am the only perfumer in the world who does these things,” Ellena says. He beholds himself as a composer or a painter, often referring to Picasso and Cézanne. Perfume is tricky: “Les parfums, c’est la même chose que les vêtements,” he says. Perfume is like clothing; it is different on different people. On a kitchen table in his office, he keeps 20 projects running at a time, of which 80 percent will ultimately land in the trash bin. But his instincts generally prove correct; woodsy, earthy Terre d’Hermès is the No. 1 perfume for men in France right now. In his four-year tenure, sales of Hermès perfume have tripled. “C’est pas mal,” he says. Not bad at all.Tomorrow will decidedly not be the same as today; there is a road trip scheduled that takes us past sunny rice paddies and coconut-tree fields where the Communist flag rips in the breeze. The party retains a toehold in the state of Kerala; a Communist government was first elected here in 1957 and enjoys strong support among the lower castes, especially after legislation awarded land to the tenant families who had farmed it for centuries. For years, the country’s most daring outlaw was in the perfume business down here: Veerappan, a sandalwood smuggler with a villain’s twirling handlebar mustache who hung on for years working the Keralan forest like some local bin Laden before he was finally killed in a rain of bullets in 2004.The car pulls up in front of a grand farmhouse built by the landowner Antony Tharakan’s great-grandfather, now known as the Olavipe Homestay, a guest house where coconut trees, pepper, vetiver and nutmeg grow, and orchids potted in coconut husks are strung around tree trunks like Christmas lights. The vanilla is not yet in bloom. A family of llamas is penned out back. Touch-me-nots in the grass snap shut on contact so that the goats won’t nibble. Ellena mourns la mort de la ferme, the death of farm life in Grasse, which is rapidly metamorphosing into a second-home hamlet, where the jasmine fields that perfume the landscape all the way to Cannes are disappearing.Over lunch, Tharakan’s wife, Rema, suggests that Chinese traders passing through from the time of Kublai Khan left with more than just coriander. Like karate, for instance, which would appear to derive from the ancient Indian martial art kalarippayattu. And feng shui, which seems awfully similar to vastu.Strict rules govern the location of flowering trees in a home; a frangipani tree at Rema’s parents’ house had to be moved because its scent was suffocating. The family is Catholic yet acknowledges the presence of other penates who must be obeyed. “The yekshi are ghosts who live under the frangipani tree,” Rema says. “We tell young men not to go out at night because a seductress might steal their spirits.”Back in the car, Ellena expresses interest in inspecting the wares of the Mumbai Muslims, whose little shops lining Mohammed Ali Road, a fabled mecca for raw essences, purport to sell natural oudh, a stinky extraction of wood that is as much the perfumers’ grail as ambergris, a prettily euphemistic name for a whale’s “evacuation.” Of course, Ellena has his own trusty secret supplier of oudh. It is not one of Un Jardin Après la Mousson’s 30 ingredients. It is not part of the illusion. C’est pas mal, this illusion. Far from it. As the man says, he is the only perfumer in the world who does these things.GETTING THERE AND AROUND Cochin is the gateway to much of the region; note that in addition to reliable internal flightson Jet Airways from Mumbai (jetairways.com), you can also fly directly to the city from some international gateways, mostnotably Dubai on Emirates (emirates.com).

"'08-05-18,'0','Alex Kotlowitz’s insightful piece (May 4) on the cycles of violence that plague many communities makes the points that in matters of health, prevention is more effective than punishment, and that ending any addiction requires us to teach alternatives. Our own experience and a vast body of rigorous research suggest a few simple directives. Support prevention programs that start early, are rooted in community values and resources and are sustained over time. Focus on resources instead of deficits; embrace the hopes, skills and positive values of youth and communities, and build on that foundation. Teach alternatives to violence: anger management, empathy, communication, cooperation, conflict resolution and active community engagement help young people not only avoid violence; they also help inoculate them against the hopelessness that breeds these cycles.As a scientist who has studied revenge for 15 years, I think the language of evolutionary biology is more accurate than that of disease in depicting what revenge is all about. Vengeance bears the hallmarks of a trait that exists today because of the social problems it solved during human evolution. Humans domesticated vengeance by replacing it with social institutions that could serve the same functions. When social disadvantage and social pressure conspire to alienate people from those institutions, they may return to revenge for self-protection.'"

"'08-05-18,'0','Vital research programs have been slashed. At the rice institute, scientists have identified 14 genetic traits that could help rice plants survive the plant hopper, which sucks the juices out of young plants while infecting them with viruses. But the scientists have had no money to breed these traits into the world’s most widely used rice varieties.The institute is the world’s main repository of rice seeds as well as genetic and other information about rice, the crop that feeds nearly half the world’s people.But nowadays at the International Rice Research Institute, greenhouses have peeling paint and holes in their screens and walls. Hallways are dotted with empty offices. In the 1980s, the institute employed five entomologists, or insect experts, overseeing a staff of 200. Now it has one entomologist with a staff of eight.“We’ve had an exodus here,” said Yvette Naredo, an assistant geneticist.Similar troubles plague other centers in Asia, Africa and Latin America that work on crop productivity in poor countries. Agricultural experts have complained about the flagging efforts for years and warned of the risks.“Nobody was listening,” said Thomas Lumpkin, director general of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in Mexico.Now, a reckoning is at hand. Growth of the global food supply has slowed even as the population has continued to increase, and as economic growth is giving millions of poor people the money to buy more food.With demand beginning to outstrip supply, prices have soared, and food riots have erupted that have undermined the stability of foreign governments. World leaders are scrambling to respond. On May 1, President Bush asked Congress for an extra $770 million to pay for food aid and to help farmers improve their productivity.But cuts in agricultural research continue. The United States is in the midst of slashing, by as much as 75 percent, its $59.5 million annual support for a global research network that focuses on improving crops vital to agriculture in poor countries. That network includes the rice institute.Robert Bertram, who oversees the funding for the United States Agency for International Development, said he was still trying to stop the cuts and argued that research to improve crop yields was “like putting money in the pockets of poor people, and I mean billions of poor people.”The Agency for International Development is the primary vehicle for the American government to finance development projects abroad. James R. Kunder, its acting deputy administrator, said the agency hoped to reconsider the cutbacks if Congress allows extra money.Crop by crop and country by country, agricultural research and development are lagging.The center in Mexico has created drought-tolerant corn for Africa and higher-yielding, disease-resistant wheat for South Asia. But it does not have the money to get the varieties into the hands of poor farmers.In Africa, where yields have remained stagnant since the 1960s, efforts to bolster them have been hampered by cuts not only in research but also in programs like fertilizer distribution.Even in the United States, long a world leader in agricultural research, some money has been shifted away from crop-productivity work into issues like nutrition and food safety.The biggest cutbacks have come in donations to agriculture in poor countries from the governments of wealthy countries and in loans from development institutions that the wealthy governments control, like the World Bank. Such projects include not only research on pests and crops but also programs to help farmers adopt improved methods in their fields.Adjusting for inflation and exchange rates, the wealthy countries, as a group, cut such donations roughly in half from 1980 to 2006, to $2.8 billion a year from $6 billion. The United States cut its support for agriculture in poor countries to $624 million from $2.3 billion in that period.“Agriculture has been so productive and done so well, people have kind of lost sight of how fragile it really is,” said Jan E. Leach, a plant pathologist at Colorado State University who works with rice. “It’s as if we have lost track of the fact that food is linked to agriculture, which is linked to human survival.”Agricultural research and development work is never done. The demand for food keeps growing. Insects and plant diseases adapt, overcoming efforts to thwart them.In the 1960s, population growth was far outrunning food production, threatening famine in many poor countries. But then wealthier nations joined forces with the poor countries to improve crop yields. Countries like India and Pakistan embraced new plant varieties, irrigation projects and fertilizer programs in a vast effort that came to be known as the Green Revolution.Yields soared, and by the 1980s, the threat of starvation had receded in most of the world. With Europe and the United States offering their farmers heavy subsidies that encouraged production, grain became abundant worldwide, and prices fell.Many poor countries, instead of developing their own agriculture, turned to the world market to buy cheap rice and wheat. In 1986, Agriculture Secretary John Block called the idea of developing countries feeding themselves “an anachronism from a bygone era,” saying they should just buy American.Additional factors prompted wealthy countries to shift their donations away from agriculture. For instance, advocacy groups criticized some of the environmental problems arising from intensive farming, weakening support for the Green Revolution. And urgent new priorities like the AIDS crisis in Africa captured the world’s attention.Advocates for agriculture fought a losing battle to stop the cutbacks — nowhere more than in the World Bank, the huge institution in Washington that makes low-interest loans to poor countries for development projects.Adjusted for inflation, the World Bank cut its agricultural lending to $2 billion in 2004 from $7.7 billion in 1980.The Green Revolution had led to creation of a global network of research centers focusing on agriculture and food production, with 14 institutes — including the International Rice Research Institute — scattered across Asia, Africa and Latin America, in addition to a research office in Washington. The centers, known collectively as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, carry much of the burden of improving crop yields in developing countries.As the world lost its focus on crops, the budgets of some of the centers were cut. At others, the budgets stayed level or even rose, but donors increasingly directed the money toward worthwhile but ancillary projects like environmental research. Spending fell on the laborious plant-breeding programs needed to improve crop productivity.As these trends played out, the stage was being set for a food emergency.From 1970 to 1990, the peak Green Revolution years, the food supply grew faster than the world population. But after 1990, food’s growth rate fell below population growth, according to a report by Ronald Trostle, a researcher at the Agriculture Department.Around 2004, the world economy began growing more quickly, about 5 percent a year. So as the food supply was lagging, millions of people were gaining the money to improve their diets.The world began to use more grain than it was producing, cutting into reserves, and prices started rising. Early this year, as stocks fell to perilous levels, international grain prices doubled or even tripled, threatening as many as 100 million people with malnutrition.At the World Bank, agricultural financing has begun to recover. Under a new president, Robert B. Zoellick, the bank has decided to double its lending for such programs in Africa. After President Bush’s request to Congress, other wealthy countries are joining the United States in increasing their support.But the case of the brown plant hopper shows there will be no quick fix for the years of neglect.The insect is not a new problem. In the 1960s, the rice institute, nestled between jungle and the bustling town of Los Baños, pioneered ways to help farmers grow two and even three crops a season, instead of one.But with rice plants growing more of the year, the hoppers — which live only on rice plants — had longer to multiply, and became a bigger concern.The institute responded by testing thousands of varieties of wild rice for natural resistance. Researchers found four types of resistance and bred them into commercial varieties by 1980.But brown plant hoppers adapted swiftly, and the resistant strains started losing their effectiveness in the 1990s. An important insecticide lost its punch, too, as the hopper developed the ability to withstand up to 100 times the dose that used to kill it.While the insect was adapting, the rice institute was being gutted.Its money comes come from government donations, foundation grants and assistance from development institutions like the Asian Development Bank. After peaking in the early 1990s, the rice institute’s budget has been cut in half after adjusting for inflation, a reflection of the larger cutbacks in global agriculture.Several dozen important varieties of rice have been lost from the institute’s gene bank through poor storage. Promising work on rice varieties that could withstand high temperatures and saltier water — ideal for coping with global warming and the higher sea levels that may follow — had to be abandoned.A potential solution is at hand for the plant hopper problem. No fewer than 14 new types of genetic resistance have been discovered. But with the budget cuts, the institute has mounted no effort to breed these traits into widely used rice varieties.Doing so now would take four to seven years, if money could be found. In the meantime, the hoppers have become a growing threat. China, the world’s biggest rice producer, announced on May 7 that it was struggling to control the rapid spread of the insects there. A plant hopper outbreak can destroy 20 percent of a harvest; China is trying to hold losses to 5 percent in affected fields.“We must stay ahead of rapidly evolving pests — and increasingly, a changing climate — to assure global food security,” said Mr. Zeigler, the rice institute’s director. “Cutting back on agricultural research today is pure folly.”'"

"'08-05-19,'1','Q: I really enjoyed this story! Great mix of branding, memory, psychology, imaginative entrepreneurship (is there any other kind?) and wry humor.I wonder what is done to establish, and mitigate if possible, the tangential, sometimes negative associations we may have with defunct brands. For example, I associate Brim, Salon Selectives and Mrs. Grass Chicken Soup (with the golden flavor nugget!) with being home sick from school (which I disliked).Rather than having warm, cozy associations, these brands remind me of feeling pent up, stalled, confined and starved for stimulation. I also remember vividly the distaste I had for the daytime television shows these ads were wrapped around. They represented a confined, housewifey adult world that I wanted to do everything I could to avoid and surpass.So I suppose brands that represented my ideal adult fantasy world would have more mileage with me. What would those be, I wonder?Some delightful admixture of whatever was advertised during “Remington Steele,” “Moonlighting” and “Trapper John, M.D.,” I imagine. — Beth Dunn, Dennis, MA (Go to Comment)A: I think this is actually a really good line of thought. While maybe not everybody has a reaction quite as fully articulated as yours, there is, I think, a real challenge in avoiding negative associations not so much with the product/brand but with the sort of era that it connotes. To some extent, that's what a brander's job is - to make you think, when you think about the VW bug, about Woodstock and not about Nazi Germany.Speaking of all those old TV shows, I think something similar goes on in all the movie and TV-show revivals.Q: I can't help feeling that River West Brands is duping consumers. While it's great that they are reviving dead or ghost brands that consumers are nostalgic over, they are not necessarily providing the SAME product.As a market researcher and marketing professor, I am aware of how consumers' perceptions can be manipulated. Time plays tricks on memory. However, the equity that River West is buying into is a culmination of not only the brand name but also the consumer experiences of the product made by the company originally owning that brand name. How many consumers are savvy enough to look at a reintroduced brand to see who is manufacturing it? I would suggest that many don't know who manufactured it in the past, let alone wonder if it's the same company that is reintroducing it.Given that consumers will probably think that their “favorite” lost brand is back in it's original form, they may be sorely disappointed when they repurchase. If the relaunched brand and its products don't meet or exceed consumers' memories, won't the revival be short-lived? What is the brand equity worth at that point? (Go to Comment)A: It's absolutely true that they're not necessarily providing the same product, and they're pretty open about that. On the question of duping consumers I see where you're coming from, but on the other hand, I'm not sure what they're proposing is all that different from many licensing programs that are already widely accepted. The garment industry is the most obvious place to look for examples: plenty of couture brands license their names to commodity makers, who simply emblazon the couture brand name on a wallet or underwear or whatever, lending an air of quality to those items that may or may not exist, but that certainly has nothing to do with any relationship to the couture brand, which isn't involved in doing anything more than cursory approval - and cashing a check. As you note, most consumers don't bother to research who is actually making the item, and I'm not even sure how easy it would be to find the answers even if they wanted to.And of course, there are those who would say the entire process of branding is basically about duping consumers by investing “meaning” (by way of marketing) into a manufactured object no different than other brands. But as a marketing prof, you know all that, so I won't rehash it here.Finally, I'm always a little cautious about marketers-dupe-consumers as the way things work: consumers share responsibility in these matters.Having said all that, I think you raise a really thoughtful and interesting line here, and your question at the end is, I think, crucial to whether a firm like River West can actually succeed long term.Q: Stimulating article. Especially telling were the stats on false-memory rates related to the fake Disney ads. Where you say, “Earle says that this imperfection of memory can be used to enhance whatever new Brim he comes up with” ... and: “ 'Consumers remember the kind of high-level essence of the brand,' '' he says. 'They tend to forget the product specifics.' This, he figures, creates an opening: it gives the reintroduced version 'permission.' ” ... Not trying to be provocative but I was struck by the similarity of his efforts are to what I feel American religions have nearly perfected, capitalizing on the “heuristics” required to further their progress and essentially morph for their consumers. — Randall, San Francisco (Go to Comment)A: Some responses I can anticipate - like the questions about whatever-happened-to-Brand-X. But a comparison to religion! That I didn't see coming. And I guess I'm not going to go near it.Q: How much is a discontinued brand worth in actual dollars? For all kinds of purposes (not the least of which is the actual buying and selling of the names “Brim” or “Salon Selectives”), there must be a hard number that represents its actual/estimated value. It would help me to understand if you shared the values in this most concrete of metrics. — Andrew, New York City (Go to Comment)A: Like so many things, what a dead brand is worth is whatever someone will pay for it.Without getting into too much detail, a firm like River West acquires trademarks in several ways. Sometimes a mark has simply fallen out of use, and can be legally claimed by another entity. In that scenario, the mark/brand has in essence been deemed worthless, or close to it.In other cases, marks can be bought on the cheap from owners who do not particularly want them anymore.Finally, they can be squabbled over in the courts: One entity files a claim, asserting that a mark is abandoned, and the owner, who for whatever reason does not want to give it up, fights back.That's where your hard numbers come into play. Whatever an entity pays for a dead brand (nothing; a bargain-basement price; a higher price; a lot of litigation costs; etc.), that's one starting point.But then it's up to that entity to persuade consumers to buy the brand. Maybe you can scoop up an abandoned trademark for practically nothing - but that doesn't tell the “value” of what you've bought. If lots of consumers do, the brand suddenly is valuable again, and you got yourself a bargain. If not well, not so much: You paid very little for something worth very little.Obviously there are a lot of unknowns built into that answer. And there are a lot of unknowns built into brands of any kind. Apple today certainly looks like a much more valuable brand today than it did 10 years ago.What a firm like River West is doing is making bets: That it has found brands that others don't see value in but that River West does. We'll see!Q: “Can a Dead Brand Live Again?” is an interesting perspective on “brands,” but the scope is a little narrow and overworked. Not trying to be critical but helpful.The view that the buying public may not know the “new origin” or “true quality” of the original, withdrawn, branded product is not a huge news item. It may not even be a bad thing. In the pantheon of global issues, I really do not care that White Cloud toilet paper is now a Wal-Mart-only brand.Of greater interest to me is a parallel example of “brand misguidance”: Polaroid. This brand is among the top 10 “most recognizable” brands in the world. But Polaroid declared bankruptcy several years ago, was bought at a bargain price by an investment firm, is now in its third ownership and ceases to manufacture any products. The post-bankruptcy owners have profited by selling the Polaroid “brand” to other goods, sellers for anything from TVs to flashlight batteries.I suggest that the buying public, if not self-informed, assumes that the innovative minds and elegant designers of former Polaroid products might be behind the newly Polaroid-branded TV or batteries, which may be “better” or “more special” than competitor products.An example of the result of misguidance: “Petters Consumer Brands LLC Announce Recall of Batteries Found in Polaroid Portable DVD Players.”If your intent in your commentary is to be informative, I humbly suggest an elevation from “Gee, that's interesting” to a more helpful “Gosh, am I glad I learned that.” — giuseppe, Boston (Go to Comment)A: I've actually written about Polaroid. And you're right that its current owners have licensed the name, and there are certainly critics of some of the decisions they've made on that front. In any event, I think what I said about Stanley might apply here (certainly more than the one paragraph or so about White Cloud). Although the difference is that Stanley's licensing program seems to be very successful, and I don't think there's much evidence that Polaroid has had significant success with efforts you're talking about.Q: I, too, have wondered about where the Vermont Country Store gets the products if they aren't available elsewhere. It does sell Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific, but it is expensive. I agree about Agree shampoo - it reappeared briefly in 1997 and then disappeared again. A lot of what people miss is shampoo and cereal, it seems. from the comments - maybe because those were products we actually used as kids. Vermont Country Store sells Evening in Paris perfume, but I also found it in Paris. Maybe some of the old brands are sold in other countries and imported now? — atticus, urbana, il (Go to Comment)A: A couple of people have brought up Vermont Country Store, which I agree is a very interesting business. About a year or two ago I looked into writing a Consumed column about it, but it didn't work out. (My memory is that they were not responsive to me, possibly because another big media outlet was doing an article on them. But you know how memories are.)So anyway I have never done extensive reporting on Vermont Country Store, but I believe its model has more to do with simply selling things “just as they were” to hard-core loyalist product fans. It is indeed interesting that they seem to be making a business of this.But what I was trying to explore in this piece was not just selling things “as they were,” but using (possibly faulty) brand memories as a starting point for something new - that balance of what we remember, and what we only think we remember and how far that can be pushed.Q: I still miss Bucky Beaver and Ipana toothpaste. — Larry, Philly (Go to Comment)A: I figured a bunch of people would bring up specific brands of yore, and I just have to fess up that I'm not fully conversant in the precise status of every such property. But I'll respond generally here, because while I have never heard of Bucky Beaver, I can tell you that River West's Paul Earle is actually quite interested in Ipana. So you never know.'"

"'08-05-19,'1','In an e-mail message to Microsoft employees on Sunday afternoon, a senior Microsoft executive seemed to acknowledge that moving on might be difficult.In his memo, Kevin Johnson, the executive in charge of Microsoft’s Internet business, emphasized the urgency felt at Microsoft about its failure to make more progress in catching up to Google.“Regardless of the outcome of any new discussions,” he wrote, “it is important that we continue to move forward to strengthen our online services business. The fact is that we are not where we want to be in this business yet and we’ve been in this position longer than we’d all like.”Mr. Johnson then outlined Microsoft’s ambitious agenda in Internet search and online advertising, exploiting the company’s strengths in desktop software and newer fields like cellphone software. Among the goals enumerated in the memo are to “innovate and disrupt in search,” “win in display” ads online and “reinvent portal and social media experiences.”Microsoft’s hastily revived effort to reach some kind of deal with Yahoo seems to suggest that the software giant has doubts about whether it can achieve those goals on its own.Indeed, Microsoft’s on-again, off-again interest in Yahoo has raised questions from analysts, investors, customers and employees about its strategy. Amid the discussions, Microsoft is scheduled to present its online strategy to advertisers at a gathering this week.People involved in the confidential discussions between Microsoft and Yahoo said the talks centered on a partnership or joint venture for search-related advertising to compete against Google. When Microsoft first made its unsolicited bid of $31 a share for Yahoo in February, it said it was doing so as part of its battle to increase its relatively small slice of the search-related advertising market against Google, a giant with about 60 percent of the United States market, according to the measurement firm comScore.By comparison, Yahoo has about 21 percent of the market, and Microsoft has about 9 percent, comScore said.The timing of Microsoft’s new approach may be a turning point in the months-long story or just an opportunistic effort to further insert itself into a dance between Yahoo and Google. Yahoo has been racing to complete its own partnership with Google and was expected to announce a formal agreement as early as this week. A Yahoo-Google partnership, which would likely face antitrust scrutiny, could make Yahoo a less desirable partner or takeover candidate for Microsoft.The Google-Yahoo discussions have been centered around the notion of Google delivering ads alongside some Yahoo searches. Such a deal would help Yahoo generate more cash, because Google’s search advertising technology is more sophisticated and is used by more advertisers. As a result, Google earns more on every search than its competitors, on average.A similar partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft might not have the same effect, because Microsoft’s base of advertisers is smaller than Yahoo’s. People involved in the confidential discussions said that search advertising was certainly a part of Microsoft’s renewed interest in Yahoo, but they cautioned that any relationship being discussed might be different from the one the company had been contemplating with Google.It is unclear whether Microsoft would pursue a takeover bid again. In its statement on Sunday, Microsoft insisted it was not making such a bid, but hinted that it could be persuaded to reverse course.“Microsoft is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo at this time, but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative depending on future developments and discussions that may take place with Yahoo or discussions with shareholders of Yahoo or Microsoft or with other third parties,” the company said.The new discussions also come as Yahoo is facing increasing pressure from shareholders, some of whom are furious that its board did not work harder to reach a deal to sell the company to Microsoft. Last week, Mr. Icahn said the directors had “acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders.” People close to Microsoft and Mr. Icahn say that neither has been in contact with the other.Yahoo released a statement late on Sunday saying that it continues to explore strategic alternatives and remains open to any proposals that are good for its shareholders.“Yahoo’s board of directors will evaluate each of our alternatives, including any Microsoft proposal, consistent with its fiduciary duties, with a focus on maximizing stockholder value,” the statement said. Yahoo also said that it had confirmed with Microsoft that the software giant was not interested an outright acquisition of Yahoo at this time.Shares of Yahoo closed last week at $27.66, far above the $19 a share they traded at before Microsoft’s first bid, in anticipation that a deal of some sort will be reached. Shares of Microsoft closed Friday at $29.99, roughly half their peak price in December 1999.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Mr. Obama’s fund-raising success makes it increasingly likely that he will back away from a pledge he made last year to accept public financing for the general election — and its attendant spending limits — if the Republican nominee also accepted public money.Several major fund-raisers for Mr. Obama said in interviews that they could not envision the campaign sheathing its sword and accepting public financing, given how powerful Mr. Obama’s fund-raising could be in the Democrats’ urgent quest to reclaim the White House. Mr. Obama would be the first major-party presidential candidate to bypass public financing for the general election since the system began in 1976.Mr. McCain, who abandoned public financing in the primary but has indicated he would employ it in the general election, is aggressively building a joint fund-raising operation with the Republican National Committee and state party committees in four battleground states. These committees can raise money far in excess of the $2,300 limit imposed on individuals giving to Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign. Donors can write a single check of almost $70,000 to the committees that is divvied up to various entities.Offering a glimpse of the kind of money that can be spread around with such a committee, $300,000 was collected from nine hedge fund executives and real estate investors at an event in New York in March, according to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission. More than $10 million was raised at an event on Thursday in Washington, McCain campaign advisers said.Lacking a robust small-dollar Internet fund-raising operation, Mr. McCain has a busy schedule of some two dozen high-dollar fund-raising events this month.Advocates concerned about the influence of money in presidential campaigns expressed alarm at how two candidates who have emphasized reform have moved closer to a no-holds-barred sprint for cash. Mr. McCain was a co-author of sweeping campaign finance legislation in 2002, and Mr. Obama has rejected donations from federal lobbyists and political action committees.But the crucible of a presidential contest inevitably yields new priorities.“It’s hard to be a reformer,” said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, “when you’re trying very hard to raise as much money as you can.”There are early signs, though, that some of the more controversial elements of recent presidential campaigns might be somewhat muted this time around.On Thursday, the leader of Progressive Media USA, which had been expected to be the major vehicle on the Democratic side for unregulated donations directed toward television advertising, said the group would stand down because of disapproving signals from the Obama camp.Similarly, the Republican side has not mounted a major “soft money” effort for the general election comparable to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which in 2004 undermined the presidential bid of Senator John Kerry. Many potential donors to such groups, which are able to skirt restrictions on donations, are wary of displeasing Mr. McCain, Republican operatives said.Mr. Obama’s fund-raising machine has been powered by more than 1.5 million donors, the overwhelming majority of whom have given to him in small increments over the Internet. Mr. Obama has argued that with this wide base of small donors, he has created something of a parallel system of public financing.His fund-raising apparatus, however, also features a formidable high-dollar network that has collected more $1,000 contributions and above than Mrs. Clinton’s once-vaunted team of bundlers of campaign donations. A key task would be to bring members of Mrs. Clinton’s team into the fold if she leaves the race. Informal conversations between top fund-raisers on both sides have begun, but feelings between the two camps remain raw, supporters from both campaigns said.Although Mr. Obama suggested recently that he might consider capping donations for the general election, his campaign manager, David Plouffe, said in an interview that there had been “no real discussions” about the possibility.“We honestly haven’t had a rigorous discussion about it,” Mr. Plouffe said.Although Mr. Obama has collected three times as much money as Mr. McCain, Mr. Plouffe said he “would not accept the proposition” that Mr. Obama would outspend Mr. McCain.“I think they’re going to have a lot of money,” Mr. Plouffe said.Mr. Plouffe said that Mr. McCain might not raise as much money through his campaign but will get substantial support through the Republican National Committee and a “constellation” of so-called 527 groups, named for the part of the tax code they are organized under, and other independent efforts.“I think what you’ll see is a sophisticated and well thought-out web of outside groups and the R.N.C. essentially being the main drivers of the McCain campaign,” Mr. Plouffe said.Mr. McCain rebuked an independent group that financed television advertisements on his behalf last year before the South Carolina primary. Lately, however, his campaign has been saying that Mr. McCain cannot be expected to “referee” advertisements by outside groups beyond his control.Mr. McCain drew accusations of hypocrisy this year when he backed out of public financing for the primary campaign, which he had initially sought when his campaign was struggling but then pulled back from after his fortunes rose. Critics argued that he had used the promise of public financing to secure a $4 million loan to keep his campaign afloat, something that would have bound him to the spending limits that come with the public system.Mr. McCain’s ties to lobbyists have also been drawing increasing scrutiny, a problem the campaign sought to address last week with the new conflict-of-interest policy. Mr. Loeffler, a lobbyist who was the general co-chairman of Mr. McCain’s campaign, became the policy’s most high-profile casualty on Friday when he submitted his resignation. Mr. Loeffler’s firm did work for Saudi Arabia, which included a May 2006 meeting between Mr. Loeffler, Mr. McCain and the country’s ambassador, according to lobbying records. The meeting was first reported over the weekend by Newsweek.Mr. McCain’s advisers say they hope their joint fund-raising efforts can raise $150 million, or just over $20 million a month until November. Coupled with the $84 million Mr. McCain would receive through public financing, which the campaign could spend in the two months after the Republican convention, his advisers insist they will have enough resources to compete with Mr. Obama.The Republican National Committee raised roughly $20 million in April, said Mike Duncan, the committee’s chairman. Mr. McCain collected $18 million in April, his second full month as the presumptive Republican nominee, a campaign spokeswoman said.By way of comparison, Mr. Kerry raised $44 million in March 2004, the month he secured the Democratic nomination.“It’s certainly below what one would expect for a Republican nominee at this stage in the race,” said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at Colby College and a campaign finance expert.Running a lean campaign, however, and shifting many functions to the national committee, Mr. McCain has amassed a war chest that left him more than $21 million in the bank at the end of April.Frank Donatelli, the deputy chairman of the national committee and the chief liaison with the McCain campaign, predicted that the party would give more financial help to Mr. McCain that it has to past nominees.“We intend to provide substantial, maybe unprecedented, resources to the McCain campaign,” Mr. Donatelli said.But Mr. McCain’s heavy reliance on the party comes with limitations. Only a relatively small pool of money can be used in advertising that is coordinated between the party and the campaign. The party can also share the costs for generic advertisements that benefit other Republican candidates, but relying on such commercials could constrain Mr. McCain’s media strategists.Mr. Obama has been collecting more than $40 million a month this year, without any help from the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Plouffe said it was hard to say whether Mr. Obama would be able to keep up that rate through the summer, but he said he expected Mr. Obama to get a bounce if he indeed became the nominee.Last week, the Obama campaign signed its own joint fund-raising agreement with the national committee, as did Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Party officials are hoping the agreements will give the party a much-needed boost, because it has seriously lagged in cash on hand. A spokeswoman for the party said it finished April with roughly $5 million in the bank, but its fund-raising usually surges once a nominee has been declared.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Last Tuesday, Republicans lost another Congressional seat in a special election — their third such defeat in two months. On Wednesday I received an acerbic e-mail message from a disgusted young G.O.P. loyalist: “I just have to say that Republicans are a dumb party that chooses stupid candidates. With the exception of McCain.” Who says the young lack wisdom? In fact, Republican hopes of denying Democrats complete control of the federal government for the next couple of years may rest on the promise of “McCain exceptionalism.”The Republican Party is clearly in bad shape — trailing by double digits in party preference among the electorate, very likely to lose House and Senate seats in the fall. But John McCain — despite a rather haphazard campaign so far lacking in thematic coherence — is doing pretty well. In two public tracking polls, by Gallup and Rasmussen, he’s basically even with Barack Obama; other polls have him slightly behind.What’s more, three developments this past week were promising for McCain — or what amounts to pretty much the same thing, problematic for Obama.1. On Tuesday night, while the G.O.P. Congressional candidate was losing in a Mississippi district George Bush carried in 2004 by 25 points, Barack Obama was being trounced in the West Virginia Democratic primary — by 41 points. I can’t find a single recent instance of a candidate who ultimately became his party’s nominee losing a primary by this kind of margin. The crucial swing states of Ohio and Pennsylvania (whose primaries Obama also lost to Hillary Clinton) have a fair number of West Virginia-type working-class, culturally conservative voters. The Obama campaign can’t be confident about his prospects there in the fall.2. On Thursday, the California Supreme Court did precisely what much of the American public doesn’t want judges doing: it made social policy from the bench. With a 4-to-3 majority, the judges chose not to defer to a ballot initiative approved by 61 percent of California voters eight years ago, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. In 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court redefined marriage in that state, helping to highlight the issues of same-sex marriage and judicial activism for the 2004 presidential campaign. Now the California court has conveniently stepped up to the plate.Obama’s campaign issued a statement that its candidate “respects the decision of the California Supreme Court.” The McCain campaign, by contrast, said it recognized “the right of the people of California to recognize marriage as a unique institution ... John McCain doesn’t believe judges should be making these decisions.” Since the next president will almost certainly have one Supreme Court appointment, and could have two or three, this difference on judicial philosophy could well matter to voters — and in a way that should help McCain.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Not everyone agrees. “When people look at the arc of the campaign, it will be seen that being a woman, in the end, was not a detriment and if anything it was a help to her,” the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said in an interview. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is faltering, she added, because of “strategic, tactical things that have nothing to do with her being a woman.”As a former first lady whose political career evolved from her husband’s, Mrs. Clinton was always an imperfect test case for female achievement — “somebody’s wife,” as Elaine Kamarck, a professor of government at Harvard and a Clinton supporter, described her.Still, many credit Mrs. Clinton with laying down a new marker for what a woman can accomplish in a campaign — raising over $170 million, frequently winning more favorable reviews on debate performances than her male rivals, rallying older women, and persuading white male voters who were never expected to support her.“She’s raised this whole woman candidate thing to a whole different level than when I ran,” said Geraldine Ferraro, a Clinton supporter and the first woman to be the vice-presidential nominee of a major party, contrasting her own brief stint as a running mate in 1984 with Mrs. Clinton’s 17-month-and-counting slog.Ms. Goodwin and others say Mrs. Clinton was able to convert the sexism she faced on the trail into votes and donations, extending the life of a candidacy that suffered a serious blow at the Iowa caucuses. Like so many women before, she was heckled (in New Hampshire, a few men told her to iron their shirts) and called nasty names (“How do we beat the bitch?” Senator John McCain was asked at one campaign event).But the response may have been more powerful than the injury. In the days after Mrs. Clinton was criticized for misting up on the campaign trail, she won the New Hampshire primary and drew a wave of donations, many from women expressing indignation about how she had been treated.And Mrs. Clinton seemed to channel the lives of regular women, who often saw her as an avenging angel. Take Judith Henry, 67, for whom Mrs. Clinton’s primary losses stirred decades-old memories of working at a phone company where women were not allowed to hold management positions. “They always gave us the clerical jobs and told us we didn’t have families to support,” she said. At a rally last month in Bloomington, Ind., she sat with her daughter Susan Henry, 45, a warehouse worker, who complained that her male colleagues did less work and made more money than the women did.Decades after the dissolution of movement feminism, Mrs. Clinton’s events and donor lists filled with women who had experienced insult or isolation on the job. Moitri Chowdhury Savard, 36, a doctor in Queens, was once asked by a supervisor why she was not home cooking for her husband; Liz Kuoppala, 37, of Eveleth, Minn., worked as the only woman in her mining crew and is now the only woman on the City Council.Ms. Kamarck, 57, the Harvard professor and a longtime adviser to Democratic candidates, said she was still incredulous about the time her colleagues on Walter F. Mondale’s presidential campaign, all men, left for lunch without inviting her — because, she later discovered, they were headed to a strip club.Janet Napolitano, the Democratic governor of Arizona, said the world was different now, especially the political world, thanks in part to Mrs. Clinton. “I never heard anybody say she can’t be elected because she’s a woman,” said Ms. Napolitano, who supports Mr. Obama and like many of his supporters saw less sexism in the race than Mrs. Clinton’s backers. “That’s a different deal than we’ve heard before in American politics.”But as others watched a campaign that starred two possibly transformative figures, they felt a growing conviction that the contest was unfair. Mrs. Clinton’s supporters point to a nagging series of slights: the fixation on her clothes, even her cleavage; chronic criticism that her voice is shrill; calls for her to exit the race; and most of all, the male commentators in the news media who, they argue, were consistently tougher on her than on Mr. Obama.Some even accuse Mr. Obama of chauvinism, pointing to the time he called Mrs. Clinton “likeable enough” as evidence of dismissiveness. Nancy Wait, 55, a social worker in Columbia City, Ind., said Mr. Obama was far less qualified than Mrs. Clinton and described as condescending his recent assurances that Mrs. Clinton should stay in the race as long as she liked. Ms. Wait said she would “absolutely, positively not” vote for him come fall.Ms. Ferraro, who clashed with the Obama campaign about whether she made a racially offensive remark, said she might not either. “I think Obama was terribly sexist,” she said.Cynthia Ruccia, 55, a sales director for Mary Kay cosmetics in Columbus, Ohio, is organizing a group, Clinton Supporters Count Too, of mostly women in swing states who plan to campaign against Mr. Obama in November. “We, the most loyal constituency, are being told to sit down, shut up and get to the back of the bus,” she said.Whatever barriers Mrs. Clinton may have smashed, she left some intact for future contenders to try themselves against. She seemed uncertain how to reconcile her sex with her political persona. Though she projected an aura of authority, said Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant unaffiliated with any candidate, she variously cast herself as a victim of male domination, a warm girlfriend type and, at the end, an indefatigable warrior. She even made contradictory statements about whether sex should be a factor in the race.Mrs. Clinton ran into trouble with some of the classic hurdles that women who are politicians face, historians and sociologists said. “It was the same conversations we’ve been having since the ’70s,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.Take the need to project toughness and warmth simultaneously. The test is unfair, many say, because men are not subjected to it as harshly and because it is nearly impossible not to err on one side. Still, some say Mrs. Clinton went overboard on toughness.“The idea that you have to talk about eradicating Iran — that’s all, to me, the voices of people advising her,” said Patricia Schroeder, a former Colorado congresswoman and Clinton supporter who considered seeking the Democratic nomination in 1987.And yet Mrs. Clinton may not have passed the commander in chief test. In New York Times/CBS News polls conducted this winter, voters rated Mr. Obama’s potential in that area more highly than they did Mrs. Clinton’s, though neither served in the military or has much experience directly handling international crises. Perhaps participants had many reasons for preferring Mr. Obama, but they followed the long-standing pattern of finding women less plausible military commanders than men.Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, many women say with regret, did not inspire a deep or nuanced conversation between men and women, only familiar gender-war battles consisting of male gibes and her supporters’ angry responses. Mr. Obama, who sought to minimize the role of race in his candidacy, led something of a national dialogue about it, but Mrs. Clinton, who made womanhood an explicit part of her run, seemed unwilling or unable to talk candidly about gender.Mrs. Clinton, for example, declined a New York Times request earlier this year for an interview about the gender dynamics of the race; an aide said the topic would be impossible for her to address in a frank way..The conversation Mrs. Clinton spurred among women, however, seemed newer and more surprising. Her candidacy split Democratic women, not to mention prominent feminists. (Last week, the abortion-rights group Naral Pro-Choice America endorsed Mr. Obama, setting off protest from other women’s groups.) The cleft was largely along generational lines, with older women who had waged their own battles showing more solidarity and younger ones arguing that voting for a male candidate over a female one was itself a sign of progress and confidence.“The most important contribution she has made is to show that women candidates are just like men candidates,” said Joan Scott, a historian at the Institute for Advanced Study. “You have to judge them not on the basis of their gender but their character.”Over the course of the campaign, Jennifer Rogers, a film producer in Los Angeles, came to agree. She voted for Mrs. Clinton, in part because she hoped to see a female president, but she recently lost enthusiasm over what she called a lack of truthfulness on the candidate’s part. “Her problems are about who she is and not her gender,” said Ms. Rogers, 28.Amy Rees, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mother in San Francisco, agrees — most of the time. She said she agonized between the two choices, finally voted for Mr. Obama and did not regret it. Mrs. Clinton lost on the merits, Ms. Rees said.Still, every so often, she feels a flicker of worry about whether that is entirely so. Referring to Mr. Obama, Ms. Rees said, “He still looks more like every other president we’ve ever had than she does.”'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Senator John McCain’s wife, Cindy McCain, has decided not to release her tax returns — not now and not in the future. In the interest of transparency and to support her husband’s frequent calls for clean and open government, she should rethink that decision.Since their marriage in 1980, Mrs. McCain, the daughter of a multimillionaire Anheuser-Busch distributor, and her husband have filed separate tax returns. In April, Mr. McCain released his own returns, but just for the last two years — a paltry nod to openness. Mrs. McCain, it was explained, would not release her tax returns in “the interest of protecting the privacy of her children.”Mrs. McCain dug in deeper this month, insisting that she will never make her returns public, even if her husband wins the presidency and she becomes first lady. “My husband is the candidate,” she said.There is no question that Mr. McCain — the candidate — has reaped considerable benefits from his wife’s wealth, including discounted use of her company’s corporate jet to fly from state to state during this campaign.Voters also deserve to know whether any of Senator McCain’s official actions have benefited his wife, family members, or their business associates, as they did in the case of Charles Keating, the Arizona developer and savings and loan operator at the center of the Keating Five scandal two decades ago. A year before Mr. McCain’s 1987 meetings with bank regulators on Mr. Keating’s behalf, Mrs. McCain and her father invested more than $350,000 in a strip mall developed by Mr. Keating.Senator Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, have released eight years of joint returns. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have recently released eight years of tax information, although the public is still owed a list of the donors to the Clinton presidential library and foundation.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Whitmore, who led all scorers with 17 points, blended her physical game inside with a delicate shooting touch from the perimeter for 14 points in the first half. No one else scored more than 6 in the half.Whitmore propelled the Sun (2-0) to a 36-26 lead at halftime, a lead that grew to 18 points with 3 minutes, 30 seconds left in the third quarter.“We didn’t put a body on anyone today,” Coyle said.But late in the third quarter, the Liberty showed signs of life, switching to a full-court press. The Sun was visibly rattled as the Liberty pulled to 57-54 with 7:34 left in the fourth. The Liberty put together a 21-7 run led by Shameka Christon, who finished with 14 points, and Janel McCarville, the league’s most improved player last year when she averaged 15.7 points a game over the second half of the season. But a basket by the Sun’s Ashja Jones made the score 62-54 and seemed to knock the wind out of the Liberty.“You expend a lot of energy coming back like that,” McCarville said.The pace seemed to impress Essence Carson, the former Rutgers star and the Liberty’s first-round draft pick, who came off the bench in her W.N.B.A. debut.“The pro game is a lot faster than the college game, especially with the 24-second shot clock,” she said. “It means you have to push the ball a lot faster. And you just have a lot of athletes at every position.”Although Carson scored only 2 points in 10 minutes of action, her fan club appears to be growing.“I love her,” said Theresa Weatherspoon, who spent seven seasons as the Liberty’s point guard. “I can only say that many, many times. I love Essence and she’s going to make a huge impact immediately.”Even W.N.B.A. President Donna Orender could not help but single out Carson when someone sitting next to her asked which team she was rooting for.“I said they’re all my teams,” she said she told her neighbor. “But you see that player Essence Carson? I’m rooting for her.”Donna Orender discussed the possibility of the league’s expansion with reporters during halftime Sunday. The league added a franchise in Atlanta this season, and she said she hoped to add another two in the next five years to bring the league to 16 teams. “It really is a reasonable goal,” she said, adding, “There’s an explosion of talent, an explosion of the game, and I think that’s going to continue to make this league work.”'"
"'08-05-19,'1','As part of a pay-for-performance plan, the federal government and many private insurers are planning to stop reimbursing hospitals for harm caused to patients by certain preventable errors.In October, Medicare, the federal insurance program for the elderly, will no longer cover the additional cost of eight preventable complications, including central-line bloodstream infections. Some hospital administrators expect Medicaid, which covers health care for the poor, to follow suit. The government may also stop covering ventilator-associated pneumonia in 2009.The turning point in the campaign to stop hospital infections in New York had all the glamour of compiling a grocery list.In late 2005, the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation adopted a series of simple, standardized protocols based on those developed by Dr. Peter J. Pronovost, a crusader against preventable hospital deaths and a professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Pronovost calls his protocols a checklist, and that is pretty much what they are.A red binder at the nursing station at Woodhull contains dozens of forms, labeled “Central Venous Catheter Insertion Checklist,” which instruct doctors to, first of all, make sure that they have the right patient and are planning the right procedure. The 14-item list goes on to include washing hands; putting on caps, masks, sterile gowns and gloves; draping the patient from head to toe; preparing the patient’s skin with chlorhexidine antiseptic; maintaining a sterile field; and applying a sterile dressing.One person, usually a nurse, acts as the referee by calling, “Timeout!” and checking off the “completed” or “not completed” columns on the list as each step is called out and performed.Dr. Pronovost, who developed his checklist at Johns Hopkins in 2001 and tested it in more than 100 intensive care units in Michigan in 2003, found that the simple hygiene it takes to avoid many infections can seem like a low priority in the frenzied atmosphere of high-tech medical care.At Woodhull last week, when the resident called timeout for hand-washing, he was interrupting a team focused on serious and complex issues like the woman’s respiratory rate and ratio of body weight to medication.“What’s going on in the critical care units is so complicated that the simple things get overlooked,” said Alan Aviles, president of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation, which administers the 11 municipal hospitals.Dr. Pronovost, testifying before Congress last month, estimated that infections acquired during treatment affect 1 in 10 patients nationally and kill about 90,000 people a year, costing the health care system $5 billion to $11 billion.City officials said that because patient deaths are often attributed to the primary illness rather than complications like hospital-acquired infections that may have pushed the patient over the brink, they could not provide parallel local statistics.As an answer to a seemingly intractable problem, Dr. Pronovost’s checklist epiphany recalls the classic medical school story of Ignaz Semmelweis, the 19th-century Hungarian physician who found that deaths from puerperal fever in obstetrical clinics could be sharply reduced when doctors washed their hands. He noticed that the death rate was much lower at a clinic staffed by midwives, and traced the difference to medical students who failed to wash their hands after autopsies.Because the checklist is so simple, its potency is easy to underestimate, Dr. Pronovost said, joking that, “If the checklist were a drug, I’d be rich.”The secret of the checklist, he said, is focus, and the theory behind it has broad applications. He likes to illustrate his point by telling how in the Netherlands, “they paint flies on the urinals because they found that men were four times more accurate if aiming at a fly than if they weren’t.”“It’s a simple intervention to help you focus and execute,” he said.In an article last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Pronovost wrote that the new federal policy of refusing payment for some mistakes in treatment could be flawed because some errors were more preventable than others.In principle, he said in an interview, “I actually think that’s wise policy. People suffer preventable harm in this health care system, regulators and the public get outraged by it, but we haven’t been really disciplined in trying to improve it.”At Woodhull, the focus begins in the lobby, which can be almost as crowded as a subway platform during the evening rush.Other than a giant Keith Haring mural, the most prominent décor is a banner that proclaims: “Clean Hands Save Lives.”Outside of every room in the intensive care unit, there is a squirt bottle of hand sanitizer attached to the wall. “What are the top 10 carriers of infectious agents?” asks the caption of a poster on the wall, a picture of 10 fingers.Patients have been enlisted to spread the anti-infection gospel, urged to watch whether their doctors wash their hands and to remind them if they do not. Doctors have been told to receive such reminders with a polite thank you, said Iris Jimenez-Hernandez, Woodhull’s chief executive.“It has been a culture change,” said Dr. Jose O. Mejia, chairman of Woodhull’s department of medicine and critical care division.But the checklist can be cumbersome and time-consuming. The team treating the woman in respiratory failure last week fidgeted nervously as they waited for their referee to tick off the items.The attending physician, Dr. Rose Marie Flores, said doctors in the emergency room do not always have time to follow the list to the letter. But once the patients are stabilized, she said, they go back and do it all over again.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Michael Rossman, an organizer of the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley, who was later known for his books on politics, society and education, died May 12 at his home in Berkeley. He was 68.The cause was leukemia, his wife, Karen McLellan, said.Mr. Rossman’s first book, “The Wedding Within the War” (Doubleday, 1971), was a collection of essays chronicling his experiences in the free speech, antiwar and counterculture movements. Reviewing the collection in The New York Times Book Review, the historian Martin Duberman called it “a dazzling, moving book,” adding: “I find the life Rossman is trying to fashion for himself admirable, and the book he’s written about it exhilarating.”Mr. Rossman’s other books include “On Learning and Social Change” (Random House, 1972) and “New Age Blues: On the Politics of Consciousness” (Dutton, 1979).Michael Dale Rossman was born on Dec. 15, 1939, in Denver and reared in Northern California. His father, Harold, was the editor of The Labor Herald, the weekly newspaper of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in California. Mr. Rossman studied at the University of Chicago before transferring to Berkeley, from which he received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1963.Mr. Rossman was a graduate student in math at Berkeley when the Free Speech Movement burst into being on Oct. 1, 1964. He was among the hundreds of students who massed around a police car that day and the next to stop officers from taking away the civil rights organizer Jack Weinberg. (Mr. Weinberg had been arrested for violating a longstanding university ban on political advocacy on campus.)A close friend of Mario Savio, the movement’s best-known leader, Mr. Rossman left graduate school in 1966 to devote himself to activism, lecturing on campuses around the country. The Free Speech Movement, which quickly spread to other universities, made political discourse a basic right on college campuses throughout the nation.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','Microsoft has proposed a complex new deal with Yahoo that would involve collaboration between their online advertising businesses but would not involve a full takeover, Microsoft said on Sunday.Microsoft released a brief statement on Sunday disclosing the renewed talks, a surprising reversal just weeks after Microsoft withdrew its $47.5 billion takeover bid for Yahoo and said it had “moved on.” The statement hints that Microsoft may later seek to reenter merger negotiations.In the statement, Microsoft said it was “considering and has raised with Yahoo an alternative that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not an acquisition of all of Yahoo.” Microsoft provided no additional details.People involved in the confidential discussions said the talks center on a partnership or joint venture for search-related advertising to compete against Google. When Microsoft first made its unsolicited bid of $31 a share for Yahoo in February, it said it was doing so as part of its battle to increase its relatively small slice of the search-related advertising market against Google, a behemoth with more than 58 percent of the market.The timing of Microsoft’s new approach may seem opportunistic. Yahoo has been racing to complete its own partnership with Google and was expected to announce a formal agreement as early as this week. A Yahoo-Google partnership, which is likely to face antitrust scrutiny, could make Yahoo a less desirable partner or takeover candidate for Microsoft.'"

"'08-05-19,'1','The museum’s former curator, Alan Borg, whose 13-year tenure as director ended in 1995, encouraged innovative approaches by reminding his staff that “the three most off-putting words in the English language” were encompassed by the museum’s name.“And we have to fight against that,” said Terry Charman, the museum’s senior historian and curator of the Bond exhibition. But judging by the enthusiasm of the visitors, concerns about the frivolousness some of Britain’s more sniffy critics have discerned in the Bond show seem misplaced.The display explores the relationship between Fleming and Bond, examining how much of the fictional spy is built on the author’s character — the degree to which Bond was his “fantasy version of himself,” as Mr. Charman put it. As well, it shows how the debonair Fleming drew on his experiences as a man about town and as a prewar foreign correspondent, in the world of banking and investment, in his postwar sojourns in Jamaica, and as a World War II aide to the head of Britain’s directorate of naval intelligence, to give what he described as “verisimilitude” to Bond’s world of spies and villains and romance.Of his Bond plots, Fleming, ever prosaic about his talent, said, “I extracted them from my wartime memories, dolled them up, attached a hero and a villain, and there was the book.” For M, Bond’s irascible, domineering secret service overseer, he had as a model Rear Adm. John Godfrey, his wartime intelligence chief; old school friends, golfing partners, and girlfriends also metamorphosed into Bond characters. Even his villains had real-life antecedents.Auric Goldfinger, “a misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face” in Fleming’s description, had the author’s “flat golf swing” and the surname of a prominent Hungarian-born British architect, Erno Goldfinger, whose penchant for concrete tower blocks Fleming abhorred. Rosa Klebb of Smersh, “a dreadful chunk of a woman” and “a toadlike figure” to Fleming, had her likeness in Maj. Tamara Nikolayeva Ivanova, a notoriously sadistic K.G.B. agent. Ernst Stavro Blofeld, “with lips that suggest contempt, tyranny and cruelty,” got his name from a Fleming schoolmate at Eton. Odd Job, Goldfinger’s enforcer and “a uniquely dreadful person,” drew his deadly missile of a bowler hat from Fleming’s knowledge of the nefarious uses to which British intelligence services made of everyday headgear.The disciplines Fleming absorbed as a correspondent for Reuters in the 1930s made him a stickler for accuracy, and the exhibition shows how this fed into Bond’s guns. A luxuriantly mustached British gun expert, Geoffrey Boothroyd, reproved Fleming in a 1950s letter for Bond’s “rather deplorable taste in firearms” — in particular the penchant of the early Bond for a Beretta pistol, which Mr. Boothroyd, later the model for Major Boothroyd, Bond’s secret service armorer, described as “a ladies’ gun.” At Mr. Boothroyd’s urging, the Bond of “Dr. No” and later novels progressed to a Walther PPK and what Mr. Boothroyd described as “a real man-stopper,” a Smith & Wesson .38 Centennial Airweight.Bond himself, Fleming said, was “a compound of all the secret agents and commandos I met during the war,” but his tastes — in blondes, martinis “shaken, not stirred,” expensively tailored suits, scrambled eggs, short-sleeved shirts and Rolex watches — were Fleming’s own. But not all the comparisons were ones the author liked to encourage. Bond, he said, had “more guts than I have” as well as being “more handsome.” And he was eager to discourage the idea that he had been as much of a Lothario as Bond before his marriage to Ann Rothermere, whom he wed in 1952, the year he wrote “Casino Royale.”But the exhibition suggests otherwise. A section of the show titled “Friends and Lovers” has one of a stable of prewar girlfriends, Mary Pakenham, saying of Fleming, “No one I know had sex so much on the brain as Ian.” And another entry records the disdain of Fleming’s mother, Evelyn St. Croix Fleming, widowed when Fleming’s father, Valentine, was killed at the front in World War I, after she found black boa feathers littered across the back seat of her chauffeur-driven Daimler on the morning after Fleming borrowed the car for a night out — and a backseat romp — with a nightclub dancer called Storm.'"
"'08-05-19,'1','The dance’s most risky feature has always been its time structure. You watch solos, duet, trios, sextets, a quintet, people coming and going. In a dim performance the sequence feels too amorphous. In a strong account, though, it’s no more shapeless than multiple-narrative works like George Eliot’s “Middlemarch” or Robert Altman’s “Nashville.” The “Dances” narratives contain an unstressed partner-swapping that is part of the ballet’s strangeness: not free love so much as isolated moments of interlocking lives. The focal dancer of one scene becomes a side player in the next.The opening solo is like the narrator of Brian Friel’s “Dancing at Lughnasa,” first saying, “I remember Ballybeg,” then re-entering a past Ballybeg from which he is now forever distanced. “Dances” also has, like many Friel plays, powerfully Chekhovian qualities: prose and lyricism, nostalgia and optimism, individuals within a community. Though its qualities of outgoing openness and energy remain American, it is laden with references to the Old World.In particular, the memories here are of Polish folk dance: Robbins plays with the footwork and upper-body gestures of the mazurka much as Chopin nostalgically re-imagined its music. At one point in the final dance, the man whose solo opens the ballet slowly reaches down to touch the floor, while all the other dancers turn to watch him. Mr. Kobborg played this in an affectingly tentative way, as if it were something he needed to do, but didn’t know what he meant by it.The new staging is rivetingly eloquent in solos and duets, and very definitely has the quality the ballet had when it was young both in New York and London: it makes each dancer look more unaffectedly distinctive than ever before. I love its ensembles best of all: in the quintet and in several sextets there are moments when you feel your heart is brimming with emotion because these people are so intensely rapt in the moment. The Royal dancers were (in order of appearance) Mr. Kobborg, Tamara Rojo, Federico Bonelli, Alina Cojocaru, Martin Harvey, Laura Morera, Sarah Lamb, José Martin, Sergei Polunin, Lauren Cuthbertson. (At the evening performance, with Ms. Cojocaru coping with a neck injury, Marianela Nuñez danced parts of her role.)Ms. Morera was overbright at times; the frank, handsome Mr. Harvey and the radiant Ms. Lamb sometimes overdid social charm; neither Ms. Morera (surprisingly) nor Ms. Rojo showed the complete accuracy of musical timing that can make these dances spine-tingling.Elsewhere, however, there were innumerable moments of musical felicity: Mr. Kobborg, Mr. Bonelli, Ms. Cojocaru, Mr. Harvey, Ms. Lamb and Ms. Cuthbertson made you attend to different Chopinian layers of meter, rubato and attack, like separate but connecting areas of the soul. This is today’s Royal Ballet at its best, and the dancer to single out is Ms. Cojocaru: her quiet innocence and meticulous lucidity go straight to the heart of Robbins’s lyric poetry.But we live in strange times. After presenting a “Dances at a Gathering” far more detailed and momentous than New York City Ballet gave last spring, the Royal then performed “The Dream” — made by Frederick Ashton for this company in 1964 — worse than American Ballet Theater’s revival last spring.Every leading ballet company today has its own Jekyll-Hyde dualism. But the movingly multilayered drama of these “Dances” compensated for the less fortunate qualities of this “Dream” revival. In the British account of Robbins’s memory ballet, paradoxically, you again feel him in the present tense.'"

"'08-05-19,'1','Was it Senator John McCain’s jokes about his age? Or was it Steve Carell, the guest host of “Saturday Night Live”?For whatever reason, the comedy show drew one of its highest ratings of the season Saturday, and the highest rating of a season finale in three years, NBC said.Mr. McCain, the expected Republican nominee, chased after the youth vote in two cameo appearances. In the first, a political-ad parody, Mr. McCain, 71, joked: “I ask you, what should we be looking for in our next president? Certainly, someone who is very, very, very old.”Mr. McCain then segued into a riff on earmarks, the pork barrel spending that he denounces almost daily on the campaign trail. Mr. McCain proudly said he had sought not a single earmark for his home state of Arizona. “When I entered the Senate in 1987, Arizona had 47,000 miles of paved roadway,” he said. “Today it’s less than 900.”On the show’s “Weekend Update” segment, Mr. McCain told Democrats not to pick a presidential nominee too soon. “If come November, you still haven’t decided,” Mr. McCain said, “I’d be willing to set aside my differences with your party and say, ‘Hey, let’s put both of them on the ballot!’ ”Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton made a cameo appearance on “Saturday Night Live” in March and Senator Barack Obama was briefly on the show in November.'"

"'08-05-20,'0','The Obama campaign quickly sent out a response from Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, both supporters with foreign policy experience who argued the country needed a change from a Bush administration approach that had for much of the past seven years frowned upon dialogue with certain adversaries, though it has more recently shown signs of shifting.""John McCain needs to explain why continuing to do exactly what George Bush has done will somehow produce a different result,” Mr. Dodd said.Mr. Obama’s record on Cuba is mixed. While campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Obama said he favored beginning taking steps to normalize relations only if the Cuban government takes meaningful steps toward democracy.But when he was running for United States Senate in Illinois in 2003, Mr. Obama said in a questionnaire that he favored normalizing relations with Cuba but did not offer any qualifiers.Mr. McCain has his own conflicting past statements to contend with. When he was running for president in 2000, Mr. McCain stood out for supporting normalizing relations with Cuba, even if Fidel Castro remained in power, provided the government went through certain steps to democratize its country, similar to the road map to normalizing relations with Vietnam.The difference with his position now appears to be primarily one of emphasis, with Mr. McCain forcefully contending the Cuban embargo should be kept in place until certain specific political freedoms are restored.“My administration will press the Cuban regime to release all political prisoners unconditionally, to legalize all political parties, labor unions and free media, and to schedule internationally monitored elections,” Mr. McCain said. “The embargo must stay in place until these basic elements of democratic society are met.”But Mr. McCain said in 1999, according to The Miami Herald, that if Castro took certain steps, he would be willing to wait on the goal of supervised free elections before beginning steps toward normalization.Both campaigns have engaged in sound bites and simplifications of these major policy differences, but in explaining, defending and attacking each other, they have revealed clear distinctions in their beliefs in the efficacy of diplomacy.The jumping off point for the debate has continued to be Mr. Obama’s response at a Democratic debate last year in which he said he would be willing to sit down without preconditions with the leaders of certain countries, including Cuba and Iran. The response exposed him to repeated broadsides, at first from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Democratic opponent, and now Mr. McCain.Mr. Obama has since on Iran sought to draw a distinction between such engagement by an Obama administration and his personal involvement as president, saying the latter would require the Iranians’ meeting certain benchmarks.But Mr. Obama has repeatedly argued that the United States needs to be willing to engage in dialogue with all countries, including enemies, while Mr. McCain has stuck much closer to the stance that largely characterized the Bush administration, maintaining that diplomatic engagement is a privilege.More recently, however, the Bush administration has edged toward a greater willingness to engage countries like Syria, Iran and North Korea, where the administration has claimed important progress in reaching an agreement to dismantle the country’s nuclear program.Mr. McCain has said he does not oppose lower-level discussions with adversaries under certain conditions but singled out the notion of a presidential-level visit as a carrot that must be handled with care to avoid enhancing the prestige of a despotic leader.Expanding upon his critique of Mr. Obama while speaking with reporters aboard his campaign bus on Tuesday, Mr. McCain repeatedly voiced skepticism at what he described as the “school of thought” that urges, “Let’s sit down and talk, and we can work everything out,” arguing such efforts have failed repeatedly in history.“It’s happened time after time after time,” he said. “Unfortunately, generally speaking, unless there are reasons and national security interests involved in both parties, then they don’t work.”'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Most of his clients are private equity lenders and hedge funds that ask him to conduct management background checks at companies they are looking at, and to look into suspicions of wrongdoing at companies they hold stakes in.There is plenty of wrongdoing out there. Employee theft alone exceeds $400 billion annually, according to Automatic Data Processing, the nation’s largest provider of payroll services. With the economy in the doldrums, the problem may well get worse.After spending nearly three decades investigating larceny in the workplace, Mr. Springer has some suggestions, especially for smaller companies, which are particularly vulnerable.Few face greater risks than start-ups. Mr. Springer cited a technology company that grew from 50 to 500 employees in nine months and recruited a seasoned project manager to handle its physical expansion. The manager hired an acquaintance as his sole contractor and in collusion with him signed off on fraudulent invoices. The company managed to get back $1 million of the $3 million they stole.Mr. Springer’s primary recommendation is to screen all potential employees, starting with their résumés. If you detect a single lie, he says, throw the résumé in the wastebasket.Be wary, too, of claims that are difficult to verify, gaps in applicants’ job histories and vague descriptions of what they did.If, for example, the computer hardware company tried to contact the three references listed by the candidate for chief financial officer, it would have learned that one was dead, one did not exist and the third had a low opinion of the candidate. Everything the man said about his wife was true, though — except that her accident occurred three years after his bankruptcy filing, not shortly before it.Once hired, the executive began his scheme almost immediately, buying a large number of computers, returning most of them and depositing the refund checks in an account that he had opened with the same name as the company’s except that it had L.L.C. at the end instead of Inc.Mr. Springer suggests that after authenticating the facts in a job candidate’s résumé, a background check should be done.Payroll companies and other concerns often offer basic screening for $100 to $400, Mr. Springer said. Automatic Data Processing, for example, offers the service on a Web page that flashes statistics like “One out of every 20 job applicants screened last year had a criminal record” and “Nearly 1,000 workers are murdered and 1.5 million are assaulted in the workplace each year.”Mr. Springer also mentioned HireRight and National Applicant Screening. Searching the Web with the words “employment screening,” “pre-employment screening” and “employee background check” yields hundreds of leads.If you are unable to verify important information, you may have to turn to detective operations like Mr. Springer’s, Huhn & Associates or the risk consulting giant Kroll Inc. (Because smaller companies often need to farm out work where they lack a physical presence, collaboration among them is common.)His company’s fees are generally $2,000 to $5,000 a person for management background checks and $25,000 to $50,000 for corporate investigations. He expects strong growth for his company and the industry, largely because more companies will need investigative services in an increasingly global economy. He sees Asia and Latin America as the hottest markets.Even the lowliest worker can create havoc. Mr. Springer recounted the case of a cashier at a home supply store who gave away $225,000 in merchandise over three years to a contractor in exchange for kickbacks. Corporate Resolutions caught them, and they agreed to repay the owner.Another factor in the growth in his business, Mr. Springer said, is the sputtering economy. As layoffs increase, so does employee theft, he said. And as loan defaults rise, so does the need for banks to track down the assets of borrowers.Here are more tips from Mr. Springer to preventing wrongdoing:¶Require job applicants to sign an agreement that allows you to do background checks and drug tests on them at any time during their employment.¶Make it clear that you plan to conduct such investigations. The troublemakers and other bad eggs will probably walk away.¶Make sure current employees know that everything on the company computer is company property, and that you have the right — and intention — to monitor their use and their e-mail messages. Follow through on that surveillance.¶Switch people’s responsibilities to prevent fraud. “One of the most common forms of employee theft is when the product is being loaded on a truck,” Mr. Springer said. “You’ve got to have cameras, you’ve got to keep changing people’s assignments.”¶Do random checks, like following trucks carrying your merchandise. If the driver makes an unauthorized stop at a warehouse or home, he is probably about to unload some of it.¶Look for red flags, for example, employees who never take a day off, a sign that they may be covering up a fraud.¶Put somebody in charge of security, whether your own employee or an outside company’s.¶Buy fidelity insurance to cover theft by employees and vendors, which on average represents 5 percent of a company’s revenue.¶Never let the chief financial officer write checks or open mail.¶Set up a whistle-blower hot line for employees to report illegal or unethical behavior. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, aimed at cleaning up corporate accounting, requires this at public companies, but privately held firms ought to follow suit. (Corporate Resolutions, for instance, provides the service for $2,200 a year.) Now is a good time to take the step, Mr. Springer said, because as the economy has weakened, anonymous allegations of malfeasance are on the rise.¶Act on anonymous tips. At a company in South Florida that Mr. Springer worked for, a whistle-blower accused the chief executive of stealing, but the board of directors ignored the warning because it was negotiating with a prospective buyer. The tipster went to a local newspaper, and the deal fell through.¶Expect some allegations to be false. Mr. Springer once investigated the background of an executive who was the target of a sexual harassment complaint, but found no evidence of inappropriate behavior. Finally, he tracked down the accuser’s college roommate. “Do you mean,” the woman asked, “that she has filed another lawsuit?”'"

"'08-05-20,'0','A lawyer for the former N.B.A. referee Tim Donaghy suggested in court papers Monday that games had been influenced by relationships among referees, coaches and players, and that other factors had “prevented games from being played on a level playing field.” The league immediately denounced the charges as unfounded.According to documents filed by the lawyer, John Lauro, Donaghy provided law enforcement officials with information about N.B.A. matters outside of the government’s original investigation. That included information about the gambling activities of other referees and an instance in which confidential information was suspected of being passed from a referee to a coach.Lauro filed a letter and several attachments as part of a sentencing memorandum, which is to be considered by United States District Judge Carol B. Amon. Donaghy, who pleaded guilty last August to two felony charges, is to be sentenced July 14.Donaghy could face up to 25 years in prison and a $500,000 fine for receiving payments for inside information on N.B.A. games, including some that he officiated. But he is expected to receive a much lighter sentence because he cooperated with the authorities.In a footnote to the document, Lauro suggested that the N.B.A. might have “pressured” the United States attorney’s office “into shutting down this prosecution to avoid the disclosure of information unrelated to Tim’s conduct.”'"

"'08-05-20,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — A lawyer for the controversial track coach Trevor Graham said in opening arguments at trial Monday that Graham was “the original Balco whistleblower” and “a convenient scapegoat” for disgruntled former sprinters who used performance-enhancing drugs on their own.The lawyer, William P. Keane, said Graham “misspoke” when he denied to federal agents four years ago that he had met Angel Guillermo Heredia, a self-confessed drug adviser and distributor, but told the truth when he said he had very little contact with Heredia.Keane predicted that Heredia, the government’s key witness, would be discredited for telling lies in an attempt to get favorable treatment from the government for his drug-distribution activities. Heredia, 33, of Laredo, Tex., has cooperated with the government since 2005.“The evidence is going to show a striking lack of corroboration,” Keane said.Graham is charged with three counts of making false statements to federal agents. His trial is expected to last about two weeks. Graham, 44, of Raleigh, N.C., could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. His case is the second arising from the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative investigation to reach trial. Eight other people have pleaded guilty to various crimes, and the cyclist Tammy Thomas was found guilty of perjury.For the prosecution, the assistant United States Attorney Jeffrey R. Finigan told the jury that evidence would show that Graham referred many athletes to Heredia for drugs, and that he received drugs from Heredia to provide to others, including the star sprinter Marion Jones.'"

"'08-05-20,'0','When people first learn how to read, they want to let people know, Mr. Kalra said, and “the first thing you want to do is be seen to be reading a newspaper.”The literacy rate in India hovers at about 61 percent, according to Unesco, but the number of literate youths (ages 15 to 24) is above 76 percent, signaling that education is improving. The number of daily newspapers grew to 287 in 2006 from 185 in 2005, according to the World Association of Newspapers.Global newspaper advertising spending will increase to $130 billion in 2010 from $125 billion in 2007, according to ZenithOptimedia, partly as a result of growth in India and other emerging markets. That trend is reversed in North America, where newspaper advertising revenue in the United States fell 7.9 percent in 2007, according to the Newspaper Association of America.A jump in income in many emerging markets often corresponds with an increased desire for business news, as consumers become investors in local or international markets. Meanwhile, an increasingly global financial system means that experienced investors are active in once far-away corners.“We do see a big potential in emerging markets,” said John Ridding, chief executive of The Financial Times, which is based in London. “There is strong and growing demand from these markets for strong industry and business analysis.”In April, The Financial Times, a unit of Pearson, started a Middle East edition from Abu Dhabi with expanded local coverage, and Mr. Ridding hopes it will increase the paper’s circulation “substantially” from the several thousand readers it currently has in the area.In India, The Financial Times sees “big opportunities for expansion” and is working on an “exciting project,” about which he would not elaborate.In China, The Financial Times is about to start a monthly Chinese language magazine called RUI, which in Mandarin Chinese means “intelligence.” The magazine, aimed at the upper-middle-class Chinese consumer, will carry a mix of lifestyle and money management articles.While spending on Internet advertising is rapidly increasing in the United States and Western Europe, the faster-growing markets of Asia and Latin America are all about old media, said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of the advertising company WPP Group, in February. But it is still unclear whether foreign newspaper companies will be able to make up revenue they have lost in the West in these new markets.Media companies in emerging markets, though, are enjoying growth their Western counterparts can only envy. “Unlike the developed markets, India is at a fundamentally different stage of its life” when it comes to media consumption, said Haresh Chawla, group chief executive of Network 18, a media conglomerate. The company also has a joint venture with CNBC, as well as with Viacom, which brings MTV and Nickelodeon to Indian audiences.“There is a huge synergy in news gathering,” and owning a newspaper will round out Network 18’s media offerings, Mr. Chawla said.'"
"'08-05-20,'0','For the business travelers who make up the majority of air taxi customers, the companies represent time saved. “Think of us,” said one, Linear Air, “as a car service with wings.”The air taxi companies use small jets or propeller aircraft, usually on set routes. Most operate from uncrowded secondary airports and fly from one small city to another — avoiding the time-consuming connections at big hubs, typical of flights on major airlines.The result, the air taxi companies argue, is that a business trip that will often require an overnight stay using commercial airlines can be done in a day because the traveler can fly directly to the meeting site.DayJet, which is based in Boca Raton, Fla., and began flying last year, is the biggest air taxi operator, the most aggressive and so far the hardest hit by the credit crisis. A second company, Pogo Jet, has also been affected, postponing an initial public offering originally set for March. It now says it plans to begin operations next year.The other companies, because they had already lined up financing or use less expensive propeller planes or have more modest expansion plans, are doing all right, so far. And while the rapid rise in fuel prices has not helped any of the air taxi companies, it has not hurt them particularly either because all are using aircraft that are new, high-performance and fuel-efficient.The air taxi companies are not the only ones rooting for their model to work. The major manufacturers of the class of aircraft called very light jets also have a vested interest. Eclipse Aviation, the maker of the jets used by DayJet, claims over 2,600 orders for its Eclipse 500, but has not yet come close to the production level of 500 jets a year it says it needs to be profitable.Other manufacturers include Cessna, Embraer and Honda. Embraer, in fact, recently announced that it would open an assembly plant in Florida to produce some of its Phenom 100 very light jets.DayJet has a fleet of 28 Eclipse 500s, which are the best-selling model of very light jets. The company also uses sophisticated technology that efficiently positions aircraft and analyzes fares, making it the leading innovator in selling on-demand, per-seat fares. It currently flies to 45 community airports in Florida and nearby states.Mr. Iacobucci said the “proof of concept” phase is successful. DayJet has about 1,600 members, nearly all of them business travelers, who pay an annual fee to register. About 200 are frequent fliers. “Our average ticket price is in the $600 to $700 range, exactly where we want to be” for flights of less than 300 miles, he said.But the tight credit markets have put its future in jeopardy.“Our target was to wind up the year with about 100 aircraft and something like 30 to 40 markets fully developed, which we considered was critical mass,” Mr. Iacobucci said.Can DayJet make it without expanding to that critical mass? “Absolutely not,” Mr. Iacobucci conceded. He said he nevertheless believed that critical investment would materialize as it became more clear that air taxis were practical and would become more so in the future. “For us, it’s all a matter of timing,” he said.DayJet says its fares are slightly more than a typical walkup coach fare on a scheduled airline. The industry, in general, promotes its fares at about half the price of a charter flight and heavily markets the ease of travel.Currently, the only jets used by air taxi businesses in this country are $1.6 million Eclipse 500s, which were the first to market. Linear Air, which operates in New England and nearby states, flies mostly eight-passenger Cessna Grand Caravan propeller planes, but plans to buy seven Eclipse 500s, which fly about twice as fast. Linear plans to acquire eight more Eclipse 500s by the end of the year to augment its growing business.SATSair, based in Greenville, S.C., is also expanding its air taxi service throughout the Southeast. SATSair flies four-passenger, short-haul Cirrus SR22 propeller planes that use a single pilot, and are equipped with a high-tech parachute intended to glide the plane down safely in case of emergencies.SATSair says it operated 16,000 flights in 27 states last year — 60 percent more than the previous year.Pogo, whose management team is led by Robert Crandall, the former chief executive officer of American Airlines, said it plans to start an air taxi business with Eclipse 500 jets at several hundred general aviation airports within about 600 miles of New York City. It says service will start in the second quarter of 2009.Not all air taxis offer the kind of on-demand, per-seat service that DayJet’s sophisticated logistical technology allows.“There are a variety of air taxi models, but they all center on one thing: putting the on-demand price-point within reach,” said Joe Leader, the president of the Air Taxi Association (www.atxa.com), founded last year to promote the growth of air taxis in the United States are abroad.One of the biggest new ventures is JetSuite, an air taxi business started by a group that is headed by Alex Wilcox, who was a founding executive at JetBlue. JetSuite, which plans to fly routes in Southern California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, has ordered 50 of the Phenom 100 very light jets, which are being produced by the big Brazilian aircraft company Embraer.In Europe, Mr. Leader said, several air taxi start-ups are flying the new Cessna Citation Mustang model, which at $2.65 million is at the high end of the very light jet market.Air taxis, whether they operate on a per-seat or per-plane model (which is how ground taxicabs typically operate) present “an evolutionary step that will probably lead to a revolutionary change in how we travel” as big airlines are cutting service and leaving some markets altogether, Mr. Leader said.'"

"'08-05-20,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency initially supported giving California full or partial permission to limit tailpipe emissions, but reversed himself after hearing from the White House, a Congressional report says.The report, by the Democratic staff of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, cites sworn depositions by high-level officials of the agency and amounts to the first solid evidence of the political interference alleged by Democrats and environmentalists since the administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, denied California’s request in December.Mr. Johnson has defended the decision as his alone. He has refused to say whether there was White House pressure.In the course of its investigation, the committee deposed eight officials of the agency and reviewed more than 27,000 pages of E.P.A. documents, some obtained under subpoena.The committee found, as has been previously reported, that the agency’s career staff was unanimously in favor of at least partly granting the California waiver and advised Mr. Johnson that any other decision would be unlikely to stand up in court.'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Mr. Obama countered on Monday, saying the Bush administration’s policy in the Middle East had only strengthened Iran and that meeting with Iranians was “common sense.”“The threat from Iran is grave,” Mr. Obama said. “But what I have said is we should not just be willing to talk to our friends, we should engage with our enemies as well. That is what diplomacy is all about.”Speaking in Billings, Mont., a day before Democratic primaries in Oregon and Kentucky, Mr. Obama said that during the most dangerous period of the Cold War, President John F. Kennedy had been willing to meet with the Soviets to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis.“That is what strong countries do,” he said. “That is what strong presidents do.”As the Democratic primaries draw to a close, Senator Obama chalked up another endorsement from a senior party leader. Senator Robert C. Byrd, of West Virginia, endorsed Mr. Obama, calling him “a shining young statesmen.” Mr. Byrd, the longest serving member of the Senate, called both candidates “extraordinary individuals.” But Mr. Byrd, a strong opponent of the war in Iraq, said Mr. Obama had the “personal temperament and courage necessary to extricate our country from this costly misadventure in Iraq.”“Barack Obama is a noble-hearted patriot and humble Christian, and he has my full faith and support,” Mr. Byrd said.In his speech in Billings, Mr. Obama downplayed concerns that the long primary race between him and Senator Hillary Clinton would hurt the Democratic Party’s chances in November. He said whatever differences there might be between him and Senator Clinton, the two candidates and their supporters would put their divisions aside in November.“We are going to be united,” Mr. Obama said.Senator Clinton, who has scheduled a series of appearances in Kentucky on Monday, signaled her clear intention to remain in the race until the last primaries on June 3.“This is nowhere near over,” Mrs. Clinton told supporters during an appearance in Maysville.Mrs. Clinton said she had won more popular votes in the primary than Mr. Obama, and warned Mr. Obama’s supporters from claiming that their candidate had won the nomination before the final primaries and before the party settles what to do about votes cast in Florida and Michigan. The Democratic Party has said delegates from those states would not be seated because the state’s primaries were held earlier than party leaders allowed.“None of us is going to have the number of delegates we’re going to need to get to the nomination, although I understand my opponent and his supporters are going to claim that,” she said. “The fact is we have to include Michigan and Florida. We cannot claim that we have a nominee based on 48 states, particularly two states that are so important for us to win in the fall.”'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Then, with seven minutes remaining, Phoenix is to plunge into the atmosphere at 12,750 miles an hour, where friction will slow it, heating the shield to 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. At 8 miles in altitude and 1,000 miles an hour, the spacecraft will deploy its parachute for the next three minutes of descent, when it is to jettison the heat shield, extend its three landing legs and begin using its radar to gather readings on its speed and distance from the surface.At six-tenths of a mile above the surface and 125 miles an hour, Phoenix is to separate from its parachute and the back shell that holds it and begin the sequential firing of 12 rocket thrusters that slow it to landing at 5 1/2 miles an hour 40 seconds later.It has been 32 years since NASA, with the twin Viking landers in 1976, has put a craft on the Martian surface using rockets to slow the descent. The last previous attempt was the 1999 Mars Polar Lander, which crashed when its engines cut off prematurely.The later Mars Pathfinder and the two robot rovers, the Opportunity and the Spirit, which have operated for three years in the equatorial region, landed using air bags to cushion the impact. Mr. Goldstein said air bags were not practical for heavier craft like the Phoenix because the added weight of bigger bags would severely cut into the scientific payload.Unlike the wheeled rovers, the Mars Phoenix Lander is to stay in one spot and dig for evidence of water and other conditions that could have supported primitive life.Although there are ample indications that Mars had surface water billions of years ago — in some cases, evidence suggests that water may have flowed in some gullies and channels within the last few millions of years or later — conditions today, including an atmosphere 1 percent as dense as Earth’s, do not allow for liquid water, scientists said. But, instruments on the Mars Odyssey orbiter discovered in 2002 that plentiful water ice lay just beneath the surface throughout much of high-latitude Mars.The target landing area for the Phoenix, surveyed in detail by the high-resolution camera aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, is a permafrost region with few rocks or deep slopes that could threaten the lander, said Dr. Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis, chairman of the landing-site working group. “This is one of the least rocky areas on all of Mars,” he said.Dr. Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, the principal scientist for the $420 million mission, said that the area was covered with polar ice in winter, but that the Phoenix was to land in early summer, when the frozen surface is mostly clear and the soil is exposed for study. The 770-pound lander, with a 121-pound science payload, is to spend at least three months examining the surface with a trench-digging robot arm.The Phoenix is named after the mythical bird that rose from its ashes, because the spacecraft is made up of parts from two earlier attempts to explore Mars. The spacecraft has the skeleton and some instruments from the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, which remained grounded because of cost overruns, as well as instruments that are based on those aboard the unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander.Dr. Smith said scientists and engineers went through the castoff parts system by system, found almost two dozen potentially fatal flaws that could doom a mission and fixed them. “We re-engineered the spacecraft without rebuilding it,” he said. “We think it’s as good as it can be.”If the Phoenix survives its landing, it will wait 20 minutes for debris at the site to settle before unfurling two circular solar power arrays that will make its width 18 feet across. Next, two stereoscopic color cameras will rise on a mast that extends seven feet above the surface to record panoramic views of the surroundings. Then a four-foot mast bearing temperature, wind and other sensors is to extend from an onboard weather station supplied by the Canadian Space Agency.The spacecraft, sterilized to prevent contamination by Earth organisms, is to use its 7.7-foot-long robot arm like a backhoe to dig a series of trenches more than 20 inches into the surface with a movable metal scoop that has sharp prongs on the end to break and scrape expected hard surface, Dr. Smith said.Using a camera on the end of the scoop, scientists will select samples for detailed study aboard the lander. In one experiment, samples will be dropped into a hopper to feed eight tiny one-use ovens. Each is about a half-inch long and one-eighth inch in diameter.The sample will be slowly heated to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit to study the transition from solid to liquid to gas, and the vapors analyzed by a mass spectrometer to measure the mass and composition of specific molecules.This laboratory also contains two microscopes to examine the fine structure of soil and ice samples, scrutinizing features as small as one one-thousandth the width of a human hair that might be evidence of past liquid water on the planet. The Phoenix is designed to operate in the Martian summer, but scientists hope that it survives into at least mid-November. Winter brings months of darkness and no power to protect the spacecraft from a fatal deep freeze before the Sun returns, they said.“It’s extraordinarily unlikely the vehicle will survive,” said Mr. Goldstein, the project manager. But on the outside chance that spring sunlight recharges the craft next year, he said, it has been programmed with a “Lazarus mode” to signal that it has risen from the dead.'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Microsoft released a brief statement on Sunday disclosing the renewed talks, a surprising reversal just weeks after it withdrew its $47.5 billion bid for Yahoo and said it had “moved on.”In an e-mail message to Microsoft employees on Sunday afternoon, a senior Microsoft executive seemed to acknowledge that moving on might be difficult.In his memo, Kevin Johnson, the executive in charge of Microsoft’s Internet business, emphasized the urgency felt at Microsoft about its failure to make more progress in catching up to Google.“Regardless of the outcome of any new discussions,” he wrote, “it is important that we continue to move forward to strengthen our online services business. The fact is that we are not where we want to be in this business yet and we’ve been in this position longer than we’d all like.”Mr. Johnson then outlined Microsoft’s ambitious agenda in Internet search and online advertising, exploiting the company’s strengths in desktop software and newer fields like cellphone software. Among the goals enumerated in the memo are to “innovate and disrupt in search,” “win in display” ads online and “reinvent portal and social media experiences.”Microsoft’s hastily revived effort to reach some kind of deal with Yahoo seems to suggest that the software giant has doubts about whether it can achieve those goals on its own.Indeed, Microsoft’s on-again, off-again interest in Yahoo has raised questions from analysts, investors, customers and employees about its strategy. Amid the discussions, Microsoft is scheduled to present its online strategy to advertisers at a gathering this week.People involved in the confidential discussions between Microsoft and Yahoo said the talks centered on a partnership or joint venture for search-related advertising to compete against Google. When Microsoft first made its unsolicited bid of $31 a share for Yahoo in February, it said it was doing so as part of its battle to increase its relatively small slice of the search-related advertising market against Google, a giant with about 60 percent of the United States market, according to the measurement firm comScore.By comparison, Yahoo has about 21 percent of the market, and Microsoft has about 9 percent, comScore said.The timing of Microsoft’s new approach may be a turning point in the months-long story or just an opportunistic effort to further insert itself into a dance between Yahoo and Google. Yahoo has been racing to complete its own partnership with Google and was expected to announce a formal agreement as early as this week. A Yahoo-Google partnership, which would likely face antitrust scrutiny, could make Yahoo a less desirable partner or takeover candidate for Microsoft.The Google-Yahoo discussions have been centered around the notion of Google delivering ads alongside some Yahoo searches. Such a deal would help Yahoo generate more cash, because Google’s search advertising technology is more sophisticated and is used by more advertisers. As a result, Google earns more on every search than its competitors, on average.A similar partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft might not have the same effect, because Microsoft’s base of advertisers is smaller than Yahoo’s. People involved in the confidential discussions said that search advertising was certainly a part of Microsoft’s renewed interest in Yahoo, but they cautioned that any relationship being discussed might be different from the one the company had been contemplating with Google.It is unclear whether Microsoft would pursue a takeover bid again. In its statement on Sunday, Microsoft insisted it was not making such a bid, but hinted that it could be persuaded to reverse course.“Microsoft is not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo at this time, but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative depending on future developments and discussions that may take place with Yahoo or discussions with shareholders of Yahoo or Microsoft or with other third parties,” the company said.The new discussions also come as Yahoo is facing increasing pressure from shareholders, some of whom are furious that its board did not work harder to reach a deal to sell the company to Microsoft. Last week, Mr. Icahn said the directors had “acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders.” People close to Microsoft and Mr. Icahn say that neither has been in contact with the other.Yahoo released a statement late on Sunday saying that it continues to explore strategic alternatives and remains open to any proposals that are good for its shareholders.“Yahoo’s board of directors will evaluate each of our alternatives, including any Microsoft proposal, consistent with its fiduciary duties, with a focus on maximizing stockholder value,” the statement said. Yahoo also said that it had confirmed with Microsoft that the software giant was not interested an outright acquisition of Yahoo at this time.'"
"'08-05-20,'0','“If anyone argued it should return to where it was previously, that would be a mistake,” Hilary Benn, the British agriculture minister, said, referring to the agricultural policy.During the meeting, ministers discussed channeling more foreign aid to help developing countries improve their agricultural output. Some ministers also underlined the importance of developing fuels from agricultural waste to reduce demand for low-carbon fuels from crops, which could also be used for food.But, if anything, the rise in commodity prices has sharpened arguments on both sides about the future of farm policy, setting the scene for a divisive debate over the future of the 100 billion euro ($155 billion) budget — and over the agricultural policy in particular, which is worth more than 40 percent of that amount — later this year.“Views are diverging as to the line to be taken with regard to the CAP in the future,” the agriculture minister of Slovenia, Iztok Jarc, said. He added that the situation was complex because of the diverse causes of high commodity prices.Linked to Europe’s reluctance to overhaul its system more thoroughly is the logjam over agriculture at the World Trade Organization, where negotiations for a new global trade accord have repeatedly stalled. So long as American farm support remains in place, Europe would be unlikely to alter its existing system. Last week, American lawmakers generally confirmed continuation of the present system.Minor changes to the European farm subsidy system will be presented Tuesday by the European Commission, the union’s executive arm.The commission will propose abolishing the so-called set-aside — which requires some land to be kept out of production — as well as a special subsidy of 45 euros a hectare (2.5 acres), now given to farmers to grow crops for biofuels.The commission also will propose annual increases in milk production quotas ahead of the planned abolition of the quota system in 2015. And it will call for a ceiling on payments, reducing those given to such big landowners as the queen of England, in a move opposed by Britain and Germany, two nations that would lose most from such a move.Europe’s agricultural policy arose after World War II, when a scarred Western Europe sought to rebuild its crippled farming infrastructure and guarantee food supplies. A half-century later, new member countries like Hungary and promarket members like Britain argue that radical changes in the global marketplace mean agriculture has become much more profitable and sustainable and that the need for state subsidies is largely outdated.But Germany and France are arguing that the rise in food prices means subsidies should continue, with funds being diverted to revive investment in Europe’s farming sector to ensure steady and affordable supplies.The differences were magnified last week, when Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, sent a letter to colleagues appealing for changes to allow farmers to react more to demand.He said it was “unacceptable, that at a time of significant food price inflation, Europe continues to apply very high import tariffs to many agricultural commodities.”In the longer term he said Europe should end direct payments, worth 32 billion euros each year to farmers.The rising price of foodstuffs has been attributed largely to the rising cost of crude oil and natural gas, which in turn raises the cost of nitrogen fertilizer — a critical item for farmers.Other immediate factors are the rising costs of land and shipping, and the effect of poor harvests.Jonathan Blake, the manager of an agriculture fund begun Monday by Barings Asset Management in London, said that rising prices are also part of long-term population growth, increasing incomes in India and China, and climate change.“Pressure on food prices is immense,” Mr. Blake said. “Limited resources and bottlenecks mean that supply is struggling to keep pace with demand whilst global warming is likely to create additional pressure on supply in the years to come.”The European agriculture commissioner Mariann Fischer Boel sought to ease fears about the economic impact of rising food prices in her comments Monday to agriculture ministers. She said global food prices were likely to decline, after recent record highs in such crucial areas as grain and dairy, as supplies of basic commodities slowly began to increase.Even though adverse weather in many regions over several seasons had hurt supplies, the situation now seemed to be returning to normal and was set to take some pressure off prices, she said. Even so, she conceded that higher food prices were not temporary.“Prices are likely to fluctuate in the medium term around a level that is higher than what we have seen in recent decades,” she said. “But we do not think that the record levels reached in recent months are likely to persist.”'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Mr. Obama replied by saying Mr. McCain was “using the same George Bush textbook” that had brought “failed cowboy diplomacy.”Mr. Obama was campaigning in Montana, which holds its Democratic primary on June 3. Four other contests against Mrs. Clinton remain as well, including those in Kentucky and Oregon on Tuesday. He picked up five more superdelegates on Monday, including the Senate’s longest-serving member, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, less than a week after Mr. Byrd’s state went for Mrs. Clinton by 41 percentage points.That endorsement was emblematic of a nation vastly changed over the last half-century. Mr. Byrd once opposed integrating the military, filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, as a young man, was briefly a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He has frequently expressed regret for that past.As for Mrs. Clinton, she campaigned in Kentucky on Monday, telling voters there that “this is nowhere near over” and vowing to stay in the race until the last primaries.The attack by Mr. McCain was prompted by comments Mr. Obama made on Sunday in Pendleton, Ore., where he urged engagement of the nation’s foes and said that “strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries.”“That’s what Reagan did with Gorbachev,” he said, adding: “I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela — these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don’t pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying, ‘We’re going to wipe you off the planet.’ ”Mr. Obama said in a Democratic primary debate last year that he would be willing to sit down, without preconditions, with adversaries like the leaders of Iran. He has since sought to draw a distinction between such engagement by an Obama administration and his personal involvement as president, saying the latter would require the Iranians’ meeting certain benchmarks.But Mr. McCain, in his remarks here, said, “Senator Obama has declared and repeatedly reaffirmed his intention to meet the president of Iran without any preconditions, likening it to meetings between former American presidents and the leaders of the Soviet Union.”Such a position “betrays the depth of Senator Obama’s inexperience and reckless judgment,” Mr. McCain said, adding, “Those are very serious deficiencies for an American president to possess.”In his response later, Mr. Obama said: “Let me be absolutely clear. Iran is a grave threat.” But, he argued, just as “Kennedy talked to Khrushchev,” the United States should have the “courage and confidence” to talk to its current adversaries.“Demanding that a country meets all your conditions before you meet with them, that’s not a strategy,” he said. “It’s just naïve, wishful thinking.”The bulk of Mr. McCain’s remarks to the restaurant association dealt with the economy, on which he sought to distinguish himself from his Democratic counterparts over taxes, trade and farm subsidies. He told his audience that he supported President Bush’s threat to veto the farm bill overwhelmingly passed by Congress last week.“Senator Clinton and Senator Obama have agreed to raise your taxes, to regulate your business more than ever and to spend more of your money in Washington,” Mr. McCain said. “That’s their idea of change, but it sure sounds familiar to me.”Mr. McCain noted his presence in Mr. Obama’s hometown, drawing laughter and applause with a joke: “Many Democratic voters in Illinois are especially proud of their junior senator. They believe more than ever that Barack Obama was the right choice for the Senate in 2004. I couldn’t agree more, and I promise to do everything in my power to help him finish his first term in the United States Senate.”'"
"'08-05-20,'0','Still, some analysts suggest that Roku has broken new ground in technology and value.“It is the most impressive product we’ve seen attached to a TV this decade,” said Richard Doherty, the director of the Envisioneering Group, a consumer electronics consulting firm.He said that the device is easier to use, with better picture and sound, than competing devices. And it costs much less. “There is nothing like this,” he said.The biggest drawback to the Roku device is the selection available. Right now, Netflix offers instant Internet viewing of 10,000 movies and television episodes, compared with its inventory of 100,000 DVD titles.Because of the way Hollywood sells rights to its products, most of the Internet titles are more than five years old, although there are some newer independent films and TV shows.Netflix has allowed its subscribers to watch these films on their computers for about a year by streaming them over an Internet connection. Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said that the company’s experience with its existing service gives it confidence that there is a market for a set-top box.“Subscribers already use Netflix on the PC now, and this gives us a way to get to their television,” he said.Netflix customers who have plans that cost at least $8.99 a month will have access to an unlimited number of movies over the Internet.Netflix has agreed to license similar technology to other set-top box makers, including LG Electronics.The $229 Apple TV, the leading rival for Roku’s box, mainly offers movies and TV shows for purchase or pay-per-view rental, although it also offers free podcasts and YouTube videos. Apple gets access to movies when they are released as DVDs and typically offers movies for purchase at $14.99 and as rentals for $3.99 a day. Apple TV also offers other features that the Roku box does not have, including access to music and photos.Roku’s box is simple to use. The most difficult part of the user experience for a set-top box — sorting through the videos available — is done on the user’s computer, not on the television set.Unlike the Apple TV or TiVo devices, the Roku box does not have a hard drive. It plays video directly from the Internet by way of an Ethernet cable or home wireless network. That means that the picture could freeze on slow Internet connections. Roku recommends that users have a connection speed of 1.5 megabits a second or faster.With cable and satellite companies trying to expand the capacity of their video-on-demand services and consumer electronics makers looking to add Internet video capabilities to DVD players, game consoles and televisions, analysts say consumers will get many more viewing choices over the next year.“A $99 price tag is very attractive,” said Michael McGuire, an analyst with the Gartner Group. But “in the end, it all comes down to content.”'"
"'08-05-20,'0','In 2005, Mr. Davis was registered as a lobbyist for corporate clients like the telecommunications company Verizon. Under the campaign’s new rules, issued by Mr. Davis on Thursday, lobbyists who are currently registered either for American companies or for foreign governments or businesses cannot be employed by the campaign. They must also disclose their lobbying work even if they are working for Mr. McCain on a part-time, voluntary basis.But while Mr. Davis took a leave from Davis Manafort in 2006, the company has developed a specialty in recent years in a type of lobbying for which firms do not have to register — namely, representing the interests abroad of foreign politicians and businessmen.In recent years, the company’s clients have included the richest man in Ukraine and a former premier of that country whose opponents were supported by Mr. McCain. The Washington Post reported in January that Mr. Davis also set up a meeting in Switzerland in 2006 between Mr. McCain and a Russian businessman, who has been barred from entering this country, apparently because of accusations about past ties to organized crime in Russia. That businessman, Oleg Deripaska, has denied such links.Another senior McCain campaign aide who has lobbied on behalf of foreign governments over the past seven years is Randy Scheunemann, the chief foreign policy adviser.Over the past several years, Mr. Scheunemann met several times with Mr. McCain to discuss his clients’ interests. He introduced the senator to the foreign ministers of Albania, Croatia and Macedonia as they tried to win admission to NATO, and a representative of Taiwan as it lobbied for free trade, records show. Mr. Scheunemann also accompanied Mr. McCain to Latvia in 2001 and Georgia in 2006.Mr. Scheunemann was a registered foreign agent until March, when he ended his registrations for several countries. He had joined the McCain campaign several months earlier.A campaign spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said he would not comment on questions raised about Mr. Scheunemann or any other campaign advisers.“We’re not going to get into specifics of volunteers, staffer by staffer, supporter by supporter,” Mr. Bounds said. “We can’t be in a position where we’re litigating the process of the process.“The campaign has put a very strict policy in place and every member of the campaign is expected to be compliant with it. There may be perfectly good people that have situations that are not reconcilable. They will not be compliant with the policy.”Senior McCain advisers were hoping the conflict-of-interest policy would quell questions about the number of lobbyists working on behalf of the campaign.But at a campaign stop on Monday in Oregon, the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Barack Obama, said: “It appears that John McCain is very much a creature of Washington. And one of the things that we have said at the outset of this campaign is that if we are going to change policies, we were going to have to change how Washington works. We can’t have special interests dictating what’s happening there.”The campaign of Mr. Obama, too, includes lobbyists among its unpaid advisers, and staff members who try to help private clients influence government policy.When asked about the ongoing vetting process in his campaign, Mr. McCain repeatedly told reporters on Monday, “We have enacted the most comprehensive and most transparent policy concerning lobbyist activities, and I challenge Senator Obama to adopt a similar policy.”But even senior McCain advisers have acknowledged the difficulty of disentangling the complicated web of relationships between lobbyists and candidates. Last week, after Mr. Davis issued the new conflict rules, two other advisers resigned, including Tom Loeffler, the campaign’s general co-chairman, whose lobbying firm had represented Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong, as well as a host of corporate clients.And it appeared unlikely the resignations would stop there. The campaign’s new policy could affect people at all levels of the McCain operation.Wayne Berman, the campaign’s deputy finance chairman, has lobbied for the governments of Cyprus and Trinidad and Tobago, along with many other corporate clients. Christian Ferry, who is a lobbyist for Mr. Davis’s firm, is Mr. McCain’s deputy campaign manager.Susan Nelson, the finance director of the campaign, was as recently as last year a registered lobbyist for the Loeffler Group, for companies, including AT&T that have had business before Mr. McCain on the Commerce Committee. John Green, who has been reported to be coordinating the campaign’s efforts with congressional Republicans, is registered as a lobbyist for Ogilvy Government Relations, Mr. Berman’s firm. Carlos Bonilla, described by the McCain Web site as an economic adviser, is also a registered lobbyist.The new rules require all staff members, including part-time volunteers, to complete a questionnaire “to identify issues and clients that could be embarrassing for the senator and the campaign.”In Washington, an entire establishment cycles between campaign work in the even numbered years and lobbying in the odd — a combination pioneered by Charlie Black, who is now serving as a senior adviser to Mr. McCain.Traveling on Monday with Mr. McCain, Mr. Black said voters would pay little or no attention to the vetting process. “This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense,” Mr. Black said. He said he was now in retirement, after stepping down as chairman of his lobbying firm, BKSH & Associates Worldwide, in March, although he had been advising Mr. McCain for months prior to leaving the firm.The lobbying clout of Mr. Davis, the campaign manager, derives from his longtime Washington connections, which he drew attention to as recently as three years ago.In January 2005, he apparently pitched executives of Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private investment firm in Cos Cob, Conn., on the idea of putting money into a new firm in which he would be a partner, documents indicate. He told Pegasus Capital’s representatives that experienced “Washington insiders” like him could use their ties to advance the interests of companies seeking federal contracts, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. A spokesman for Pegasus did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.The proposal never bore fruit. But it came at the same time Mr. Davis was lobbying the Defense Department on behalf of Imagesat, an Israeli company that sells satellite imagery in which Pegasus Capital had invested. He was also then drawing a salary as the part-time president of the Reform Institute, a Washington group Mr. McCain helped found to champion ideals like reducing “the influence of special interests” in politics and government.Mr. Black also defended Mr. Davis, saying the campaign manager had not taken any money from his lobbying firm since 2006. The two men are working on an unpaid basis for the campaign.Mr. Black contended that nobody at Davis Manafort had been a registered lobbyist for five years. “Rick Davis and nobody else at his firm, either, has been a registered lobbyist in five years,” he said. “Five years.” But a check of lobbyist records shows associates at the firm have represented clients numerous times as recently as 2005.The campaign’s new policy appears to provide a loophole for some aides. Under the policy, no one working for the campaign may be a registered lobbyist or represent foreign countries, or be paid for that kind of work. But volunteers are required only to disclose their lobbying work.But they are not allowed to participate in any campaign conversations about the issues for which they lobby, which would seem to pose a conflict for someone like Mr. Scheunemann. His work as a foreign agent could overlap on any number of issues with his foreign policy advice.'"

"'08-05-21,'0','Some words are asked to do too much. “Love” is what you feel for ice cream and your life partner. “God” is a multipurpose interjection or the creator of the universe. In “Depression: Out of the Shadows,” a stark documentary on Wednesday on PBS, Andrew Solomon, who won a National Book Award for his book about depression, makes his own nomination for this grouping.“It’s a poverty of the English language,” he says, “that we only have that one word, depression, that’s used to describe how a little kid feels when it rains on the day of his baseball game, and it’s also used to describe why people spend their lives in mental hospitals and end up killing themselves.”The word may be tossed around casually, but through the stories of an assortment of people like Mr. Solomon (the author of “The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression”), who have battled the condition or lost loved ones to it, this program makes clear just how devastating clinical depression is.“Suicide is almost twice as common as homicide in the United States,” Thomas R. Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, says bluntly. “We have roughly 30,000 suicides a year. And 90 percent of those are associated with mental illness, most commonly depression.”Those to whom depression is just a vaguely defined condition may be surprised by the variety of manifestations seen here: postpartum depression, bipolar disease, late-onset depression, the mild but persistent depression known as dysthymia. And, commendably, the filmmakers don’t focus just on the affluent whites who are the easiest subjects to line up for programs like this; one segment looks at the particular problems depression presents for the urban poor, and especially blacks.“Many of us would rather tell somebody that we have a relative in jail or on drugs before we will ever utter ‘mental illness,’ ” says Terrie M. Williams, a black public relations executive who has battled depression.Programs like this always dangle promising medical advances as a counter to the jarring personal stories, and “Out of the Shadows” is no exception. But there’s a surprise. One of the more effective treatments in some instances is the seemingly primitive electroshock therapy. It is a tool, we’re told, that remains underused, and you can guess why: those memorable scenes from the film “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.”'"
"'08-05-21,'0','The gathering is taking place on a weekend when Mr. McCain is releasing his health care records, itself a high-profile event that could — by design or not — draw attention away from the event at the Arizona ranch.The identities of the potential running mates who have been invited to Sedona is not a surprise: Mr. Romney, Mr. Crist and Mr. Jindal have been on most lists of potential running mates, and they have made no secret of their interest. And even the perception that they are under consideration could be more a matter of appearance than reality: the mere impression that Mr. McCain is considering Mr. Crist of Florida, for example, could by itself help him in a critical state where Mr. McCain campaigned WednesdayStill, Mr. McCain’s gathering comes as Senator Barack Obama appears to have all but nailed down the Democratic nomination in his competition with Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and its timing suggests an acceleration in reaching a decision that several Republicans said could prove critical to Mr. McCain’s success in a tough political environment for their party. Mr. McCain, arguably more than most presidential candidates, has a lot riding on choosing a running mate who could make up for any weaknesses in his own résumé and give him a boost in his public standing.Mr. McCain himself has said his choice of a running mate would draw particular scrutiny from voters, given his age; he is now 71 year old, or “as old as dirt,” as he likes to joke, while quickly adding that he is in good health.More than that, with Mr. Obama’s selection now almost assured, Mr. McCain is contemplating a contest involving an energized electorate that has put a focus on race and gender.Earlier this month, Mr. McCain said he had assembled a list of about 20 potential running mates. He said he had not decided when he would make a decision; his aides made clear that he would keep the process as closely held as possible..Among the other potential running mates are Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and Rob Portman, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget.Mr. Crist, a fairly popular first-term governor, has been included on various lists of potential running mates for Mr. McCain, who he endorsed shortly before Florida’s primary in January, effectively helping Mr. McCain secure the nomination. He said Wednesday that he and Mr. McCain had not discussed the prospect of his being on the ticket, and the two attended a fund-raiser in Miami on Tuesday night.The McCain campaign, Mr. Crist said, has not solicited the kind of personal information typically requested to vet possible running mates.As governor of Florida, Mr. Crist, 51, would bring a number of obvious assets to a Republican ticket, beginning with his popularity in a state that is almost always an electoral battleground — and where Mr. Obama appears to be struggling. His relative youth could also be an asset for Mr. McCain.In Florida, Mr. Crist has long been known for his affability and a campaign skills. Instantly recognizable because of his perpetual tan and striking white hair, Mr. Crist, who served as Florida’s attorney general before being elected governor in 2006, has also acquired a reputation as something of a hard-liner on law and order issues.He supports the death penalty, largely opposes restrictions on the rights of gun owners, early on earned the nickname ""Chain Gang Charlie"" because he favored allowing convicts to be used in road work, and has described himself as a ""pro-life and pro-family"" candidate.Mr. Romney, a former chief executive who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination this year, has made no secret of his desire to join Mr. McCain’s presidential ticket. As a vice president, Mr. Romney’s business background — including running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics — could address concerns about Mr. McCain’s ability to manage the struggling economy.Mr. Romney has also proven himself to be a prolific fund-raiser, although he spent enormous sums of money during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and still could not beat Mr. McCain. And geographically, he brings little to the ticket, since he is unlikely to put Massachusetts in play for the Republicans.Mr. Jindal, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., to a family that had just arrived there from the Punjab area of India, took office as Louisiana’s governor in January after serving three years in the House of Representatives. Mr. Jindal, who was born a Hindu but became a Roman Catholic as a teenager, campaigned for governor as a social conservative, opposing human embryonic stem cell research and abortion in any form and favoring teaching “intelligent design” in schools as an alternative to evolution.But Mr. Jindal also has a reputation as a policy wonk, like the Clintons, with a specialty in health care issues.

"'08-05-21,'0','BRUSSELS — The European Commission proposed on Tuesday an overhaul of farm spending that fell far short of the liberal farm policy favored by countries like Britain but sharpened a debate with France, which has sought to preserve generous support for agriculture.The proposals, which would cover the period to 2013, are broadly aimed at moving Europe’s Common Agricultural Policy farther away from market-distorting systems like quotas, which keep prices artificially high, and payments to farmers linked to the amount they produce.The European agriculture commissioner, Mariann Fischer Boel, said the new measures were “all about freeing our farmers to meet growing demand and respond quickly to what the market is telling them.”Some Nordic nations and Britain are pressing for wholesale changes to the agricultural policy, which absorbs more than 40 percent of the annual European Union budget.They also say that freer trade is the best way to ease the sharp rise in food prices in recent months.'"

"'08-05-21,'0','The police officers’ raises were offset by concessions worth about 2.8 percent a year, including having newly hired officers give up 10 vacation days a year during their first five years on the job.The city’s labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, said on Monday that if the other unions agreed to similar concessions they were likely to receive the same raises.The ability of the unions to do so has ramifications for the city at a time when it can ill afford to increase spending. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he did not know whether a tax increase would be necessary if other unions were given the same percentage raises as the police.“If all else fails, we’re not going to walk away from providing services, and only then would I think about a tax increase, and my hope is that we’ll avoid it,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a news conference at City Hall.The same pattern bargaining has traditionally applied to the city’s contracts with other civil servants, like correction and sanitation workers. Officials of those unions said on Tuesday that they had not yet decided whether to renegotiate their previous contracts. The president of the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, Harry Nespoli, said he would examine the arbitrators’ ruling before making a decision. But he said he was not willing to “surrender anything for new hires” or give up annual leave.“But I do want to keep our options open,” Mr. Nespoli said in a statement. “Maybe we can sit down and negotiate a different angle.”The sanitation union has a reopener clause in its contract running from November 2002 through March 2007, with a 5 percent raise in the first and second years, a 3 percent raise in the third year and a 3.15 percent raise in the fourth. If the union decided to reopen the contract, it would focus on the last two years.Norman I. Seabrook, president of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, said he had sent a letter to Mr. Hanley, the labor commissioner, asking for a meeting to explore reopening contract negotiations because his union had the same lower raises as the firefighters.Mr. Bloomberg said the city’s financial picture had dimmed since the current contracts were written. The other civil service unions are welcome to reopen them, he said.But he added, “This is certainly not open house, and they’d have to come up with the same productivity or givebacks that the P.B.A. was forced to take.”While the arbitrators’ ruling raised the starting salary for police recruits to $35,881 from $25,100, and the maximum base pay for veterans to $65,382 from $59,588, the union had wanted to grant even higher raises to reduce the pay disparity with that in the Port Authority and nearby counties. On Tuesday, the P.B.A. notified the city that it wanted to begin negotiating the next contract immediately.The Police Department hopes that better salaries will help future recruitment.“I was praying for the raise to go up,” said Ibrahim Rogers, 28, a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “It’s wonderful. It’s not bad compared to what they had before. Imagine living with $25,000 a year in New York. It’s impossible.”'"
"'08-05-21,'0','In the private sector, pension funds are highly regulated, and actuarial numbers are less of an issue. But in government, actuaries and the consulting firms that employ them are starting to draw lawsuits in places like Alaska, San Diego, Milwaukee County, Wis., and Evanston, Ill.In Texas, the attorney general is calling for actuaries to be registered, so the state can keep them on a shorter leash. Federal regulators are also flexing their muscles, and the actuarial rules-making board is being pushed to change.Two big problems are being laid on actuarial doorsteps: overly aggressive investing and overly rich benefits. Benefits can go off the scale because widely used actuarial methods tend to make them look inexpensive. And this tends to encourage aggressive investing, because the greater the risk in the portfolio, the less costly it can seem to provide the benefits.“Actuarial assumptions based on misinformation are a recipe for disaster,” said the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott.After the Fort Worth pension fund was found to have a crushing $410 million deficit, Mr. Abbott sent his staff to dig through more than a decade’s worth of documents, to find out why. They found that in 1990, an actuary had calculated that the city could put less money into the pension fund and increase workers’ benefits simultaneously — without making a dent in the fund — if he assumed that the fund would earn 10.23 percent a year on its investments.This worked on paper but not in the real world. In reality, Fort Worth actually lost money on its pension investments that year. And the new benefits did, in fact, have a cost. But the city forged ahead, armed with an actuarial opinion letter stating that “the numbers are correct.” It generously sweetened public workers’ benefits five times in subsequent years.From time to time, the actuary issued muted warnings, but he was ignored. He also began tweaking other numbers in his calculations, which kept the plan looking viable on paper. Meanwhile, the imbalances in the pension fund compounded.“It went bust,” said David C. Mattax, the attorney general’s chief of financial litigation.Fort Worth is now trying to come up with a reform package to bring the city pension fund back into balance. It is struggling, though, because its proposals are expensive, and some have been found unconstitutional.Something similar happened in New Jersey. In 1994, the state needed money, and it made actuarial changes that allowed it to avoid putting billions of dollars into its pension fund. The state then spent the money on other things.Members of the pension oversight board resigned in protest, and employee groups sued, but an actuary for the state provided a detailed opinion letter saying the new method “will securely fund the present benefits” and even produce a modest surplus.Two years later, a state senate committee called back the actuary, Robert D. Baus, for questioning, to make sure all was well. Senator Peter A. Inverso noted that a $4 billion deficit had appeared in the pension fund. “That frightens me,” he said. But Mr. Baus said that while the deficit had grown, “it does not change the fact that the system is funded.” He said New Jersey would have to close the shortfall at some point, but in the meantime, “it does not mean that there is not enough money to cover the liabilities right now. There is more than enough.”No one asked exactly when the shortfall would have to be closed. Instead, legislators kept withholding pension contributions, even as they increased benefits again and again. Over the years the imbalances in the fund finally snowballed.Now the fund is so deep in the red that Governor Jon S. Corzine’s administration cannot find the cash to catch back up. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating.Alaska is also struggling with a sick pension fund, and complaining its actuary got it into trouble. In Alaska, the state pension fund pays for retirees’ health care as well as pension benefits. The actuarial firm that crunched the numbers for the plan, Mercer, made the assumption that health care inflation would fall to 4.5 percent by 2009. Instead, health care costs have gone up.The difference looks small in percentage terms, but multiplied over many years, and 80,000 workers and retirees, it is enormous. Alaska has sued Mercer for $1.8 billion, arguing that it “failed to take into account real-world data,” and, therefore, allowed the state to make unreasonably low contributions.Mercer has said that it did nothing wrong, and that Alaska is trying to blame it for investment losses and other factors beyond its control.Mercer is also being sued by Milwaukee County, where the pension fund has been draining the budget for years. The county accuses Mercer of underestimating the cost of new benefits that were promised in 2001. Mercer says the county caused the problems itself, through its mismanagement.In Evanston, Ill., a former actuary has been accused of using aggressive assumptions about such things as investment returns, after a new actuary discovered a big shortfall. The former actuary has said his assumptions were valid and the plan had weakened because it was highly leveraged.San Diego’s official numbers produced by an outside actuarial firm were found to be so misleading that the S.E.C. sanctioned the city for securities fraud. The city sued the actuarial firm, which settled.The New York State Legislature has dropped several proposed pension enhancements since lawmakers learned that the actuary, whose opinion was that the cost of the benefits would be zero, was being paid by a labor group. The actuary said his assumptions were within acceptable ranges. But the state’s actuarial methods continue to be contentious, showing the pension fund is fully funded even when markets turn down.Actuaries worry their profession cannot withstand too many large lawsuits. The board that writes actuarial standards has been working on revisions in how to make economic assumptions.But change is coming at a creep. There are still a large number of actuaries for public plans who vigorously defend current methods.In Washington, the Internal Revenue Service is seeking to intervene. It is an active regulator of corporate pension funds, but has seldom been involved with public plans until recently. At a recent informational event, I.R.S. officials explained that they wanted to help, and would send out an anonymous questionnaire.“The law in this area is complex, and mistakes do happen,” said Joyce Kahn of the I.R.S.’s Employee Plans Voluntary Compliance division. “They happen all the time.” She said errors cost much less if they are corrected right at the beginning.Many public fund officials, however, have resisted cooperating with the I.R.S., citing states’ rights doctrine.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','“There’s real concerns about the degree of risk that F.H.A. is taking on,” said Howard Glaser, a mortgage industry consultant who served at the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration. “And everyone is calling on Fannie and Freddie to do more to stabilize the mortgage marketplace, but at what point does imposing new costs on those companies undermine their financial safety?”Lawmakers of both parties say such concerns are baseless. Congressional aides say that the housing plan’s estimated $1 billion cost will be more than offset by the $700 million a year that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will hand over and by the billions of dollars in new fees the F.H.A. will charge borrowers and lenders.“We believe we’ve identified more than twice the funding that this program needs,” said Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Banking Committee. “We have to provide relief to people who are at risk of losing their homes, and this is a good start.”The Banking Committee approved the foreclosure rescue plan by a vote of 19 to 2, with 8 Republicans joining all 11 Democrats on the committee in favor of it. Republican Senators Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming were the two no votes.The broad consensus on the bill was a stark turnabout after years of partisan debate over how to tighten regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and more recent disagreement over whether the government should help troubled homeowners and lenders who might have acted irresponsibly.The Senate agreement underscores the view in both parties that addressing problems in the housing market is a political necessity in a high-stakes election year. Republicans who initially opposed helping struggling borrowers agreed to extend a hand, but only after Democrats agreed to tap Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, instead of taxpayers, to cover the cost.Even the White House, which expressed staunch opposition and threatened a veto when the House passed a similar measure earlier this month, seems to have changed its tune. While the White House said it needed to review the specific language of the bill, President Bush suggested he was willing to support it, especially because it contains the tighter regulation of the mortgage finance companies that he has sought for years.Mr. Shelby said that, while the measure leans on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for financing the rescue plan, it also ensures their financial health by creating a more powerful regulator to oversee the companies.For decades, Fannie and Freddie have been overseen by multiple regulators, each with limited powers. Consolidating oversight into one agency with broad authority has long been a priority for lawmakers who feel the companies take too many risks.But critics worry that such protections may not be enough. They note that the government’s estimates of the housing plan’s cost make relatively conservative assumptions about default rates and housing price declines. Moreover, they note that the housing plan that passed the House has earmarked some of the same Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac funds to pay for rebuilding New Orleans and other areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Now Congress will have to choose between conflicting plans.“There’s other money in the Senate bill that will pay for the housing plan without dipping into money for affordable housing,” said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “I am very insistent that we don’t abandon the people in the Gulf.”There also are lingering questions about how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will operate once a new regulator is in place, and after the companies begin handing over hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Although the funds the companies will hand over are comparatively small — only about 5 cents for each dollar in mortgages the companies buy — they may have significant ramifications for shareholders.The stock prices of both companies have been battered in recent months as they have announced billions in losses. Both companies have been criticized for holding too little capital in reserve and have recently asked investors for fresh capital infusions. Their new regulator, whom the president would appoint, may require them to do business by standards that could sharply affect the companies’ bottom lines.Those concerns were reflected by executives at the companies themselves, who released statements on Tuesday warning about the adverse effects of overregulation, and by shareholders, who slightly pushed down the price of both companies’ stocks.Ultimately, analysts say, it is likely that both companies will need to raise more capital this year. And it is unclear how investors will judge the housing plan, which in effect has drafted the companies to bail out hurting homeowners.“The F.H.A. bailout program isn’t designed to help Fannie or Freddie, so why are they paying for it?” asked Tom Lawler, an economist who worked at Fannie Mae for over two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. “You could charge the banking system, Wall Street, home builders — there are lots of companies that will actually benefit from this bailout who could have paid for it. But they will get the benefit without having to pay.”Democratic aides said they expected the bill to be brought to the Senate floor in early June, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','ALBANY — In his first public response to a widening investigation of the State Police, Daniel Wiese, the former lieutenant colonel at the center of the inquiry, has sought to rebut suggestions that he ran a rogue unit specializing in political favors and dirty tricks.Mr. Wiese was suspended from his position at the New York Power Authority in early April, shortly after Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo’s office began an investigation of the State Police at the request of Gov. David A. Paterson. The governor sought to determine if the police had engaged in inappropriate political activities, echoing suspicions of some lawmakers that they were either followed or that their legal troubles were leaked to the press.In a letter to the Power Authority sent Monday, Mr. Wiese said that he had done nothing wrong and that his reputation had been unfairly tarnished.“I am not aware of the existence of the alleged ‘rogue element,’ ” he said in the letter, adding, “I do not believe that any such unit or element ever existed within the State Police any time during my association with the organization.”Mr. Wiese sent the letter after losing a court battle in which his lawyer, Kevin J. Kitson, sought to quash a subpoena issued by Mr. Cuomo’s office.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','The report quotes passionate objections from F.B.I. officials who grew increasingly concerned about the reports of practices like intimidating inmates with snarling dogs, parading them in the nude before female soldiers, or “short-shackling” them to the floor for many hours in extreme heat or cold.Such tactics, said one F.B.I. agent in an e-mail message to supervisors in November 2002, might violate American law banning torture.More senior officials, including Spike Bowman, who was then the head of the national security law unit at the F.B.I., tried to sound the alarm as well.“Beyond any doubt, what they are doing (and I don’t know the extent of it) would be unlawful were these enemy prisoners of war,” Mr. Bowman wrote in an e-mail message to top F.B.I. officials in July 2003.Many of the abuses the report describes have previously been disclosed, but it was not known that F.B.I. agents had gone so far as to document accusations of abuse in a “war crimes file” at Guantánamo. The report does not say how many incidents were included in the file after it was started in 2002, but the “war crimes” label showed just how seriously F.B.I. agents took the accusations. Sometime in 2003, however, an F.B.I. official ordered the file closed because “investigating detainee allegations of abuse was not the F.B.I.’s mission,” the report said.The inspector general, Glenn A. Fine, found that in a few instances, F.B.I. agents participated in interrogations using pressure tactics that would not have been permitted inside the United States. But the “vast majority” of agents followed F.B.I. legal guidelines and “separated themselves” from harsh treatment, the report says.The report says that the F.B.I. “had not provided sufficient guidance to its agents on how to respond when confronted with military interrogators” who used interrogation techniques that were not permitted by the F.B.I., and that fueled confusion and dissension. But it also says that “the F.B.I. should be credited for its conduct and professionalism in detainee interrogations in the military zones.”Jameel Jaffer, who tracks detainee issues for the American Civil Liberties Union, took a more critical stance, saying the report shows “the F.B.I.’s leadership failed to act aggressively to end the abuse.” Mr. Jaffer said the report “only underscores the pressing need for an independent and comprehensive investigation of prisoner abuse.”The report documents in greater detail than ever before the conflict between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A. over interrogation methods, which began with the capture of Abu Zubaydah, a senior Qaeda figure, in Pakistan in March 2002. F.B.I. agents began the interrogation using traditional rapport-building methods, and one agent even provided personal care for Mr. Zubaydah, who had been shot three times and grievously wounded, “even to the point of cleaning him up after bowel movements.”But C.I.A. personnel who took over the case within a few days began to use harsher methods that one F.B.I. agent described as “borderline torture,” and which the C.I.A. has acknowledged included waterboarding, in which water is poured over the prisoner’s mouth and nose to create a feeling of suffocation.The report describes extensive debate inside the F.B.I. over the next six months over whether it should continue to observe or assist the C.I.A. with interrogations using harsh methods it believed were counterproductive.F.B.I. officials, including Pasquale D’Amuro, then the bureau’s top counterterrorism officer, believed the physical pressure being used by the C.I.A. was less effective than traditional noncoercive methods, that it would “taint” any future effort at prosecution, and that it “was wrong and helped Al Qaeda in spreading negative views of the United States,” the report says.After the capture of another Qaeda figure, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, in September 2002, F.B.I. agents again traveled to a secret C.I.A. site where Mr. bin al-Shibh was being questioned. But only in 2003, the report concludes, did the F.B.I. make a “clean break” and choose to have no involvement in the C.I.A.’s harsh interrogations.The report said several senior Justice Department Criminal Division officials raised concerns with the National Security Council in 2003 about the military’s treatment of detainees but saw no changes as a result. One Justice Department official said he believed that John Ashcroft, the former attorney general, had spoken to Condoleezza Rice, then the national security adviser, about the department’s concerns about interrogation methods being used in late 2002 on Mohammed al-Qahtani, a Qaeda member who was believed to be the so-called 20th hijacker in the attack of Sept. 11, 2001.But Mr. Ashcroft declined to be interviewed by the inspector general’s office of the department he had headed, an unusual refusal and one that hampered investigators’ effort to learn of discussions inside the National Security Council , the report says.A spokesman for Mr. Ashcroft, Mark Corallo, said the former attorney general had not cooperated because “his conversations with the White House and with staff on national security matters are privileged.”The report says that while some Justice Department officials believed that the physical pressure techniques being used by the military were wrong, others merely thought they might be ineffective.A Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman, noted that abuses at Guantánamo were the subject of a 2005 Defense Department investigation that found no evidence of torture, though it did fault some interrogation tactics and called the Qahtani interrogation degrading and abusive.The Justice Department said it was pleased that the report “credited the F.B.I. for its conduct and professionalism during interrogations.”A C.I.A. spokesman said the harsh methods it used were “found lawful by the Department of Justice itself” and were “employed only when traditional means of questioning — things like rapport-building — were ineffective.”'"

"'08-05-21,'0','Mr. McKinnon had made those comments as Mr. McCain’s campaign was entering a rough patch that by midsummer left his prospects in doubt. With a general election battle between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain increasingly likely, speculation over whether Mr. McKinnon would follow through on his pledge had been recently circulating in both parties.Mr. McKinnon did not respond to a request late Monday to discuss his plans but on Tuesday told The Washington Post Web site that he would be stepping down. “I’ll be transitioning, shifting position from linebacker to head cheerleader,"" he was quoted as saying, adding that he would remain a “friend and fan” of the campaign.The situation divided the loyalties of a man known to take them seriously. But one adviser to Mr. McCain, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the choice for Mr. McKinnon was not between Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain, who remains his choice for president, but between staying true to his word and not.“This is not about neutrality,” the adviser said. “I think this really pains him, but he made a commitment to do something.”Mr. McKinnon, who lives in Austin, Tex., has been something of an anomaly in Republican politics. He has spent most of his career working for Democrats, including Ann Richards, a former Texas governor, and Buddy Roemer, a former governor of Louisiana and congressman.But he also has a reputation as a strategist who falls hard personally for his candidates, as he did for George W.

"'08-05-21,'0','The changes are causing a prime builder of affordable housing, Atlantic Development Group, which has accounted for about two-thirds of New York’s total certificate units, or 25,000 of 38,000, to shift gears. Worried that the changes may mean it cannot produce as many affordable homes, Atlantic, based in Manhattan, is branching into more market-rate projects.“The new system won’t have as much fluidity,” said Peter Fine, the company’s principal, who began his career as a social worker. “It will take longer to get deals done, because of extra layers of bureaucracy.”One of four market-rate buildings planned by Atlantic, a 13-year-old for-profit company, is Two Cooper Square, a blocky 15-story red brick tower that is rising from a former parking lot in the East Village, at Bowery and East Fourth Street.The 160 units at Two Cooper, which will range from studios to two-bedroom apartments, and from 500 square feet to 1,050 square feet, do not have prices yet. But neighborhood rents for units of similar size average $2,000 to $5,000 a month, according to brokers.Completion of the $81 million project, which is now being excavated, is expected in 2010, Mr. Fine said.Two Cooper will also offer 24,000 square feet of retail space on its ground-floor and basement levels. Tenants interested in the berths include boutiques, restaurants and coffeehouses, he said.In an unusual deal with the city’s landmarks agency, Atlantic must also restore a dilapidated 1845 town house on the property, which is a third of an acre. Originally known as the Samuel Tredwell Skidmore House, the four-story Greek Revival structure will ultimately be available as a one-family rental, Mr. Fine said.Under the current 421-a law, which was created in 1985, when affordable housing developers were hard pressed for public financing, certificates are generated under a fairly consistent formula. One new affordable apartment typically yields five certificates, providing tax abatements for 10 years for five market-rate units. These certificates have traded in recent months for $20,000 apiece.That favorable five-to-one ratio could generate considerable income for established developers. “We didn’t have to wait for years for a government agency to deliberate and provide a subsidy,” Mr. Fine said. “It was really a miracle of New York City.”Indeed, Atlantic realized about $60 million alone from the Extell Development Company, a national developer, said Extell’s president, Gary Barnett, based on the purchase of an estimated 3,000 certificates over four years.The tax abatements allowed by those certificates can save owners of a one-bedroom condo $10,000 over a decade, and they are partly responsible for the successes of the Avery, the Rushmore and the Lucida, three high-end Manhattan condos developed by Extell, Mr. Barnett said.Without the certificates, “there will definitely be a slowdown in affordable development, and development in general, in the city,” he added.Some critics of the existing program say that it unfairly punishes nonprofit, affordable-housing developers, who reflexively shy away from risks associated with private-market transactions. Another drawback, they say, is that the system is overly complicated and that only developers with established relationships seem to be able to navigate it.“This is reflected in the fact that there are only a few affordable-housing developers using it,” said Neill Coleman, a spokesman for the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which led a two-year effort to reform the 421-a law. About five such developers used it in 2007, though New York has dozens of them.But the major impetus for changing the law, which the governor’s office approved in January, is that the certificates’ values are too low — at best producing 20 cents of affordable housing for every dollar lost because of tax abatements, Mr. Coleman said.In place of selling certificates, affordable-housing developers will now be able to tap a $400 million trust fund, administered by the New York City Housing Development Corporation. It should reach maturity in a year, Mr. Coleman said.The fund will be amassed from the property tax payments of residents in buildings that would have been eligible for abatements if affordable housing had been built under the same roof as market-rate units. These taxes will apply if a building is located in a so-called exclusion zone, which is an area that includes New York’s most sought-after neighborhoods, defined by the city.Currently, that zone encompasses Manhattan’s midsection. Under the new 421-a rules, however, it will include all of Manhattan, as well as parts of all the other boroughs.The idea, Mr. Coleman said, is that developers no longer require so many tax incentives to build in New York. Under the new version of 421-a, as is already the case, developers who build in outlying areas will get tax breaks for 10 to 25 years based on the type of housing.Atlantic’s decision to retool its business model does not come as a surprise to Carol Lamberg, executive director of the Settlement Housing Fund, a nonprofit group that has built low-income homes in New York since 1969.“They’re losing their niche,” she said. “It was the thing they were good at.”As she sees it, the program’s chief drawback is that it awards certificates only after a building is in the ground, thus playing to developers that are relatively well capitalized, like Atlantic, Ms. Lamberg said.Still, she thinks the 421-a revisions, coming at the downturn of a market that continues to experience credit problems, could deal a blow to the sector. “It’s one less tool, and we need every tool we can get,” Ms. Lamberg said.Despite a course change, Mr. Fine said he is not entirely abandoning the earlier focus of his company, which he founded with Marc Altheim in 1995.In fact, at Boricua Village, a 4.5-acre mixed-use project under construction in the Morrisania-Melrose section of the South Bronx, three of the seven residential rental towers, ranging from 8 to 13 stories, in both brick and glass, will be set aside for low-income residents. These towers will have 250 homes, ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments, of 700 units over all at the project.The $250 million development, which is centered on Boricua College, a commuter school with campuses in Manhattan and Brooklyn, will also feature classrooms for 2,000 students and 45,000 square feet of retail space; its first building will open by the summer of 2009, Mr. Fine said.Though rents have not been set, a below-market one-bedroom is expected to cost about $650, while its market-rate counterpart would lease for about $1,000, he said.Before becoming a developer, Mr. Fine said, his jobs included helping homeless people find housing, and he maintains that charity is part of his company’s mission. “We are really social workers at heart,” he said.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','“I know the association with Dr. Hwang is going to be controversial,” Lou Hawthorne, the chief executive of BioArts, said in a telephone interview on Friday. “One of the contradictions of Dr. Hwang is that he made mistakes on his human stem-cell research, and he’s the first to admit that.”But he said Dr. Hwang’s dog-cloning work had been independently verified. “Our main concern is simply he’s the best when it comes to dog cloning,” Mr. Hawthorne said, “and for that reason it behooves us to work with him.”Mr. Hawthorne had hoped to clone a dog — a dog named Missy — since the 1990s. He was the chief executive of another company, Genetic Savings & Clone, which did extensive research on cloning dogs but concentrated on the commercial potential of cloning customers’ cats, something it offered to do for $50,000 apiece.But he said Genetic Savings shut down in 2006 after giving “some pricey refunds” to customers who had paid to have their cats cloned.“The technology was not refined,” Mr. Hawthorne said, “and rather than keep an operation that was burning through several million a year, keep that going, we decided, shut that down, focus on technology and launch a new company when the time seemed right.”His new company, BioArts, began work last fall to clone Missy, he said, who was three-quarters border collie and one-quarter husky.Missy died in 2002 at age 15. But Mr. Hawthorne had taken genetic samples from Missy in 1997, and had more taken after she died.In December, he said, a clone was born, Mira. Two other clones of Missy, Chin-Gu and Sarang, were born in February, he said. Tests by the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California, Davis, indicated that the three dogs were clones, not just relatives.As for the auctions, Mr. Hawthorne said the bidding would start at $100,000. He said that was a starting price, not a minimum, and could drop.He said that the opening and closing times for the auctions would be staggered, to reach potential customers in different time zones, and that the starting bids for the later auctions would be higher “to steer people to participate in the earlier auctions if they can, and avoid a phenomenon of everyone waiting to see how they go.”He said that BioArts would not spend the money “unless and until we deliver a cloned dog that they sign off on,” and that the company would guarantee the resemblance between the customer’s dog and the clone.“We let that be subjective,” Mr. Hawthorne said. “If the client doesn’t feel it’s extremely high, comparable to identical twins,” the client can ask for his or her money backHe also said that BioArts would guarantee the cloned dog’s health for a year, and that a veterinarian would examine and approve the dog before it was delivered to its new owners.Mr. Hawthorne said cloning techniques had become more efficient over the years. He said 25 percent of embryo transfers now result in a puppy, and the survival rate of the puppies is greater than 80 percent. “That’s within the range of what conventional dog breeders expect,” he said.But Dr. Robert Lanza, the chief scientific officer of Advanced Cell Technology, a biotech company with laboratories in Worcester, Mass., voiced concern when a reporter described Best Friends Again.“If anyone thinks they’re going to get Fluffy back,” Dr. Lanza said, “they’re gravely mistaken.” A cloned dog is “likely to be a totally unknown dog, just as if you went to the pound and adopted another, unknown animal.”'"
"'08-05-21,'0','In the case of asbestos, the lesions eventually become mesothelioma, a deadly cancer.The researchers, though, portrayed their results as good news by providing people who work with nanotubes with knowledge of how to minimize the dangers.“In a sense, we’re forewarned and forearmed now with respect to nanotubes,” said Anthony Seaton, a professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.Vicki Colvin, a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston, who was not involved with the research, said that she saw no need to restrict the use of nanotubes in products, but that their use should be better labeled.“I’m not alarmed,” Professor Colvin said, “but it seems we should have better information about where it is and how it’s being used.”When foreign particles like smoke or dust land in the lungs, cells known as macrophages engulf the particles and clear them away. Some asbestos fibers are too long for the macrophages to handle, resulting in lesions. The researchers hypothesized that nanotubes would cause similar problems if they were long, but not if they were short or tangled into a ball.In their study, the researchers injected four groups of mice: one with short nanotubes about 5 microns in length, one with long nanotubes about 20 microns in length, one with asbestos and one with small carbon clumps. Some of the mice were killed and dissected the next day. Some were dissected a week later.The mice injected with the short nanotubes or small carbon clumps did not develop disease. Those injected with long nanotubes or asbestos developed lesions on the tissue lining.“Long ones are harmful, and short ones are not,” said Ken Donaldson, a professor of respiratory toxicology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the authors of the Nature Nanotechnology article.Dr. Donaldson said he was sure that given more time, the lesions caused by the long nanotubes would have developed into mesothelioma.The study did not look at how easily nanotubes become airborne or whether they become lodged in the lungs if inhaled. The scientists said more research was needed to determine the extent of the risk posed by nanotubes.Vince Castranova, chief of the pathology and physiology research branch of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in Morgantown, W.Va., said the new study was “very well done,” but added, “So far, we haven’t done the studies long enough to determine the long-term pathology.”The people in greatest danger would most likely be those working in laboratories or at nanotube manufacturers.“I think there is clear evidence for caution in how they are used and handled,” said Andrew D. Maynard, chief science adviser to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington and another author of the Nature Nanotechnology paper.Dr. Maynard said nanotubes should be subject to the same rules and regulations as asbestos.“That gives you a good baseline starting point,” Dr. Maynard said. The rules could be relaxed if nanotubes turned out to be less toxic, he said.Consumers would probably not be able to inhale nanotubes embedded in a golf club or bicycle frame, for instance. But Dr. Maynard said there could be a concern that nanotubes in products could be released later, much as asbestos in concrete or automobile brake pads was inhaled by construction workers or mechanics.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','Jurors in the child pornography trial of the R&B star R. Kelly, right, were warned on Tuesday by a prosecutor that they would be required to watch a videotape of an “under-age child performing sex acts that you have never seen before.” In an opening statement in Cook County Criminal Court in Chicago, the prosecutor, Shauna Boliker, said, “A child doesn’t choose to be violated and placed on a videotape, a videotape that will live on forever — long after this child becomes an adult,” The Associated Press reported. Mr. Kelly, 41, a Grammy Award winner, is accused of videotaping himself having sex with an under-age girl. Prosecutors contend that she was as young as 13 when the recording was made, between Jan. 1, 1998 and Nov. 1, 2000. Both Mr. Kelly and the woman, now 23, deny they are the people on the tape, and one of Mr. Kelly’s lawyers, Sam Adam Jr., told the jurors during his opening statement that the videotape is “at best a copy of a copy” and that Mr. Kelly was not the man on the tape. “Not a single witness can tell you that is him on the tape,” he said. If convicted, Mr. Kelly could face as much as 15 years in prison.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','Many a martial march is heard, but not a single flag is waved in “The Great American All-Star Traveling War Machine,” a revue of songs, sketches and speeches focusing on the history of human conflict at the Theater for the New City.If the title has not clued you in to the uncelebratory bent of the show, perhaps the news that it is based on the first issue of Lapham’s Quarterly, a journal edited by Lewis H. Lapham, will do the trick. Mr. Lapham, the former longtime editor of Harper’s Magazine, is known for his refined literary style and his adamantine liberal views. No friend of the generals, he.Performed by the Irondale Ensemble Project and directed by Jim Niesen, the production is nonetheless not a strident screed simply denouncing war as a bloody useless business. The collage of historical documents and celebrated speeches taken from the Quarterly’s “States of War” issue includes the famous oration at Tilbury in which Queen Elizabeth I roused her troops to repel the advances of the Spanish Armada. It is presented with no framing commentary to turn it on its end, and is still stirring.If anything, the show is too broad in its approach, too vague in its point of view. The “American” in the title is misleading, obviously. In addition to that contribution from Elizabeth, the show also includes the exchange of telegrams between Czar Nicholas II and Kaiser Wilhelm II that failed to resolve tensions between Russia and Germany on the eve of World War I. One comic bit details the war wounds suffered by Alexander the Great. The war machine, after all, was not invented by America. Still, United States military forays on foreign soil make up the majority of the material in this scattershot, intermittently engaging show. Jessica Lynch’s testimony before Congress on the misleading hype surrounding her rescue in Iraq is delivered by Thea Brooks with simple emotion. Patrena Murray impersonates Elizabeth and, rather more amusingly, Gen. George Patton, who delivers his own give-’em-hell speech to buck up troops during World War II. President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger are shown squaring off over tactics during the Vietnam War.The historical texts are linked with musical segments that are more satirically pointed. The whole cast opens the show singing the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” while Damen Scranton, pointer in hand, presides over a slide show listing all the wars and “interventions” undertaken by the United States in its two centuries and more of existence. After a segment quoting the leaflets dropped on the Japanese warning them of the horrors of the atomic bomb, the cast sings “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head.” (That is a little tasteless, actually.)The cast of eight is young and energetic. The performers sing well, harmonizing entrancingly in some of the better musical segments. I could not help thinking, unfortunately, that I’d rather hear them singing than reading a lot of the material, which never coheres to present a strong vision of the folly or waste or, for that matter, the bloody glory of war. It’s too much of a hodgepodge.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — The drug maker Merck has agreed to pay $58 million as part of a multistate settlement of accusations that its ads for the once-popular painkiller Vioxx deceptively played down the health risks.The agreement, announced on Tuesday, also calls for Merck to submit all new television commercials for its drugs to the Food and Drug Administration for review.The civil settlement ends investigations by 29 states and the District of Columbia into Merck’s advertising practices involving Vioxx, Pennsylvania’s attorney general, Tom Corbett, said.Vioxx was taken off the market in 2004 after research showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. That led to thousands of lawsuits against Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J. A pending $4.85 billion settlement would end the bulk of those personal injury suits.Thanks to aggressive marketing through direct-to-consumer television ads begun in 1999, hundreds of thousands of consumers demanded Vioxx prescriptions before doctors had a chance to understand the side effects, Mr. Corbett said.An F.D.A. spokeswoman did not immediately return a telephone message on Tuesday seeking comment.Merck is not admitting any wrongdoing under the settlement and defended its marketing of Vioxx in a statement on Tuesday.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','Michael Holland, the chairman of Holland & Company, said the market has done well recently in the face of troubling news, but he said Tuesday’s news about inflation as well as record oil prices had caused new concerns.“Record oil prices combined with unsettling of the market, unsettling inflation news is the reason du jour,” Mr. Holland said.Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, said the Labor Department report came just as investors were questioning the market’s strength.“I think even before this morning’s number, there had been some worries about this rally getting overextended,” Mr. Feroli said.Michael Strauss, the chief economist at Commonfund, said one concern was the possibility that producers would not be able to pass along increased prices, resulting in a drop in profit margins.“It is a reasonable level, but it is a level that suggests profit margins are being squeezed,” he said.Also fueling the decline in the market were quarterly results from retailers like Home Depot, which reported that earnings fell to $356 million, or 21 cents a share, in the first quarter that ended on May 4, from $1.05 billion, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. Total sales fell 3.4 percent to $17.9 billion, with sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, down 6.5 percent.Home Depot was the biggest loser among the Dow industrials, closing at $27.31, a loss of 5.4 percent. But the losses were widespread, with JPMorgan Chase, General Motors and Citigroup also showing big declines, along with technology and telecommunications stocks. Among the blue chips, only Chevron ended higher, up 0.6 percent to $102.83.On a broader level, Donald L. Kohn, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a speech in New Orleans on Tuesday that the recent news on inflation “had been mixed.”“Core inflation has moderated a little so far this year,” Mr. Kohn said in the speech. “However, we have seen no relief from the pressures for energy and food; thus headline inflation has been quite elevated.”According to Tuesday’s Labor Department report, food prices were unchanged in April after increasing 1.2 percent the previous month. Within the category, prices for eggs dropped 12.3 percent and vegetables dropped 4.1 percent . But rice prices increased 17.4 percent.Energy prices declined 0.2 percent in April after a 2.9 percent jump in March. The number was helped by a 4.6 percent decline in the price of gasoline, which reflected the government’s seasonal adjustment methods.While growing demand and questions about oil supplies have driven prices to twice as high as a year ago, Adam Robinson, an energy analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the most interesting developments recently have been in the prices for oil that will be delivered five years from now, called the back end of the market. The long-term prices, which are normally more stable than the shorter-term contracts, reached $135 Tuesday.“That market was at $102 on May 1,” he said. “This market is not supposed to move around this much.”The market also received further bad news regarding the credit crisis in a new report from Oppenheimer & Company saying that problems could extend beyond 2009. In the report, an analyst, Meredith Whitney, predicted further setbacks for the banking sector.“Our view is that the credit crisis will extend well into 2009 and perhaps beyond,” the report said. “Although the complexion will change, the net effect will be the same: three years of multibillion-dollar revenue reversals.”'"
"'08-05-21,'0','“He really loves the common people, and we can see this is not an act,” said Wang Liangen, 72, a retired math teacher from the devastated city of Dujiangyan, who watched last week as the prime minister climbed over the wreckage of a school where hundreds of children were buried. “He has brought the people closer together, and brought the people closer to the government.”Some analysts say Mr. Wen’s unusually public role may signal at least a modest shift in the way the Communist Party interacts with the Chinese citizenry. In a country where many millions live in poverty and thousands perish each year in mine accidents, for example, Mr. Wen ordered shortly after the quake that lives must be saved “at any cost.” And while Mr. Wen is not known to have supported any substantive political change during his first five-year term as prime minister, his frequent calls for more democratic-style consultation with ordinary people and for greater economic parity have resonated with the poor.“Wen’s efforts will absolutely leave a long-lasting influence on government work in the future,” said Fang Ning, a political scientist at the China Academy of Social Science in Beijing. “His quick response and immediate appearance will set a precedent for other officials.”It is difficult to know if the rescue effort Mr. Wen has led will ultimately be judged a success. And it is unlikely that the unusually vigorous press coverage of the quake and of Mr. Wen’s hands-on role in managing the rescue effort signal a shift away from strict censorship.But Mr. Wen and his boss, President Hu Jintao, do seem inclined to show the world a kindler, gentler side of official China in advance of the Olympic Games. After the international backlash over China’s crackdown on ethnic Tibetans, the leaders have used the earthquake in an effort to show that their authoritarian government can be responsive, even populist, at crucial moments.“I think the earthquake really has the potential to change things,” said Cheng Li, a senior fellow of the Brookings Institution, who argues that Mr. Wen — whose second appointed term expires in 2012 — is one of China’s brightest and most pragmatic modern leaders. Even before his actions in Sichuan, he said, Mr. Wen was a muscular champion for China’s have-nots, an advocate of broadening the use of legal norms to help govern the country, and a bulwark against party conservatives. “A lot of Chinese have been overwhelmed by Wen and his sincerity, honesty and humanity,” Dr. Li said. “Not many leaders have his qualities.”Mr. Wen often talks about democracy but is not a proponent of Western-style democratic reforms. He remains an unwavering advocate of single-party rule, and he has taken a hard line on Tibet, accusing the Dalai Lama of instigating the ethnic Tibetan unrest in March. In public statements, he has said China is unafraid to use its military might to prevent Taiwan from declaring independence from the mainland.Despite Mr. Wen’s well-tended image as an apolitical pragmatist, cynics note that he did not earn his lofty post by playing nice. “It takes a considerable amount of political skill and cunning to become premier of China,” said Fred Teiwes, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Sydney in Australia.Mr. Wen is nothing if not the consummate survivor. A lifelong technocrat, he made his way to the top of the heap by pleasing his superiors, hewing to the party line and making few enemies. A trained geologist who comes from a family of teachers, he is sometimes ridiculed for indecisiveness and for long-winded speeches flecked with quotations from Descartes and classical Chinese poetry. In the 1980s he served as a top aide to successive party bosses, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang; both leaders were purged after opposing harsh crackdowns on liberal forces in society, but Mr. Wen went on to serve in senior posts under their more conservative successors.As with most Chinese leaders, much about him remains a mystery. But he presents himself as self-effacing and penurious. For more than a decade, he wore the same dull green overcoat. Unlike most of his fellow cadres, he refuses to tint his graying hair with gobs of black dye.In contrast to Mr. Hu, an opaque and aloof statesman, Mr. Wen favors a colloquial speaking style, even if his comments always hew closely to the party script. Unlike his predecessor, Zhu Rongji, who was known for his jocular manner and snap decisions, Mr. Wen, when faced with tough economic policy choices, will often spend days ruminating and consulting before deferring to fellow members of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee for a collective decision, party officials have said.“He may not be a good leader,” said Dr. Li, of Brookings, “but the perception out there is that he’s a good person.”That has been the overwhelming impression since a somber-looking Mr. Wen announced news of the earthquake on May 12 as he flew from Beijing to Sichuan. In the days that followed, he was frequently shown hugging quake victims and promising government aid. According to people who saw him in those first few days, he cried more than once.In recent days, a pro-government newspaper in Hong Kong and a Guangzhou-based Web site wrote that Mr. Wen had tripped and fallen as he walked on earthquake rubble and had refused medical treatment for a bloody arm.A more intriguing account described his fury when he learned that rescuers from the People’s Liberation Army had yet to reach Wenchuan, a city of 100,000 at the quake’s epicenter. Even if concocted by Mr. Wen’s admirers, the report reveals a shift away from the prime minister’s persona as a vacillating, avuncular bureaucrat.According to the account — which has been ricocheting by text message for days — Mr. Wen screamed on the phone to a general, who, under Beijing’s pecking order, does not answer to the prime minister. “I don’t care what you do,” Mr. Wen reportedly yelled, his face drenched in rain. “I just want 100,000 people saved. This is my order.”Then, according to the story, he slammed the phone down.'"
"'08-05-21,'0','The Obama campaign quickly sent out a response from Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, both supporters with foreign policy experience, who argued the country needed a change from a Bush administration approach that had for much of the past seven years frowned upon dialogue with certain adversaries, though it has more recently shown signs of shifting.“John McCain needs to explain why continuing to do exactly what George Bush has done will somehow produce a different result,” Mr. Dodd said.Mr. Obama’s record on Cuba is mixed. While campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Obama has said he favors taking steps to normalize relations only if the Cuban government takes meaningful steps toward democracy.When he was running for United States Senate in Illinois in 2003, however, Mr. Obama said in a questionnaire that he favored normalizing relations with Cuba but did not offer any qualifiers.Mr. McCain has his own conflicting past statements to contend with. When he was running for president in 2000, Mr. McCain stood out for supporting normalizing relations with Cuba, even if Fidel Castro remained in power, provided the government went through certain steps to democratize its country, similar to the road map to normalizing relations with Vietnam.The difference with his position now appears to be primarily one of emphasis, with Mr. McCain forcefully contending the Cuban embargo should be kept in place until certain specific political freedoms are restored.But Mr. McCain said in 1999, according to The Miami Herald, that if Mr. Castro took certain steps, he would be willing to wait until the goal of supervised free elections before beginning steps toward normalization.Both campaigns have engaged in sound bites and simplifications of these major policy differences, but in explaining, defending and attacking each other, they have displayed clear distinctions in their beliefs in the efficacy of diplomacy.The jumping-off point for the debate has continued to be Mr. Obama’s response at a Democratic debate last year in which he said he would be willing to sit down without preconditions with the leaders of certain foes of the United States, including Cuba and Iran. The response exposed him to repeated broadsides, at first from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, his Democratic opponent, and now Mr. McCain.On Iran, Mr. Obama has since sought to draw a distinction between such engagement by an Obama administration and his personal involvement as president, saying his involvement would require the Iranians’ meeting certain benchmarks.Mr. Obama has repeatedly argued that the United States needs to be willing to engage in dialogue with all countries, including enemies, while Mr. McCain has stuck much closer to the stance that largely characterized the Bush administration, maintaining that diplomatic engagement is a privilege.More recently, however, the Bush administration has edged toward a greater willingness to engage countries like Syria, Iran and North Korea, where the administration has claimed important progress in reaching an agreement to dismantle the country’s nuclear program.Mr. McCain has said he does not oppose lower-level discussions with adversaries under certain conditions but singled out the notion of a presidential-level visit as a carrot that must be handled with care so as not to enhance the prestige of a despotic leader.Expanding on his critique of Mr. Obama while speaking with reporters aboard his campaign bus on Tuesday, Mr. McCain repeatedly voiced skepticism at what he described as the “school of thought” that urges, “Let’s sit down and talk, and we can work everything out,” arguing such efforts had repeatedly failed in history.“It’s happened time after time after time,” he said. “Unfortunately, generally speaking, unless there are reasons and national security interests involved in both parties, then they don’t work.”'"

"'08-05-21,'0','To reach their conclusions, the scientists compared the list of the most popular second-generation biofuels with the list of invasive species and found an alarming degree of overlap. They said little evaluation of risk had occurred before planting.“With biofuels, there’s always a hurry,” said Geoffrey Howard, an invasive species expert with the International Union for Conservation of Nature. “Plantations are started by investors, often from the U.S. or Europe, so they are eager to generate biofuels within a couple of years and also, as you might guess, they don’t want a negative assessment.”The biofuels industry said the risk of those crops morphing into weed problems is overstated, noting that proposed biofuel crops, while they have some potential to become weeds, are not plants that inevitably turn invasive.“There are very few plants that are ‘weeds,’ full stop,” said Willy De Greef, incoming secretary general of EuropaBio, an industry group. “You have to look at the biology of the plant and the environment where you’re introducing it and ask, are there worry points here?” He said that biofuel farmers would inevitably introduce new crops carefully because they would not want growth they could not control.The European Union and the United States have both instituted biofuel targets as a method to reduce carbon emissions. The European Union’s target of 10 percent biofuel use in transportation by 2020 is binding. As such, politicians are anxiously awaiting the commercial perfection of second-generation biofuels.The European Union is funding a project to introduce the “giant reed, a high-yielding, non-food plant into Europe Union agriculture,” according to its proposal. The reed is environmentally friendly and a cost-effective crop, poised to become the “champion of biomass crops,” the proposal says.A proposed Florida biofuel plantation and plant, also using giant reed, has been greeted with enthusiasm by investors, its energy sold even before it is built.But the project has been opposed by the Florida Native Plants Society and a number of scientists because of its proximity to the Everglades, where giant reed overgrowth could be dangerous, they said. The giant reed, previously used mostly in decorations and in making musical instruments — is a fast-growing, thirsty species that has drained wetlands and clogged drainage systems in other places where it has been planted. It is also highly flammable and increases the risk of fires.From a business perspective, the good thing about second-generation biofuel crops is that they are easy to grow and need little attention. But that is also what creates their invasive potential.“These are tough survivors, which means they’re good producers for biofuel because they grow well on marginal land that you wouldn’t use for food,” Dr. Howard said. “But we’ve had 100 years of experience with introductions of these crops that turned out to be disastrous for environment, people, health.”Stas Burgiel, a scientist at the Nature Conservancy, said the cost of controlling invasive species is immense and generally not paid by those who created the problem.But he and other experts emphasized that some of the second-generation biofuel crops could still be safe if introduced into the right places and under the right conditions“With biofuels we need to do proper assessments and take appropriate measures so they don’t get out of the gate, so to speak,” he said. That assessment, he added, must take a broad geographical perspective since invasive species don’t respect borders.The Global Invasive Species Program estimates that the damage from invasive species costs the world more than $1.4 trillion annually — five percent of the global economy.Jatropha, the darling of the second-generation biofuels community, is now being cultivated widely in East Africa in brand new biofuel plantations. But jatropha has been recently banned by two Australian states as an invasive species. If jatropha, which is poisonous, overgrows farmland or pastures, it could be disastrous for the local food supply in Africa, experts said.But Mr. De Greef said jatropha had little weed potential in most areas, adding: “Just because a species has caused a problem in one place doesn’t make it a weed everywhere.”'"

"'08-05-22,'1','Q. What is a ""bridge loan,"" and what is it used for?A. A ""bridge loan"" is temporary financing that is used to close on the purchase of a new property before the current property has been sold, according to Oded Ben-Ami, a senior loan officer for Sterling National Bank, a mortgage lender in Great Neck on Long Island. But not all lenders mean the same thing when they use the term, he said.Such a loan often takes the form of equity financing against the current property — to be paid off upon sale. But Mr. Ben-Ami noted that creditors will not issue a new line of credit when a property is already on the market. So this type of bridge loan will typically work only if the line of credit has already been established and is available to be drawn upon.If that option is not available, it may also be possible to get a line of credit — in addition to the new mortgage — against the new property and then pay down that loan when the current property is sold.Finally, Mr. Ben-Ami said, a bridge loan may take the form of a personal loan — sometimes secured by investment securities — for the amount needed to complete the purchase.'"
"'08-05-22,'1','Declines in nationwide home prices accelerated in the first quarter, falling a record 1.7 percent from the end of 2007 and darkening the clouds over a struggling mortgage market, according to a federal index released Thursday.The national house price index of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (Ofheo), which covers home purchases, is also down a record 3.1 percent in the quarter from the year-ago period.Falling home prices have wreaked havoc on the housing market since last year, stoking a rise in foreclosures as homeowners find their homes are worth less than they owe their lenders. The decline in home equity and tight credit conditions may cost nearly 13 percent of residential borrowers their homes by 2012, according to Credit Suisse.“For homeowners and financial market observers, these declines spell further erosion in home equity levels and potentially more trouble for mortgage markets,” James Lockhart, Ofheo’s director, said in a statement.The agency’s broader index, which includes appraisals for refinancings, fell 0.2 percent last quarter and was unchanged from a year earlier.Ofheo’s monthly price index, introduced in February, showed home values declined by 0.4 percent in March, and are down 3.7 percent from their peak in April 2007.'"

"'08-05-22,'1','Does this sound familiar? Muslim men are stripped in front of female guards and sexually humiliated. A prisoner is made to wear a dog’s collar and leash, another is hooded with women’s underwear. Others are shackled in stress positions for hours, held in isolation for months, and threatened with attack dogs.You might think we are talking about that one cell block in , where President Bush wants the world to believe a few rogue soldiers dreamed up a sadistic nightmare. These atrocities were committed in the interrogation centers in American military prisons in , and , . And they were not revealed by Red Cross officials, human rights activists, Democrats in Congress or others the administration writes off as soft-on-terror.They were described in a painful report by the Justice Department’s inspector general, based on the accounts of hundreds of agents who saw American interrogators repeatedly mistreat prisoners in ways that the agents considered violations of American law and the Conventions. According to the report, some of the agents began keeping a “war crimes file” — until they were ordered to stop.These were not random acts. It is clear from the inspector general’s report that this was organized behavior by both civilian and military interrogators following the specific orders of top officials. The report shows what happens when an American president, his secretary of defense, his Justice Department and other top officials corrupt American law to rationalize and authorize the abuse, humiliation and torture of prisoners:— Four F.B.I. agents saw an interrogator cuff two detainees and force water down their throats.— Prisoners at Guantánamo were shackled hand-to-foot for prolonged periods and subjected to extreme heat and cold.— At least one detainee at Guantánamo was kept in an isolation cell for at least two months, a practice the military considers to be torture when applied to American soldiers.'"
"'08-05-22,'1','In recent months, South Korea has experienced calls to create a domestic coal industry in order to reduce dependence on imports. In the United Kingdom, where coal’s decline became a symbol of withered industrial might, companies are increasing production and considering reopening at least one closed mine as demand for British coal rises.“It’s now the perfect storm with demand for our coal from South Africa to China and Australia,” said Rhidian Davies, president of Energybuild, an operator of mines in South Wales that will increase production at one of its mines tenfold over the next five years.In Japan, higher commodity prices have also unleashed soaring demand for the heavily populated nation’s other limited natural resources, including lumber and natural gas, where production has risen nearly 20 percent this year to a three-decade high.But coal is the most potentially plentiful fossil fuel in Japan, and companies have been quick to embrace now affordable domestic supplies out of deep-rooted anxieties about Japan’s heavy reliance on imported energy.While there are no national figures yet, mining communities report sharply higher production in the last two years. For example, in Bibai the city’s last two mines, both small strip mines, produced just 34,961 tons of coal in 2005. This year, they expect to surpass 150,000 tons, the highest production since 1973, when the city’s last large underground mine was shutting down.For decades, Japanese coal, at $100 or more a ton, was simply too expensive because of high wages and extraction costs. But with global prices now reaching the same heights, Japanese coal is looking more attractive.The price of power-station coal shipped from Newcastle, Australia, settled at $134 a metric ton for the week ending May 16, from a high of $142 for the week ending Feb. 15. In May 2003, the price was $23.25 a metric ton.The utility company Hokkaido Electric Power announced it would nearly double purchases of domestic coal this year to 110,000 tons, while Mitsubishi Materials, a cement maker, said it would buy domestic coal for the first time in 18 years.Demand is so high that one of Bibai’s mine operators, the Hokuryo Corporation, is now scouting a second mine to double its output.But the industry’s long decline has made it difficult to gear up. There are almost no geologists left in Japan specializing in coal, or recent surveys of coal deposits in the region. To conduct its search, Hokuryo is relying on a stack of torn, yellowed maps hand-drawn by company geologists more than 40 years ago.“Our predecessors braved the bears in the woods to leave us these maps,” said Fumihiro Yamamoto, the Hokuryo mine’s director.Other changes in the last four decades could also hamper efforts to increase production. Hokuryo and other companies say they can no longer build large underground mines because no Japanese worker would want to work in such dark and dangerous conditions today.At the same time, environmental regulations prevent most strip-mining, which creates huge open pits that can be eyesores. There have been proposals to raise production using new, untested technologies like pumping in water or heat to liquefy coal so it can be sucked it out of the ground like oil.Even if such technologies worked, no one is expecting Japan to become self-sufficient in coal anytime soon. Domestic coal production contributes only 0.8 percent of the total coal consumed by Japan. Still, there is enormous potential: Sorachi, the region that includes Bibai, sits on an estimated six billion tons of coal, enough to supply Japan’s current level of use for 30 years.“I don’t think we can expect a dramatic increase in the near future” in domestic coal production, said Hirofumi Furukawa, general manager of the Japan Coal Energy Center, an industry-affiliated research group. “But still, it is good to have a rare bit of encouraging news.”Japan’s coal industry needs cheering up: nationwide, production is down from its peak in 1961 when 662 mines yielded 55 million tons of coal. Last year, eight mines produced about 1.4 million tons, according to Mr. Furukawa and Japan’s economy ministry.Japan’s hard-hit coal mining communities have sought ways to cope with the industry’s long decay. The town of Yubari, an hour east of Bibai, went bankrupt after building an extravagant amusement park, the Coal History Village, which failed to attract tourists.That does not mean coal is a savior. In fact, so far the coal revival has failed to produce new jobs in Bibai’s mines, where machines now do most of the digging. Many residents doubt a real renaissance is even possible. Much of the city’s population is in its 70s or older. Some doubt that working-age people who left when the mines closed will ever want to come back.“Even if a few young people come back, it won’t be enough to save this town,” said Mitsuko Michiyama, 69, who owns a clothing shop on an empty shopping street where most storefronts are boarded up.Still, business is looking up for Hokuryo, a unit of the Mitsubishi Corporation that once operated vast mines producing a million tons of coal a year and employing 8,000 workers.Today, it employs just 40 at its single remaining strip mine.The mine had survived by supplying about 30,000 tons a year to Hokkaido Electric, which bought the coal in order to support a local industry. Then, starting last year, the mine began receiving calls from other potential buyers. This year, it has promised to deliver some 120,000 tons of coal, far beyond the mine’s initial projected output of 50,000 tons, said Mr. Yamamoto, the mine’s director.With its half dozen bulldozers and power shovels digging full-time, the company has had to turn down a half dozen would-be buyers.“It’s frustrating,” said Mr. Yamamoto, who has witnessed the industry’s decline after he started working 36 years ago in one of Japan’s last big underground mines. “It was so hard for so long, and now we refuse big customers.”At the mine, an open pit cut into a mountainside above Bibai, the mood is noticeably upbeat. Workers say they are working every day of the week, which was not the case even last year.“We’re all really thankful,” said Takeshi Sasaki, who wore a hard hat as he checked one of the conveyers that wash and sort newly unearthed coal. “If this keeps going, it will mean a whole new era for Bibai.”'"
"'08-05-22,'1','Baseball games are taking an extra minute out of the lives of fans, and team owners are concerned. On Tuesday, officials from the office of Commissioner Bud Selig held conference calls with club officials and umpires to remind them of rules designed to quicken games.After several years in which the time of games had decreased, games are on average a minute longer this season compared with 2007, when the average nine-inning major league game lasted 2 hours 51 minutes.The longer games come after a postseason in which many games lasted more than three hours.The issue was raised at the owners’ meetings in Milwaukee last week. In response, the commissioner’s office held conference calls with managers, general managers, in-game entertainment staffs and umpiring crew chiefs to remind them of several rules that have been implemented to quicken games.The rules include not granting time to a batter who asks for it once the pitcher has begun his delivery, warning a pitcher for his first violation of the 12-second time limit and issuing a pitcher a ball for each subsequent violation. Also, umpires are expected break up conferences on the mound more quickly, especially if the visitor is not prompt to the mound.“Clubs and fans share the common objective of seeing a game that is played as sharply and crisply as possible,” Selig said in a written statement.'"

"'08-05-22,'1','Nuveen Investments, the largest American manager of closed-end funds, said on Wednesday that it had a commitment for up to $1.75 billion in liquidity support to help refinance the troubled auction-rate preferred shares its funds once issued.The move is the firm’s latest step to back away from the stalled auction-rate securities market. On Tuesday, the Eaton Vance Corporation, another primary seller of closed-end funds, announced a similar move.Closed-ends funds are a variant of a mutual fund in which a set number of shares are sold in an initial public offering. Proceeds are used to buy the fund’s initial holdings, and the shares themselves are listed on an exchange, where they are bought and sold among investors. Demand for closed-end funds had grown steadily after several years of strong returns in a bull market.But the funds are now struggling. Most of them use leverage to enhance returns, and many of them borrowed that leverage in the auction-rate market, which is now effectively in liquidation.Nuveen hopes to issue variable-rate instruments to replace the auction-rate securities used as leverage in its closed-end funds. Nuveen said the replacement instruments would also include an unconditional “put” feature, making them potentially attractive to money market funds, which cannot currently invest in auction-rate preferred shares, and to other qualified institutional investors.The firm added that the approach to refinancing the securities in municipal closed-end funds could, if successful, also be used with taxable funds.'"
"'08-05-22,'1','Live Search cashback is essentially a marketing effort by Microsoft to promote its search service, which lags far behind those of Google and Yahoo in popularity. On Wednesday, the research firm comScore reported that Google’s share of all searches in the United States grew once again in April, to 61.6 percent, from 59.8 percent in March.Google gained at the expense of Yahoo and Microsoft, which experienced declines in search share, Yahoo to 20.4 percent, Microsoft to 9.1 percent.Google has put marketing dollars into some of its services, but it has managed to dominate in search while spending virtually no money to promote its search engine. Google declined to comment on the Microsoft announcement.Microsoft said that 700 merchants offering more than 10 million products have agreed to participate in the program. They include Barnesandnoble.com, Circuit City, eBay, Foot Locker, Home Depot and Hewlett-Packard.“It is a great opportunity for buyers who come to eBay,” said Matt Ackley, vice president for Internet marketing and advertising at eBay. “And it is all about driving demand for our sellers.”EBay is one of the largest buyers of search advertisements on Google and other search engines. Mr. Ackley said that if Microsoft’s program was effective, eBay might shift some of its advertising dollars to Microsoft from Google.In most cases, Microsoft will determine the amount of the rebate that shoppers will get. On a Samsung digital camera that costs $90 to $107, rebates range from 2 percent to 5 percent.“Microsoft’s issue is lack of consumer share,” said Bryan Wiener, the chief executive of 360i, a digital marketing agency that specializes in Internet search. “This is an interesting effort to try to motivate consumers to use Microsoft without cheapening the process.“Will the incentives be enough?” he said. “Time will tell.”As part of the program, Microsoft is also unveiling a new business model that allows search marketers to pay for ads only when people buy a product, rather than when they simply click on an ad.Microsoft said this so-called cost-per-action model would give advertisers more precise returns on their marketing budgets. Google already offers a program that allows advertisers to tailor their bids on keywords based on the number of actions, or conversions, they get.Microsoft also said that it had integrated Farecast, a travel Web site that Microsoft acquired in April, into Live Search cashback. The Live Search cashback service was built on technology developed by Jellyfish, a start-up that Microsoft acquired in 2007.'"

The Explore is from Eye-Fi, which introduced a memory card with built-in Wi-Fi and automatic uploading last year.The card, with a capacity of 2 gigabytes and a price tag of $130, uses Wi-Fi to figure out your location. It works through a partnership with Skyhook Wireless, which has mapped Wi-Fi hotspots in the United States and Europe.When you take a picture, the card records which Wi-Fi signals are nearby. Skyhook attaches the latitude and longitude coordinates to the photo file. If you use a photo site that can handle geotagging, like Flickr, SmugMug or Picasa, it will pick up that data so you can plot the photo’s location on a map.The Explore, which will be available from major retailers next month, also uploads wirelessly to photo sites. Through a partnership with Wayport, which manages 10,000 hotspots, including those in McDonald’s restaurants and 700 hotels, the photos load automatically, with no need to sign in.

"'08-05-22,'1','The Roesners say they have had no choice but to adjust. In one year, Mrs. Roesner said, the price of a 50-pound bag of fertilizer more than doubled to $19.99, from $7.89; a bale of hay rose to $6.29, from $4.29, and a 50-pound bag of horse feed to $10.49, from $6.99.Officially, the government is indicating that inflation is in check, taking into account seasonal variations. On Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices climbed just 0.2 percent in April. The core rate, though, which excludes food and energy, had its largest year-over-year jump since 1991.And last week, the government reported that consumer prices inched up in April, suggesting cooling inflation.But on Main Street and in households across America — where rapidly rising fuel and food prices are not excluded — the picture is not so rosy. Gasoline prices are now up to about $3.80 a gallon. The cost of diesel fuel, which powers many small business vehicles, set a record yet again on Wednesday, about $4.56 a gallon, up nearly 64 percent from a year ago. And food prices rose at a 0.9 percent rate in April, the biggest one-month jump since 1990.“The Federal Reserve in its minutes says it is counting on the recession to manage inflation,” Mr. Dunkelberg wrote in his summary. “If we are in a recession, it is not getting the job done.”Economists, including Mr. Dunkelberg and Raymond Keating of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, have tracked an increase in prices over the last couple of years, though Mr. Keating said it was “not the raging inflation we had in the 1970s.”To be sure, not every business is passing along the pain, Mr. Keating said, but certainly more owners are trying to do it this year if the competition allows it. That trend has been reflected in the monthly surveys of the National Federation of Independent Businesses this year.Zachary Hoffman, an owner of Wiley Office Furniture in Springfield, Ill., said he, too, had been passing “more and more manufacturers’ price increases on to our customers.”Suppliers, especially those shipping steel components like shelves, desks and files, used to raise prices in line with the consumer price index, Mr. Hoffman said. Now it is twice that rate, he said.Beyond the cost of goods, Wiley Office Furniture is grappling with significant operating expenses. “Our fuel bill has more than doubled in the space of a year,” he said. The company’s delivery trucks run on diesel and only get about seven miles to the gallon, and the cost to service those vehicles has also gone up.The company’s utility bill has skyrocketed, so much that Wiley replaced all of its lights in its showroom with more efficient fluorescent lights, Mr. Hoffman said, which are turned down to save energy. And it is now aggressively recycling all cardboard boxes to save on waste removal.This year for the first time, he said, the company had to ask its 30 full-time employees to pay a share of their health insurance.More customers are coming in to pick up furniture, he said, because the company had had to raise its delivery charges. Even so, on long hauls, delivery is a losing proposition for Wiley. Now it is grouping those long-distance deliveries by ZIP code to become more efficient. That takes longer, but customers are willing to wait to pay less, Mr. Hoffman said.Copley Feed, too, is altering deliveries, scaling back to twice a week from three times. It will deliver only once a week if necessary, Mrs. Roesner said.So far, neither Wiley nor Copley has had to consider layoffs, but that could change.“We have always been very frugal,” Mrs. Roesner said. “We are making sure that lights are off in areas we are not in. Sometimes the guys tend to leave a room and leave the lights on, so we women get on them about it. If we are slow then I put it up to the employees to pick who wants off early.”Mrs. Roesner said she was not sure if she would have to resort to layoffs if the price of gasoline climbed to $5 a gallon. Her customers, she suspects, will be cutting back on owning pets since that can be seen as more of a luxury than a necessity. Lawn and garden customers might forgo splurging this season.Already, some pleasure-horse owners are putting their horses out to pasture, which means those customers are not buying her feed. “We’ve seen a recession before,” Mrs. Roesner said, recalling her nearly 40 years in the business, “but not to this extent.”'"
"'08-05-22,'1','Q. Mushrooms are growing around the stump of a fallen tree in my yard. Are they harmful to plants or other trees, or just signs that the stump is decomposing?A. It is tempting to say do not worry, they are probably the harmless Coprinus micaceus, a small dark tan mushroom with inky gills. It grows in clumps around dead trees and seems to be everywhere in spring.But I am going to resist, because they might be any of several hundred others.You might, for instance, have oyster mushrooms, Pleurotus ostreatus, the species sold in grocery stores. Oysters can spread to and weaken other trees, so it would be wise to remove the stump. (The fungus permeates the wood and cannot be banished separately).Alternatively, the mushrooms might be the little brown Flammulina velutipes, another common edible. Or maybe they are the little brown Gallerina autumnalis. It is common. It fruits in spring in spite of its name. It is one of the most lethal mushrooms known.To figure out roughly what you have, try using the online guide offered through Messiah College, in Grantham, Pa. It is at messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood.To learn whether the mushrooms you have are safe to eat, an essential prelude to consumption, try finding a local expert through the North American Mycological Association, at namyco.org.'"

A final pathology analysis showed that it had not, Mr. McCain’s staff said at the time.Mr. McCain has said he did not need chemotherapy or radiation.Mr. McCain and his doctors have released little other information about the surgery.In his first campaign for president in 1999, Mr. McCain made public, also to a tightly controlled group of reporters, 1,500 pages of in-depth medical and psychiatric records amassed in a Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war.Mr. McCain, who was imprisoned and sometimes tortured over five and a half years in North Vietnam, has difficulty raising his arms because of injuries sustained in the ordeal. He receives what his staff calls a tax-exempt “disability pension” from the Navy, $58,358 in 2007.Since last year, Mr. McCain has repeatedly promised to release his more recent medical history, but has delayed for more than a year. Last week, he told reporters that the delay was because of a “scheduling conflict,” or what an aide said was the difficulty in gathering his doctors at one time. Mr. McCain also said the release had been slowed by his doctors’ insistence on accuracy.“They’re going to be saying, ‘We have reviewed these records and these are the facts,’ ” Mr. McCain said. “And I think it’s very clear that they want to make sure that every single thing is right.”On Friday, the campaign will allow a small pool of reporters access to the records from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific time in a conference room at the Copper Wind Resort in Phoenix, near the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale. The reporters will be allowed to take notes but not remove or photocopy the records. Campaign officials said they were imposing the restrictions to prevent the actual records from wide dissemination.Around the same time, campaign officials said, they will post medical summaries of each year from 2000 to 2008 on the campaign Web site. The summaries will not include doctors’ notes in the actual records.The news organizations in the pool, selected by the campaign, include ABC News, The Arizona Republic, The Associated Press, Bloomberg, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Reuters, The Washington Post and, possibly, a newsmagazine.Each organization is allowed two representatives and is expected to file a “pool report” for other reporters detailing the information in the records.At 11 a.m. Pacific time, the campaign said, Mr. McCain’s doctors will be available to all reporters in a 90-minute conference call.'"

They’re trying to nickel and dime us.”Ms. Pineda, who managed to pack the family’s belongings in one suitcase, said she would rather pay the additional $15 as part of the fare. “If it’s $160 to Miami and if they charged me $175, I’d pay it,” she said.Ms. Pineda might be exempt from the fee.

They ticked through her talking points — among them that results from the disputed states of Florida and Michigan could change the dynamic; that the race could swing her way with help from unaligned, party superdelegates with automatic seats at the Democratic nominating convention (who are presumably committed consumers of political news coverage).Inevitably, however, commentators returned to the conclusion that, with his grasp on a majority of the pledged delegates available in this year’s primaries and caucuses — with the exception of the contested states of Florida and Michigan — Mr. Obama has this thing nailed.Working his touch-screen, electronic electoral map on CNN on Tuesday night, the correspondent John King highlighted Mrs. Clinton’s strong showing in Kentucky and said, “Senator Clinton’s math does improve, without a doubt.” But, he said, even if Mrs. Clinton were to be awarded the delegates from Michigan and Florida in the proportion she thinks she deserves for winning in both states — though all delegates were supposed to be withheld as punishment to the state parties for moving their primary dates up — “it is still very tough math.”Speaking on “Today” this morning, the NBC News Washington Bureau chief Tim Russert said, “The import of last night: The superdelegates would now have to say, ‘You know what, elected delegates? You made your decision, you made your choice, but we’re going to, in effect, overrule you.’” He added, “I cannot find a superdelegate who wants to do that.”After George Stephanopoulos offered a similar analysis on “Good Morning America” on ABC, the host Robin Roberts asked, “Is there any kind of way, mathematically, she can win the nomination?”“Mathematically, yes,” he said, before going on to say that she would have to win 84 percent of the delegates who remain up for grabs, which did not shake him from his bottom-line analysis: “Unless some kind of lightning strikes, Barack Obama is going to be the nominee.”At least he was offering a chance of lightening, unlike Brit Hume on Fox News Channel, who last night said of Mrs. Clinton, “She can’t possibly, unless she’s taken leave of her senses, think that her chances of actually prevailing for the nomination are very good.”But if there was one silver lining for Mrs. Clinton in the news media coverage, it was that the primary results abruptly shifted the focus to her continued candidacy after a week in which it had centered on the general election sniping between Mr. Obama, of Illinois, and the presumed Republican nominee, Senator John McCain, of Arizona.“It is almost as if there are two different races going on here,” Nina Easton, the Fortune magazine Washington Bureau chief said on Fox News Channel. “All week long, it was as if Hillary hardly wasn’t on stage — he was battling it out over foreign policy and who you negotiate with with John McCain.”For now, Mrs. Clinton is back on the stage, and Tuesday definitely showed that as long as she runs — and runs strongly in some states — she will be able to continue to command some attention from news media eager to cover the general election.“We’re just all mindful of the fact that it is an ongoing process, we have to watch what they do and watch what the voters tell us,” said Marty Ryan, the executive producer of Fox News Channel’s political programming. “It’s not our position to tell people when the primaries are over.”'"
"'08-05-22,'1','In addition to Mr. Crist, Mr. Jindal and Mr. Romney, the McCain guest list includes some of his top political counselors, among them Charlie Black, a senior strategist, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, his frequent traveling companion and probably his closest colleague in the Senate. Also on hand will be at least one senior business executive prominent in Mr. McCain’s circle, Frederick W. Smith, the chairman of FedEx.Mr. McCain himself has said his choice of a running mate would draw particular scrutiny from voters given Mr. McCain’s age; he is now 71, or “as old as dirt,” as he likes to joke, while quickly adding that he is in good health. More than that, with Mr. Obama’s selection as his party’s nominee now almost assured, Mr. McCain is contemplating a contest against an energized Democratic electorate after a campaign that has highlighted race and gender issues.The meeting, which was not disclosed publicly, is taking place on a weekend after Mr. McCain releases his health-care records. The release of those records on Friday is itself a high-profile event that could — by design or not — draw attention away from the gathering.Mr. McCain said this month that he had assembled a list of about 20 potential running mates. He said he had not decided when he would make a decision; his aides made clear that he would keep the process as closely held as possible.Among the other potential running mates are Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, and Rob Portman, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget who had been an Ohio congressman.Mr. Crist, a fairly popular first-term governor, has been included on various lists of potential running mates for Mr. McCain, whom he endorsed shortly before Florida’s January primary, which effectively helped Mr. McCain claim the nomination. Mr. Crist said Wednesday that he and Mr. McCain had not discussed the prospect, not even at a fund-raiser in Miami that the two attended Tuesday night.The McCain campaign, Mr. Crist said, has not solicited the kind of personal information typically requested to vet possible running mates.As governor of Florida, Mr. Crist, 51, would bring obvious assets to the Republican ticket, beginning with his popularity in a state that is almost always an electoral battleground — and where Mr. Obama appears to be struggling. Mr. Crist’s relative youth could also be an asset for Mr. McCain, who has made clear that age will be a consideration in his search for a running mate.In Florida, Mr. Crist has long been known for his affability and a campaign skills. Instantly recognizable because of his perpetual tan and striking white hair, Mr. Crist, who was Florida’s attorney general before being elected governor in 2006, has also acquired a reputation as something of a hard-liner on law and order issues.He supports the death penalty, largely opposes restrictions on the rights of gun owners, early on earned the nickname “Chain Gang Charlie” because he favored allowing convicts to be used in road work, and has described himself as a “pro-life and pro-family” candidate.Mr. Romney, the former chief executive who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination in 2008 and who was born in Michigan, has made no secret of his desire to join Mr. McCain’s presidential ticket. Mr. Romney’s M.B.A. skills, and business background — including running the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games — could address concerns about Mr. McCain’s ability to manage a struggling economy.Mr. Romney has also proven himself as a prolific fund-raiser, though he spent enormous sums of money during his campaign and still could not beat Mr. McCain.Mr. Jindal, who was born in Baton Rouge, La., to a family that had just arrived there from the Punjab area of India, took office in January after serving three years in the House of Representatives. In a race with four candidates, Mr. Jindal, who was born a Hindu but converted to Roman Catholicism as a teenager, won 54 percent of the vote after campaigning as a social conservative, opposing human embryonic stem cell research and abortion in any form, and favoring teaching “intelligent design” in schools as an alternative to evolution.'"

"'08-05-23,'0','The 2003 Medicare law was a disturbing case in point. It blocked states from regulating most abuse by private Medicare insurance plans — an area the administration is not properly policing. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents insurance regulators in all 50 states, has protested that its members no longer have the authority they need to protect sick, elderly consumers.The Associated Press recently reported that the administration has quietly rewritten more than 50 proposed or adopted federal regulations to make it more difficult for consumers to sue makers of unsafe food, drugs and other dangerous products. The federal standard for head restraints in automobiles had language expressly saying it did not pre-empt state-court lawsuits — but it was taken out. Manufacturers are more likely to make unsafe products if they know a customer who is injured or killed cannot sue.One of the bitterest pre-emption battles has been over chemical plant safety. A terrorist strike on a big chemical plant could injure or kill hundreds or even thousands of Americans. The chemical industry has succeeded, however, in blocking mandatory federal safety requirements. When New Jersey imposed its own reasonable rules, the industry and the administration went into overdrive, fighting fiercely — so far, unsuccessfully — to pass a federal law pre-empting New Jersey’s safety requirements.The administration has used other powers to pre-empt sound state laws. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency blocked California from curbing greenhouse-gas emissions from new cars and trucks by denying it a waiver that was once granted routinely — a move Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called “unconscionable.”Most of this has happened outside the public spotlight, but there is one case that has been grabbing attention. The actor Dennis Quaid and his wife are suing the maker of the blood thinner heparin after their newborn twins were mistakenly given large doses at a hospital. The Quaids argue that confusing packaging was at fault, but the drug company that makes heparin is saying that once the Food and Drug Administration approved its packaging, lawsuits like the Quaids’ were blocked.Most Americans may not know about the supremacy clause, but they do seem to understand that they are increasingly vulnerable. Weeks before the 2006 elections shifted control of Congress from the Republicans to the Democrats, 79 percent of respondents in an Opinion Research poll said big business had too much influence over the Bush administration. As Democrats and Republicans contemplate what kind of “change” voters are looking for now, they can start with the idea that both the federal and state government need to do a better job of protecting their citizens.'"

"'08-05-23,'0','To be sure, oil prices have never been higher. Though they eased on Thursday to $130.81 a barrel, down $2.36 on the day, they are up 30 percent in the last two months. And just as sure, Democrats in Congress are itching to take action — perhaps by taxing so-called windfall profits of oil companies, perhaps by allowing the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to be sued in American courts under antitrust laws.But neither those initiatives nor a portfolio of others currently under consideration are likely to reduce prices at the pump. And so the lawmakers and the oil titans, well aware of this reality but also mindful of the roles they are expected to play, ran through a familiar script.The executives firmly insisted that global market forces beyond their control were to blame for high prices. “As repetitive and uninteresting as it may sound, the fundamental laws of supply and demand are at work,” said John Hofmeister, the president of Shell Oil Company.The executives politely but just as firmly insisted that Congress should focus its efforts on allowing more drilling and exploration for domestic oil — in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, offshore in the Atlantic and Pacific, and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. They insisted that they were investing heavily in search of new oil supplies.And they strongly warned against other measures: any new tax on profits would put American companies at a disadvantage and only further decrease oil supply; a temporary suspension of the federal gas tax would increase demand and only raise prices more; lawsuits against foreign nations would do nothing to lower prices.The lawmakers played their parts, too — showing mostly outrage and fury. “You all are gouging the American public and it needs to stop,” declared Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee. Other Democratic lawmakers openly questioned whether the companies were illegally fixing prices to hoard profits and voiced suspicions that they were in cahoots with Vice President Dick Cheney to enrich the energy industry.The Republicans, on the whole, were more understanding of the needs of America’s corporate citizens but still sought to sympathize with their constituents.Representative Chris Cannon, Republican of Utah, gave an impassioned speech on the need to develop more petroleum from oil shale, which can be found in abundance in the rugged terrain of the Rocky Mountain West.And Representative Ric Keller, Republican of Florida, said: “In terms of solution, which is where we are all going right now, I firmly believe that we need to have more exploration.” He added: “One law we can’t change here in Congress is the law of supply and demand.”Later in the hearing, though, Mr. Keller expressed little sympathy when the executives said that they sold gasoline in the United States on slim margins. “You are saying, ‘I need a hug here, because margins are tight?’ ” he asked incredulously.As in the Senate hearing, lawmakers focused on the record profits that oil companies have enjoyed in recent years, and the large compensation packages of their executives, even though none of those testifying was actually the highest-paid employee in their firms.It was also clear that Senator Patrick J. Leahy had made an impression on Wednesday when he ridiculed some of the executives for claiming they did not know how much they were actually paid.When a lawmaker demanded that John E. Lowe, the executive vice president of ConocoPhillips, tell her the pay of the company’s chief executive, Mr. Lowe said he did not know it but told her where to look. “I know it’s on page 36 of the proxy,” he said. “Because I looked at my compensation on page 36 of the proxy last night.”The House Judiciary Committee hearing stretched on for most of the day, interrupted briefly at points as lawmakers rushed over to the Capitol to cast votes. Throughout the day, Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, presided with a regal air, a demeanor accentuated by his maroon velvet sport coat.In one of the more pointed exchanges, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, seized on the record $40.6 billion profit of Exxon Mobil in 2007. She pounded on the company’s senior vice president, J. Stephen Simon, demanding to know if gas prices would be lower if the company earned a few billion dollars less.At another point, Ms. Waters brazenly suggested that perhaps the American oil industry should be nationalized, acknowledging that it was an “extreme step” but one that might be necessary if outsize profits and exorbitant gasoline prices continued.“Thank you for being here today,” Ms. Waters told the executives. “If you feel a little bit beaten up on, we all feel beaten up on, so just share the pain. We get our behinds kicked every day in our districts about what is going on.”'"
"'08-05-23,'0','Though the official was not named in the lawsuit, William J. Davis, a lawyer for Kool-Tech, disclosed two weeks ago in an interview that it was Mr. Olmert, and that the hotel reservation had been made by Shula Zaken, Mr. Olmert’s longtime aide.He said the company broke off ties with Mr. Talansky upon learning of the expenditure, largely out of a desire to steer clear of doing anything illegal or running afoul of laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes to foreign officials.Mr. Davis said that he was told that the F.B.I. had opened an investigation that included Mr. Talansky’s activities, but he said that neither he nor his client had yet been contacted by the authorities. He would not disclose his source.Selva Ozelli, a New York lawyer who has written extensively about the antibribery statute, agreed that paying the hotel bill for a foreign politician could violate the law if the American benefactor received something in return. To be illegal, the payment or gift “has to be in furtherance of their business purpose,” she said.No one responded to a message left at the Talansky home in Woodsburgh, N.Y., and lawyers who have previously represented Mr. Talansky in commercial disputes either failed to return phone calls or said they had no information on the new lawsuit or the possibility of an F.B.I. investigation.A New York spokesman for the F.B.I. said it was the agency’s policy not to confirm or deny investigations.Mr. Talansky had proved helpful to Mr. Olmert when he was the mayor of Jerusalem by helping start and run the New Jerusalem Foundation, a charity meant to raise money for civic projects in Israel. Its United States office was at the same address as Mr. Talansky’s home. He was listed on tax returns as its treasurer, and his wife, Helene, was listed for a time as the organization’s secretary.Mr. Talansky is also well known in both the United States and Israel for his work as a key fund-raiser in the United States for Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem. Tax returns show that he and his wife, a fellow employee of the hospital’s American charitable organization at the time, received more than $1 million in consulting fees and other payments from the organization in the seven years after they left the charity in 1997.When Mr. Talansky joined Kool-Tech in 2005, his wife also obtained employment there as a bookkeeper.One claim made by the company in the Nassau County lawsuit is that Mr. Talansky improperly withdrew $80,000 in company funds, falsified books to award himself $200,000 in extra capital and urged an employee to work for a competitor.Mr. Talansky, meanwhile, who was the first to sue, accused the company of freezing him out of the business, failing to deliver a prototype for a new minibar, and using company funds to hire a $60,000-a-year personal assistant for the founder’s wife. “As a result, plaintiff’s investment and reputation in the business community have been greatly damaged,” Mr. Talansky argued in the initial complaint.In the latest lawsuit, filed in Manhattan on Thursday, Kool-Tech accused Mr. Talansky of tampering with its 10-year contract at the Excelsior Hotel in New York by aligning himself with a competitor while telling the hotel’s general manager that Kool-Tech was financially shaky and going bankrupt.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','“This is going to take a lot of work,” said Dr. Bruce Psaty, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington.Mr. Leavitt said “the power of this is in the capacity to take disparate databases and use it in a productive way.” Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.’s drug center, agreed that much work remains to be done.The Sentinel Initiative has been in the works for years. In 2005, Mr. Leavitt asked the F.D.A. to explore the creation of such a system. In 2006, the Institute of Medicine recommended one, and last fall Congress voted to require the agency to create such a system.The agency now relies on an unsystematic system in which doctors, patients and manufacturers report problems with drugs and medical devices when they deem them important. One doctor might see an infection following the use of a drug as important to report while another might not. The agency estimates that it receives reports for only a fraction of actual drug effects.And the current system is all but useless when a drug causes a common problem. For instance, the F.D.A. had no way of measuring whether Vioxx, a popular painkiller manufactured by Merck, caused heart problems. The drug was withdrawn in 2004 when a study by Merck found that it doubled heart risks.The use of Medicare records may solve many of these problems because the agency could get a clear idea of what percentage of a drug’s recipients suffer a certain effect.For instance, Dr. Woodcock said she would like to know how often antibiotics like Cipro and Factive cause ruptured tendons. The agency has received enough reports of damaged tendons that it has required the drugs’ labels to warn of such a risk, but its system has no way of measuring the likelihood of the problem.With Sentinel, the agency could ask Medicare officials to count the number of patients given antibiotics who later see doctors or check into hospitals with tendon difficulties, Dr. Woodcock said. It could then compare that number with the overall number of tendon ruptures among Medicare beneficiaries.But there are several problems with this and similar studies.Most important, Medicare collects data only when a doctor, hospital or other medical provider is seeking payment. These are called “claims data,” and they are far less accurate than actual patient health records.For instance, when a hospital bills Medicare for treating a patient with a heart attack, it is not always the case that the patient actually suffered a heart attack any time recently. So using Medicare data to assess health outcomes is often problematic.Another problem is that sometimes patients suffer problems after receiving drugs because they are sick, not because the drug is to blame. Finally, Medicare beneficiaries use an average of 28 prescriptions in a year, compared with an average among all Americans of 16 prescriptions. Sorting out which medicine caused any single problem can be difficult in the elderly.To assess the accuracy of the Sentinel system, the F.D.A. will initially conduct studies of drug side-effects that are already well known, Dr. Woodcock said. The agency is in discussions with private insurers to add their records to the system.Health officials also said they could use the Sentinel system to identify drugs that are not working, a result that could save the government money and relieve patient suffering.Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said his organization supported the F.D.A. initiative “because it allows regulators and health care professionals to move from reliance on voluntary reporting of side effects to proactive monitoring of medicines.”Epidemiologists said they were hopeful the project would prove useful.“If this succeeds, then the use of drugs and vaccines will be safer and better,” said Dr. Richard Platt, chairman of the department of ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','Audio of the sermon, from the late 1990s, was first posted last week by the Web site Talk to Action, which scrutinizes the Christian right, and then reported by The Huffington Post.In the sermon, which is also available on the church’s Web site, Mr. Hagee said the Bible prophesied Hitler’s brutality. “How is God going to bring them back to the land? The answer is fishers and hunters,” Mr. Hagee said, referring to how Jews ended up in the modern state of Israel. “A hunter is someone who comes with a gun and forces you. Hitler was a hunter.”Mr. Hagee continued: “That will be offensive to some people. Well, dear heart, be offended: I didn’t write it. Jeremiah wrote it. It was the truth and it is the truth. How did it happen? Because God allowed it to happen. Why did it happen? Because God said, ‘My top priority for the Jewish people is to get them to come back to the land of Israel.’ ”Asked at a news conference in Stockton, Calif., on Thursday why these particular remarks led him to act, Mr. McCain said, “I just think the statement is crazy and unacceptable.” He added, “We reached a point where that kind of statement, simply, I would reject the endorsement of the expression of those kinds of views.”Some have compared Mr. Hagee’s remarks with those of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., the former pastor of the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Barack Obama. But Mr. McCain said his relationship with Mr. Hagee was different.“I have said I do not believe Senator Obama shares Reverend Wright’s extreme views,” Mr. McCain said in his statement. “But let me also be clear, Reverend Hagee was not and is not my pastor or spiritual adviser, and I did not attend his church for 20 years.”Mr. McCain has been courting Christian conservatives after attacking them eight years ago as “agents of intolerance.” At a speech last year before Mr. Hagee’s Christians United for Israel, he thanked Mr. Hagee for his “spiritual guidance to politicians like me” and said, “It’s hard to do the Lord’s work in the city of Satan.”The latest Hagee remarks to surface may strike at the heart of Mr. McCain’s efforts to reach a critical group of voters, Jews, some of whom have viewed Mr. Obama with suspicion.At roughly the same time the McCain campaign issued its statement on Thursday, Mr. Hagee issued his own statement withdrawing his endorsement of Mr. McCain.“I am tired of these baseless attacks and fear that they have become a distraction in what should be a national debate about important issues,” the Hagee statement said. “I have therefore decided to withdraw my endorsement of Senator McCain for president effective today, and to remove myself from any active role in the 2008 campaign.”Religious and political leaders critical of the sermon welcomed the news that Mr. McCain had rejected Mr. Hagee’s endorsement.“This is a perfect example of when politicians and religious leaders try to use each other, both of them end up getting hurt,” said the Rev. Dr. Welton Gaddy, president of the Interfaith Alliance, a liberal religious group. “The reason that many of us talk about separating religion and politics is that they are two different parts of life, and they operate with different values and methods.”Mr. Hagee said that his sermon had been ""mischaracterized” and that he had always spoken harshly about Hitler and the Holocaust.Mr. Hagee, 68, is not as well known as other evangelical leaders, but he is powerful among strongly conservative evangelical Christians, thanks to a vast media reach.His prominence is partly explained by his activism on behalf of Israel. Mr. Hagee has given about $30 million to Israeli causes.Mr. Hagee’s views flow out of his adherence to what is known in evangelical circles as premillennial dispensationalism, a literalistic approach to biblical prophecy that places a special emphasis on the role of the nation of Israel in the end of history.Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the country’s largest branch of Judaism, said that while he did not consider Mr. Hagee an anti-Semite, he found a reading of the Bible that would include a prophecy of Hitler to be “obscene.”“This is a man who has some profound ambivalence about Jews,” Rabbi Yoffie said. “On the one hand, he has a love for Israel. But on the other, that was a sermon and he said Jews were punished by God for not going to Israel, that the divine plan that brought Israel into being included the Holocaust and Hitler was God’s instrument.”In an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday, Mr. McCain rejected the backing of the second pastor, Mr. Parsley.On Thursday, ABC News broadcast a segment about Mr. Parsley, noting that he has called Islam an “anti-Christ religion” and preached that “America was founded in part to see this false religion destroyed.”“I believe that even though he endorsed me, and I didn’t endorse him, the fact is that I repudiate such talk, and I reject his endorsement,” Mr. McCain said.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','DUBLIN (AP) — Brian Keenan, a commanding figure during the Irish Republican Army’s long march from war to peace, died Wednesday at age 66.The cause was cancer, said the Sinn Fein party, which announced his death.Mr. Keenan of Belfast, Northern Ireland, built up the I.R.A.’s arsenal in the 1970s, directed its bombing campaign in Britain and served on its ruling army council for a decade, voting to break and call cease-fires in the 1990s.To his death, however, Mr. Keenan sent mixed signals on the I.R.A.’s decisions in 2005 to disarm and formally abandon the 1970-97 campaign, which claimed 1,775 lives. He had been the I.R.A.’s most prominent critic of disarmament, insisting that it should not happen until the British north was united with the Irish Republic.Mr. Keenan resigned from the seven-member army council after the 2005 peace moves, when his cancer was already advanced.He was the son of a World War II veteran of Britain’s Royal Air Force. He was a television repairman in Britain, then returned to his homeland in the mid-1960s, when a Catholic civil rights movement was taking shape.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','“It’s now at a level where we have to consider if there’s a deal at all,” said Dvai Ghose, an analyst with Genuity Capital Markets in Toronto. “The $52 billion question now is what the supreme court will do and when.”Other analysts were similarly pessimistic, although some said that it might be possible for Bell to negotiate a settlement with the angry bondholders behind the court challenge that blocked the deal.The Quebec Court of Appeal accepted the argument of the bondholders that Bell had not demonstrated that it made an effort to treat them fairly in the transaction. Under Canadian law, a court, as well as shareholders, must approve the transaction.The debt loaded onto Bell is expected to depress the values of its current bonds by increasing the company’s credit risk.In a note to investors, Jonathan Allen of RBC Capital Markets estimated that it might take 1.3 billion Canadian dollars to placate the current bondholders. He suggested that such a settlement could be accomplished by reducing the takeover price to 41.11 Canadian dollars a share, from the 42.75 Canadian dollars a share that shareholders accepted.But reopening the deal would be fraught with difficulties. It is not certain that shareholders, who would have to vote on any changes, would be open to a lower offer. Any renegotiation might also provide an avenue for skittish banks to escape their lending commitments, which were made last June, before the current credit market crisis.Mr. Ghose is among those who believe that Telus, a smaller communications company that is the dominant carrier in Western Canada, might take advantage of the current confusion to bid for Bell.Like many analysts, he assumed that Telus would make a bid using cash and stock rather than the all-cash deal proposed by the leveraged buyout group. That might suit the individual shareholders in Canada who own Bell stock, many of whom complained that a privatization would exclude them from holding a continuing stake in the company.But the Canadian government is trying to increase competition in the wireless communications market by offering additional radio spectrum to newcomers. Mr. Ghose said that, without its wireless business, Bell would hold little appeal for Telus. So the merged company would have to come up with other proposals to win approval from regulators and competition officials.The court decision in favor of the bondholders was unexpected by lawyers and analysts. On Thursday, several of them said that the supreme court would probably hear Bell’s case and might well rule in its favor.“I don’t think this has really been tested at the supreme court,” said Richard C. Powers, a lawyer who is assistant dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Bell, he added, “does have a very strong case here, the question is how quickly the court will move.”'"

"'08-05-23,'0','Wall Street rebounded moderately on Thursday after two sessions of steep declines, as oil prices stepped back from their frenetic upward run.Oil set another trading record overnight, moving above $135 a barrel for the first time, then pulled back to settle at $130.81, offering some relief for stock investors. The Labor Department said the number of workers seeking unemployment benefits declined 9,000 last week to 365,000. The market had expected a slight increase.But the economic fallout from rising energy prices remained Wall Street’s focus.“People are concerned about the economy and what’s happening with oil,” said Scott Fullman, director of derivatives investment strategy for the WJB Capital Group in New York.Mr. Fullman predicted that the markets would remain jittery and said that the low trading volumes on Thursday indicated that the gains were coming without much conviction.The Dow Jones industrial average declined about 427 points, or 3.3 percent, over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday, the steepest two-day loss since late February.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','A former stock trader was charged on Thursday with duping friends out of $16 million over six years by luring them into various investments, most of which never existed, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said.Instead of investing the money his friends handed him, the ex-trader, David Holzer, 58, spent it on luxuries, including a $300,000 Aston Martin, a gold Cartier watch with diamonds and bracelets from Hermès, the district attorney’s office said. He spent the money so quickly, prosecutors said, that he now has only $375 in one bank account and just over $1,000 in a brokerage account.“The moral of this case is beware of your friends who give you hot investment tips,” Mr. Morgenthau said.Mr. Holzer pleaded not guilty before Justice Roger S. Hayes of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He faces up to 25 years in prison on six charges including first-degree grand larceny. He was arrested on Thursday morning at his apartment in Manhattan and was held in $2 million bail.Mr. Holzer’s lawyer, Ronald Rubinstein, said his client had formed legitimate business partnerships with friends that had soured. As recently as April, Mr. Rubinstein said, his client golfed with one of the people identified as victims in the indictment.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','But Mr. Schwartzman said the Rachofskys’ pact with the museum assured the couple the right to “evolve their collection during their lifetime.” John R. Lane, director of the museum, said the proceeds of the sale would go toward the enrichment of the Rachofskys’ collection, “which will ultimately benefit the museum.”This is not the first time these collectors have sold a work by Mr. Koons. In 2001 they sold “Woman in Tub,” a 1988 sculpture of a woman in a bathtub clutching her breasts, at an auction at Christie’s for $2.8 million. The proceeds allowed the couple to acquire “Balloon Flower (Magenta)” as well as an extensive collection of Arte Povera works by artists like Piero Manzoni, Luciano Fabro and Alighiero Boetti.In November’s New York auctions, two other monumental sculptures by Mr. Koons brought far steeper prices, with “Hanging Heart (Magenta/Gold)” going for $23.5 million at Sotheby’s and “Diamond (Blue)” for $11.8 million at Christie’s. Last week one of the artist’s vacuum cleaner displays brought an identical $11.8 million at Christie’s.Mr. Koons made five “Balloon Flowers,” each in a different color. A blue one sits outside the headquarters of DaimlerChrysler in Berlin; a yellow version is owned by François Pinault, the luxury goods magnate and owner of Christie’s. Mr. Koons himself owns a red one that has been on view since 2006 in a fountain in front of 7 World Trade Center in New York. A fifth, in orange, is in a private collection in France.Christie’s views “Balloon Flower (Magenta)” as a feather in its cap. “There hasn’t been a major Koons like this ever on the market in London,” said Amy Cappellazzo, an international co-head of the auction house’s postwar and contemporary art department, who described the London art market as “exploding.”To land the consignment, Christie’s gave the Rachofskys a guarantee — an undisclosed sum promised regardless of the outcome of the sale — that contemporary art experts familiar with the deal estimated at $25 million.While neither Christie’s nor Sotheby’s will identify the buyers of major Koons sculptures at recent auctions, contemporary art dealers say they believe that the Ukrainian billionaire Victor Pinchuk, who lives in Kiev, bought both “Hanging Heart” and “Blue Diamond.”Collectors from the former Soviet Union have emerged as major buyers of postwar and contemporary art. Since many of them have homes in London, it seems logical that Christie’s included the Koons in its June sales there.Now that a week has passed since Sotheby’s and Christie’s wrapped up their big spring auctions of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art in New York, officials at both houses have had time to digest just who their buyers are.It can be hard to sort out: with so many dealers and art advisers bidding for clients from around the globe, a computer printout of names does not necessarily shed light on where the works will end up.In an off-the-cuff breakdown on May 7 at its auction of Impressionist and modern art, Sotheby’s said that 67 percent of the buyers that night were Americans. On May 15 it revised that figure: a pie chart of buyers that was e-mailed to Sotheby’s clients and is now online at sothebys.com indicates that only 54 percent were Americans.After its Impressionist and modern sale on May 6, Christie’s estimated that 32 percent of its buyers were Americans and 52 percent were Europeans (including Russians). For its postwar and contemporary art sale the following week, it reported that 70 percent of the buyers were American and 26 percent European; but that figure was inaccurate, said Marc Porter, Christie’s president. Once the clients were actually identified, he said, “Russian buying was more present than it’s ever been in New York before,” adding, “American buying was not what it was a year ago.”Whenever either Sotheby’s or Christie’s announces an increase in the fees it charges buyers, it is only a matter of time before the other auction house follows suit. Following Sotheby’s example, Christie’s officials said this week that their house, too, was raising its buyer’s premium.Reporting a first-quarter loss on May 9, Sotheby’s said it would increase its fees on June 1. Both companies had been charging 25 percent of the first $20,000, 20 percent of $20,001 to $500,000 and 12 percent of the rest fetched by an artwork; they will now charge 25 percent on the first $50,000, 20 percent of $50,001 to $1 million and 12 percent from everything above that.In announcing the increase, Sotheby’s said that to stay competitive in winning consignments, it had been remitting part of its buyers’ premium to sellers, a practice that cut into its earnings. Although Christie’s is a private company and does not report its earnings, it is known to have been doing the same.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','In fact, after Ms. Keaton acquired the negatives and started printing them, she says in the exhibition catalog, she found herself disappointed. Mr. Wood did not turn out to be an unknown genius like Mike Disfarmer, the Depression-era Arkansas commercial photographer who made extraordinarily intense studio portraits. A 1976 book on Mr. Disfarmer was partly what had inspired her to take a chance on this Fort Worth journeyman.“I didn’t know what to make of it,” Ms Keaton writes about the Wood archive. “Everything looked ordinary, maybe too ordinary, more like odd or funny, but not really funny, sort of flat.”Mr. Heiferman ventures that the interest of Mr. Wood’s photography is not in its aesthetic quality or personal vision but in what it represents: “a comprehensive and detailed cross section of midcentury, middle American, middle-class life.” But that doesn’t really explain what is so beguiling about the pictures.Mr. Heiferman gets closer to the truth when he observes how uncomfortable many of Mr. Wood’s subjects look. Two trumpet players in identical blazers and bow ties look so nervous you’d think they were posing for a police lineup. The image of a supervisor stiffly lecturing his attentive staff on custodial routines is like a still from a zombie movie. The smiling girl photographed outdoors wearing her dental retainer is poignant just because she is so awkwardly guarded. Intimacy was not Mr. Wood’s forte.What is captivating and often funny is the gap between what he evidently meant to do and what he did. It appears that he meant to create reassuring images for his customers, pictures that affirmed their identities, values and world. Today, however, it looks more as if he captured feelings of absurdity, unease, alienation and grief.An image of five old people watching television in a nursing home seems so sad you wonder why Mr. Wood made it. So does the weirdly desolate image of a man in a hat standing at the edge of a wide, sun-baked parking lot occupied by just five cars. A deserted children’s playground under a blank drive-in movie screen is an enigmatic dream.Some of Mr. Wood’s pictures could be mistaken for the work of more sophisticated artists. The laconic, sometimes deadpan modernism of Robert Adams and Bill Owens comes to mind. There is an impressive, formal austerity and psychological suggestiveness in Mr. Wood’s image of the dark corner windows of a gas station with folding chairs and an empty desk inside and cars on the street reflected in the glass.All of this raises questions about how Mr. Wood is represented by this exhibition. As Mr. Heiferman acknowledges in his essay, it is not clear which pictures he considered his best professional efforts. Many of the images that will interest sophisticated viewers might have been outtakes that he filed away and never used.Were he still alive, he might like the idea of viewing his work as a form of documentary history. But to value his photographs of grocery store displays or car showrooms as a kind of vernacular Pop Art would probably strike him as incomprehensible.Selecting just 210 out of 20,000 images and arranging them in two wall-covering grids as the curators have done might also be mystifying to Mr. Wood. The way they are displayed — printed the same paperback book size and in identical black frames — has the effect of absorbing the many disparate images into a single photographic essay on the American social landscape. It creates the illusion of a broadly integrative, authorial vision that Mr. Wood probably did not possess. (It is worth noting, too, that a second photographer, Reginald C. Phillips, worked for Mr. Wood from 1948 on, which means some of the pictures in the exhibition might not be Mr. Wood’s.)It might be argued that the exhibition is a work of contemporary art — a kind of big collage — created by Ms. Keaton and Mr. Heiferman out of raw material left by Mr. Wood.Ultimately, however, whether you attribute it to the curators, to a latent outsider genius in Mr. Wood, to the magical nature of photography or to all of the above, the exhibition conjures a haunting, dryly soulful visual poetry.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Five additional people, including former employees of Morgan Stanley and Janney Montgomery Scott, were indicted Thursday as part of a large federal investigation into the stock-loan industry.The latest indictments on securities fraud and other charges arise out of a continuing inquiry into bribery and kickbacks in the industry, where people called “stock loan finders” seek stock to cover short sales of shares.Investigators have found that some stock-loan traders steered millions of dollars of fraudulent finder fees to conspirators, often for no services, in exchange for outright bribes or payments to relatives.So far, 18 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the schemes, said a statement from the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn.Those indicted Thursday were Darin DeMizio, a former Morgan Stanley supervisor; Robert Johnson of Tyde Inc.; and Joseph Lando, a former manager of the stock-loan desk at Janney.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','The scope of the penalties could be worse but for an eight-year statute of limitations on doping violations in track and field. Pettigrew also helped the United States win world titles in 1997 and 1999 and was part of a world-record-setting relay team in 1998 — years when he said he took performance-enhancing drugs.Stephen A. Starks, legal affairs director for the United States Anti-Doping Agency, took notes throughout Pettigrew’s testimony. Travis T. Tygart, the agency’s chief executive, said in a telephone interview, “We can’t comment on the testimony, but we will pursue all potential doping violations based on the evidence, and we will continue to work with the federal investigators on this.”Pettigrew’s admission would be considered a “nonanalytical positive” and constitute a violation. Marion Jones, who likewise never failed a drug test, was stripped of five medals from the 2000 Olympics last October after she admitted to taking steroids from September 2000 to July 2001. The International Olympic Committee also stripped the medals of seven of Jones’s teammates in two relay races, but the runners are appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.Pettigrew’s Olympic relay teammates were Michael Johnson, Angelo Taylor, Jerome Young and the twins Alvin and Calvin Harrison.The Harrisons have been banned for doping offenses that were not committed in the Olympic year. Young previously lost his gold medal as an alternate in that race and was banned for life for two doping offenses, but his teammates were allowed to keep their medals after the Court of Arbitration for Sport found that Young had not doped during the Olympics and because he had not run in the final.Young also testified in the Graham trial Thursday. He said he doped from 1999 to 2003. He said Graham gave him drugs and showed him how to inject them.His testimony adds to the likelihood of the runners losing their medals — and to the shame being heaped on the United States track and field program by widespread doping violations on the eve of another Olympics.Pettigrew is an assistant track coach at the University of North Carolina. He is a former officer of USA Track & Field’s Athletes Advisory Committee and a former athlete representative to the U.S.O.C.He testified that he was not truthful with federal agents in February 2005, when he was interviewed as part of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative investigation. Asked why, Pettigrew said, “Things coming out in my past that I did and that I knew was wrong.” He said he told the truth to a grand jury in 2006.Graham, who also coached Jones, is charged with three felonies, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, for allegedly making false statements to federal investigators in 2004 about a drug supplier. The prosecution rested its case Thursday afternoon after five athletes testified against Graham.The defense lawyer, William P. Keane, said he may call only one witness when the trial resumes Tuesday.A verdict is possible soon after that.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','The vote was the second this month in which Labor has taken a severe pummeling. Three weeks ago, the job of London’s mayor was won by Boris Johnson, the Conservative candidate, by a 140,000-vote margin over the Labor incumbent, Ken Livingstone. In that campaign, too, the widespread unpopularity of Labor and of Mr. Brown appeared to have been a decisive factor, prompting a growing sense that Britain’s electorate is growing tired of Labor, which has ruled the country for the past 11 years. In local elections across other parts of Britain on the day of the London vote, Labor picked up only 24 percent of the total vote, against 45 percent for the Conservatives, and lost more than 300 council seats.A large part of Labor’s problem has been the accelerating economic slowdown in Britain after more than a decade of unparalleled prosperity. The credit crunch that began in the United States reached Britain in full force over the winter, leading to falling housing prices, rising inflation and widespread job losses, particularly in the financial sector. The rapid rise in oil prices has added to the gloom, with the price of a gallon of gasoline at British pumps now at more than $10 a gallon, about 70 percent of which goes to the government in taxes.Mr. Brown, 57, was bound to pay a political price for the economic problems, particularly since he served 10 years under Mr. Blair as chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain’s finance minister, and often boasted of his success in the years of prosperity, just as he has been saying lately that he is the man to guide Britain out of its current problems. But opinion polls have shown a sharp turn in the public mood against him personally, in ways that appear linked in part to the issue of personality and in part to a series of government blunders.Ironically, Mr. Blair, now traveling the world making handsomely compensated speeches, serving as a special Middle East envoy and earning millions as a consultant to banks and investment houses, continues to throw his own shadow over his successor. Although Britons tired of Mr. Blair over the Iraq war, effectively forcing his resignation after three successive election victories, he is remembered now as a debonair, intellectually agile figure who seemed in tune with a country in the process of rapid social and economic change.Mr. Brown, whose relentless efforts to push Mr. Blair into handing over the prime minister’s job have been richly chronicled in a recent spate of memoirs by Labor insiders, including one by Cherie Blair, the former prime minister’s wife, has cut a contrasting figure since taking over as head of the government last June. Earnest but dour, hard-working but humorless, always laden with statistics-laden chronicles of Labor achievements, he has seemed dull and cumbersome in comparison to Mr. Blair, in the view of many Britons.In the Crewe by-election, all this was compounded by widespread anger, especially among traditional Labor voters, over what has come to be seen as the worst of the government’s miscues, a decision by Mr. Brown, while still finance minister last year, to eliminate the 10 percent income tax bracket for Britain’s poorest-paid workers. As a cavalcade of Labor ministers returned to London from campaigning in Crewe this month with word of the disdain for Labor among its own past voters, Mr. Brown sought to limit the political damage by announcing a tax cut for 22 million taxpayers, amounting to $5.3 billion.But the move appeared to backfire in Crewe, with many voters describing it as a political bribe. Notably, Mr. Brown made no campaign appearances in Crewe, prompting David Cameron, 41, the Conservative leader, to accuse Mr. Brown of hunkering down in his Downing Street “bunker.”Labor’s loss in Crewe was also attributed, among some of the party’s own officials, to a badly mismanaged local campaign that seemed a throwback to the party’s reflexes before Mr. Blair led the reform movement that became known as New Labor. With advice from Mr. Brown’s political advisers, Ms. Dunwoody, the Labor candidate, accused Mr. Timpson, the Conservative, heir to Britain’s largest chain of shoe-repair and key-cutting shops, of being a “toff,” a British term for upper-class dandy. The intention was to make Mr. Timpson a surrogate for Mr. Cameron, the Eton- and Oxford-educated Conservative leader, who has been accused by Labor of being out of touch with ordinary Britons.If this seemed a far cry from Mr. Blair’s approach, which was characterized by his declaration after taking office in 1997 that “the class war is over,” it was enthusiastically supported by Labor’s old left-wing, unionist base. But the approach appeared to backfire, with the Conservatives depicting Ms. Dunwoody, whose grandmother was Labor’s general secretary, as Labor “aristocracy” and as a practitioner of “hereditary” politics, since she was seeking to win the parliamentary seat that had been held for 34 years by her mother, Gwyneth Dunwoody, whose death last month led to the by-election.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','Gasoline prices are nearing $4 a gallon in the United States, partly as a result of a 39 percent rise in the price of New York oil futures since the start of the year. Prices have more than quadrupled since 2003.On Capitol Hill on Thursday, a panel of oil company executives took a lashing from legislators for a second day, this time before the House Judiciary Committee, over their prices and profits. “You all are gouging the American public, and it needs to stop,” declared Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee.A series of unsettling reports have suggested world oil supplies may not be able to keep up with future demand, a situation that could potentially lead to even higher prices.On Wednesday, weaker-than-expected weekly inventory data in the United States stoked fresh worries over oil supplies in the world’s biggest economy ahead of the busy summer driving season, sending oil prices up $4.19 a barrel.Some investors reacted to a report on Thursday in The Wall Street Journal that the International Energy Agency, an Paris-based policy advisory group for industrialized countries, was concerned about a reduction in the long-term world supply of crude oil.But the agency’s chief economist said in an interview that the study’s results were still inconclusive. “We are going to revise our oil supply prospects,” said Fatih Birol, the economist. “We don’t know the results yet.”And several oil analysts dismissed the importance of the current anxieties affecting the market.“Concerns about future supply — that’s nothing new, it’s been there for four years,” said Antoine Halff, an analyst at Newedge.Some experts expressed frustration that investors were only focusing on alarmist reports about declining supplies in a few areas and failed to consider that higher prices would eventually tamper demand and attract new production from places like Brazil.“The market is reacting to the fact that we might not have enough oil in the market 13 years from now — excuse me?” said Edward Morse, the chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. “You never recognize it’s a bubble until the bubble is over.”The International Energy Agency warned about such a disconnect three years ago. At the time, it said that if investments didn’t keep pace with the growth in consumption, the world might face a shortfall of as much as 15 million barrels a day by 2030. Instead of growing to reach 116 million barrels a day, global supplies would struggle to increase to 100 million barrels a day by then, up from today’s average of 86 million barrels day.In recent years, a chorus of analysts and oil executives have raised concerns about possible shortfalls in supplies over the next years as new discoveries and production fail to keep up with rising demand. That, they warned, could lead to a supply crunch and spiking oil prices until demand eventually fell.Part of the reason is that costs in the industry have more than doubled in the last five years, oil-rich countries are tightening access rules for foreign investors, and many developing countries are subsidizing their fuel costs, and thereby fueling energy consumption. Global demand is expected to grow by about 1 million barrels a day in the next decade.“We are concerned about the supply prospects,” Mr. Birol said. “Investments is the main issue here. Each year we need $400 billion a year in the oil and gas sector. But because of cost inflation, in real terms, we are far from the investments needed.”Speaking in Chicago on Thursday, the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., told CNBC that concerns over oil supply are driving prices to record levels, rather than bets by oil traders.“This is not about blame; this is about supply and demand,” Mr. Paulson said in an interview. “Supply is tight and there’s concern that supply is going to have trouble keeping up with demand over the longer-term. All the research I’ve done is that speculators, short-term investors have had very little impact on this.”In recent months, the market’s confusion over the long-term supplies, as well as a decline the dollar, and rising commodity investments, have accelerated the rally in oil prices. Since October, oil futures have surged by $50 a barrel, jumping from $80 to more than $130 a barrel.The current market, Barclays Capital analysts said in a note to investors today, “is testing for a new equilibrium, seeking to work out what those supply and demand dynamics really look like.”Experts disagree on whether speculation is playing a significant role in the market.Samuel W. Bodman, the United States energy secretary, said at a House hearing on Thursday that the government would refuse to dip into its emergency oil reserves. He played down the impact of market speculation in the current price increase, attributing the high prices to factors of supply and demand.Michael Masters, a portfolio manager at Masters Capital Management, testified Tuesday to a Senate committee that the most common explanation given for rising oil prices is the increased demand for oil from China.But he cited data showing that the increase in demand from index speculators over the past five years is almost equal to the increase in demand from China.The earthquake in China has also been weighing on markets as well, Mr. Kilduff said. It has deepened the fears about global supply because the Chinese authorities are now diverting energy supplies for their own needs.“China has reacted by holding supplies off the international market,” he said. “We also saw them make a major purchase on the world market.”He said that the latest reports meant he would likely raise his forecast for the future oil price. “We are going to raise that,” he said. “Clearly now the medium term favors a price of above $140.”'"

"'08-05-23,'0','FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT, who died in 1959 at the age of 92, completed more than 500 buildings in his lifetime. Of the 400 or so that still stand, most are residences. At any given time, 8 or 10 of these homes may be up for sale, and they are highly sought after.“It’s a narrow market. It’s an active market. And it can be a lucrative market,” said Ron Scherubel, executive director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy, an international preservation organization based in Chicago. “Some of these houses can be seriously overpriced. But most of the time, buyers pay a 25 to 40 percent premium because it’s a Wright design.”A renewed interest in midcentury modern American architecture has widened the pool of interested buyers, particularly for the Usonian Wright houses, which he began designing in the late 1930s as affordable homes for the middle class. Where once Wright fixer-uppers may have been passed over, they now sell no matter what their condition.“Today’s buyer has both the means and the desire to restore a Wright house,” Mr. Scherubel said. “This is not the Home Depot set, either. When a door hinge is missing, they call us to find an artisan who can create a custom reproduction. When the roof needs tiling, they call to find someone who knows how the original work would have been done. I think it’s wonderful.”Wright’s signature design elements, like windows that meet the floor, built-in functional home furnishings that prevent clutter, open floor plans and an emphasis on nature and the environment, are desirable in today’s market, even to those who haven’t been his followers.“But nobody buys a Wright house by mistake or coincidence,” Mr. Scherubel said.Many Usonian houses are small and humble in presentation. Some are situated on acreage and some are sited in communities among other single-story homes. Even there, they are easy to identify. Though the other homes may sit neatly in a row, the Wright house may be at an angle. Each of his houses was designed to capture specific light and the best possible views — even if that meant disrupting the collective aesthetic.In Minnesota, two 1950s Wright houses recently went up for sale. Prices for these houses, as for any, are influenced by condition and location. History has an impact on the latter. Many of the Usonian houses that were built far from the city are now encircled by development. Where once were woods and fields may now be shopping malls.'"
"'08-05-23,'0','“I’m very pleased to see that they’re all governors,” said Saul Anuzis, chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. “There’s been a sense that it would be great to get someone outside of Washington and to get a governor in that second spot.”Mr. Romney in particular has emerged as a favorite among state party officials who met him during his failed campaign for the presidential nomination. Many said his fund-raising prowess, coupled with his high national profile and enthusiasm for long days of campaigning, would make him an attractive running mate.He could also help woo voters in Michigan, his native state, and in the swing state of New Hampshire, and even give Republicans a shot in solidly Democratic Massachusetts, where Senator Barack Obama lost the Democratic primary.“He’s a great campaigner,” said Robert A. Gleason Jr., the Pennsylvania Republican chairman. “I think he would be dynamite, especially with his background in business and economic affairs.”Doug McKinney, chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, said Mr. McCain needed “a pure conservative” who was strong on the economy.“He admittedly says that the economy is his weak point,” Mr. McKinney said, “so I think he needs to have somebody with a proven record on economics and how to manage a state.”Some party officials rejected the idea of a running mate from an existing Republican stronghold like South Carolina or Texas, challenging the wisdom of choosing someone who might not add electoral muscle. In contrast, Mr. Crist was cited frequently as a candidate who could help deliver Florida, the swing state where he presides as governor.“He’s a twofer,” said Mr. Gleason, noting that Mr. Crist was born in Altoona, Pa. “When he’s in Pennsylvania, we’ll promote him as a Pennsylvanian, and when he’s in Florida, he’ll be a Floridian.”Although the Republicans will face off against a historic Democratic nominee, having a minority member or a woman as Mr. McCain’s running mate is “not a priority,” said Tom Wilson, the New Jersey Republican chairman.“All those secondary qualities are nice,” Mr. Wilson said, “but they’re deep down the list, in my book.”Mr. Wilson suggested that if Mr. McCain did decide to choose a woman, he could turn to Carly Fiorina or Meg Whitman, former executives who are now advising the campaign.Others pointed to a prominent black Republican, Michael Steele, the chairman of Gopac, which tries to groom Republican candidates.“If we’re worried about race being a question, Michael Steele is a brilliant guy, and no one would question his conservative credentials,” said Mr. McKinney, of West Virginia.Christopher C. Healy, the party chairman in Connecticut, said he believed that the importance of the vice-presidential nominee was overstated.“It’s a great parlor game we all play,” Mr. Healy said. “You look back at the Dan Quayle pick, and everybody thought that would be ruinous. And Michael Dukakis won 10 states.”'"

The victims were contract employees working on a new coal-fired plant about 20 miles northwest of Kansas City, said Matt Tidwell, a spokesman for the utility. The crane tipped and crumpled around 7:30 a.m. Pieces of its boom were scattered, and a nearby portable toilet was smashed. The utility said the accident occurred as the crane was lowering its boom, which extended about 15 stories high, after workers had determined that wind speeds were too high for safe operation. The identities of the victims were not immediately released.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','But the 1,173 pages of medical records did provide some important details about his cancer in 2000: Two pathologists at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology who examined the melanoma specimen from Mr. McCain’s left temple in 2000 suggested that there were two melanomas on his temple, not one, as his doctors had said publicly at the time. Specifically, the Armed Forces Institute pathology report said that details about the lesion were “highly suggestive of a metastasis of malignant melanoma and may represent a satellite metastasis,” with satellite meaning one melanoma had spread to create another.The Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale said it “cannot comment” on another institution’s medical opinion, and stood by its diagnosis and treatment of Mr. McCain’s melanoma. Mr. McCain’s melanoma is classified as Stage IIA, his campaign has said.But two experts in the field who reviewed the pathology report released on Friday said it was unclear whether the melanoma on Mr. McCain’s temple had metastasized from another, or whether there was one new primary melanoma.If the spread was through the nearby melanoma, that could suggest a greater risk, said Dr. Lynn M. Schuchter, a melanoma expert at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Mohammed Kashani-Sabet, director of the Melanoma Center at the University of California, San Francisco.Mr. McCain, who would be the oldest president to take office if he wins election in November, chose to release his most recent medical records on the Friday before Memorial Day weekend in what his campaign advisers said was an effort to play down reporting about his cancer surgery. Despite Mr. McCain’s favorable report, the advisers have said they do not consider articles about his melanoma as politically helpful and are hopeful that they will attract less notice over the long holiday.The 45-minute conference call with Mr. McCain’s doctors occurred after a tightly controlled pool of about 20 reporters was shown into a conference room at the CopperWynd Resort near the Mayo Clinic. The reporters were permitted three hours to review and take notes on the 1,173 pages of Mr. McCain’s medical documents, spanning 2000 to 2008, but they were not permitted to remove the documents from the room or photocopy them.Campaign officials said they imposed the restrictions to prevent the widespread dissemination of the actual records and to protect Mr. McCain’s privacy.Since 2007, Mr. McCain had repeatedly promised to make public his most recent medical records. Mr. McCain told reporters last week and his doctors repeated on Friday that the holdup was because of the difficulty gathering the physicians and campaign officials together after Mr. McCain’s most recent doctor’s visit, which was to see his dermatologist, Dr. Suzanne Connolly, on May 12.In the call, Dr. Eckstein said there was no evidence of short-term memory loss in Mr. McCain either in his history or his examination, but Dr. Eckstein did not say if he had performed tests of Mr. McCain’s mental status.The issue of mental competence has been an especially sensitive one since the end of the Reagan presidency. Former President Ronald Reagan at times forgot and confused names of people. After he left the White House, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.In the conference calls, Mr. McCain’s doctors reported that Mr. McCain takes a variety of medications: simvastatin to control his cholesterol levels; hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone prevention; aspirin for blood clot prevention; Zyrtec, an antihistamine, as necessary for nasal allergies; Ambien CR, as necessary for sleep when traveling; and a multiple vitamin tablet.According to a pool report based on the review of the records, Mr. McCain’s cholesterol level was recorded as high in 2003, with a total cholesterol of 226 and an LDL, or harmful cholesterol, of 139, and an HDL, or good cholesterol, of 35. Mr. McCain was put on Vytorin, which worked in reducing his cholesterol in subsequent checks, but he was taken off this year after reports that the drug may not work.Mr. McCain was instead put on simvastatin, which the records said did not reduce his cholesterol by as much but was deemed “acceptable.”In addition, Dr. Eckstein reported that Mr. McCain had “significantly reduced range of motion” in his shoulders, arms and right knee from injuries sustained as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Dr. Eckstein has said Mr. McCain might need a joint replacement in the future.Mr. McCain’s doctors elaborated only slightly in the conference call on previously released details about the senator’s cancer surgery. Dr. Michael L. Hinni, Mr. McCain’s surgeon, said that a circular wound on the left side of Mr. McCain’s face from the surgery was six centimeters by six centimeters, a size not previously disclosed.Dr. Hinni said in the conference call, as he has in the past, that “the large incision was necessary to safely remove all cancer with an appropriate margin, resulting in a wound requiring sizeable reconstruction.” He restated that the large incision was made so that a flap of skin and soft tissue “consistent with the color and texture” of Mr. McCain’s facial skin could be rotated into the wound.Dr. Hinni also said he wanted to answer questions about the prominence of the senator’s left jaw, which has appeared puffy since the 2000 surgery. “This is a result of an absence of soft tissue on the face in front of his ear that makes the masseter, or the chewing muscle, over the jaw appear more prominent,” he said. “To be clear, the swelling is not due to any evidence of cancer.”Dr. Hinni said that during the reconstructive surgery to close the wound, 33 lymph nodes were removed, a relatively large number, because they were already exposed and Dr. Hinni felt it a “prudent” course.Because doctors generally do not recommend extensive neck node dissection for Stage IIA, a number of melanoma experts have said they suspected that Mr. McCain’s melanoma was Stage III, which carries a bleaker prognosis.Although he has shown no sign of recurrence, melanomas can be quirky, and experts say no melanoma survivor is 100 percent clear of danger. For Stage IIA melanoma, the survival rate 10 years after diagnosis is about 65 percent. But the outlook is much better, as Mr. McCain’s doctors noted, for patients who have already survived more than seven years.Dr. Connolly told reporters that there was “no crystal ball to predict with certainty” if Mr. McCain’s cancer would return, but she put the chance at less than 10 percent at this stage in his life.The doctors also reported that Mr. McCain has occasional momentary episodes of dizziness when he stands up too quickly. They diagnosed the symptoms after testing as a common condition, “benign positional vertigo,” and said it was not a precursor for a stroke.In addition, the doctors said Mr. McCain had his most recent colonoscopy in April, when six benign polyps were removed.In 1999, Mr. McCain released about 1,500 pages of his medical and psychiatric records, which were amassed as part of a Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war.In those records, doctors said Mr. McCain’s mental status and psychological tests were normal. A psychiatric evaluation in 1974 described him as ambitious, competitive and energetic.As a prisoner of war, Mr. McCain told doctors, he had tried to commit suicide twice. But by 1977, he said he had “all but forgotten the traumas of captivity.”'"
"'08-05-24,'0','Technology companies keep insisting they will provide new low-cost ways to get video into the home, but so far their efforts have created more black boxes to stash under the TV, not real competition for cable that could bring prices down.“A couple of years ago, there was a thesis that we were at the twilight of Comcast as the gatekeeper,” said Craig Moffett, a cable industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “That thesis still titillates some. But technologically and economically, it’s probably not going to happen.”So why hasn’t technology had a bigger impact? One answer is the alliance between cable companies and Hollywood producers of content to sell channels in bundles, rather than letting consumers pay only for the channels they want.The producers of cable television content share $15 billion to $20 billion a year in fees from cable subscribers, roughly equal to the $20 billion they receive in advertising revenue, Mr. Moffett said.Without those fees, the cable companies say, prices would go up.“If each channel depended on individual consumers electing to pay individually for it, this would slash potential viewership and seriously hurt the ability of most channels to attract their current level of advertising dollars,” said Jenni Moyer, a spokeswoman for Comcast. “Lost ad revenue would have to be replaced by higher license fees.”The industry says the digital era has brought its customers better image quality, more on-demand services and solid value through packages that combine cable, phone and Internet service. It also says consumers are actually getting more viewing value for their dollar, at least relative to inflation. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association says that from 1998 to 2006, the price consumers paid for each viewing hour was essentially flat.The chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission, Gregory S. Crawford, disagrees, saying the industry is not factoring in the real cost of the programming that subscribers are watching. By his analysis, the increase has been around 50 percent from 1997 to 2005.The F.C.C. and some politicians have been in a pitched battled with the cable industry, trying to get it voluntarily to offer so-called à la carte pricing. But cable companies insist that this is not economically feasible.Kevin J. Martin, chairman of the F.C.C., said in an interview that since 1996, when Congress increased competition in telecommunications, prices have dropped for many other services.“We’ve seen the opposite occur in the cable industry,” he said. “The dramatic increases in pricing we’ve seen are one of the most troubling issues from a consumer point of view.”In 2007, average monthly revenue for each Cablevision subscriber was $75, up from $65 in 2005, according to SNL Kagan, a research company. At Time Warner it was $64, up from $54.50.The cable industry has never felt the pricing pressures the music industry is feeling. The most obvious reason is that Internet speeds have not been fast enough to permit easy downloading of movies and other video material.That is changing, though. People are viewing millions of videos online each month — albeit mostly short video clips, and not Hollywood movies. At the same time, the use of file-sharing tools like BitTorrent to download illegally popular movies and television shows is growing.Another factor helping the cable industry is the difficulty of getting video from the computer onto the TV. That may not be a deterrent for those who have grown accustomed to watching movies on their laptop. But the last thing many consumers want to do is hook up wires or program a new box before sitting back to relax and watch TV.In that sense, the lure of cable appears to have a sociological component. In a stress-filled life, cable television is easy to use.“I work eight hours a day facing a computer. When I come home, the last thing I want to do is mess with another computer,” said Eric Yu, 24, a college student in San Francisco who pays around $80 a month for cable.Mr. Yu said he watches only a handful of channels, including some in high definition like National Geographic. But to get them, he has to pay for a premium package. “I just pay the bill and try to forget about it,” he said. “It lessens the pain.”Evelyn Tan, 22, a friend of Mr. Yu, takes a different approach. She pays Comcast $33 a month for Internet access and does not get cable television — but she does watch TV programming.In fact, she watches ABC shows like “Desperate Housewives” and “Gray’s Anatomy,” which are free on the Web. When she wants to watch shows or movies that are not readily available online, she says she easily pirates them. “I would not pay for cable TV at all,” she said.Broadcast networks like ABC, NBC and Fox are starting to put their programming on the Internet. But most cable channels do not because they depend on subscriber revenue.Albert Cheng, executive vice president for digital media at the Disney-ABC Television Group, said the industry was trying to prepare for an era in which more video is watched on computers.“It wasn’t lost on us what happened to the music industry,” Mr. Cheng said. Even though the audience is growing for ABC shows online, he said, this is supplementing, rather than undercutting, the television audience.Enter Silicon Valley. It is trying to marry the content people want with their preferred setting for viewing it. There is a host of new set-top boxes and consumer devices aimed at bringing video and other content from the Internet to the TV.Apple’s iTunes store offers 20,000 episodes of some 800 shows at typically $1.99 or $2.99 an episode, effectively creating an à la carte option. But consumers must either watch on their computers, wire the computer to the television or get an Apple TV.This week Roku, a Silicon Valley start-up, began selling a $99 box that streams movies from Netflix straight to the TV. And this summer Hewlett-Packard is expected to introduce a device called the MediaSmart Connect, a sleek box connecting computer and TV that lets users watch Internet videos as well as rent or buy some 6,000 movies through CinemaNow, an H.P. partner.But the box will also demonstrate how much of a gap still separates the computer screen and the TV screen.Carlos Montalvo, vice president for marketing of connected entertainment at H.P., said the MediaSmart Connect and similar devices would not offer much of the programming provided over cable, or even programming that content companies allow to be delivered over the Internet to computers. The reason, he said, is that this content is licensed to be shown only on a computer, not delivered via computer to a TV.“Simply because the technology is there doesn’t mean that the large opus of content — both television and movies — that is available on the two-foot screen can move automatically to the large-screen TV,” he said.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','It took a long time for him to do it, but Senator John McCain has finally rejected the endorsements of two evangelical ministers — one whose bizarre and hate-filled sermons deeply offended both Catholics and Jews and the other who has used his pulpit to attack Muslims.Mr. McCain had it right in his unsuccessful primary campaign eight years ago when he denounced the Christian right’s Pat Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell as “agents of intolerance” who exercised an “evil influence” over the Republican Party. It was particularly disturbing to see him cynically pander this year for the support of that same Christian right.His belated decision to distance himself from two of the most extreme ministers was long overdue — and we suspect driven more by political ambition than by the principles he espoused in the past.Mr. McCain had sought the endorsement of the Rev. John Hagee, a televangelist, for more than a year and finally won it in February, only to have the Catholic League denounce Mr. Hagee for waging “an unrelenting war against the Catholic Church.” Mr. Hagee called it “the Great Whore,” an “apostate church,” and a “false cult system.” The pastor apologized and said his remarks had been misconstrued, a truce was declared and Mr. McCain still welcomed the endorsement.Then a recorded sermon emerged in which Mr. Hagee suggested that Hitler and the Holocaust had been part of God’s plan to drive the Jews from Europe into Palestine — a final straw that led Mr. McCain to reject the Hagee endorsement. He also rejected the backing of the Rev. Rod Parsley whose anti-Muslim sermons have argued that America was founded, in part, to see “this false religion destroyed.”Mr. McCain has tried to argue that his recent embrace of these two extremists was different from Barack Obama’s 20-year pastoral relationship with the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. The Rev. Wright’s bigoted and paranoid rants are appalling, but that does not lessen the hatefulness of the views espoused by the Rev. Hagee or the Rev. Parsley, nor does political expediency excuse Mr. McCain’s willingness to overlook those views until they became a political liability.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','Siegmund Nissel, the second violinist of the Amadeus Quartet, an internationally renowned ensemble that had its roots in the internment camps of wartime Britain, died on Wednesday at his home in London. He was 86.Mr. Nissel died after having been ill for some time, his wife, Muriel, said.The Amadeus, one of the most highly regarded string quartets of the 20th century, performed widely and made about 200 recordings. It was also known for its longevity, performing for 40 years without a single personnel change. For a quartet, subject to the strains that a marriage of four strong, temperamental people inevitably entails, that was an almost unheard-of feat.As the Amadeus Quartet, the ensemble made its debut in London in 1948. (Mr. Nissel gave the group its name; it had begun in 1947 as the Brainin Quartet, after its first violinist, Norbert Brainin.) When the quartet played its last concert in 1987, it had been together longer than its namesake, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-91), had lived.The Amadeus was known in particular for mainstream Classical and Romantic repertory from Austria and Germany: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert. The group ventured into 20th-century waters only occasionally, notably with Benjamin Britten’s Third String Quartet, written in 1975 and given its premiere by the Amadeus the next year.Siegmund Nissel was born in Munich on Jan. 3, 1922, to Jewish parents from Vienna. Siegmund, known as Sigi, began playing the violin at 6; at 9, after his mother’s death, he moved back to Vienna with his father. In 1938, after the Nazis annexed Austria, Siegmund, then 16, was evacuated to Britain. His father joined him there in 1939, shortly before war was declared.In 1940 Siegmund Nissel, now considered an enemy alien, was interned on the Isle of Man. In the internment camp he met Peter Schidlof, the quartet’s future violist. Mr. Schidlof had previously been interned in a camp in Shropshire, where he had met Mr. Brainin.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','Senator John McCain’s wife, Cindy, abruptly reversed course on Friday and released a summary of her 2006 income tax return after weeks of vowing not to do so. The form revealed that she took in more than $6 million in taxable income that year.The release of just the two-page 1040 return from 2006 — the campaign said she filed for an extension on her 2007 return — came without warning, and on the same day reporters were focused on poring over Mr. McCain’s medical records.By far the largest part of Mrs. McCain’s income, $4,551,901, was listed under a category that included rental real estate, royalties, partnerships and trusts, almost certainly coming from her stake in Hensley & Company, one of the country’s largest beer distributorships for Anheuser-Busch, founded by Mrs. McCain’s father and her uncle. She also listed $299,418 in salary and $743,476 in capital gains.She claimed $569,737 in deductions and paid $1,746,445 in taxes, including the $24,162 she paid for household employees.Hensley & Company, of which Mrs. McCain is the chairwoman, is valued at more than $100 million by published estimates.By way of comparison, during the 2004 presidential election, Senator John Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, reported just more than $5 million in income in 2003. Her late husband, Senator John Heinz, was the heir to the H. J. Heinz Company fortune.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','It certainly looks as if it will be a three-way tussle for the title in Paris.“I’m coming to this year’s French Open as a much more mature player,” Djokovic said. “And considering that fact, I believe much more in myself and that I can win against Rafa on clay, or Roger on any surface, or any other player who is at the top.”Djokovic also addressed the report on professional tennis’s integrity, which was released Monday by the sport’s governing bodies. The review, begun after concerns about possible match fixing, was prepared by Ben Gunn and Jeff Rees, former British police officers. The conclusions were that 45 matches played in the last five years warranted further investigation because of potentially suspect betting patterns. The report also said there were “emerging concerns about some players.”“I don’t want this to go further in our sport, because this is the worst possible picture that we are sending to the world about our sport,” said Djokovic, who said he had not read the review.None of the 45 matches or players have been identified publicly. Tennis is creating an integrity unit to investigate and combat potential corruption, another of the review’s recommendations.“You have to go slowly, because whatever you do, it’s in the center of media attention,” Djokovic said of the response. “You know everything cannot be done right away. It takes time.”Djokovic has not beaten Nadal on clay, but their semifinal in Hamburg last week was brimming with intensity and quality. If Nadal had not won in three sets, he, not Djokovic, would have been ranked and seeded third at Roland Garros. Instead, Nadal clung to No. 2 behind Federer, which is where he has been for three seasons.Top-seeded Federer still has company in the top half of the draw, and will face the unseeded Sam Querrey of the United States in the first round. Though Querrey, 20, will be a big underdog and has lost his only previous match to Federer, he did reach the quarterfinals in Monte Carlo this year on clay. “He’s playing better and better,” Federer said.It has been a challenging year by Federer’s high standards. He has won one tournament: on clay in Estoril, Portugal. But he says that he feels he has recovered from the mononucleosis that slowed him early in the season and that he is happy with his form under his new coach, José Higueras.“I wish I could have won maybe a tournament here and there a little bit more,” he said. “But if I keep on winning the next few, I don’t really care what happened in the past. But I’m happy with the season so far. You might think it’s average. I don’t. I think it’s better than average.”The only blip on Nadal’s clay-court screen this season was a surprise loss to fellow Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero in Nadal’s opening match in Rome. But that defeat could be explained by the discomfort caused by foot blisters and the accumulated fatigue of winning in consecutive weeks in Monte Carlo and Barcelona.On the women’s side, Serena Williams comes to Roland Garros with her most complete preparation and best opportunity in several years. Williams won the 2002 French Open but was eclipsed on clay by Justine Henin, who won four of the last five titles here.Henin, however, rocked the sport by retiring last week. “It’s definitely the right time to win, obviously,” said Williams, who is seeded fifth and will face another American, Ashley Harkleroad, in the first round. “It’s probably the best preparation I’ve had since 2002. I feel like I’ve played so many clay-court tournaments. I just really am feeling like a real clay-court player.”Williams, who withdrew from the Rome tournament last week with a back injury, said she felt “a lot better.” She will need to be healthy because she appears to be in the tougher half of the draw. It includes her sister Venus, the Serbian stars Jelena Jankovic and Ana Ivanovic and the promising French 18-year-old Alize Cornet.Maria Sharapova, back at No. 1 after Henin’s retirement, casts a longer shadow over the top half. But she, too, had to withdraw from the Rome event, citing a calf injury. Clay remains her least favorite surface, and the French Open is the only one of the four Grand Slam titles that she has not won.'"

"'08-05-24,'0','WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain released his medical records on Friday under tightly controlled circumstances, allowing them to be reviewed by a small group of reporters from news organizations that his campaign chose.From 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Pacific time, about 20 reporters were permitted to view more than 1,000 pages of records in a room at a resort near the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale in Arizona. The reporters had three hours to review and take notes on the documents, from 2000 to 2008. They were not permitted to remove the documents from the room or photocopy them.At 11 a.m., Mr. McCain’s doctors made themselves available in what was scheduled as a 90-minute conference call. But the questions were stopped after 45 minutes.The media organizations in the pool included ABC News, The Arizona Republic, Bloomberg, CBS News, CNN, Fox News, NBC News, Reuters and The Washington Post. Before the viewing, the campaign provided a look to The Associated Press.The campaign did not include The New York Times in the pool, declined a request by The Times to review Mr. McCain’s 2000 to 2008 medical records after the viewing and did not call on The Times in the conference call. Throughout the primary season, the campaign declined requests by The Times to interview Mr. McCain or his doctors about his medical history.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','Both Microsoft and Google have been scanning older books that have fallen into the public domain, as well as copyright-protected books under agreements with some publishers. Google also scans copyrighted works without permission so it can show short excerpts to searchers, an approach that has drawn fire from publishers.Microsoft’s decision also leaves the Internet Archive, the nonprofit digital archive that was paid by Microsoft to scan books, looking for new sources of support. Several major libraries said that they had chosen to work with the Internet Archive rather than with Google, because of restrictions Google placed on the use of the new digital files.“We’re disappointed,” said Brewster Kahle, chairman of the Internet Archive. Mr. Kahle said, however, that his organization recognized that the project, which has been scanning about 1,000 books each day, would not receive corporate support indefinitely. Mr. Kahle said that Microsoft was reducing its support slowly and that the Internet Archive had enough money to keep the project “going for a while.”“Eventually funding will come from the public sphere,” Mr. Kahle said.Some libraries that work with the Internet Archive and Microsoft also said they planned to continue their book-scanning projects.“We certainly expect to go on with this,” said Carole Moore, chief librarian at the University of Toronto. “Corporate sponsors are interested in whatever works for their commercial interests and their shareholders. Long-term preservation is not something you can look to the commercial sector to provide. It is what research libraries have always done.”Microsoft acknowledged on its blog that commercial considerations played a part in its decision to end the program.“Given the evolution of the Web and our strategy, we believe the next generation of search is about the development of an underlying, sustainable business model for the search engine, consumer and content partner,” Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s senior vice president for search, portal and advertising, wrote on the blog.Microsoft said it had digitized 750,000 books and indexed 80 million journal articles.Google, which works with libraries like the New York Public Library and those at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Michigan and Oxford, said it had scanned more than a million books. It plans to scan 15 million in the next decade. Google makes the books it scans freely available through its search engine but does not allow other search engines to use its database.“We are extremely committed to Google Book Search, Google Scholar and other initiatives to bring more content online,” said Adam Smith, product management director at Google.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','PARIS — Weak management and insufficient internal risk controls at Société Générale made it possible for a 31-year-old trader to cause nearly 5 billion euros in losses at the French bank, a report from an internal investigation has concluded.The report, released Friday, also said that the trader, Jérôme Kerviel, might have had an accomplice.A panel of independent directors reported that two of the trader’s direct bosses had proved “deficient” by failing to detect, despite many red flags, that Mr. Kerviel had traded beyond his authority for more than two years and exposed the bank to 50 billion euros, or $78.9 billion, worth of risk.“The fraud was facilitated, or its detection delayed, by weaknesses in the supervision of the trader and in the controls over market activities,” the panel said, citing evidence from the audit.“The direct supervisor lacked trading experience and was not given a sufficient degree of support in his new role,” it said. “He demonstrated an inappropriate degree of tolerance in relation to the taking of intraday directional positions and neither he, nor his own supervisor, carried out an adequate review of the trader’s activities on the basis of the available figures and reports or reacted to the alerts that would have allowed them to identify the concealed positions.”'"
"'08-05-24,'0','The 45-minute conference call with Mr. McCain’s doctors occurred after a tightly controlled pool of about 20 reporters was shown into a conference room at the CopperWynd Resort near the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale. The reporters were permitted three hours to review and take notes on 1,173 pages of Mr. McCain’s medical documents, spanning 2000 to 2008, but they were not permitted to remove the documents from the room or photocopy them.Campaign officials said they imposed the restrictions to prevent the widespread dissemination of the actual records and to protect Mr. McCain’s privacy.Since 2007, Mr. McCain had repeatedly promised to make public his most recent medical records, but he had delayed doing so for more than a year, raising the question of why, if he was in as excellent health as he maintained. Mr. McCain told reporters last week and his doctors repeated on Friday that the hold-up was because of the difficulty gathering the physicians and campaign officials together at one time after Mr. McCain’s most recent doctor’s visit, which was to see his dermatologist, Dr. Suzanne Connolly, on May 12.In the conference calls, Mr. McCain’s doctors reported that Mr. McCain takes a variety of medications: simvastatin to control his cholesterol levels; hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stone prevention; aspirin for blood clot prevention; Zyrtec, an antihistamine, as necessary for nasal allergies; Ambien CR, as necessary for sleep when traveling;” and a multiple vitamin tablet.According to a pool report based on the review of the records, Mr. McCain’s cholesterol level was recorded as high in 2003, with a total cholesterol of 226 and an LDL, or harmful cholesterol, of 139, and an HDL, or good cholesterol, of 35. Mr. McCain was put on Vytorin, a medication which worked in reducing his cholesterol in subsequent checks, but he was taken off earlier this year in the wake of reports that the drug may not work and might even speed up the growth of fatty plaques in the arteries.Mr. McCain was instead put on simvastatin, which the records said did not reduce his cholesterol by as much but was deemed “acceptable.”In the conference call, Dr. Eckstein said there was no evidence of short-term memory loss in Mr. McCain either in his history or his examination, but Dr. Eckstein did not say if he had performed any tests of Mr. McCain’s mental status.In addition, Dr. Eckstein reported that Mr. McCain has “significantly reduced range of motion” in his shoulders, arms and right knee from injuries sustained as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. Dr. Eckstein has said that Mr. McCain might need a joint replacement in the future.Dr. McCain’s doctors elaborated only slightly in the conference call on previously released details about the senator’s cancer surgery. Dr. Michael L. Hinni, Mr. McCain’s surgeon, said that a roughly circular wound on the left side of Mr. McCain’s face from the surgery was six centimeters by six centimeters, a size not previously disclosed.Dr. Hinni said in the conference call, as he has in the past, that “the large incision was necessary to safely remove all cancer with an appropriate margin, resulting in a wound requiring sizeable reconstruction.” He reiterated that the large incision was made so that a flap of skin and soft tissue “consistent with the color and texture” of Mr. McCain’s facial skin could be rotated into the wound.Dr. Hinni also said that he wanted to answer numerous questions about the prominence of the senator’s left jaw, which has appeared puffy since the 2000 surgery. “This is a result of an absence of soft tissue on the face in front of his ear that makes the masseter (the chewing muscle) over the jaw appear more prominent,” Dr. Hinni said. “To be clear, the swelling is not due to any evidence of cancer.”Under questioning from a reporter, Dr. Hinni said that during the reconstructive surgery to close the wound, 33 lymph nodes were removed, a relatively large number, because the nodes were already exposed and Dr. Hinni felt it a “prudent” course.Mr. McCain has had four melanomas removed in the last 15 years one on his left shoulder in 1993, one each on his temple and upper left arm in 2000 and one on his nose in 2002. The most dangerous was the one removed from his temple in 2000, classified by his doctors as an invasive melanoma (Stage IIA) on a standard scale that makes stage IV the most serious.The 2000 surgery left Mr. McCain not only with the puffy jaw but also a scar down his neck, still noticeable today. Because doctors generally do not recommend extensive neck node dissection for stage IIA, a number of melanoma experts have said they suspected that Mr. McCain’s melanoma was stage III, which carries a bleaker prognosis.Although he has shown no sign of a recurrence, melanomas can be quirky, and experts say no melanoma survivor is 100 percent clear of danger. For stage IIA melanoma, the survival rate 10 years after diagnosis is about 65 percent. But the outlook is much better, as Mr. McCain’s doctors noted, for patients who have already survived more than seven years.Dr. Connolly told reporters that there was “no crystal ball to predict with certainty” if Mr. McCain’s cancer would return, but she put the chance at less than 10 percent at this stage in his life.The doctors reported that Mr. McCain sees Dr. Connolly for a check-up every three months, and that he had last seen her on May 12.The doctors also reported that Mr. McCain has occasional momentary episodes of dizziness when he stands up too quickly. They diagnosed the symptoms after testing as a common condition, “benign positional vertigo,” and said it was not a precursor for a stroke.In addition, the doctors said that Mr. McCain had his most recent colonscopy in April, when six benign polyps were removed.The statement by Mr. McCain’s doctors followed by three days the disclosure that Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has brain cancer. Mr. Kennedy, 76, is a good friend of Mr. McCain’s and had been in apparent good health until now.In 1999, Mr. McCain released about 1,500 pages of his medical and psychiatric records exclusively to The Associated Press early in the presidential campaign. Later, The New York Times and The Arizona Republic were allowed to examine the records, which were amassed as part of a United States Navy project to gauge the health of former prisoners of war.The records provided the broadest look ever given the public about the psychological profile of a presidential candidate.In those records, doctors said Mr. McCain’s mental status and psychological tests were normal and judged that he had adjusted to repatriation “exceptionally well.” A psychiatric evaluation in 1974 described him as ambitious, competitive and energetic. He was not diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.As a prisoner of war, Mr. McCain told doctors, he had tried to commit suicide twice to avoid breaking under torture. He said he never lost a sense of reality during captivity but that frightening memories of his captivity have come back at times.By 1977, he said he had “all but forgotten the traumas of captivity.”Doctors said that Mr. McCain “would probably not seek psychiatric aid” and “would probably seek aid first, if needed, from various friends and acquaintances.”'"
"'08-05-24,'0','As the Memorial Day holiday starts the summer driving season, record prices are provoking dread and upsetting vacation plans. A recent survey by AAA, the automobile club, found a rare year-on-year decline, of 1 percent, in the number of people planning to travel this summer.Interviews with more than 70 people across the country suggested that the adjustments they were making, mental and otherwise, would last well beyond the summer. Americans have started trading their gas guzzlers for smaller cars, making fewer trips to the mall and, wherever possible, riding public transportation to work.For years, it was not clear whether rising prices would ever cause Americans to use less gas. But a combination of record prices, the slowing economy and a tight credit market has beaten consumers down.Gasoline demand has fallen sharply since the beginning of the year and is headed for the first annual drop in 17 years, according to government estimates.The Transportation Department reported Friday that in March, Americans drove 11 billion fewer miles than in March 2007, a decline of 4.3 percent. It is the first time since 1979 that traffic has dropped from one March to the next, and the month-on-month percentage decline is the largest since record keeping began in 1942.High gasoline prices, plastered on 20-foot signs from coast to coast, are turning into a barometer of the country’s mood.“The psychology has changed,” said Sara Johnson, an economist at Global Insight. “People have recognized that prices are not going down and are adapting to higher energy costs. It’s a capitulation.”Typically, gasoline sales rise before Memorial Day weekend. But gasoline sales dropped nearly 7 percent last week compared with the same week in 2007, according to an estimate by MasterCard.Gasoline prices almost always rise in the summer, as demand increases. On Friday, gasoline prices reached yet another record, a nationwide average of nearly $3.88 a gallon. That figure was up 4 cents in one day and is 65 cents higher than this time last year, according to AAA. Diesel hit $4.65 a gallon on Friday, up $1.73 a gallon in a year.The force behind high gasoline prices is the high price of oil, which is being driven up by soaring worldwide demand. Oil reached a record above $133 a barrel this week, nearly five times as expensive as it was five years ago.All this has led to a vast transfer of wealth from American drivers to domestic and foreign oil producers. Every one-cent increase in gasoline prices means Americans pay $1.42 billion more a year for gas, according to Stephen P. Brown, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Nearly two-thirds of that goes to foreign producers.In the first four months of the year, Americans spent $158 billion on gasoline. In 2003, just as oil prices started to take off, they spent $88 billion over the same four-month period, according to Michael McNamara, vice president for MasterCard’s Spending Pulse, an indicator of weekly gasoline sales.Whether today’s high costs will translate into a permanent change in behavior remains to be seen, of course. The Energy Department expects gasoline sales to fall by 0.6 percent this year, the first drop since 1991, but it expects consumption to rebound in 2009 as the economy strengthens.Still, analysts said that the hardship induced by today’s prices is getting close to the level reached during the oil shock of the early 1980s.Americans spend 3.7 percent of their disposable income on transportation fuels. At its lowest point, that share was 1.9 percent in 1998, and at its highest, it reached 4.5 percent in 1981, said Ms. Johnson of Global Insight.Still, despite the rise in energy prices, gasoline remains cheaper in the United States than in most industrialized countries. In France, for example, a gallon of gasoline costs about $7.70 at today’s exchange rates. Also, Americans pay less to drive a mile today than they did in 1980, once the impact of inflation and gains in fuel efficiency are taken into account, said Lee Schipper, a visiting scholar at the transportation center of the University of California, Berkeley.Mr. Schipper estimates that the cost of gasoline for each mile traveled will be about 15 cents this year. That is nearly three times the low of 5.6 cents a mile reached in 1998, when fuel efficiency peaked and prices were at their lowest. But it is still cheaper than the record paid in 1980 of 17.1 cents a mile, adjusted for inflation.The oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s introduced the nation’s first efforts to curb consumption, including the first fuel efficiency standards and scaled-back speed limits. These had an impact on gasoline demand, which fell each year from 1979 to 1985. But then oil prices collapsed, political pressure evaporated, and many consumers lost interest in small cars.“This is the wake-up call,” Mr. Schipper said. “We actually have a lot of choices, based on what car we drive, where we live, how much time we choose to drive, and where we choose to go. But you have built in a very strong car dependency. And when the price hits the fan, people have a hard time coping.”For many people, higher energy costs mean fewer restaurant meals, deferred weekend outings with the family, less air travel and more time closer to home. Big-box retailers are suffering as customers balk at driving to the mall, airlines have slapped on steep fuel surcharges and carmakers have seen their sales slump. On Thursday, the Ford Motor Company announced production cuts because of sharply lower demand for sport utility vehicles and pickups.In Los Angeles, Ron and Patricia Lowe spend more time at home on weekends, hanging out and barbecuing. They are also more likely to leave their house together now, scheduling fewer car trips and bundling their chores to cut the gas bill.“If I go to the grocery store, and the mall and pick up some prescription, I do it in one shot,” he said.As gasoline prices have risen to record highs, consumer confidence, as measured in surveys, has fallen to its lowest level since 1980.“The whole gas price situation makes me so angry,” says Lissa Nash, 39, a single mother struggling to raise her two sons on a modest nursing assistant’s salary. To make ends meet, she has started working extra shifts at a suburban Chicago hospital, picking up whatever overtime is available.“Rising gas prices end up hurting working, lower class people like me, who can’t afford it anymore,” Ms. Nash said.The higher costs ripple through the economy in unusual ways. In Round Lake, Ill. $3 still buys a wriggling tangle of night crawlers in a dirt-filled Styrofoam cup. But Marty Badegian, the 72-year-old owner of the Red Worm Ranch Bait Shop, says he might have to raise prices after his vendor imposed a $5-an-order gas surcharge.In Encinitas, Calif., Ryan Andrews, 23, and Tara Driscoll, 21, arrived at the beach red-faced and sweating from riding their bicycles in 80-degree weather.They had bought their bikes the previous week and had just cycled six miles from home. Ms. Driscoll said she had gotten the bicycle so she could ride to work every day, a commute of two miles, instead of driving.“It just makes sense,” she said.At Sim’s Bowling Alley and Lounge, in Des Plaines, Ill., Robin Sebastian, 51, who tends bar there, sounded bitter the other day after recalling that she had just paid $46 to fill half a tank in her 1994 Buick Regal.“There are too many politicians’ hands in our pockets, and too many crooks in the oil companies,” said Ms. Sebastian, an Army veteran who served in the Persian Gulf. “I’m all for helping other countries, but we need to help our people here in the U.S. first.”'"
"'08-05-24,'0','His visit here is the first by a state leader since the May 12 earthquake that has resulted in the deaths of nearly 56,000 people in southwest China, the nation’s greatest natural disaster in more than three decades. Russia is among the handful of countries to have sent both aid supplies and rescue teams.In recent months, both countries have condemned America’s plan for a missile shield. Russia in particular has long sought allies to act as a bulwark against what Moscow depicts as American global hegemony.In a statement signed by Mr. Medvedev and Mr. Hu, the leaders took issue once more with plans for a missile defense system “in certain regions of the world,” saying such measures “do not support strategic balance and stability, and harm international efforts to control arms and the nonproliferation process.”“It harms the strengthening of trust between states and regional stability,” the statement said.The White House’s reaction to the statement was muted. A spokesman for the National Security Council, Gordon D. Johndroe, noted that on Thursday Mr. Medvedev made remarks indicating that he remained open to negotiations. A new round of talks involving American and Russian technical experts is expected to begin next month.“We’re having discussions with the Russians in good faith about the sites in the Czech Republic and Poland,” Mr. Johndroe said. “So we’ll see.”The Russian-Chinese statement did not specifically identify the United States, which has angered Russia with plans to deploy elements of a missile defense system in the Czech Republic and Poland. Washington says the shield is to protect against potential attacks by rogue states like Iran and North Korea.For their part, Moscow and Beijing have not always supported Washington’s efforts to characterize Iran as a sponsor of terrorism and a potential nuclear threat, particularly to Israel. Iran says its nuclear development program is for peaceful, civilian purposes.The joint statement also took issue with America’s attitude toward the promotion of human rights, insisting that “every state has a right to encourage and protect them based on its own specific features and characters.”The statement reflected an argument among Washington’s critics that the United States uses the human rights issue as a means of exerting pressure. It said governments should “oppose politicizing the issue and using double standards” and should not use “human rights to interfere with other countries’ affairs.”In late March, as China was coming under growing international criticism for a harsh crackdown on pro-Tibetan protests, President Bush called Mr. Hu to urge restraint and to advise the Chinese government to meet with the Dalai Lama’s representatives, according to the White House. He also asked Mr. Hu to allow diplomats and foreign journalists into Tibetan areas.As a signal of the warming ties between China and Russia, the two countries signed a $1 billion agreement for Russia to build a nuclear fuel enrichment plant in China and supply uranium. Sergei V. Kiriyenko, the director of Rosatom, Russia’s state nuclear corporation, described the deal as “a good addition to our presence in China.”Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported on Friday that trade between the countries rose to $48.17 billion last year from $10.67 billion in 2000.'"
"'08-05-24,'0','“Sixty years ago, we had a momentous event in history,” Father Jordan said. “The United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. One has a right to health and to be protected, even while one is in prison.”The number of people detained in immigration cases has more than tripled since 2001, government officials say. Many vanish into a system that has no resemblance to ordinary American legal procedures. There is no right to a lawyer, limited ability to contest evidence, and isolation from family or friends, who may themselves be vulnerable to deportation.Simply making a phone call is often impossible: phones do not work, or the requirements for using them — first punching in an Alien Registration Number, as opposed to an unrelated identification number that the detainees wear on wristbands — are baffling, the Government Accountability Office said in a report issued last year.At the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey, where Mr. Bah, the tailor, was held, 9 of 30 posted telephone numbers for foreign consulates — the only way for many detainees to get legal help — were wrong, the report said.Somehow, Mr. Bah hurt his head. He was put into solitary confinement. He had a fractured skull and multiple brain hemorrhages. Eventually, he was taken to a hospital for emergency surgery. No one told his family until five days later, when he was already in a coma from which he would never emerge.“Some of the fastest growing industries in the United States are casinos and prisons,” Father Jordan said. “It’s a big business. But the economy exists for the person, not the person for the economy.”The records of Mr. Bah’s case were in a file marked “proprietary information” by the Corrections Corporation of America, a private company that has federal contracts to run many detention centers across the country, including the one in Elizabeth. The company, which has thrived with the immigration crackdown, contributes to both political parties. The magazine Mother Jones reported that among its lobbyists was the son-in-law of Vice President Dick Cheney.The Mass at St. Andrew’s was organized by the Emerald Isle Immigration Center, a nonprofit organization that provides citizenship assistance and other services to immigrants in New York, and most of those in the church were affiliated with the group. Father Jordan said that on weekly visits to an immigration detention center on Varick Street, he had seen improvements in recent years. But he said officials had told him that there wasn’t enough money to do better at the Elizabeth center.“We’re paying $12 billion a month for an unjust war, and we can’t take proper care of the soldiers who are hurt fighting the war, and we can’t take care of the squalid conditions in prisons,” Father Jordan said.“What does it mean to be a human person?” he asked. “We should be outraged by the death of innocent people, with no access to health care, to their families, to lawyers.”Mr. Bah “should be alive now,” Father Jordan said. “So should many others. Remember, the economy exists for the person — not the other way around.”'"

"'08-05-25,'0','Before New York’s presidential primary, Jackie Gavron, 48, asked Mrs. Woo if she could put a sign in the window in support of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton; Mrs. Woo agreed, saying that she liked strong women. Jeremy Krevat, 37, was on his way to an interview for a sales job one day last year when he stopped in the store and Mrs. Woo noticed that he was missing a stay in his collar. “She just came over and put one in,” he said. He got the job.On Saturday, people entered the store somewhat timidly, awkwardly, many holding their pink and white claim slips. Grief is hard, and grief in the middle of a transaction over dress shirts is not any easier.One man apologized for not having his ticket. “I never used to bring my ticket because she knew who I was,” he said.Another man spent several minutes with Kenneth Oh, searching the long racks behind the counter for a suit that he had dropped off for cleaning and alterations. The suit was soon discovered, and Mr. Oh, examining the cuffs of the pants, smiled.“She did the work,” he told the man. “All you got to do is iron. This is the last work she did.”Last Sunday, the police arrested Jamal Winter, 22, of nearby Park Slope and charged him with murder and robbery in the case. The police said they believe that Mrs. Woo was strangled the night before her body was found.The day of the attack, she had asked a neighbor to chase away a man who had frightened her by hanging out in front of her shop all day, the neighbor said.Kenneth Oh, 40, said the motive appeared to involve not money but a car. He said that he had bought his mother a 2008 Honda Accord for Mother’s Day, and that the attacker may have had his eye on the car for days. The car, parked near the shop, was missing after the killing. It was found about a block and a half away from the suspect’s residence, the police said.The two brothers later read an article in The Daily News saying that Mr. Winter had served time for robbery and was out of jail at the time of Mrs. Woo’s killing because of a legal technicality. They were outraged.“I don’t know why he was released,” said Daniel Oh, 38, who owns a nail salon on Long Island.There has been an outpouring of sympathy and shock in Windsor Terrace over the killing. On Thursday night, about 140 people filled the intersection outside the shop for a vigil.John Maloney, a retired truck driver who has lived in the neighborhood for all his 67 years, referred to Mrs. Woo not as Linda but as Mom.“Mom was part of the community,” he said. She had operated the business in the neighborhood for 18 years.Customers also worried about the fate of the store. Kenneth and Daniel Oh told them on Saturday that they would keep the shop open. “We’re going to save this business,” said Kenneth, a regional sales manager for an international cargo company. The brothers said they would close the store for the coming week, reopening on May 31.A truck pulled up and parked on Saturday morning. Workers with shovels started digging, and another truck arrived shortly after. A tree was being planted, in memory of Mrs. Woo.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','PARIS — A tennis season that began in exhilarating fashion for the young Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has turned into an ordeal, and he announced Saturday that he would miss this year’s French Open because of a knee injury.Tsonga made a stirring run to the final of the year’s first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open, producing attacking tennis of remarkable quality in his straight-sets upset of Rafael Nadal in the semifinals.But Tsonga, 23, has been unable to scale those heights again. Since January, he has failed to win more than two rounds in any significant tournament and was forced to withdraw from the Davis Cup quarterfinal in April against the United States because of a slight tear in the meniscus in his right knee.Once the world’s second-ranked junior, Tsonga has had an injury-prone professional career, missing stretches of competition with back and knee problems. He attempted to resolve this latest injury with rest, therapy and a cortisone injection and was able to compete in Masters Series events in Rome and Hamburg.But on Friday, he withdrew from a minor event in Casablanca, Morocco, before his semifinal because of swelling and pain in the knee. On Saturday, at a hotel in central Paris chosen because he did not want to have to cope with the crush at Roland Garros, he announced he would have surgery this week and be out of action for “three to four months.”“I’m feeling lots of frustration, an enormous amount of sadness,” said Tsonga, who had been seeded 14th this year but whose only appearance at the French Open remains a first-round loss in 2005.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','In recent years, the debate over the Amazon has intensified, with many outside the country seeing an intact rainforest as a key to controlling global warming. At the same time, Brazil’s economy has taken off — largely because of businesses that are claiming more of the Amazon’s land for crops and livestock, and more of its trees for logging.Mr. da Silva has spent the last several years walking a careful line, trying to maintain his image as Brazil’s first “green” president, which has gained him international cachet, without threatening Brazil’s agriculture industry at a time of soaring grain and meat prices.Dr. Câmara’s findings made the president’s balancing act harder and turned up the heat on what had been a long-simmering battle between businesses and environmentalists.It did not help that the scientists’ report, released in January, relied heavily on progressive deforestation, a relatively new measure that is is widely accepted by environmentalists but that Governor Maggi contends is tantamount to lying. The space agency argues that this slower-paced deforestation, where parts of the forest are thinned out little by little rather than at once, can be just as devastating.The criticism of the report worried scientists in and out of Brazil, including Dr. Câmara. “Science,” he said, “should not bow to authority.”The space agency, known as INPE, reported in January that deforestation had hit an estimated 4,300 square miles between August and December of last year. If that pace continues, the yearly total for deforestation would jump; the number was approximately 6,900 square miles from August 2006 to August 2007.The agency’s data also showed that 54 percent of the deforestation had occurred in Mato Grosso, Governor Maggi’s state, where the scientists said ranchers and loggers pushed farther into the rainforest.Some of the deforestation is legal. Owners are allowed to clear 20 percent of their land in the rainforest.Nonetheless, the report was a headache for the government. Mr. da Silva has received international attention in recent years for the country’s growing biofuels program and for the recent two-year drop in deforestation. Suddenly environmentalists across the world were again criticizing Brazil’s efforts to save the rainforest.The attacks on the space agency made some environmentalists worry publicly that the president might cave in to pressure from businesses. Environmentalists became even more alarmed when Marina Silva, Brazil’s environmental minister and a respected rainforest defender, resigned this month. While leaving, she spoke of heavy pressures being exerted by industry-minded governors, including Governor Maggi, to reverse the federal crackdown on destruction of the forest.Still, Mr. da Silva responded to the space agency’s report with tough measures, including imposing credit restrictions on those found to be involved in illegal forest-clearing and creating a Arc of Fire, a multi-agency police operation that conducts surprise raids to catch illegal loggers.The space agency has two systems for measuring deforestation. Prodes, a yearly satellite analysis, measures deforested areas as small as about 15 acres, while Deter, a lower-resolution system, maps areas greater than about 60 acres in real-time, giving law enforcement information to act quickly to stop further destruction.The dispute over the space agency’s figures has centered on the information provided by Deter.In the past, Dr. Câmara said, the agency included mostly large swaths of cleared land in its analysis. But environmental researchers have been clamoring for years for satellite researchers to expand monitoring to include areas thinned by logging and surface fires, rather than just areas that have been clear cut.The agency uses the term progressive deforestation to refer to the slower form of forest degradation that has become increasingly common in the Amazon in recent years and which Dr. Câmara said the agency began including in its analysis in 2005.The latest deforestation alerts have shown that about one-third of newly deforested areas were from progressive degradation, of which more than 75 percent were “severely degraded,” he said.“We had to ask ourselves what happened between forest and clear-cut,” said Dr. Câmara, 52, who has been with the agency for 26 years. “With a view that if you are going to do prevention and enforcement, you need to be there as rapidly as possible.”In other words, if farmers, loggers and others are clearing illegally, but slowly, the government, by identifying thinned-out areas, has a better chance to catch them before a large area has been affected.“We are satisfied with the technology we have,” Dr. Câmara said. “It is the largest use of remote sensing data for environmental protection worldwide on a systematic basis of any country.”But for Governor Maggi, who leads the state that has become a locomotive in Brazil’s surging agriculture industry, news that Mato Grosso was once again the worst deforestation offender was difficult to accept. While he is lauded by many for pioneering Brazil’s expansion into the world soybean market, his pro-industry stance and actions as head of a soybean-growing business have made him a frequent target of environmentalists. Greenpeace gave him the Golden Chainsaw Award in 2005 for being the Brazilian who most contributed to the destruction of the rainforest.Governor Maggi’s chief of staff, Alexander Torres Maia, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment, and he did not reply to a list of questions sent via e-mail last week.In recent years, critics say Governor Maggi has softened his all-out defense of the rights of businesses out of political necessity. But that did not stop his administration from challenging the satellite data. Officials in Mato Grosso said that the state’s environmental agency had never heard of progressive deforestation.“We could see this wasn’t deforestation, it was burning of fields and old deforestation,” Luis Henrique Chaves Daldegan, Mato Grosso’s environment secretary, said in an interview.Mato Grosso’s environmental agency worked to gather evidence to prove the space agency had overreached. Technicians compared satellite images dating from 2000, went to disputed locations and shot photos of what was there today. Mr. Daldegan said the pictures proved that the space agency was declaring land that had been deforested as far back as 2000 as newly cleared.On March 25, the state agency provided Dr. Câmara with a detailed report that included 854 photos of areas in Mato Grosso that the space agency had included in its tally. The state report contended that only 10 percent of the areas had recently been deforested.Dr. Câmara put 10 of the 50 specialists that had produced the deforestation analysis onto the task of analyzing Mato Grosso’s photos and data. They worked intensely for six weeks, he said, sometimes time-stamping their analysis of the photos after midnight.“There was clearly a sense of urgency,” Dr. Câmara said.In the end, the space agency said that 96 percent of its initial assessments had been correct.“INPE is very proud, and the internal pressures were almost stronger than the external pressures to show that science would win out,” Dr. Câmara said. He did, however, agree to try using higher-resolution satellites in the future to improve the reliability of his agency’s analysis.Mr. Daldegan said he is still not satisfied.“We don’t think this is the end of the story,” Dr. Câmara said. “They did not ask us to stop doing this data. So this was a step forward.”'"
"'08-05-25,'0','Meanwhile, Tiger Woods, the world No. 1, who has been sidelined since having knee surgery April 15, announced Friday that he would not play next week at the Memorial Tournament as he had originally hoped. This leaves just the Stanford St. Jude Championship as a possible, though unlikely, final tuneup. Woods has never played in Memphis and does not customarily play the week before a major championship, meaning his first round of tournament golf since the final round of the Masters could be June 9 in the first round of the Open.These recent events have ladled more intrigue on what has simmered all year as a most highly anticipated Open. With Mickelson on track and Woods still on the mend, the already unprecedented plot thickens: the game’s two best players and biggest rivals squaring off at the public golf course where each formed his game as a child and honed it as an adult, combining for nine pro victories (Woods six, Mickelson three) in the Buick Invitational, an annual stop on the PGA Tour.Now the big question: without a competitive round since the Masters, can Woods’s left knee — repaired for the third time in his career — be ready for 72 holes of golf’s sternest test at the longest, and one of the toughest, United States Open courses?Woods, 32, may shed more light on that Tuesday, when he meets the news media at Congressional Country Club in Washington to promote his June 30-July 6 PGA Tour event, the AT&T National. His most recent update came in the form of a guarded prognosis on May 12 during a conference call promoting the BMW Championship.“I’m chipping and putting,” said Woods, who at that point had not hit a shot longer than a 30-yard pitch. “I’m not doing anything beyond that. Hopefully, I’ll start hitting balls and start progressing soon and working my way up the bag.”Mickelson, a four-time runner-up at the Open, has no such concerns. During the last two months he has played at Torrey Pines about once every other week, including Tuesday before coming to Colonial. The health of his game is evident, with his short game peaking and his overall game rounding into shape.“I feel like I’m starting to play pretty well,” said Mickelson, who took copious notes Tuesday at Torrey Pines, which he pronounced “fabulous.”“It’s tight, but it’s not ridiculous,” he said. “It looks fair. It doesn’t look funny to the eye. It looks good.“I love something they’re doing this year, where there are a couple of different layers of rough where you can actually play if you only miss the fairway by a couple of yards. You can probably play a shot to the green. And then it gets progressively worse. I think it’s going to be a great championship because the golf course is so hard as it is, with its length and with its difficult pin placements, that you don’t really need to do too much to make par a good score.”Mickelson’s best chances to hoist the distinctive, two-handled silver United States Open trophy both came down to the final hole. In 1999 at Pinehurst, he was denied when Payne Stewart ran in a putt at the final hole. In 2006 at Winged Foot — where a par at the 72nd hole would have won and a bogey would have resulted in a playoff — a far-left drive bounced off a hospitality tent, an ill-advised hero shot bounced off a tree, and an agonizing double bogey left Mickelson in second again.All this tumult, of course, makes Mickelson the ideal foil for Woods, whose two Open victories have been icily efficient displays of dominance. His record-shattering 15-stroke victory in the centennial Open at Pebble Beach in 2000 perhaps stands alone as the transcendent championship moment in golf.It appears it will be three long weeks before the golf world learns whether Woods can stun everyone again, as he did that week at Pebble Beach or as he did, on a different scale, in 2003. That was when he made a triumphal return from another knee surgery with a victory in his first event back — the Buick at Torrey Pines.“I miss being out there to mix it up with them,” Woods said last week in response to a question about his desire to return. “But in this condition right now, as I said, the only chance I have is from 30 yards and in, until I get the leg strong enough and my game ready so I can compete and play again.”While he is finding the answer to that question, his main rival is getting in as much work as he can. Mickelson is scheduled to play next week at the Memorial before taking a week off in final preparation for the Open in his hometown. Regardless of what happens this week or next, Mickelson is on a glide path into the Open while Woods has yet to file a flight plan.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','More than that, they said, Mr. McCain organizationally still seems far behind where President Bush was in 2004. Several Republican Party leaders said they were worried the campaign was losing an opportunity as they waited for approval to open offices and set up telephone banks.“They finally assigned someone to West Virginia three weeks ago,” said Doug McKinney, the state Republican chairman there. “I had a couple of contacts with him and I e-mailed him twice and I never heard back. I finally called and they said that the guy had resigned.”Mr. McCain’s campaign has transmitted conflicting messages in recent days about how he would present himself, as he has sought to reassure conservatives nervous about his ideological consistency even as he has tried to expand his appeal to moderates and liberals.He recently spent three days talking about global warming, a subject he used to emphasize his differences with Mr. Bush. But he ended that week with a high-profile speech to the National Rifle Association, a group suspicious of his views on gun control.Mr. McCain’s advisers — some of whom gathered with the candidate for the holiday weekend at his Arizona ranch along with three Republicans assumed to be under consideration as his running mate — said the concern in the party reflected, in part, exaggerated concern about Senator Barack Obama’s strengths as a general election candidate. Mr. McCain, they said, was in a strong position entering into this next phase of the race.Steve Schmidt, a senior adviser, said Mr. McCain had used the time since effectively winning the nomination to methodically raise his standing by traveling the country, delivering speeches on issues including national security and the environment, and raising money, to make sure he could at least hold his own with Mr. Obama going through the summer.Although Mr. Obama has continued to raise far more money than Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush’s fund-raising machinery has helped keep the Republican Party competitive. The McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee, between them, have $11 million more on hand — about $62 million — than the combined cash-on-hand of Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee.“How do you measure success over the course of the spring campaign?” Mr. Schmidt asked. “This is how: The reality of this race is the Republican Party brand is very, very badly damaged, in some places broken. We’ve lost Congressional seats in districts that have elected only Republican for a generation. And Senator McCain is running even or ahead of Senator Obama in most national polls.”Mr. McCain has taken steps to inject new thinking into his campaign. He recently expanded his extremely tight circle of advisers by bringing on Nicolle Wallace, who was communications director for Mr. Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign, which many Republicans view as the model for political management.Last Sunday, he invited Mike Murphy, his longtime friend and political adviser, who is not involved in this campaign, to his home in Virginia. There, Mr. Murphy reportedly gave him a detailed and at times tough assessment of what Mr. McCain had done wrong.Mr. Murphy urged him to tone down his attacks on Mr. Obama and stop coming across as so angry. He recommended that Mr. McCain concentrate on running as a reform candidate to strip that issue from Mr. Obama, and to make greater efforts to distance himself from Mr. Bush, Republicans familiar with the conversation said.Some of Mr. McCain’s associates said that Mr. McCain might be interested in bringing Mr. Murphy back on board, but that his current circle of advisers was resisting that.As soon as Mr. Obama secures the Democratic nomination, Mr. Schmidt said, Mr. McCain will begin a series of speeches intended to contrast their positions. Mr. McCain’s advisers said they did not think it made sense to do that until Mr. Obama wrapped up his battle against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, given how the two Democrats are dominating the news.“The race changes the moment she drops out and he emerges as the official nominee,” said Charlie Black, a senior McCain adviser. “Then the focus becomes on a two-person race and that leads to us getting more equal treatment in terms of getting airtime. We’ve had to fight with one hand tied behind our back.”Republicans said Mr. McCain certainly had time to get his campaign back on track, and they remained confident that he would be a strong general election candidate against Mr. Obama. Some said the level of concern was overstated, or reflected the general Republican apprehension about this electoral environment, rather than anything Mr. McCain had done wrong.“I think any Republican who doesn’t say panic is in the wind is lying through their shirt,” said Ron Kaufman, who was a senior adviser this year for Mitt Romney. “The question is, is that panic caused by McCain’s campaign — or lack thereof in some respects — or is it the climate?”The string of departures from the campaign was prompted by questions about lobbying activities by aides and advisers to Mr. McCain and a new policy, which he dictated, that active lobbyists not be allowed to hold paying jobs in the campaign. Mr. Schmidt said that policy was an example of how Mr. McCain would take tough action, part of a contrast he said they would draw with Mr. Obama for “giving great speeches” but having no record of accomplishment.But Mr. McCain’s associates said the campaign had failed to anticipate the extent to which the news media would use the policy to examine Mr. McCain’s staff. The result was a run of damaging stories and resignations that highlighted not the policy itself but the backgrounds of top campaign officials, including Rick Davis, the campaign manager, and Mr. Black, both of whom have long lobbying backgrounds.Some Republicans said they were concerned that the Democrats would soon unify around Mr. Obama, and that it was only a matter of weeks before Mr. Obama began unloading a huge round of advertising intended to define Mr. McCain. If that happens, they said, Mr. McCain may look back at this period as a time of missed opportunity.Discussing what Mr. McCain needed to do, Mr. Nelson, another veteran of the Bush 2004 team, said: “Step No. 1 would be finding a compelling message that excited Republicans, and Step No. 2 would be having the ability to turn your voters out. From what I see, in both respects, they have a long way to go, but they have time.”Mr. McCain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration, polls suggest. But if he is going to rely on turnout in the Republican base more than on winning over independents and disaffected Democrats, there is evidence that he has not gone as far as he needs to — particularly given how energized Democrats appear to be.“He is going to need extraordinary participation of Republicans if Democrats continue to flock to the polls the way they have,” said Kris Kobach, the Republican Party leader from Kansas. “It’s critical that he use this period to generate enthusiasm from his base.”Mr. McKinney, the Republican chairman in West Virginia, said Mr. McCain’s identification with immigration legislation that would eventually permit some illegal immigrants to apply for citizenship continued to be highly problematic for him.“But it doesn’t matter what we think — Senator McCain goes his own way,” Mr. McKinney said. “Always has and always will.”'"
"'08-05-25,'0','“They don’t play baseball in Haiti,” said Melanie Teff, who has studied the issue for Refugees International, an advocacy group in Washington. “That shows how Dominican this guy and many people like him are.”The government does not necessarily agree, and Ángel awaits a ruling on his appeal for access to his Dominican birth record.The issue arose with a fury several years ago when advocates took the government to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, whose jurisdiction the Dominican Republic acknowledges, to protest the denial of birth certificates to two ethnic Haitian children.While the case was in process, the government changed its migration law in 2004 to specifically exclude the offspring of Haitian migrants from citizenship. The Dominican Constitution grants citizenship to those born on Dominican soil, except the children of diplomats and those “in transit.” That has long meant that the children of immigrants, no matter their legal status, gained Dominican citizenship.After the international court ruled against the Dominican government in 2005, ordering that damages be paid to the two children, the Dominican Supreme Court said that Haitian workers were considered “in transit” and that their children were therefore Haitian, not Dominican.Last spring, the government agency in charge of identity documents, the Joint Electoral Council, issued a memorandum telling its employees to watch for the offspring of foreigners trying to identify themselves as Dominican. It now hangs at every clerk’s office and is shown to people thought to have Haitian blood.“The issue of Haiti has become very combustible in the Dominican context,” said Daniel Erikson, director of Caribbean programs at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research group in Washington. “You have a deep resentment of Haiti, and that’s driving these responses that don’t reflect favorably on the country.”Government officials point out the strain that poor illegal immigrants from Haiti put on the Dominican Republic. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola but have vastly different levels of development.Of course, Haitians contribute, too. They have long worked in the jobs Dominicans did not want to do, mostly cutting cane on plantations that supply sugar to the United States. The government has not just known of their presence for decades but has in some cases encouraged their arrival.The Dominican government says the new crackdown is a security matter, aimed at wiping out fraud. And in some cases over the years, young Haitians who had crossed the border illegally claimed to have been born on the Dominican side.But opponents accuse the government of applying its 2004 law retroactively, which they call an illegal practice that has longstanding societal animosity against Haitians at its heart.“The racist beliefs of some are being used to twist our laws,” said Cristóbal Rodríguez Gómez, a Dominican constitutional law professor at Ibero-American University, who is acting as counsel for another descendant of Haitians who lacks documents. “This is a crime, a monstrous crime.”In a recent report, two United Nations experts found “a profound and entrenched problem of racism and discrimination” in the Dominican Republic, mostly affecting people of Haitian origin. The report said Haitians and their descendants face “extreme vulnerability, unjustified deportations, racial discrimination, and are denied the full enjoyment of their human rights.”The Dominican government rejected the conclusions, portraying the relationship between the neighbors as one of solidarity.Ángel is one of many who find their lives in limbo under the new rules. Emildo Bueno Oguis, 33, a college student who recently married an American woman, could not get his birth certificate either and therefore cannot apply to the American Embassy for residency to join her in Florida.Mr. Oguis, whom Mr. Rodríguez represents, challenged the government’s decision in court, accusing the council of denying his rights. But his claim was rejected, despite the fact that he had previously been issued a Dominican identity card and a Dominican passport.Confusing the matter, a lower court judge ruled in favor of another descendant of Haitian immigrants, Nuny Angra Luis, who had been denied her birth certificate. That decision was announced the same week in April as the other, diametrically opposed ruling.Demetrio F. Francisco de Los Santos, a government lawyer, dismisses the notion that anyone’s rights are being violated. Descendants of Haitians, he argues in court documents, can simply go to the nearest Haitian consulate for their documents.While Haitian law does grant citizenship to the offspring of Haitians, the issue is complex. Ángel’s parents would have to prove they are Haitian for him to get citizenship in Haiti, a country which he has never visited.While some are indignant about the Dominican crackdown, Ángel seems surprisingly calm.Before a recent practice, in which he flagged fly balls and then fired them into the infield, Ángel said his mother could not sleep after he lost the Giants contract. (“Ángel Luis Joseph is one of a number of players in the Dominican that clubs are finding do not have the proper paperwork to prove their identity or age,” the Giants said in a statement, indicating that the team had been forced to look for someone else.)Ángel may have another shot. The Cleveland Indians have come calling, he said, visiting the humble shack that he shares with his parents and seven siblings just outside a sugarcane field.The Indians’ offer was about a third of that put forward by the Giants, but still a windfall for a boy from a batey, the name for the workers’ camps that grow up around sugar cane plantations.But while he awaits a ruling, he acknowledges worrying that he will see his dream disappear a second time.“God wants me to be a baseball player — that I know,” he said. What he does not know is whether the Dominican Republic, the country he considers himself from, agrees.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','Rising energy costs and further declines in the troubled housing market led to steep losses in stocks last week.On Friday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes dropped again in April. At the current sales rate, it would take nearly a year to sell off the current inventory of unsold homes.Energy prices soared to new records during the week. The futures price for a barrel of oil closed at $132.19 in New York on Friday, up from $126.29 the previous week. Coca-Cola, which gained 2.7 percent, had the best weekly performance in the Dow industrials. General Motors, which lost 14.9 percent, was at the bottom of the list.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 507.17 points, or 3.9 percent, to close at 12,479.63. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 49.42 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 1,375.93. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 84.18 points, or 3.3 percent, to close at 2,444.67.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note finished even with the previous week, at 3.84 percent.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','After experiencing intense pain, she said, her body disconnected from her mind. “I felt like a genie liberated from its bottle,” she wrote in her book. “The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria.”While her spirit soared, her body struggled to live. She had a clot the size of a golf ball in her head, and without the use of her left hemisphere she lost basic analytical functions like her ability to speak, to understand numbers or letters, and even, at first, to recognize her mother. A friend took her to the hospital. Surgery and eight years of recovery followed.Her desire to teach others about nirvana, Dr. Taylor said, strongly motivated her to squeeze her spirit back into her body and to get well.This story is not typical of stroke victims. Left-brain injuries don’t necessarily lead to blissful enlightenment; people sometimes sink into a helplessly moody state: their emotions run riot. Dr. Taylor was also helped because her left hemisphere was not destroyed, and that probably explains how she was able to recover fully.Today, she says, she is a new person, one who “can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere” on command and be “one with all that is.”To her it is not faith, but science. She brings a deep personal understanding to something she long studied: that the two lobes of the brain have very different personalities. Generally, the left brain gives us context, ego, time, logic. The right brain gives us creativity and empathy. For most English-speakers, the left brain, which processes language, is dominant. Dr. Taylor’s insight is that it doesn’t have to be so.Her message, that people can choose to live a more peaceful, spiritual life by sidestepping their left brain, has resonated widely.In February, Dr. Taylor spoke at the Technology, Entertainment, Design conference (known as TED), the annual forum for presenting innovative scientific ideas. The result was electric. After her 18-minute address was posted as a video on TED’s Web site, she become a mini-celebrity. More than two million viewers have watched her talk, and about 20,000 more a day continue to do so. An interview with her was also posted on Oprah Winfrey’s Web site, and she was chosen as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2008.She also receives more than 100 e-mail messages a day from fans. Some are brain scientists, who are fascinated that one of their own has had a stroke and can now come back and translate the experience in terms they can use. Some are stroke victims or their caregivers who want to share their stories and thank her for her openness.But many reaching out are spiritual seekers, particularly Buddhists and meditation practitioners, who say her experience confirms their belief that there is an attainable state of joy.“People are so taken with it,” said Sharon Salzberg, a founder of the Insight Mediation Society in Barre, Mass. “I keep getting that video in e-mail. I must have 100 copies.”She is excited by Dr. Taylor’s speech because it uses the language of science to describe an occurrence that is normally ethereal. Dr. Taylor shows the less mystically inclined, she said, that this experience of deep contentment “is part of the capacity of the human mind.”Since the stroke, Dr. Taylor has moved to Bloomington, Ind., an hour from where she was raised in Terre Haute and where her mother, Gladys Gillman Taylor, who nursed her back to health, still lives.Originally, Dr. Taylor became a brain scientist — she has a Ph.D. in life sciences with a specialty in neuroanatomy — because she has a mentally ill brother who suffers from delusions that he is in direct contact with Jesus. And for her old research lab at Harvard, she continues to speak on behalf of the mentally ill.But otherwise, she has dialed back her once loaded work schedule. Her house is on a leafy cul-de-sac minutes from Indiana University, which she attended as an undergraduate and where she now teaches at the medical school.Her foyer is painted a vibrant purple. She greets a stranger at the door with a warm hug. When she talks, her pale blue eyes make extended contact.Never married, she lives with her dog and two cats. She unselfconsciously calls her mother, 82, her best friend.She seems bemused but not at all put off by the hundreds who have reached out to her on a spiritual level. Religious ecstatics who claim to see angels have asked her to appear on their radio and television programs.She has declined these offers. Although her father is an Episcopal minister and she was raised in his church, she cannot be counted among the traditionally faithful. “Religion is a story that the left brain tells the right brain,” she said.Still, Dr. Taylor says, “nirvana exists right now.”“There is no doubt that it is a beautiful state and that we can get there,” she said.That belief has certainly sparked debate. On Web sites like evolvingbeings.com and in Eckhart Tolle discussion groups, people debate whether she is truly enlightened or just physically damaged and confused.Even her own scientific brethren have wondered.“When I saw her on the TED video, at first I thought, Oh my god, is she losing it,” said Dr. Francine M. Benes, director of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, where Dr. Taylor once worked.Dr. Benes makes clear that she still thinks Dr. Taylor is an extraordinary and competent woman. “It is just that the mystical side was not apparent when she was at Harvard,” Dr. Benes said.Dr. Taylor makes no excuses or apologies, or even explanations. She says instead that she continues to battle her left brain for the better. She gently offers tips on how it might be done.“As the child of divorced parents and a mentally ill brother, I was angry,” she said. Now when she feels anger rising, she trumps it with a thought of a person or activity that brings her pleasure. No meditation necessary, she says, just the belief that the left brain can be tamed.Her newfound connection to other living beings means that she is no longer interested in performing experiments on live rat brains, which she did as a researcher.She is committed to making time for passions — physical and visual — that she believes exercise her right brain, including water-skiing, guitar playing and stained-glass making. A picture of one of her intricate stained-glass pieces — of a brain — graces the cover of her book.Karen Armstrong, a religious historian who has written several popular books including one on the Buddha, says there are odd parallels between his story and Dr. Taylor’s.“Like this lady, he was reluctant to return to this world,” she said. “He wanted to luxuriate in the sense of enlightenment.”But, she said, “the dynamic of the religious required that he go out into the world and share his sense of compassion.”And in the end, compassion is why Dr. Taylor says she wrote her memoir. She thinks there is much to be mined from her experience on how brain-trauma patients might best recover and, in fact, she hopes to open a center in Indiana to treat such patients based on those principles.And then there is the question of world peace. No, Dr. Taylor doesn’t know how to attain that, but she does think the right hemisphere could help. Or as she told the TED conference:“I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.”It almost seems like science.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','“I talk about bringing the troops home from Iraq, but also don’t you feel like it’s about time they came back from Korea, Europe and Japan?” the candidate then asked.The audience whooped in approval, as if Ron Paul were a lead guitarist tearing off a solo.Mr. Paul was supposed to be a memory by now. But in the Oregon primary last week, he won 15 percent of the vote, and the campaign appears to be growing into something beyond a conventional protest campaign. Some supporters have helped turn the outspoken congressman’s campaign into a colorful, loud sideshow with their guerrilla marketing tactics — self-penned Ron Paul anthems on YouTube, a Ron Paul blimp, T-shirts that portray Mr. Paul as a world-historical icon like Che Guevara.Attendance at Ron Paul campaign stops has nearly returned to pre-Super Tuesday levels. A group of supporters recently announced plans to start Paulville, a gated community in West Texas, where believers can pursue the candidate’s libertarian ideals as a cooperative lifestyle. Ron Paul’s book, “The Revolution: A Manifesto,” rocketed to No. 1 on a New York Times best-seller list on May 18 (it has since dropped). Supporters are starting to discuss creating yippie-ish disruptions at the Republican National Convention in Minneapolis-St. Paul in September to gain visibility for the movement.Many supporters say that such gestures are not the final gasp of a failed political campaign, but a spark for a “revolution.” And Mr. Paul encourages such talk. When he speaks or writes of revolution, the congressman means it in the 1776 sense, except that the oppressors now live in Washington, not London. The candidate wants to turn back what he sees as 200 years of creeping expansion of federal power, dissolve the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service, return to the gold standard, bring the troops home, not just from Iraq, but from everywhere — and yes, legalize pot, at least for medical purposes.This message has hit home — not only with some traditional libertarians, but also among a small but passionate group of young voters who came of age after Sept. 11, during the debates about the Iraq war, the Patriot Act and Abu Ghraib. For them, the Ron Paul message has the feel not of 1776, but of 1968, when an unpopular war raged abroad, and a subculture of disenfranchised young people embraced an unorthodox philosophy built around a utopian ideal of freedom.Of course, Ron Paul is a lot closer to Barry Goldwater than to Eugene McCarthy. But his young supporters, many of whom call themselves former liberals, said the peacenik left shares much with the libertarian right.“It’s about taking the country back,” Mr. Lim said, waving off the policy differences between his old “political saint,” Mr. Nader, and his new one, who is anti-Roe (Mr. Paul opposes abortion personally, but thinks states should decide the issue) and supports gun rights. “Whether you believe in abortion or not, in guns or not, that’s not the point,” Mr. Lim said. “It’s about the way the country is going: to hell in a handbasket.”Mr. Paul’s voters tend to be younger and angrier than most Republicans. Exit polls in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Michigan by Edison/Mitofsky showed that Mr. Paul’s voters tended to strongly disapprove of the Iraq war, and hold a far more negative opinion of the Bush administration than other Republican voters do. In Michigan, where Mr. Paul received 6 percent of the vote, 34 percent of Paul voters were under 30, compared with 13 percent of voters there over all. (Mr. Paul is also, largely, a guy thing. In the New Hampshire primary, where the candidate received 8 percent of the vote, his support was 77 percent male, according to exit polls.)With young voters comes youthful enthusiasm. “This is the message of the Beatles, the Dylans of the world,” said Marc Scibilia, a 21-year-old songwriter from Buffalo, referring to Mr. Paul’s platform. Mr. Scibilia posted a video of his Paul-themed song, “Hope Anthem,” on YouTube, and this summer he will lead a 28-city “Freedom Tour” featuring other musicians. Mr. Paul’s message of freedom and peace is “an ancient message — it inspired people in the 60s and 70s,” Mr. Scibilia said. “I want to bring back that era of magic.”Some supporters are as quick as Dylan fans from the 60s to label mainstream politicians as sell-outs and compromisers. They cherish their candidate’s outspokenness.“Man, I’ve straight hated politics, I’ve just never liked the authority,” explained Tommy Rayome, 19, a “musician-slash-cook-slash-whatever” from Lexington, Ky., who was one of more than 600 people who showed up at last week’s Ron Paul signing at a Borders bookstore in Louisville.Mr. Rayome, whose unkempt ash curls cascaded from a knit Rasta cap, wore an enameled American flag pin on his faded maroon T-shirt. He said that he fell for Mr. Paul almost instantly after his roommate, also a supporter, described the candidate’s lack of hypocrisy. (In Congress, Mr. Paul is known as Dr. No, for his staunch refusal to vote for any bill he thinks might expand government power.) “I said, ‘All right, I like him,’ ” Mr. Rayome recalled. “He’s a terrible politician, so he’s the best.”Brad Linzy, who writes for a small entertainment magazine in Evansville, Ind., said that by now, Mr. Paul is more than a political preference. “The man is my hero,” he said. “He is a hero on the level of a Gandhi.” Adhering to the candidate’s calls for a hard-currency economy, Mr. Linzy, 30, keeps nearly half his savings in silver bullion, and scours antiques fairs and rummage sales for objects containing silver.In this passionate support, some political observers hear echoes not from 1968, but from 1964 — when Barry Goldwater lost the presidential election but won a fervent following.The youthful zeal of the Paul movement “does recall the early Goldwater movement, which was also jam-packed with people dropping out of graduate school, college, maybe even high school, to devote themselves 24/7 to what they called the ‘revolution,’ ” said Rick Perlstein, author of “Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus” (Hill and Wang, 2002).And such movements don’t always stay in the margins forever, he said, adding that the young supporters who stumped for Goldwater’s failed presidential bid helped lay the seeds for the Reagan revolution 16 years later.The figure at the center of the tempest looks like an unlikely political idol. Waiting in an empty green room at the Palace Theater before taking the stage, Mr. Paul looked slender, stooped, slightly sad. But that image dissolves when he begins to speak about the unlikely sense of community spawned by his traditional libertarianism.“It does bring people together, people who were totally apathetic,” he said in an interview afterward. “They’re very diverse. But they understand the issue of freedom. There’s a reason for this. If you’re free to live your life as you choose and spend your money as you wish, you’re not competitive with other people, you don’t tell people how to live.”Libertarianism and utopianism are part of the plans for Paulville, outside of Dell City, Tex. For now, the town is little more than an idea and a title deed to a 50-acre parcel of desert. The goal, according to www.paulville.org, is “to establish gated communities containing 100 percent Ron Paul supporters and or people that live by the ideals of freedom and liberty.”For $500 apiece, the residents would buy shares representing one acre of land to homestead. The site contains no contact information, but land records indicate the first purchase was made by the Jason Ebacher Land Investment Group. Mr. Ebacher, a Ron Paul supporter in Farwell, Minn., did not respond to requests for interviews.The candidate himself, however, has said that supporters should take the message out into the world, not hide from it.At a recent mixer at a bar on East 15th Street in Manhattan, it seemed as if Paul supporters had built a community without the help of gates.“Don’t you feel like an evangelist sometimes?” asked Rain Chacon, 36, a television writer and former Kucinich Democrat who lives in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. “It’s like, ‘Here’s The Book, have you read The Book?’ ” she said, wearing a Fleshtones T-shirt and cat’s-eye glasses and hoisting her copy of “The Revolution” into the air.The assembled — a few women and about 15 men — cheered with approval. They talked about their beliefs in spiritual terms, using phrases like “seeing the light.” Those who follow “the movement” are termed “awake.” The fact that their candidate has essentially zero chance to be president did not seem to faze them.“As Ron Paul said himself, the revolution has to be more than Ron Paul,” said Andrew Rushford, 25, a legal assistant who lives in Brooklyn. “To him, it didn’t start the day he was born. It started in 1776.”'"

"'08-05-25,'0','“Directors are responsible not only for overall administration,” Dr. Sutton said, “but also the financial stability of the institution, which means both the expenditure and revenue.”Dr. Sutton, who was director of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford before coming to the Bruce in August 2001, is not alone in devoting a great deal of his time to administrative matters. Take Michael Botwinick, the director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, who spent a morning several weeks ago studying changes to the museum’s insurance policies. “It is pretty boring stuff, but incredibly important,” he said. The same morning, Mary Sue Sweeney Price, director of the Newark Museum, had started her day attending a city-sponsored meeting on diversity in the workplace.Mrs. Price, who has been the head of the museum for 15 years, is also a former president of the Association of Art Museum Directors.“These days, to be a successful art museum director,” she said, “you have to get sustenance from knowing that you may not have the good fortune to be dealing with art and exhibitions all day, but that the broad range of responsibilities and duties which you are expected to perform make it possible for others on the staff to make it happen.”As an older generation of museum directors begins to retire, there are an unprecedented number of vacancies in the field; in the last six months alone, there have been openings for directors at more than two dozen major American art museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the Dia Art Foundation in Manhattan; the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth; the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis; and the Phillips Collection in Washington.Similarly, there are numerous current or imminent vacancies at museums outside of Manhattan. At the Samuel Dorsky Museum of Art in New Paltz, Neil C. Trager is retiring next month after more than 26 years. There are also vacancies at the Princeton University Art Museum, where Susan Taylor, who has been on leave since mid-January, will officially depart at the end of June; at the Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum on the Rutgers University campus in New Brunswick, N.J., where Greg Perry left on Dec. 31; and at the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art in Peekskill, which has had three directors in the last three years.Vacancies were recently filled at two high-profile museums in the region. Terrie Sultan joined the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton on April 1, replacing Trudy C. Kramer, who had been director for 26 years. Susan Lubowsky Talbott is taking the top job this month at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, which had been vacant for more than a year.Salaries paid to museum directors are “disparate,” Mrs. Price said, depending on the candidates’ skills and “where an institution is in its life cycle.”Generally, however, “in nonprofits there is still a huge difference in resources available in comparison to the corporate sector,” she said.The changing of the guard at museums often brings with it a renewed emphasis on financial stability, particularly at successful regional museums, which rarely have the large endowments bestowed on their urban counterparts.“The director’s job description has metamorphosed over the last decade as museums have grown in size and are increasingly expected to generate their own revenue,” Mrs. Price said. “Obviously, in addition to traditional attributes of connoisseurship and scholarship, candidates for director jobs these days also need to have skills in management, business and other areas like marketing, new technology and, of course, resource gathering, which is more popularly known as fund-raising. And I would probably put this last one top of the list.”During Mrs. Price’s 15-year tenure, the Newark Museum’s operating budget has more than tripled, growing to $18 million from $5.6 million. When she joined the museum, 85 percent of the operating budget came from city and state funding, she said. These days it is closer to 60 percent, and Mrs. Price says she spends about 40 to 50 percent of her time working directly or indirectly on fund-raising activities.Fund-raising and the constant pressure to get more people through the door — audience numbers are an important measure of success, especially for government funding bodies — are responsibilities that directors of regional museums have in common with their counterparts in major cities. But there are significant differences, clustering around issues of scale, staffing levels and community involvement.In general, regional art museums tend to be small to medium in size, with operating budgets of $1 million to $10 million. (As a point of comparison, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has an annual operating budget of $200 million.) They survive from one year to the next on very tight margins, raising money to put on shows with little endowment to fall back on in hard times. They also tend to give priority to programming rather than people, so they are frequently understaffed. Multitasking is common, even among directors. Dr. Neil of the Heckscher said that at one recent fund-raiser he did everything from setting up tables to giving the welcoming speech.But the most striking difference between metropolitan and regional art museums is their relationship to their community. “It tends to be much more organic” in the suburban museums, Mr. Botwinick said, referring to their focus on local audience and outreach.By contrast, tourists and casual visitors tend to form the core metropolitan museum audience.“The people who come to a regional museum are usually from the local area and use it genuinely by choice,” Mr. Botwinick said. “They see it as part of the fabric of the community and often have a sense of ownership over it and certain expectations about what it provides.”Mr. Botwinick believes this kind of relationship to a local community is the best — and the most challenging — aspect of running a regional art museum.“It is about understanding what your place is, what your mission is, and being comfortable with that,” he said. “But it is also about understanding that this goal doesn’t let you off the hook on the highest standards and scholarship. This is not some alternative, dumbed-down version of the real thing. You are part of a national conversation on matters of art and culture, and informed visitors expect the very highest standards.”Ms. Sultan, 55, the new director of the Parrish Museum, who came from the Blaffer Gallery, the Art Museum of the University of Houston, said she wants the Parrish “to be known for strong local ties but also to have a more global outlook.”“I want to be part of a national and global museum network,” she said.However, she said: “To be successful the Parrish has to be a center for community engagement. What matters is how you define community. I’d also like to see us take a leadership role among Long Island museums.”At the Bruce Museum, where the vast majority of visitors are from a 30-mile radius, “we cater very much to the local community and do tailor our offerings,” Dr. Sutton said.“At the same time, we also try to mix things up, with shows ranging from old masters to contemporary art, with research catalogs and loans from collectors and museums,” he said. “It is all about striking the right balance between responsibilities to the community and maintaining a commitment to professional, quality programming.”To meet those standards, many regional art museums have had to be entrepreneurial, partnering with other institutions to make shows happen or drawing on all the talents and connections of the staff and board. Some regional museum directors continue to curate shows, like Harry Philbrick, at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Conn., who spent a recent day trying to organize the manufacture of 50,000 camouflage-colored tennis balls in China for an outdoor installation by Serge Spitzer. He eventually found a factory in Shanghai that could do it for him.“As a noncollecting museum, the Aldrich is focused on exhibitions, so I probably have a bit more contact with art and artists than directors at other museums,” Mr. Philbrick said. “But it is true that a lot of your time is spent doing things that don’t seem to have a lot to do with art.”Despite his busy schedule, Dr. Sutton recently found the time to curate an exhibition at the Bruce devoted to old master works from the collection of Jacques Goudstikker, a Dutch-Jewish art dealer whose gallery was plundered by the Nazis. Given his expertise in Dutch and Baroque art, the show, which opened this month, was a natural fit for Dr. Sutton, who started as a curator of European art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. But even for a show like the Goudstikker, which received $40,000 in a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, he said he spent more time fund-raising than anything else.Ms. Sultan at the Parrish is determined to try to balance her business and art interests. “I have a lot of energy and care very deeply about museum management,” she said. “But I am in this business because I love art, so I try to make sure that one part of every day at work has something to do with art. I am very directed about that.”'"
"'08-05-25,'0','There are many adjectives one can apply to the great musicals by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. But a half-century or so after their creation, “fresh” is not typically the first, or even the last, word that springs to mind.Their wonderful songs seem too familiar, their well-made plots too proficient, their long-accepted innovations too hallowed by history to be called fresh.Yet that is the word that best describes the terrific new production of “Carousel” at Long Wharf. Even the superlative “South Pacific” now at Lincoln Center feels like what it is: a magnificently mounted revival of a classic. The Long Wharf “Carousel,” by contrast, feels like a new show, with lines that have never before been spoken and songs that have never before been sung.That’s not to say that we’re dealing with a radical interpretation here. The director, Charles Newell, has decided on a minimalist approach that emphasizes the gritty lives of the musical’s working-class characters. In this “Carousel,” everyone has an aching back. So Jacqueline Firkins undercuts the show’s usual 19th-century prettiness with no-frills costumes in drab shades of blue and brown. And the set designer, John Culbert, avoids pictorialism altogether, ditching literal references to the show’s bustling fairground and New England docks in favor of a pair of nearly bare curving platforms and an abstract backdrop of wooden slats. Even the musical’s title attraction is imaginary, represented onstage by a single, miniature carousel horse suspended overhead and dramatically lighted by the expert Joshua Horvath.But for all its Brechtian impulses and stripped-down style, this “Carousel” is essentially the one we’ve known since 1945, when the musical adaptation of Ferenc Molnár’s “Liliom” opened on Broadway and dared to break the audience’s heart. It is still about the star-crossed romance between Julie Jordan, the independent-minded mill worker, and Billy Bigelow, the shiftless but captivating carnival barker; it is still about how Billy’s love reaches beyond the grave to heal his angry, aching daughter.The freshness comes from the vivid but unaffected performances of the show’s young, mostly Chicago-based leads (Mr. Newell is the artistic director of the Court Theater in Chicago, where this production originated). It comes from utter simplicity — which in the theater is never simple.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','I left Baghdad almost a year ago after a long tour there. I then spent some months studying Mandarin in Vermont and Taiwan. It was enough time away from work and in bucolic places to allow me to think that when I landed in Beijing in late April to start my new assignment I had put behind me much of the ugliness of the war: morgues filled with corpses shredded by shrapnel, mosques demolished by suicide car bombs, the fear of random death that kept people caged in their homes.Then came the tremor at 2:28 p.m. on May 12. In the following days, making my way through the towns hardest hit by the quake and hearing stories from people like the rescuer Mr. Jiang, I realized that whatever violence people unleash on each other, the wrathful face of nature can be just as cold and lethal and implacable. It too can force ordinary people to confront horrific scenes and to take on the terrible task of triage — deciding who can be saved and who must be consigned to the dead.Beichuan was once a town of 22,000. It is nestled in a river valley between two mountains, and electric-green rice fields line the roads radiating from it.The quake lasted minutes at most, but it left half the town smothered by landslides, swallowing people, cars and entire buildings. Boulders the size of sedans rained down from the mountainsides and crushed residents rushing from their homes. Heads were sheared off. One thousand children were trapped in a middle school collapse.The earthquake placed China on a wartime footing. The afternoon I rode up to Beichuan in the back of a flatbed lorry, three helicopters buzzed overhead while convoys of army trucks passed us. Entire tent villages had sprung up on the sides of the road, some housing the soldiers who would be working here for weeks or months, the others sheltering the thousands of refugees who had hiked, hobbled and crawled from the wreckage of Beichuan.“I saw bodies all the way here,” said Li Yalan, a 24-year-old computer specialist now sleeping on blankets with her family in a stadium in Mianyang. “I made my way on top of the bodies. On the night of the earthquake, because the rescue teams didn’t come, parents used flashlights to search for their children. I saw people being rescued, but because they were bleeding so heavily, I watched them die right in front of me.”The lorry dropped us off near the debris of the middle school. No one knew for certain whether any of the children were still alive. No one had time to dwell on it. The area had become a staging post for thousands of rescue workers in hard hats and orange suits, and soldiers from the People’s Liberation Army. It felt like downtown Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks.The soldiers, teenagers really, just like the Americans I had met in Iraq, stood at attention while being sprayed with disinfectant. Few had ever seen a dead body before. They marched off with shovels and pickaxes into a town littered with thousands of corpses.They must have known, from the tremors we felt, that aftershocks and continual landslides were killing hundreds of road and rescue workers.Teams like these were making tough choices all across the earthquake zone. Whom to save, whom to ignore. One evening, a friend of mine, a French photographer, watched as a rescue crew pulled a sulfur-factory worker from the ruins of a five-story workers’ club in a nearby town. Everyone clapped. Then they quieted down and listened: Was there someone else alive in there?The head of the rescue team said no.A woman began crying, saying a waitress was still alive in the rubble. It turned out that the factory worker, while trapped earlier, had spoken to the waitress through a wall dividing them. “Please make sure I get out tonight, too,” the waitress had pleaded.But just like that, the rescue workers stopped digging that night, insisting no one else was down there.They reversed their decision the next morning, for whatever reason. And what did they find in the debris but the waitress, still breathing.In Beichuan, rescue teams concentrated their efforts more on the town and less on the villages higher in the mountains. Maybe it was the right call. Maybe more people were saved that way. But I met one team from Guizhou Province that had rescued seven elderly people from villages earlier in the day.It was late afternoon when they brought an eighth survivor down. He was a wiry old man strapped to a wooden stretcher. The workers had slipped a surgical mask over his mouth. His son had found him lying amid the rubble of his home the day before, and had gone into Beichuan to get a rescue team.“Some of my friends died, some were injured, some are still living,” said the man, Hu Mingchun, 70. “The ones who are dead, I can’t find them.”Thousands would probably never be found in Beichuan and the neighboring villages. In Iraq, I had seen single buildings — a mosque, a hotel, an army outpost — flattened by car bombs or missiles. In this town, it was block after block of buildings, all leveled, all grave sites. Red paper lanterns fluttered from the crumbled facade of one restaurant.Atop piles of rubble were photo albums and baby strollers and a pink teddy bear.Few survivors were being found anymore. The people dug up now were mostly being zipped up in plastic bags and brought to three outdoor collection points in town. There, forensic scientists pried molars from them or sliced off swatches of skin or cartilage for DNA identification. If the day was hot and if the wind blew the wrong way, the stench carried through town.The bodies were dumped in a burial pit near what remained of police headquarters.Li Yingbi had seen his share of crime scenes and fatal accidents in 24 years of forensics work, but he shook his head when trying to describe what he felt while in Beichuan.“I can’t say; it’s too complicated,” he said. “We have to go on, and we have to be strong and determined.”People tried to save whatever they could. One survivor walked out of town carrying a washing machine in a basket on his back. The man behind him had a television set in his basket. A farmer returning to look at his home told me he had found some pigs still alive and fed them corn. He wanted to come back for them in five or six days.Walking out of town, I saw a brown puppy follow three soldiers. It had a red ribbon around its neck. Its owner was likely dead. It yapped at the soldiers. They told it to go away.It turned and began following us. My driver, Mr. Yu, found a length of cable and tied it around the puppy’s neck. By the week’s end, workers driving heavy machinery would begin razing the remaining buildings in town. Government officials said no one would ever live here again.Night was falling when we walked the puppy out of the valley.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','It’s helpful to look more closely at why the invisible hand works so well in many ordinary markets. Consider the market for potatoes: in it, production and consumption are determined by millions of separate cost-benefit calculations. Profit-seeking sellers are willing to offer an additional pound of potatoes for sale whenever the benefit of doing so — as measured by what buyers are willing to pay — is enough to cover the cost of production.The market reaches equilibrium when the cost of producing the last pound is exactly equal to its value. If the costs incurred directly by sellers are the only relevant costs of expanding potato production, and if the benefits to potato buyers are the only relevant benefits, the invisible hand gets things just right.The production and consumption of many other goods, however, generate costs or benefits that fall on people besides buyers and sellers. Producing an extra gallon of gasoline, for example, generates not just additional costs to producers, but also pollution costs that fall on others. As before, market forces cause production to expand until the seller’s direct cost for the last unit sold is exactly the value of that unit to the buyer. But because each gallon of gasoline also generates external pollution costs, the total cost of that last gallon produced is higher than its value to consumers.The upshot is that gasoline consumption is inefficiently high. Suppose that pollution costs are $2 for the last gallon consumed, but that its $4 price at the pump is just enough to cover its direct production costs. Reducing production and consumption by a gallon would then cause consumers to lose fuel that they value at $4, which would be exactly offset by the $4 in reduced production costs. The $2 in reduced pollution costs would thus be a net gain for society.That simple example captures the classic breakdown in the invisible hand when a product’s market price doesn’t reflect all its relevant social costs and benefits. In such cases, the simplest solution is to discourage consumption by taxing it.Doing so would not only raise revenue to pay for public services; it would also make the allocation of society’s resources more efficient — hence economists’ almost universal dismay when Senators John McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton recently proposed eliminating the federal tax on gasoline for the summer.The stated aim of their proposal was to ease the financial burden of sharply higher gasoline prices. But adopting inefficient policies is never the best way to help people in financial distress.Efficiency is important because any policy that enlarges the economic pie necessarily lets everyone have a bigger slice than before. Economists opposed suspending the gas tax because doing so would make the economic pie smaller.Of course, when millions of voters feel the pinch of rapidly rising prices, politicians find it hard to stand idly by. But as the late economist Abba Lerner once remarked, the main problem confronting the poor is that they have too little money. The best solution is not to reduce the prices they pay, but rather to bolster their incomes — for example, by selectively reducing the payroll tax for low-income workers or increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit.Suspending the gas tax would encourage rich and poor alike to do more summer driving. It would also promote sales of fuel-intensive vehicles. Because the gas tax reduces waste, it actually makes more resources available to help low-income families.Gasoline is one of a host of goods whose production or consumption generates costs that fall on outsiders. Noisy goods, like leaf blowers, for example, can jolt whole neighborhoods from calm. And goods that don’t biodegrade readily, like many plastic bags, can generate costly waste streams. The list goes on.THAT the invisible hand often breaks down is actually good news. After all, we need to tax something to pay for public services. By taxing forms of consumption that generate negative side effects, we could not only generate enough revenue to eliminate budget deficits, but also help steer resources toward their most highly valued uses.Because such taxes make the economy more efficient, it makes no sense to object that they impose hardships on low-income families. Again, an efficient policy is one that maximizes the size of the economic pie. And with a bigger pie, it’s always possible for everyone to get a bigger slice.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','A. Very funny. The 93-year-old former courthouse, at Third Avenue and 161st Street in the Melrose neighborhood, was vacated in the 1970s but is to become a charter school this fall. In the center of the Beaux-Arts south facade, Justice sits regally between two pillars, seeing all.The statue, made of Tennessee marble, is by G. E. Roine.Asked about the absence of a blindfold, the Bronx borough historian, Lloyd Ultan, said, “Nobody knows why,” but he mentioned a coincidence: The Bronx County Building, erected in the 1930s about 10 blocks west at 161st Street and the Grand Concourse, has steps flanked by huge sculptured blocks. Next to the steps that lead to the 161st Street entrance is a high-relief sculpture of Justice, who, Mr. Ultan said, is also not blindfolded.Mr. Ultan said the sculptured blocks were attributed to a consortium of four sculptors under Adolph A. Weinman, a noted sculptor in his day.Then the historian couldn’t resist offering a conclusion: “When it comes to Bronx justice, you’ve got to keep your eyes open.”Q. For the last year or more, something big has been under construction on both sides of the upper-level roadway of the Queensboro Bridge. It appears to be huge circular air ducts. They seem to be made of metal too thin to protect the bridge from terrorists. What is their purpose?A. You’re looking at some careful lead-paint removal.The city’s Department of Transportation has been cleaning and repainting the structural steel of the bridge’s main spans and approaches. The removal of old paint and the repainting are performed in segments and are scheduled to be finished next January, said Craig Chin, a spokesman for the department.Following federal, state and city environmental rules, the removal of the lead-based paint is done in a sealed containment system under negative pressure. That means that any air leak would flow into the chamber, not out. The chambers are the circular structures you see.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','Lobbying experts also say there are other gaps in the campaign’s lobbying guidelines. Lobbyists can try to influence lawmakers on behalf of corporate and other clients without registering, as long as the time they spend doing so does not exceed a specified threshold. They are also often not required to register if lobbying overseas on behalf of foreign politicians or companies.“Influential people with fat Rolodexes can in effect lobby without having to register,” said Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan center that studies money in politics.In recent years, for instance, Mr. Davis’s business partner, Paul J. Manafort, has met with the United States ambassador in Ukraine, a time when he was advising Viktor Yanukovich, that country’s onetime prime minister, a State Department official said. Mr. Yanukovich’s party was opposed by both the Bush administration and Mr. McCain because it was closely tied to Vladimir Putin.If Mr. Manafort had met with United States officials in this country on behalf of the Ukrainian politician, he would have had to register. But some meetings abroad are not covered, several legal experts said.Mr. Davis, who worked as deputy campaign manager in Bob Dole’s 1996 presidential campaign, has been a registered lobbyist for telecommunications companies like SBC Communications, Comsat and Verizon. Some of his other registered clients have included Deutsche Post World Net USA, the giant cargo concern, and GTech, a worldwide lottery firm.Mr. McCain’s campaign said Mr. Davis still retains a stake in his lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, but is not receiving profits from it.But a look at Mr. Davis’s activities surrounding Imagesat shows how the business ties and financial interests of lobbyists can be complex.Back in early 2004, Mr. Davis and Mr. Manafort started discussing becoming consultants with Pegasus Capital, based in Cos Cob, Conn. Not long afterward, the two men were providing advice to Pegasus about governmental matters that might affect companies in which the firm had invested and also suggested investment targets. The firm has never retained Davis Manafort as a lobbyist.In late 2004, however, Mr. Davis became a registered lobbyist for Imagesat. He gained the account through a recommendation from Pegasus, which holds a stake in the company, said a person knowledgeable about the investment firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Davis said he found the firm without Pegasus’s help.Davis Manafort received $120,000 from late 2004 to mid-2005 to lobby for Imagesat on both defense and domestic security issues. Mr. Davis and Christian Ferry, now Mr. McCain’s deputy campaign manager, were the two lobbyists on the project, the records show.Early in 2005, Mr. Davis tried to develop another relationship with Pegasus when he and two other men suggested that it help bankroll a proposed new private equity firm. That firm was to focus on investments in domestic security companies, including those that vied for federal contracts, the person knowledgeable about Pegasus said.A draft proposal for the new firm described Mr. Davis as a power player among Washington influence brokers.“For the last three decades in the White House, Congress, federal agencies and politics both here and abroad Rick has operated at the highest level of decision and deal making,” according to a copy of that proposal reviewed by The New York Times.Along with his work as a lobbyist, Mr. Davis at the time was also drawing a salary as the part-time president of the Reform Institute, a Washington group that Mr. McCain helped found to reduce “the influence of special interests” in politics and government.The proposed firm never took off. But Pegasus also offered another opportunity to advisers, like Mr. Davis and Mr. Manafort, who worked with it — the chance to get in on some of its investments. In November 2005, Pegasus bought a stake in a company called Traxys, which trades in industrial metals.In January 2006, just two months later, the subject of metals trading came up in association with a social meeting Mr. Davis helped arrange near Davos, Switzerland. At that meeting, first reported by The Washington Post, Mr. McCain met the Russian aluminum magnate, Oleg Deripaska, who has been barred from entering the United States apparently because of alleged criminal ties.After the event, Mr. Deripaska sent a brief thank-you note to Mr. Davis and Mr. Manafort. In it, he said, “Please will you send me the information on the metals trading company we discussed and would be happy to see if I can do anything to help.”In written responses to questions, Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, said that “Mr. Davis did not approach Mr. Deripaska” about any metals trading company. Mr. Bounds said Mr. Davis retained investments he made during the time he advised Pegasus, a relationship that ended in 2006. He said Mr. Davis declined to disclose whether Traxys was one of them because he considered the investments a private matter.A spokesman for Pegasus said it was unaware of the letter from Mr. Deripaska and had had no business dealings with him. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska said he had never hired Davis Manafort. Mr. Manafort did not return phone calls.Davis Manafort has worked for other overseas clients for whom it did not have to register, including the richest man in Ukraine, Rinat Akhmetov. One Mr. Akhmetov’s companies, SCM Holdings, hired the firm to help it develop a corporate communication strategy, a spokesman for Mr. Akhmetov said. That relationship lasted until September 2005.Mr. Akhmetov was the principal financial backer of Mr. Yanukovich, the Ukranian politician for whom Davis Manafort has also worked.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','WHAT price glory? It could be more than $100 million.At 15 Central Park West, perhaps the most successful development of the decade, there is still a clamor for long-since sold-out condominiums, especially glorious trophy apartments with sweeping terraces overlooking Central Park.But while the developers, Arthur and William Lie Zeckendorf, are still finishing the last batch of apartments, as well as the gymnasium, pool and other amenities, brokers and owners are struggling to figure out just what the apartments are worth on the resale market.The first batch of resales at 15 Central Park West went into contract last December and January, almost as soon as they became available. In the last few weeks, a new crop has come on the market at higher prices. Two high-floor two-bedrooms, however, quickly cut their prices — one to $13 million from $15 million, another to $12.5 million from $14 million — shortly before a similar apartment came on the market at a lower price.Michel Madie, who runs an independent brokerage company in Manhattan, says the building is still in its infancy, having opened only last summer, which makes pricing something of a guessing game. “It is still at birth,” he said, “and it is difficult to assess where the price will settle” once the “cocoon of services” at the building is completed.Mr. Madie is asking $21 million for a three-bedroom on the 36th floor with more than 2,700 square feet of space and park views, or about $7,600 a square foot, which would make it one of the most expensive apartments per square foot ever sold.Other brokers are showing two-bedrooms on high floors with good views for under $5,500 a square foot. Mr. Madie is hoping to find a buyer interesting in combining his condo with the two-bedroom next door, which is on the market for $12.75 million, listed by Roger Erickson of Sotheby’s International Realty.'"
"'08-05-25,'0','I can’t even tell you how many times per day I field a question about my tattoos. Or, actually, I can: about five. Coming up with a thousand witty variations on the response to ‘‘Did it hurt?’’ is just part of the bargain when you start getting big tattoos. But these days, I mostly just stick to ‘‘yes’’ or ‘‘not as much as getting waxed.’’For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been trying with a degree of success that’s surprised me not to think of Jake at all. And when I do, I usually make myself think of negative things. But as I was walking home from the pool today, in the blinding sun with just a hint of chill in the air, I let myself remember the innocence and happiness of our first kisses, him ardent as a teenager, me trembling with uncertainty and excitement. And then the stolen kisses in alleyways, the thrill of those furtive weeks. It was so good when it was good, and the reasons why it was good, while more apparent now, don’t matter so much. Who cares that his appeal was artificially enhanced, the same way a stale Balthazar croissant becomes the world’s most delicious treat if you eat it after a morning of hard swimming? The satisfaction, in the moment, is the same.Like I said, I’m not good at writing about sex, or maybe no one is. But the way I feel about last night is the way I felt about bacon after I started eating meat again after 10 years of vegetarianism. Which was: I wanted everyone to understand how important, how absolutely essential, bacon is. I wanted to tell people about bacon. I actually did tell people, several times. ‘‘Have you had bacon? It’s like a potato chip made out of meat!’’ Bacon. Man, bacon is delicious!WHY DO OTHERWISE NORMAL GIRLS REFUSE TO GO DUTCH?Last night I almost made a gossip columnist drop her drink in horror with a single sentence. Luckily we were on the roof of 60 Thompson, which is such a classy establishment that the drinks are served in plastic tumblers, so no harm would’ve been done, but my gossipy friend’s gasp drew the attention of another woman in our group, who asked me to repeat the shocking thing I’d said. She, too, did a double take. ‘‘You let a man allow you to pay for your own dinner on the first date, and you’re seeing him again?’’ ‘‘I just . . . I went for my wallet, and he didn’t stop me,’’ I told them. ‘‘I didn’t mind! I like paying for myself.’’ What time capsule are these women living in? Why on earth would you want to feel beholden to a dude for any reason? Sure, free things are nice, but not when they come wrapped in cultural assumptions that men are the wage earners and women are their cossetted pets. What makes women feel like being asked to pay their own way is an insult?WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS?Today I got my ear holes stretched two sizes bigger. I’ve been slowly stretching them for about eight months now with no clear idea of why. Stretching one size bigger only twinges for a second but two sizes hurts, and right now they are still dully throbbing. I wonder wonder wonder why there’s a part of me that seeks out pain. It’s not that I enjoy pain! Pain, you know, hurts. I think it’s more about mastery of pain. I enjoy pain as long as I am in control of the pain, or I think that I am. And it’s this maybe-misguided impulse that compels me to do other things besides poke holes in myself. Like, for example: put big chunks of my ‘‘personal, private’’ life on the Internet for anyone to see. Maybe it makes me feel safe to think that if I tell you all my secrets you won’t have any ammo against me that I haven’t given you. Maybe it’s that I think that my pain and my pleasure are just that important. Maybe I just like telling. Part of it, certainly, is that I don’t want to have these thoughts and feelings inside me. I want to get them out.‘‘I’m going to try to never write about you,’’ I whispered to the boy whose shoulder my head was on two nights ago. Oops. Well, here’s the thing, though! One of the hundreds of incredibly good reasons I’ve been so wary of letting myself feel the feelings I’ve been feeling for this boy I’ve been seeing is: I don’t know if I can be with someone and still write these kinds of things. I’ve always had this problem. I think it’s pretty common.'"

"'08-05-26,'0','For years, officials in New Jersey have talked about the need for more affordable housing and then done almost nothing. The need is pressing, and the state may finally be ready to move. Unfortunately, this newfound resolve carries serious risks. Unless the state changes its current plan, some of the new housing will be built on the few parcels of undeveloped land that still remain. That must not be allowed to happen.The conflict between two competing and legitimate needs — low- and moderate-income housing and breathing room — is a national problem. Anyone who drives into rural areas of Pennsylvania, New York and other northeastern states is struck by the number of houses mushrooming on what just a few years ago were huge stretches of farmland.Under New Jersey’s plan, which could take effect in October, one unit of affordable housing would have to be built for every five units of market-rate housing. The current required ratio is one for every eight. Commercial developers, meanwhile, would be required to provide one new affordable housing unit for every 16 jobs generated by commercial development. Both requirements could go a long way toward meeting the state’s need for at least 115,000 new affordable housing units.The downside is that the rules will put more pressure on rural towns to build housing: assigning them an “obligation” for new affordable units within their borders. That makes little economic sense. Many small towns offer no real job opportunities and no public transportation to places where the jobs exist.There would be other pressures. As now happens in the suburbs, builders could use a rural town’s affordable-housing obligation as cover for winning approval of projects containing many market-priced homes.The plan will also make it difficult for remote communities to shift their obligations to cities and suburbs that want more housing and can also provide jobs.'"
"'08-05-26,'0','SEDONA, Ariz. — James Wadsworth used to be a groundskeeper at Senator John McCain’s ranch near here. But on Sunday, he traded pruning shears for a digital camera, waiting for a glimpse of Mr. McCain, who spent the weekend entertaining a group of guests, including a few said to be potential running mates, at his secluded property.“I thought I did pretty good for my first day as a paparazzi,” said Mr. Wadsworth, 43, who showed a photo he took for his own scrapbook of Mr. McCain riding in his sport-utility vehicle wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap.Mr. Wadsworth snapped his photo from a makeshift dirt parking lot across from the windy, unpaved road that leads to Mr. McCain’s retreat. He joined a handful of reporters and camera crews that were staking out the gathering, trying to discern something — anything — about the activities of Mr. McCain and his high-profile houseguests.Among those who spent the holiday weekend at the ranch were Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, and Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who had challenged Mr. McCain for the Republican nomination. All three have been talked about as possible vice-presidential candidates.Meg Whitman, the former eBay executive who has been mentioned as a potential dark-horse candidate for the job, was also here.'"
"'08-05-26,'0','And it is true: most operas do not have acrobats playing crustaceans in shopping carts juggling parasols with their feet, or extended fight sequences like Hong Kong kung-fu movies, or contortionists wrapping their legs around their heads. And most circuses do not have pit orchestras, a narrative or opera singers.The score is a mix of hip-hop beats, washes of electronic sound, dissonant brass fanfares, sweet Chinese pop melodies and percussive effects. Ten vocalists sing in Mandarin with Chinese opera inflection. There is little dialogue. The heavy amplification made it difficult to tell who was singing at times, or whether the voices were even coming from the stage.The show was a hit when it first played, at the Manchester International Festival in England last year, and the creators have high hopes of cloning it in commercial sites and other opera houses, particularly in Asia. On Saturday night the audience was somewhat tentative, not quite sure whether to applaud after a particularly stunning circus routine. And the opera’s presence on Spoleto’s calendar did not receive a completely enthusiastic response.Good programming “doesn’t necessarily represent the tastes of the team doing the programming,” said Emmanuel Villaume, the festival’s orchestra and opera director.“There is an incredible entertainment value of ‘Monkey,’ ” he said. “The music is an accompaniment for the visual effects. I won’t say more. People who know about these things say it’s a good score.”But he said the fact that Spoleto was giving “Monkey” its American premiere made it a welcome addition, and it is drawing a diverse audience. “It’s doing the job we want it to do,” he said.Its presence has also done something else: It has brought a genuine pop-culture celebrity to Charleston, someone easily recognizable to a younger crowd. (Mr. Albarn became a favorite among the college students at the gelato shop across from the theater, where he would repair to watch British soccer games.) Rarely do festival participants have musicians like Mr. Albarn, whose record sales number in the five-million-plus range.But Mr. Albarn is taking a break from that world. Working on “Monkey,” he said, has taught him about orchestration, and he is working on another “classical” piece, which he calls a tone poem. The chance to make musical works longer than a pop song is liberating, he said.“It’s definitely changed my course,” he said. “I love being the author of stuff now,” he said.“I just want to keep doing things that take longer to listen to, that doesn’t just happen in three minutes.” His compositional technique involves creating demo tapes or sitting at a keyboard and playing a passage, which an orchestrator then expands upon and notates.For “Monkey,” he said, he created a system to spin out lines of the pentatonic scale’s five notes organically. To demonstrate he drew a five-pointed star and assigned numbers to each point. The numbers stood for notes. Then he started the numbering at different points on the star, creating a sequence of numbers at each. Some passages were built from those kinds of sequences.The production was born when Jean-Luc Choplin, director of the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, and Mr. Chen discussed the possibility of a new production. Mr. Chen said he had long wanted to do an opera about the Monkey story, and when the idea appeared possible, he traveled back to China as much as possible for inspiration. (He has lived in New York since leaving China in the late 1980s.) He was introduced to Mr. Albarn and Mr. Hewlett, who themselves were fans of the cult-hit “Monkey” live-action show from Japan that was on British television in the 1980s.The men made long trips to China together. Mr. Albarn recorded sounds, and Mr. Hewlett made sketches. Mr. Chen scouted circuses and found the “very young, very hip kids” he needed in Dalian, the port city in northeast China. Most of the singers are young graduates of Chinese conservatories who studied either Chinese opera techniques or music theater singing or both.Mr. Chen said he knew he couldn’t use Western classical music. “It’s a story children love,” he said. “The instrumentation has to be very eccentric. The monkey is like a boy. It has to be a boy’s sound.”The characters were shaped by Mr. Hewlett’s cartoon sketches, and the opera essentially turns animated characters into live ones. Makeup for some of them takes more than two hours. Before Saturday night’s performance, the Monkey, Li Bo, sat in a chair having white and red makeup applied to his face. He got up and mugged for the mirror. Mr. Li was supposed to take on performances later in the run, but the main Monkey, Fei Yang, suffered an injury the night before: one of many mishaps because of the elaborate action, Mr. Chen said. A practitioner of Chinese medicine and a Chinese masseuse are on hand for the run.Describing his ambitions for the show to clone itself, Mr. Chen, watching the makeup application, said, “I think we have to have a Monkey training camp.”'"
"'08-05-26,'0','Big Brown’s smooth path to a potential Triple Crown sweep was spoiled Sunday when his trainer, Rick Dutrow, revealed that the colt had sustained a quarter crack on the inside of his left front hoof.Big Brown, the undefeated Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner, who has a history of sore feet, has not been to the racetrack to gallop since Friday, when Dutrow sensed something was amiss. He saw a small spot on Big Brown’s foot Friday afternoon and summoned the hoof specialist Ian McKinlay to Belmont Park later that night. By Saturday, the spot had turned into a slight quarter crack, or a stress fracture of the hoof wall, about five-eighths of an inch long.Dutrow insists that this is a minor setback and that Big Brown will be in excellent shape for the Belmont Stakes on June 7 and for an opportunity to become the 12th Triple Crown champion, and the first since Affirmed in 1978. He is expected to meet as many as eight challengers in what is known as the Test of the Champion, a grueling mile-and-a-half marathon. “If the race was today, yesterday or tomorrow, this would not be an issue and he’d run,” Dutrow said Sunday morning at Belmont Park. “We’re all concerned with a big race coming up, but it’s better that it happened now.”He added: “It’s not going to be an issue. It’s bad that it happened, but we’re going to be able to fix him up. The amount of training he is missing is nothing. He is going to be ready to roll.”McKinlay said Big Brown’s hoof should be healed by Thursday at the latest. McKinlay is treating the injury with an iodine and alcohol solution. When he is certain that the crack is clean and that any chance of infection has passed, he will close the crack in the hoof wall with wire stitches perhaps as early as Monday.He said the injury was nothing like the ones Big Brown sustained last fall and over the winter. Those injuries sidelined him for nearly three months. Last September, Big Brown developed an abscess in the sole of his left front hoof that caused a wall separation and kept him idle for 45 days. He had the same injury in his right front hoof in December and did not train in January.'"
"'08-05-26,'0','But this encounter, which Kuerten insisted was the last of his career in singles, never quite turned the corner from feeling like an exhibition to feeling like a Grand Slam match.“Of course it wasn’t easy, because I sensed that I was going to win, so it was tough to stay concentrated,” Mathieu, the 18th seed, said. “You start imagining the end. But I think he played a few beautiful points, so I hope he was happy.”Kuerten, a Brazilian, won the French Open in 1997, 2000 and 2001. But he has not been a threat to win since 2004, when he knocked off Roger Federer before reaching the quarterfinals. His only reason for requesting a wild card at age 31, he said, was that he wanted the luxury of “one more little pleasure.”Did he get what he came for, despite the tears that he shed after his last backhand, a drop shot, had hit the net?“I think I’m very satisfied, especially with the memories that are going to stick with me from this match,” Kuerten said. “I thought I played much better than I expected, and there wasn’t a single shot I didn’t make. I played forehand, backhands, serve, drop shots, volley. I did everything I think I was able to do in the past, just not with the same frequency. But at least I had the feeling to do it once more.”In Kuerten’s glory years, the French Open did not start on Sundays. In this year’s edition, 32 matches were played Sunday, with only the occasional upset. The qualifier Eduardo Schwank defeated Carlos Moyà, the No. 16 seed who won the 1998 French Open, 7-6 (4), 6-2, 6-7 (1), 4-6, 6-3.In the women’s draw, second-seeded Ana Ivanovic and No. 5 Serena Williams advanced in straight sets. Williams defeated Ashley Harkleroad, 6-2, 6-1, but tennis has not been Harkleroad’s primary concern of late. During the Sony Ericcson Open in Miami in March, she was rushed to the hospital after losing her third-round match. A cyst on her right ovary had ruptured, causing internal bleeding; the ovary was removed, and she was hospitalized for four days.“I was pretty depressed for like three weeks,” she said. “I was afraid I wasn’t going to be able to have kids and this and that. But I’m going to be able to, so it’s going to be all good.”The men’s No. 3 seed, Novak Djokovic, lost his opening set against Denis Gremelmayr before taking control in a 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2 victory. No. 7 James Blake defeated Rainer Schüttler, 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (3). Blake, ranked eighth in the world, is the top men’s player from the United States at this tournament after Andy Roddick withdrew last week because of an injured right shoulder.That already makes this a better French Open than last year for the American men, who failed to win a singles match.“We set the bar low enough that we’re over the bar by 3 on Sunday afternoon,” Blake said. “We all feel like last year was an aberration that should never happen again.”Kuerten no longer needs to strive for tennis improvement. But he had pushed himself particularly hard in the weeks leading to Roland Garros, training with his longtime coach Larri Passos. On Sunday, he served convincingly and hit a world-class backhand. But winning a set proved too much. His lateral movement was not what it used to be, and neither was his consistency.But Kuerten said that he would not remember the errors, but he would remember the atmosphere — the standing ovation he received as he walked on the court, the Brazilian flags being waved, the frequent chants of his nickname, Guga, that greeted his winners and even his struggles.“This particular tournament is really like home for me,” he said.Afterward, it was time for the tears, time to receive a final trophy, in the form of a cross section of a clay court.Not many first-round losers receive a prize, but then not many players burst into the light by winning their first Grand Slam title when they are ranked 66th in the world, then make the precipitous climb to the top.“One stage of my career was very successful, and I was able to get all the goals that I could, then the second part was really tough,” Kuerten said. “But in the same way, it was important to live these years, to grow as a person, to understand what it is to have other things to deal with. So I guess, like that, for me there’s no regrets at all, just big knowledge.”'"
"'08-05-26,'0','While “The Paper” documented the adrenaline rushes of chasing after news and meeting deadlines, it also devoted ample screen time to behind-the-scenes conflicts among the students at The Circuit and the friendships that were tested or broken by its demanding environment. Ms. Lorber came in for particularly rough treatment; her colleagues at the paper were frequently shown on camera making critical or nasty comments about her behind her back. Ms. Lorber said that tensions at The Circuit were not exacerbated by the presence of MTV. “We were that passionate before the cameras came, and we’re that passionate now,” she said. “If you had seen our last deadline, you would have seen that.”She said she was not surprised that “The Paper” placed so much emphasis on the in-fighting and unraveling of friendships, nor did she find it uncomfortable to relive these experiences when the show was broadcast. “Once I’ve come to terms with everything that’s happened on the show, it’s not hard for me to think about other people seeing it,” Ms. Lorber said. “I agreed to broadcast my junior year and my senior year on camera. It comes with the territory.”What did sadden her, Ms. Lorber said, were the harsh rebukes she received from print and Internet journalists who wrote about “The Paper.” In a review of the show, Newsday called Ms. Lorber a “pushy suck-up,” while Slate.com wrote that “her behavior is so unyieldingly superior that she’s an absolute delight to hate.”For Ms. Lorber these cutting critiques felt like rejections from the very people whose industry she wanted to promote, and who she someday hoped would be her professional peers. “It was really very upsetting at first,” she said, “because I thought of all people to degrade my character, I wouldn’t have thought it would be the journalists to do it.”Dave Sirulnick, an executive producer of “The Paper” who is also in charge of MTV’s news and documentary division, said that MTV tried to be attentive to the sensitivities of its high-school-age stars and took additional precautions in preparing the show, obtaining the permission of the school board and the parents of all the featured students.What MTV hoped the series would convey, Mr. Sirulnick said, was a lesson that would transcend teenage pettiness, and be relevant to anyone who has experienced a high-pressure workplace. “Sometimes it gets even harder after you’ve achieved what you wanted,” he said. “Sometimes the politics come into play, and the ambitiousness of others as well as yourself.”Mr. Sirulnick said that under the right circumstances high school students can be appropriate subjects for reality television shows. “I do think there are some people who will handle things better than others,” he said, adding that such determinations depend on the show, “the casting process, and in carefully picking a group of students.”For her part Ms. Lorber said that positive developments had come out of her experience on “The Paper.” She said that she had received numerous e-mail messages of support from students around the country, some of whom were persuaded to join their schools’ newspapers after watching the show.Her early forays into the self-cannibalizing world of journalism, she said, had not discouraged her interest in the field. Articles that she wrote for the paper about the circulation of counterfeit money at Cypress Bay and the proposed federal Dream Act (for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), which would help expedite the citizenship process for children of illegal immigrants, helped her and The Circuit win honors in county and state student-journalism competitions this year.And Ms. Lorber said she planned to continue studying journalism this fall when she becomes a freshman at New York University.Already, she said, she has become a popular addition to the Facebook pages of many N.Y.U. students, and is something of a campus celebrity even though she is not yet on campus — at least according to one of Ms. Lorber’s friends who recently visited N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business.“He came back and told me that I’m already well known there,” she said. “I was really worried because I don’t know what that means. If ‘well known’ implies ‘well liked,’ then that’s cool.”'"
"'08-05-26,'0','BAGHDAD — As some semblance of normal life began to return to the Sadr City area on Sunday, the Iraqi government and followers of the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr accused each other of being weak. The verbal sniping occurred despite a cease-fire that had finally brought calm to one of Baghdad’s most volatile areas.Mr. Sadr’s followers asserted that Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki was not fully in control of his own military. But a top Iraqi military spokesman dismissed their claims, saying that Mr. Sadr’s militia, the Mahdi Army, had been beaten back in all its major strongholds.The salvos came as American military officials said the number of overall attacks throughout Iraq had fallen to its lowest weekly level since March 2004. Because some previous declines proved to be short-lived, American officials were cautious, conceding that Sunni Arab insurgents remained a very lethal threat.The decline in attacks came after a truce ended two months of violence in Sadr City, a troubled Shiite district in Baghdad, and after operations in two other major cities, Basra in the south and Mosul in the north.Sheik Salman al-Fraiji, the head of Mr. Sadr’s office in east Baghdad, accused the military of violating the terms of the cease-fire. Iraqi soldiers and police officers have continued to arrest Shiite militiamen and carry out raids and seizures across Sadr City and the rest of Baghdad.'"

I can pick up anywhere close to transportation.” Or “Promised: Pentel refill erasers.” Or “Offer. A Lego set from the ’70s; not in best shape, though some do still fit.”Some do still fit? Exactly how many are we talking?Future anthropologists trying to determine the values of postmillennial New York could examine one week on Freecycle Brooklyn and glean volumes about the culture. (“Wanted. MP3 player. I am nothing without one!”) Such anthropologists will make what they will of a glut of Epson printers and aquariums, and unceasing demand for Snap-N-Go baby strollers.Studying the borough, they might draw elaborate connections between the wheatgrass juicer and Darth Vader mask requested last week and the 100 journals of the National Association of Social Workers offered during the same time period.But it’s as much the popularity of the site as its contents that says something about Freecycle Brooklyn, in particular. Its numbers reflect a certain (sometimes self-conscious) pride in community, combined with a D.I.Y. aesthetic in which frugality, eco-consciousness and creativity merge or are merely mistaken for each other, depending on the perspective. There are more a few hundred more Freecyclers in Brooklyn than in all of Los Angeles, which seems entirely predictable.Among the Brooklyn postings lie hidden snips of poetry: “Please contact me if you have something small, bright and yellow.” An artist working on an installation posted that cry for help.All over Brooklyn, one can imagine people looking up from their desks to notice a pencil, a stray magnet, an oversize button, all small, bright and yellow, no longer mere detritus, suddenly all creative inspiration. Intended or not, her installation is more like performance art, making unwitting artistic collaborators out of volunteers.Someone logging on in hopes of snaring one of those hot Snap-N-Gos might easily get hooked into a regular habit, scouring the borough’s Freecycle site not for a free air-conditioner, but for its telegraphic tales of the city: the new bicycle messenger who’s desperate to find a bike before his first day of work in just a few days; or the woman willing to travel across the borough for a pair of used running sneakers, preferably not too used; or someone seeking, mysteriously, any and every possible hair product, including but not limited to pomade.At 10 minutes to midnight on Thursday, 12 cans of Glowmaster butane fuel were offered for the taking. By 8:10 the next morning, they’d been fought for, divvied, the news of their new ownership already posted. Desire, competition — they never rest.The neighborhood yard sales that pop up all Memorial Day weekend are social, and have the promise of serendipity, but are ultimately inefficient.

"'08-05-27,'1','For much of our history, the world considered the United States a young country. Today, we are the world's oldest constitutional democracy, yet we remain a young nation. We still possess the attributes of youth: spirit, energy, vitality, and creativity. America will always be young as long as we're looking forward and leading to a better world.Innovative and energetic American leadership is as vital to the world's future today as it was during the Cold War. I've spent my life in public service working to ensure our great nation is strong enough to counter those who wish us ill. To be an effective leader in the 21st century, however, it's not enough to be strong. We must be a model for others. That means not only pursuing our own interests but recognizing that we share interests with peoples across our planet.There's no such thing (sic) as good international citizenship, and America must be a good citizen of the world -- leading the way to address the danger of global warming and preserve our environment, strengthening existing international institutions and helping to build new ones, and engaging the world in a broad dialogue on the threat of violent extremists, who would, if they could, use weapons of mass destruction to attack us and our allies.Today we also need to apply our spirit of optimism, energy, and innovation to a crisis that's been building for decades but is now coming to a head: the global spread of nuclear weapons. Forty-five years ago, President John Kennedy asked the American people to imagine what the world would look like if nuclear weapons spread beyond the few powers that then held them to the many other nations that sought them. ""Stop and think for a moment,"" he said, ""what it would mean to have nuclear weapons in so many hands, in the hands of countries large and small, stable and unstable --SENATOR MCCAIN: You know, it's not too important, but I have town hall meetings all the time -- I'll be having one tomorrow -- where people are allowed to come and state their views and we exchange them. And the one thing we don't do is interfere with other people's right to free speech. (Applause.) But that doesn't seem to be the case with these -- with these people.But anyway, if I could get back to Jack Kennedy, a second. (Laughter.)Kennedy's warning resonates more today than ever before. North Korea pursues a nuclear weapons program to the point where, today, the dictator Kim Jong Il has tested a nuclear weapon and almost certainly possesses several more nuclear warheads. And it has shared its nuclear and missile know-how with others, including Syria. It's a vital national interest for the North Korean nuclear program to be completely, verifiably and irreversibly ended.Likewise, we have seen Iran marching, marching with single-minded determination toward the same goal, authenticated again today by the IAEA. President Ahmadinejad has threatened to wipe Israel off the face of the earth, and represents a threat to every country in the region -- one we cannot ignore or minimize. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: The U.S. is -- (inaudible). (Booing.)SEN. MCCAIN: You know -- thanks, my friend. Thanks. Thanks.SEN. MCCAIN: This is -- this may turn into a longer speech than you had anticipated. (Laughter, applause.) And by the way, I will never surrender in Iraq, my friends. I will never surrender in Iraq. (Cheers, applause.)But back to the subject at hand -- (laughter) -- other nations have begun to wonder whether they too need to have such weapons, if only in self defense. As a result, we could find ourselves in a world where a dozen or more nations -- small and large, stable and unstable, responsible and irresponsible -- have viable nuclear weapons programs.But there is a flip side to President Kennedy's warning. We should stop and think for a moment, not only of the perils of a world awash with nuclear weapons but also of the more hopeful alternative: a world in which there are far fewer such weapons than there are today and in which proliferation, instability and nuclear terrorism are far less likely. This is the world it is our responsibility to build.There is no simple answer to the problem. If you look back over the past two decades, I don't think any of us, Republican or Democrat, can take much satisfaction in what we've accomplished to control nuclear proliferation.Today, some people seem to think they've discovered a brand new cause, something no one before them ever thought of. Many believe all we need to do, to end the nuclear programs of hostile governments, is to have our president sit down with leaders in Pyongyang and Tehran, as if we haven't tried talking to these governments repeatedly over the past two decades.Others think military action alone can achieve our goals, as if military actions were not fraught with their own terrible risks. While the use of force may be necessary, it can only be as a last resort, not a first step.You know, the truth is, we will only address the terrible prospect, of the worldwide spread of nuclear weapons, if we transcend our partisan differences, combine our energies, learn from our past mistakes and seek practical and effective solutions.I'd like to suggest some steps we should take to chart a common vision for the future. It is a vision in which the United States returns to a tradition of innovative thinking, broad-minded internationalism and determined diplomacy, backed by America's great and enduring power to lead.It is a vision, not of the United States acting alone but building and participating in a community of nations all drawn together in this vital common purpose. It is a vision of a responsible America dedicated to an enduring peace based on freedom.A quarter of a century ago, Ronald Reagan declared, ""Our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth.""That is my dream too. It is a distant and difficult goal, and we must proceed toward it prudently and pragmatically, and with a focused concern for our security and the security of -- of our allies, who depend on us.But the Cold War ended almost 20 years ago, and the time has come to take further measures to reduce dramatically the number of nuclear weapons in the world's arsenals. It's time for the United States to show the kind of leadership the world expects from us, in the tradition of American presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind.Our highest priority must be to reduce the danger that nuclear weapons will ever be used. Such weapons, while still important to deter an attack with weapons of mass destruction against us and our allies, represent the most abhorrent and indiscriminate form of warfare known to man. We do quite literally possess the means to destroy all of mankind. We must seek to do all we can to ensure that nuclear weapons will never again be used.While working closely with allies who rely on our nuclear umbrella for their security, I'd ask the Joint Chiefs of Staff to engage in a comprehensive review of all aspects of our nuclear strategy and policy. I'd keep an open mind on all responsible proposals.At the same time, we must continue to deploy a safe and reliable nuclear deterrent, robust missile defenses and superior conventional forces that are capable of defending the United States and our allies.But I will seek to reduce the size of our nuclear arsenal to the lowest possible number, consistent with our security requirements and global commitments. Today we deploy thousands of nuclear weapons. It's my hope to move as rapidly as possible to a significantly smaller force.While we have serious differences, with the end of the Cold War, Russia and the United States are no longer mortal enemies. As our two countries possess the overwhelming majority of the world's nuclear weapons, we have a special responsibility, the two of us, to reduce their number.I believe we should reduce our nuclear forces to the lowest level we judge necessary, and we should be prepared to enter into a new arms control agreement with Russia reflecting the nuclear reductions I will seek. Further, we should be able to agree with Russia on binding verification measures based on those currently in effect under the START Agreement, to enhance confidence and transparency. In close consultation with our allies, I would also like to explore ways we and Russia can reduce -- and hopefully eliminate -- deployments of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. I also believe we should work with Russia to build confidence in our missile defense program, including through such initiatives as the sharing of early warning data and prior notification of missile launches.There are other areas in which we can work in partnership with Russia to strengthen protections against weapons of mass destruction. I would seriously consider Russia's recent proposal to work together to globalize the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. I would also redouble our common efforts to reduce the risk that nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons may fall into the hands of terrorists or unfriendly governments.I believe we should also begin a dialogue with China on strategic and nuclear issues. We have important shared interests with China and should begin discussing ways to achieve the greatest possible transparency and cooperation on nuclear force structure and doctrine. We should work with China to encourage conformity with the practices of the other four nuclear weapon states recognized in the Non- Proliferation Treaty, including working toward nuclear arsenal reductions and toward a moratorium on the production of additional fissile material.I believe we must also address nuclear testing. As president I will pledge to continue America's current moratorium on testing, but also begin a dialogue with our allies, and with the U.S. Senate, to identify ways we can move forward to limit testing in a verifiable manner that does not undermine the security or viability of our nuclear deterrent. This would include taking another look at the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to see what can be done to overcome the shortcomings that prevented it from entering into force. I opposed that treaty in 1999, but said at the time I would keep an open mind about future developments.I would only support the development of any new type of nuclear weapon that is absolutely essential for the viability of our deterrent, that results in making possible further decreases in the size of our nuclear arsenal, and furthers our global nuclear security goals. I would cancel all further work on the so-called Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator, a weapon that does not make strategic or political sense.Finally, we cannot achieve our non-proliferation goals on our own. We must strengthen existing international treaties and institutions to combat proliferation, and develop new ones when necessary. We should move quickly with other nations to negotiate a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty to end production of the most dangerous nuclear materials. The international community needs to improve its ability to interdict the spread of nuclear weapons and material under the Proliferation Security Initiative. And we need to increase funding for our own non-proliferation efforts, including the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs established by the landmark Nunn-Lugar legislation, and ensure the highest possible standards of security for existing nuclear materials.In 2010, an international conference will meet to review the Non- Proliferation Treaty. If I am President, I will seize that opportunity to strengthen and enhance all aspects of the non-proliferation regime. We need to strengthen enforcement of the so-called ""atoms for peace"" bargain by insisting that countries that receive the benefits of peaceful nuclear cooperation must return or dismantle what they receive if they violate or withdraw from the NPT. We need to increase IAEA funding and enhance the intelligence support it receives. We also need to reverse the burden of proof when it comes to discovering whether a nation is cheating on its NPT commitments. The IAEA shouldn't have to play cat-and-mouse games to prove a country is in compliance. It is for suspected violators to prove they are in compliance. We should establish a requirement by the UN Security Council that international transfers of sensitive nuclear technology must be disclosed in advance to an international authority such as the IAEA, and further require that undisclosed transfers be deemed illicit and subject to interdiction. Finally, to enforce treaty obligations, IAEA member states must be willing to impose sanctions on nations that seek to withdraw from it.We need to enlist all willing partners in the global battle against nuclear proliferation. I support the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Accord as a means of strengthening our relationship with the world's largest democracy, and further involving India in the fight against proliferation. We should engage actively with both India and Pakistan to improve the security of nuclear stockpiles and weapons materials, and construct a secure global nuclear order that eliminates the likelihood of proliferation and the possibility of nuclear conflict.As we improve the national and multilateral tools to catch and reverse illicit nuclear programs, I am convinced civilian nuclear energy can be a critical part of our fight against global warming. Civilian nuclear power provides a way for the United States and other responsible nations to achieve energy independence and reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas. But in order to take advantage of civilian nuclear energy, we must do a better job of ensuring it remains civilian. Some nations use the pretense of civilian nuclear programs as cover for nuclear weapons programs. We need to build an international consensus that exposes this deception, and holds nations accountable for it. We cannot continue allowing nations to enrich and reprocess uranium, ostensibly for civilian purposes, and stand by impotently as they develop weapons programs.The most effective way to prevent this deception is to limit the further spread of enrichment and reprocessing. To persuade countries to forego enrichment and reprocessing, I would support international guarantees of nuclear fuel supply to countries that renounce enrichment and reprocessing, as well as the establishment of multinational nuclear enrichment centers in which they can participate. Nations that seek nuclear fuel for legitimate civilian purposes will be able to acquire what they need under international supervision. This is one suggestion Russia and others have made to Iran. Unfortunately, the Iranian government has so far rejected this idea. Perhaps with enough outside pressure and encouragement, they can be persuaded to change their minds before it is too late.I would seek to establish an international repository for spent nuclear fuel that could collect and safely store materials overseas that might otherwise be reprocessed to acquire bomb-grade materials. It is even possible that such an international center could make it unnecessary to open the proposed spent nuclear fuel storage facility at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.This is a long list of steps we need to take. It is long because there is no single answer to this crisis, and there are no easy answers. It is long because no nation can meet this dire challenge alone and none can be indifferent to its outcome. The United States cannot and will not stop the spread of nuclear weapons by unilateral action. We must lead concerted and persistent multilateral efforts. As powerful as we are, America's ability to defend ourselves and our allies against the threat of nuclear attack depends on our ability to encourage effective international cooperation. We must strengthen the accords and institutions that make such cooperation possible. No problem we face poses a greater threat to us and the world than nuclear proliferation. In a time when followers of a hateful and remorseless ideology are willing to destroy themselves to destroy us, the threat of suicide bombers with the means to wreak incomprehensible devastation should call the entire world to action. The civilized nations of the world must act as one or we will suffer consequences once thought remote when the threat of mutually assured destruction could deter responsible states from thinking the unthinkable.Americans have always risen to the challenges of their time. And we have always done so successfully not by hiding from history, but by making history; by encouraging a sometimes reluctant world to follow our lead, and defend civilization from old mistakes and old animosities, and the folly of relying on policies that no longer keep us safe. I want to keep the country I love and have served all my life secure in our freedom. I want us to rise to the challenges of our times, as generations before us rose to theirs. It is incumbent on America, more than any other nation on Earth, to lead in building the foundations for a stable and enduring peace, a peace built on the strength of our commitment to it, on the transformative ideals on which we were founded, on our ability to see around the corner of history, and on our courage and wisdom to make new and better choices. No matter how dangerous the threats we face in our day, it still remains within our power to make in our time another, better world than we inherited. And that, my friends, is what I am running for President to do.'"

"'08-05-27,'1','“A quarter of a century ago, President Ronald Reagan declared, “Our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth,’ ” Mr. McCain said. “That is my dream, too.” He added: “It is time for the United States to show the kind of leadership the world expects from us, in the tradition of American presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind.”Mr. McCain took an oblique but direct swipe at Mr. Obama in his speech and his stated willingness to meet with the leaders of America’s greatest enemies, including North Korea and Iran. “Many believe all we need to do to end the nuclear programs of hostile governments is have our president talk with leaders in Pyongyang and Tehran, as if we haven’t tried talking to these governments repeatedly over the past two decades,” Mr. McCain said.Mr. Obama had called last October for “a world in which there are no nuclear weapons,” a fact his campaign underscored Tuesday. “By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama’s non-proliferation agenda today,” said a statement from Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Bill Burton, “John McCain highlighted Obama’s leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on non-proliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate.”Mr. McCain’s advisers said that many people had a hand in the speech, among them: Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s chief foreign policy aide; the former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; the former Navy secretary John Lehmann; James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Richard Burt, a former United States chief negotiator to the Start talks; John Bolton, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations; Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; and Rich Williamson, a former deputy United States ambassador to the United Nations.Charles Kupchan, senior fellow for Europe studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that Mr. McCain seemed to want to “go back to the liberal internationalist playbook.”“I was struck by how many references there are in the speech to multilateralism, to institutions, to treaties,” he said, “and I think he clearly senses that the electorate has soured on the go-it-alone attitudes of the Bush administration, and that he wants to tack back to the center.”“It was really a return to a set of policies much more reminiscent of the pre-Bush Republican Party,” Mr. Kupchan said. “There seems to be little of the neocons’ template in this speech. ‘We will work with whatever powers we need to, to keep the world safe from nuclear weapons and proliferation of those weapons.’ It’s a refreshingly pragmatic approach.”But Mr. McCain’s talk of nuclear cooperation with Russia raised questions about how receptive Moscow might be to heightened nuclear cooperation with McCain if he were elected, when another of the senator’s proposals — excluding Moscow from the Group of Eight industrialized countries — seems sure to test relations.Mr. McCain, in an opinion article in the Wall Street Journal’s Asian edition co-written with Senator Joseph Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, also alluded unfavorably to Mr. Obama’s foreign-policy proposals.“We must never squander the trust of our allies and the respect for our highest office by promising that the president will embark on an open-ended, unconditional personal negotiation with a dictator responsible for running an international criminal enterprise, a covert nuclear weapons program and a massive system of gulags,” the senators wrote.On North Korea, they said: “We must use the leverage available from the UN Security Council resolution passed after Pyongyang’s 2006 nuclear test to ensure the full and complete declaration, disablement and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear facilities, in a verifiable manner.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','Also getting in through the world ranking were Ian Poulter, Stuart Appleby, Robert Karlsson, Sean O’Hair, Martin Kaymer, Justin Leonard, Mike Weir and J. B. Holmes.Ryuji Imada, Anthony Kim and Jeff Quinney earned spots by being in the top 10 on the PGA Tour money list. Miguel Ángel Jiménez defeated Oliver Wilson in a playoff at the BMW Championship in England, and both qualified as Nos. 1 and 2 on the European tour’s Order of Merit.Other players who were exempt included the defending champion Ángel Cabrera and Tiger Woods, who was exempt in 10 categories. There are 84 spots available at 36-hole sectional qualifiers that will be held next Monday.How did Oberholser fall six spots in one week?He lost a few points when his tie for fourth at Colonial two years ago was wiped off the slate, but that was not enough on its own. It took good results from six players on three tours who were behind him in the ranking:¶ Toru Taniguchi tied for fifth on the Japan PGA Tour.¶ Tim Clark birdied two of the last three holes and tied for second at Colonial, along with Pampling.¶ Wilson moved into the top 50 with his playoff loss at Wenworth, while Hansen birdied the 17th hole to tie for 34th and earn enough points to hold down the 50th spot in the ranking.¶ Quinney birdied the last hole at Colonial and tied for seventh, earning enough points to move from No. 52 to No. 49.“The perfect storm,” Oberholser said. “I kept looking at the ranking and was falling one spot, two spots. And then I fall six spots when I least needed that to happen. It’s very disappointing.”Oberholser said he will not go to sectional qualifying Monday because he does not think his tender hand can take 36 holes in one day.He had not played since a tie for 25th at the Masters, taking six weeks off for rest and therapy and returning last week at Colonial, where he tied for 59th and received no points. It would not have mattered had he taken last week off because Oberholser has played fewer than 40 tournaments over the last two years while coping with various injuries.And this might not be the last of his troubles.He said his left hand was weaker than his right hand after the Masters, but therapy has helped. Doctors also found a bone spur in the top of his left hand. If it gets too painful, he might face surgery.“I’ve kind of written this year off,” Oberholser said.'"
"'08-05-27,'1','Many of those benefits tend to be short-lived, though. Elsewhere, Verizon has offered introductory packages with phone, Internet and television services for as little as $95 a month for the first year, before raising its prices. To compete, cable companies have sometimes lowered prices, too, or, more often, offered customers faster Internet connections and other service improvements.“There is a little jostling at the beginning, but it’s not like classical competition where you have 10 guys trying to figure out how to steal each other’s customers,” said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America. “When you have just two players, they realize it’s not in their best interests to have a price war.”In any case, many city residents may have to wait years to consider switching.Verizon will not have the infrastructure in place to hook up every home in the city — a precondition to get government approval — until the mid-2014, company officials said. Right now, Verizon’s new fiber optic service, with the brand name FiOS, reaches about 20 percent of New York’s 3.1 million households, including all of Staten Island and about half of Manhattan; it will be the end of 2009 before Verizon’s fiber network reaches 30 percent of Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, according to company forecasts.The company must install hundreds of miles of fiber optic cables under the city’s streets and into apartment buildings, a complicated and time-consuming process. At a hearing of the city’s franchise committee last week that drew about 400 people, some lawmakers and residents expressed concern about the lengthy timetable.“New Yorkers need to know whether they’re going to wait three years or six years,” said City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, representing the Upper West Side, suggesting that the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications, known as DoITT, establish a database that tracks Verizon’s precise installation schedule.Others, including Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, objected to a provision in Verizon’s application that would penalize the company $25 if workers failed to get to a customer’s home within a promised window of time. Currently, cable companies are supposed to give customers a credit equal to the previous month’s service.A representative from the city’s technology department said that the smaller penalty was a compromise made during negotiations with the company.In its February issue, Consumer Reports magazine said Verizon’s FiOS service was the best bundled television, phone and Internet service, beating out Comcast, Time Warner and every other major satellite and cable company. Verizon’s television and Internet services offered the best performance, support, reliability and value, the report said.Verizon has been selling television for the past three years in towns and cities across Long Island, in Westchester and Rockland Counties, and in New Jersey — places filled primarily with single-family homes and telephone poles, rather than underground conduits. It is far more complicated to wire the dense high-rise neighborhoods of New York City, where obstacles can include labor costs, city permits for street work and negotiations with the boards of apartment buildings that may charge “door fees,” or one-time access fees.The company also must find the space to install equipment in basements, in elevator shafts and other conduits, and into apartments.“The logistical hurdles are unlike any other city in America,” said Craig Moffett, a telecommunications analyst at Sanford A. Bernstein & Company, a brokerage. “In urban situations, every building is its own engineering problem, so it takes another layer of planning and expense.”While Verizon has secured franchise agreements from about 110 communities in New York State, and a statewide franchise in New Jersey, some customers in the suburbs have had to wait for more than a year to get FiOS in their neighborhoods.In Robbinsville, N.J., for instance, Verizon is offering television to 45 percent of the town nearly two years after it announced plans to start selling there. The rest of the township is taking longer because most of the fiber must be buried, not strung from telephone poles.“It’s something that our residents really, really want, but I don’t think it’s been rolled out as quickly as they would have liked,” Mayor Dave Fried of Robbinsville said, whose township administrator testified in Trenton on behalf of Verizon before it won its statewide franchise.Mayor Fried has been unhappy with Cablevision, which was the only cable provider in the township. Earlier this month, he wrote to the state’s Board of Public Utilities complaining about Cablevision’s plan to reduce the number of channels customers will get if they do not pay for a digital service plan.Mr. Fried said people in his township were eager to have more choices. “We really wanted to see Verizon come in,” he said, “because we have a lot of complaints about cable.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','“We have 80 to 100 listings, double the number we had last year,” said the site’s owner, Moses A. Zuniga. “Every business is hurting.”Such sites can give only a snapshot of the market, Mr. Handelsman acknowledged, because “when a listing is removed, we always check to see if it sold, but the broker doesn’t always tell us.”Several brokers say that buyers typically are people who are retiring and looking for a second act or laid-off corporate executives looking for a business to run.Retirement, illness, divorce, death — and simple burnout — still drive the majority of owners to sell, but in the rocky economy, some otherwise solid businesses are now having a hard time. Their owners decide they cannot hold out for better times, so they sell for less, business brokers say.A decline in revenue was one reason that Richard Lightowler decided to sell the family’s retail nursery in West Linn., Ore., in January. When he took over the Willamette General Store from his parents in early 2007, he said, he evaluated the business. He said he found it difficult to manage the adjacent nursery, which specializes in ponds and pond supplies, as well as the store’s growing business in expensive Traeger barbecue grills.So he decided to sell the decade-old nursery, which had been bringing in $150,000 annually several years ago. Business had slipped even though nurseries generate higher margins than the hardware, barbecue supplies and food that are the core items at the blue-and-white clapboard general store, he said.“A few years ago — based on how it was doing then — I could have gotten $50,000 for the nursery,” said Mr. Lightowler, 40. “But I had to ask less, about $40,000, and accept $33,000.”Phillip L. Beukema, of Luxemburg, Wis., who recently sold his online business, Corporate Apparel Unlimited, may have been luckier in his timing. Over the last eight years, he and his family built the company, which sells promotional items like T-shirts on 13 Web sites, with some 25,000 clients, and recorded $2.8 million in sales in 2006.Then he and his wife, Charla, both 55 years old, decided last August that they wanted to retire. So last fall he listed the company with a business broker, Cornerstone Business Services, in nearby Green Bay, and the transaction — he did not disclose the sales price — closed on Feb. 15.The price, said Mr. Beukema, a former college dean, would probably have been less if he had tried to sell this year.“As the subprime situation hit last year, we noticed about a 10 percent slide in orders,” he said. “So if we had put it on the market in January, the asking price would have been in jeopardy. I don’t think we could have gotten the same figure for it.”Pinpointing what is happening to sales prices nationwide is difficult because data is diffuse and unreliable. It is possible to advertise nationally on a Web site, but the buying and selling of most small businesses remains local. And most transfers of small businesses are between individuals, who are not required to register such transactions.But both listing sites and brokers around the country say that sellers have become more flexible about price. In a survey by the International Business Brokers Association of its 2,000 members, nearly 73 percent predicted that 2008 would be a buyer’s market. The survey was released in January.Cress S. Diglio Sr., the association’s chairman and president of Corporate Investment International, which is based in Orlando, Fla., said that “this year the number of sellers will easily outpace the number of qualified buyers.”One reason is that a crucial small business financing tool, home equity lines of credit, has been drying up as house values fall. Traditionally, small businesses have had a hard time obtaining commercial credit, and that is worsened in rough economic times, several brokers said.“A year ago, people were using home equity loans,” Mr. Hottes said. “And now they are drawing down their 401(k)s.”Sellers — who historically have provided financing to sell their small businesses — are doing so more than ever, said Julie Gordon White, chief executive officer of BlueKey Business Brokerage in Point Richmond, Calif.Even so, an unpleasant truth is that many, if not most, businesses do not sell. For decades, the conventional wisdom was that brokers sold about one out of five businesses they listed. But a new study by Louis O. Vescio, owner of Sunbelt Business Brokers in Melbourne, Fla., found that the percentage was only 10.5 percent.The main reason, Mr. Vescio and others said, was that “most small business owners keep bad records,” so buyers cannot get an accurate financial picture.Confidentiality can also hamper sales, brokers said.“It’s not like a house where you want everyone to know it’s for sale,” said Mr. Diglio, who has been in the business for two decades. “You don’t want employees, customers or competitors to know you are selling.”'"

"'08-05-27,'1','The panel that the men were hoisting into the press that morning was a small slice of this project: it depicted a Victorian gun safe, a maroon nail-head armchair and an open window framing a vista of desert hills. Over the last year Ms. Taylor had assembled this piece and its fellows in her Brooklyn studio, using close to 200 types of exotic wood and a lot of elbow grease.Normally she presses her paintings there too, using a homemade vacuum press. But the installation was too big for her studio to handle, so her gallery had arranged the trip to William Somerville.“I actually feel more confident about these guys doing my pieces than I feel about me doing them,” Ms. Taylor said. But once they had levered the piece back onto a table, she took over, running her fingertips over the smoking-hot surface to check for bumps as they stood back and watched respectfully.“Now I’ve just got to sand for seven days straight,” she said ruefully. In the dusty workroom her artificially red ponytail glowed like padauk, one of the exotic veneers she uses in her work.Ms. Taylor began inching toward her current métier in 2001, shortly after graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, Calif., when she found some wood-grain contact paper in a 99-cent store and suddenly got the urge to use it to make a portrait of her best friend as she had looked in first grade. At art school her interest in figurative painting had been something that “always got me in trouble,” she said. “Most of my teachers were abstract painters and conceptualists.""She also liked drawing indie comics, and the contact paper soon became another one of her many storytelling mediums.In 2004, after moving to New York to attend graduate school at Columbia University, Ms. Taylor visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art and happened upon the Studiolo from the Ducal Palace in Gubbio, Italy, one of the most important surviving examples of Renaissance marquetry. Commissioned in the late 15th century by the Duke of Urbino, it is fitted with trompe l’oeil furniture and cupboards whose open doors reveal objects that tell the patron’s life story: items like armor, books, and musical and mathematical instruments. As soon as she saw it, Ms. Taylor said, “I thought, ‘I’ve got to work with real wood.’ ”So at graduate school, along with studying conceptualism and critical theory, she researched marquetry in hobby books and on the Internet. “I think I was being kind of ornery,” she said. One of her earliest works presents two girls cuddling in a hot tub, with one wearing a zebrawood bikini. In another, made after she had taken an art history class about 19th-century Orientalism, a woman stands in a tract house filled with chinoiserie.Although these pieces seem a bit clunky by comparision with Ms. Taylor’s current work, they drew the attention of a visiting critic, the artist Andrea Zittel, who appreciated that Ms. Taylor was using a craft with hobbyist associations to make scenes that suggested both comics and genre paintings, without descending to kitsch.“She was always trying to figure out where she fit in between high and low culture,” said Ms. Zittel, who is now a friend. “She’s created this really interesting hybrid.”Elyse Goldberg, the director of James Cohan, discovered Ms. Taylor at her 2005 master of fine arts show. She was similarly struck by the young artist’s ability to blend “incompatible information,” using a craft originally developed to decorate European palaces to depict contemporary American scenes. “I think of her as a conceptual artist who is using story,” she said, “but story in a way that you’d find in a Gus Van Zandt film.”Ms. Taylor starts by making a drawing in a sketchbook, constantly reworking as she scales up in size. Then she cuts out her veneer pieces and fits them together like a puzzle, keeping them in place with sticky film from a sign warehouse.Even a small panel can use up to 50 types of wood. “I try to make every piece a different variety,” she said. “I really try not to repeat myself.” After assembling a scene, she frequently reworks it with new species to modify the look or mood. “The struggle,” she said, “is to use the grain in a way that can create form and contrast and value, just the way you would use paint.”Over time she has figured out a few guidelines. The gumwood’s fine grain is “great for reflections,” she said, while walnut burl works better “for ambiguous space.” To create an overcast sky she likes maple; for moody skies she prefers the striped violet grain of kingwood.The idea for “Room” arose in early 2007 on a road trip through the desert in Nevada and California. En route she was struck by the tiny houses she saw that had been abandoned as tract developments mushroomed nearby. “I got really interested in the way that all this is a tradition — that if you’re a little misanthropic, you could go west and escape.” But now, “all the things that you’re trying to get away from — congestion, suburbs, shopping malls,” she said, have forced the early utopia seekers out.So, mindful of the Studiolo, she decided to tell the story of one such person, using only his possessions. The piece shows all the disparate memorabilia of a man’s life: his tools, his microwave, an old Army helmet, even photographs, and, seen through a doorway, the corner of a solitary camp bed.Yet in contrast to the Duke of Urbino’s artisans, she noted, she doesn’t aim exactly to exalt her subject; she tried to make sure that what he represents is not ignored.Like most of the stories she tells, this is one is “mundane and ugly,” she said. “But people are drawn to the beauty of the wood, and when they’re looking at the wood, they have to look at the image.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','In March, The Journal of American College Health published a report on the link between energy drinks, athletics and risky behavior. The study’s author, Kathleen Miller, an addiction researcher at the University of Buffalo, says it suggests that high consumption of energy drinks is associated with “toxic jock” behavior, a constellation of risky and aggressive behaviors including unprotected sex, substance abuse and violence.The finding doesn’t mean the drinks cause bad behavior. But the data suggest that regular consumption of energy drinks may be a red flag for parents that their children are more likely to take risks with their health and safety. “It appears the kids who are heavily into drinking energy drinks are more likely to be the ones who are inclined toward taking risks,” Dr. Miller said.The American Beverage Association says its members don’t market energy drinks to teenagers. “The intended audience is adults,” said Craig Stevens, a spokesman. He says the marketing is meant for “people who can actually afford the two or three bucks to buy the products.”The drinks include a variety of ingredients in different combinations: plant-based stimulants like guarana, herbs like ginkgo and ginseng, sugar, amino acids including taurine as well as vitamins. But the main active ingredient is caffeine.Caffeine content varies. A 12-ounce serving of Amp contains 107 milligrams of caffeine, compared with 34 to 38 milligrams for the same amount of Coca-Cola or Pepsi. Monster has 120 milligrams and Red Bull has 116. Higher on the spectrum, Spike Shooter contains 428 milligrams of caffeine in 12 ounces, and Wired X344 contains 258.Mr. Stevens points out that “mainstream” energy drinks often have less caffeine than a cup of coffee. At Starbucks, the caffeine content varies depending on the drink, from 75 milligrams in a 12-ounce cappuccino or latte to as much as 250 milligrams in a 12-ounce brewed coffee.One concern about the drinks is that because they are served cold, they may be consumed in larger amounts and more quickly than hot coffee drinks, which are sipped. Another worry is the increasing popularity of mixing energy drinks with alcohol. The addition of caffeine can make alcohol users feel less drunk, but motor coordination and visual reaction time are just as impaired as when they drink alcohol by itself, according to an April 2006 study in the medical journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research.“You’re every bit as drunk, you’re just an awake drunk,” said Dr. Mary Claire O’Brien, associate professor in the departments of emergency medicine and public health services at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C.Dr. O’Brien surveyed energy drink and alcohol use among college students at 10 universities in North Carolina. The study, published this month in Academic Emergency Medicine, showed that students who mixed energy drinks with alcohol got drunk twice as often as those who consumed alcohol by itself and were far more likely to be injured or require medical treatment while drinking. Energy drink mixers were more likely to be victims or perpetrators of aggressive sexual behavior. The effect remained even after researchers controlled for the amount of alcohol consumed.Energy drink marketers say they don’t encourage consumers to mix the drinks with alcohol. Michelle Naughton, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, which markets Amp, said, “We expect consumers to enjoy our products responsibly.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','Books aimed at the small business and entrepreneur audience far too often fall into two categories.There is the “how I made $27 trillion in business, and you can too,” genre or the ones that say you only need to take care of customers (or cash flow or sales or something else) and you will be the envy of Warren Buffet and Bill Gates.The following four do not fit into either mold, and if, for no other reason, are worthy of consideration.Let’s start with the best, and work our way through the list.“A Whack on the Side of the Head” (Business Plus), a book about increasing creativity, has just been reissued to celebrate its 25th anniversary and it easy to understand its lasting appeal.The author, Roger von Oech, a consultant, has taken an abstract subject — how to think differently — and made it concrete by asking a series of questions, all of which involve breaking what he calls the “mental locks” that bind our thinking.“Most of us have certain attitudes that lock our thinking into the status quo and keep us thinking ‘more of the same,’ ” he writes. “These attitudes are necessary for most of what we do, but they get in the way when we are trying to be creative.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','Teenage girls who vomit one to three times a month to control weight increase their risk of having irregular menstrual periods by 60 percent, a new study reports; those who vomit once a week or more triple their risk. When researchers restricted the analysis only to girls of normal weight, the association was even stronger.Self-induced vomiting can cause electrolyte imbalance, dental enamel erosion, tears in the esophagus and other medical problems, according to background information in the study and an accompanying editorial. Irregular periods are an indication of hormonal disruptions that can affect bone health and mental function in ways that may not be reversible even with treatment.Researchers analyzed self-reported data from 2,791 girls ages 14 to 19 nationwide. Almost 9 percent reported vomiting for weight control one to three times a month; an additional 3.1 percent vomited once a week or more. The report appears in the May issue of The Journal of Adolescent Health.S. Bryn Austin, the lead author and an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard, said that about two million teenage girls a year vomit for weight control. “A girl may keep the vomiting a secret, but may talk about her irregular menses.

And the worse the air pollution, the higher the risk.Researchers studied 871 D.V.T. patients in the Lombardy region of Italy, comparing them with 1,210 healthy people.They tested levels of particulate air pollution — dust, soot and other tiny bits of matter suspended in the air — in areas where the patients lived, using monitors at 53 sites over a one-year period. The study was published May 12 in The Archives of Internal Medicine.After adjusting for various health factors, the researchers found that for each increase of 10 micrograms per cubic meter in particulate matter, the risk for D.V.T increased by 70 percent. The effect of air pollution was smaller in women and not apparent at all in those using oral contraceptives or taking hormone therapy. Oral contraceptives themselves increase the risk for blood clots, but air pollution had no added effect.“It’s a risk to live where pollution is high,” said Dr. Andrea Baccarelli, the lead author and an assistant professor of environmental health at the University of Milan. “But air pollution is not the only risk for D.V.T. Rather, this emphasizes the need for having a healthy lifestyle. That’s important wherever you live, but even more important if you live where pollution is high.”'"

So much of what happens is outside of one’s control.As the mother of a 4-year-old who has had multiple surgeries and hospitalizations, I have experienced that helpless feeling. But there is one important thing that I — and every parent, caregiver or loved one — can do: make sure that everyone who touches my child or his environment has clean hands.This sounds simple. Yet many patients and families do not have the information or the encouragement to make the simple but important request noted in your article: Please stop and wash your hands.The culture change you described may have been driven by financial and pay-for-performance reasons, but it can improve infection rates. This is great news for hospitals and patients.Hospitals, please invite your patients and families to be your partners.

"'08-05-27,'1','John Seibert, a research analyst at the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, said “that a company seeking to ship something can put a load on a dock and some trucker will come by and pick it up, accepting the offered rate.”Like the truckers, air freight operators are being hurt by higher fuel costs, although less so. But railroads, the third pillar in the nation’s freight infrastructure, have so far sidestepped losses, the Association of American Railroads reports. That is partly because of rising exports of coal and grain, which travel by rail to port cities, and partly because some trucking companies have turned to rail to move trailers long distances.“By using railroads, we are achieving some economy on fuel,” said Dan England, chairman of C. R. England, a family-owned company based in Salt Lake City that runs 3,600 tractor-trailers and now regularly loads 350 of the trailers on railroad flat cars to get them from, say, Chicago to Los Angeles.Still, 70 percent of the nation’s freight tonnage moves over the highways on trucks, much of it in the diesel-powered tractor-trailers of the nation’s 350,000 independent operators, each with a fleet of up to five vehicles, one usually driven by the proprietor. Profit margins, notoriously thin in good times, are minuscule now, and each rise in fuel prices pushes more truckers into the red.More than 45,000 vehicles, or 3 percent of the tractor fleet, have disappeared from the highways since early last year, according to America’s Commercial Transportation Research in Columbus, Ind. That surpasses the last great shakeout, in the early 1980s, when deregulation, along with a recession, high interest rates and the second Arab oil embargo, took out 33,000 tractors.While small operators like Mr. Hendley, of Millen, Ga., appear to be bearing the brunt of the damage, carriers with at least five trucks are also going out of business at an accelerating pace. In the first quarter, 935 of these larger operators shut down, the American Trucking Association reports, up from 385 a year earlier and the highest quarterly failure rate since the 2001 recession.“There are so many used trucks in dealer lots now that some of the larger dealers have stopped buying them,” said James McCormack, whose Web site, www.truckertotrucker.com, markets used trucks. “From what dealers tell me, exports have become their best outlet, particularly to Russia.”His own site listed 1,250 new ads in April from owner-operators, up from 900 in March and 450 a year earlier. Many of the owners are no longer able to lay out $1,100 to fill a 250-gallon fuel tank, which they often need to do two or three times a week. The increased outlay for fuel more than eats up the earnings of many small operators once they meet their truck loan payments and pay for insurance, maintenance, tires and the like.“If the prices asked are low enough,” Mr. McCormack said of the advertised trucks, “dealers will pick up single units and resell them.”Trucks are also going abroad. Nearly 24,000 used, over-the-highway tractors have been exported since early last year, the Commerce Department reports, or nearly three times the number in 2006. The weakness of the dollar makes the prices more attractive to foreigners and less so to potential domestic buyers.The nation’s air cargo carriers are also paring their operations somewhat. Northwest Airlines, for example, dedicated 13 giant 747-200’s to carrying freight between the United States and the Far East, a business that brought in $840 million, or 7 percent of the airline’s total revenue last year. The price of jet fuel, however, has risen faster than freight rates, and Northwest recently shrank its cargo fleet to 12 planes.The airline also dropped cargo service to Singapore and Bangkok, the least profitable markets, said Ben Hirst, a senior vice president, and soon will pull out of Taipei and Guangzhou, China.“We are seeing demand falling while fuel costs have gone up faster than we can raise rates to cover them, despite 20 surcharges,” Mr. Hirst said.United Parcel Service notes a shift to slower and less expensive ground shipments from air cargo. “People are trading down because of our numerous fuel surcharges,” said Norman Black, a U.P.S. spokesman.Adding surcharges that keep up with fuel prices is hardest for small truckers. Until the deregulation of interstate trucking, the government kept shipping rates high enough to cover trucking costs, while limiting the number of truckers. After deregulation, thousands of trucks were purchased, largely on credit, by individuals who gambled that freight rates would stay high enough to cover their costs — loan payments, insurance, tires, repairs, food on the road, Social Security taxes, tolls, accountants and fees to brokers who obtain loads.In time, fleets of fewer than 10 trucks, with the proprietor often driving one, carried much of the nation’s highway cargo.“It’s the Horatio Alger myth,” said Michael H. Belzer, a professor of industrial relations at Wayne State University and an ex-trucker. “These are people who want to be their own bosses in an occupation that is not always economically rational.”That marginal viability — rewarding owner-operators and many employed drivers with incomes that, even in good times, are less than $40,000 a year for 80 hours a week on the road — is now disappearing. The lumber mills paid Mr. Hendley $3.25 a mile to bring his logs from the forests. But diesel fuel, which had eaten up 25 percent of this revenue, in the end consumed 59 percent — not enough, he said, to cover other expenses and profit.The large carriers — J. B. Hunt, Yellow Freight, C. R. England and others — with fleets in the thousands, have efficiencies beyond the reach of the small truckers. They can minimize, for example, the number of miles a truck runs empty en route to a cargo without collecting revenue. In addition, England runs refrigerator trucks, a specialty that commands higher shipping rates.Even so, the surge in diesel fuel prices is eating steadily into profits. At England, for every dollar of revenue, 96 cents now goes to costs, up from 92.8 cents last year and 90.8 cents in 2006.“We are going to each customer and asking them individually to agree to pay more,” Mr. England said. “This is new for us.”Dan Little of Carrollton, Mo., does not have that much bargaining power. At 49, he has been a trucker for 30 years, driving one of the three trucks in his fleet himself and hiring drivers for the others. His rigs go empty to the Southeast, where they pick up underweight cattle and deliver them to Texas and Kansas, to be fattened for slaughter.The roundtrip, half of it without a load, was bringing Mr. Little $2,100. When fuel costs rose early this year, he sold one rig for $20,000 and gave up the lease on the other. Paying the drivers had eliminated his profit.Then on April 1, Mr. Little decided to park the truck he drove, falling back on the $1,200 a month that his wife, Barbara, earns helping handicapped children. “I just got fed up with being broke,” he said, “or braking an axle, as I did on one trip to Georgia, and ending up losing $300.”He got other owner-operators to join him in a trucker protest movement — one in which a parade of drivers in tractor-trailers recently converged on Capitol Hill in Washington, seeking relief through Congress.Mr. Seibert, whose Independent Drivers Association includes as members many of the protesters, said the drivers “think that government should not permit a situation in which the market does not pay them for their work.” He added, “It would seem that they are demanding a return to some form of regulation.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','The pattern has become familiar: Customs officers wave in vehicles filled with illegal immigrants, drugs or other contraband. A Border Patrol agent acts as a scout for smugglers. Trusted officers fall prey to temptation and begin taking bribes.Increased corruption is linked, in part, to tougher enforcement, driving smugglers to recruit federal employees as accomplices. It has grown so worrisome that job applicants will soon be subject to lie detector tests to ensure that they are not already working for smuggling organizations. In addition, homeland security officials have reconstituted an internal affairs unit at Customs and Border Protection, one of the largest federal law enforcement agencies, overseeing both border agents and customs officers.When the Homeland Security Department was created in 2003, the internal affairs unit was dissolved and its functions spread among other agencies. Since the unit was reborn last year, it has grown from five investigators to a projected 200 by the end of the year.Altogether, there are about 200 open cases pending against law enforcement employees who work the border. In the latest arrests, four employees in Arizona, Texas and California were charged this month with helping to smuggle illegal immigrants into the country.While the corruption investigations involve a small fraction of the overall security workforce on the border, the numbers are growing. In the 2007 fiscal year, the Homeland Security Department’s main anticorruption arm, the inspector general’s office, had 79 investigations under way in the four states bordering Mexico, compared with 31 in 2003. Officials at other federal law enforcement agencies investigating border corruption also said their caseloads had risen.Some of the recent cases involve border guards who had worked for their agencies for a short time, including the arrest this month of a recruit at the Border Patrol academy in New Mexico on gun smuggling charges.The federal government says it carefully screens applicants, but some internal affairs investigators say they have been unable to keep up with the increased workload.“It’s going to get worse before it gets better,” said James Wong, an internal affairs agent with Customs and Border Protection. “It’s very difficult for us to get out and vet each and every one of the applicants as well as we should.”The Border Patrol alone is expected to grow to more than 20,000 agents by the end of 2009, more than double from 2001, when the agency began to expand in response to concerns about national security. There has also been a large increase in the number of customs officers.James Tomsheck, the assistant commissioner for internal affairs at Customs and Border Protection, said the agency was “deeply concerned” that smugglers were sending operatives to take jobs with the Border Patrol and at ports.Mr. Tomsheck said the agency intended to administer random lie-detector tests to 10 percent of new hires this year, with the goal of eventually testing all applicants. His office has contracts with 155 retired criminal investigators, adding 36 since last fall, to do background checks.In one of the new corruption cases this month, at a border crossing east of San Diego, a customs officer allowed numerous cars with dozens of illegal immigrants and hundreds of pounds of drugs to pass through his inspection lane, investigators said.The officer, Luis Alarid, 31, had worked at the crossing less than a year, and the loads included a vehicle driven by Mr. Alarid’s uncle, the authorities said. Mr. Alarid has pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to smuggle. Investigators found about $175,000 in cash in his house, according to court records.In another recent case, Margarita Crispin, a customs inspector in El Paso, Tex., began helping drug smugglers just a few months after she was hired in 2003, according to prosecutors. She helped the smugglers for four years before she was arrested last year and sentenced in April to 20 years in prison and ordered to forfeit up to $5 million.Although bad apples turn up in almost every law enforcement agency, the corruption cases expose a worrisome vulnerability for national and border security. The concern, several officials said, is that corrupt agents let people into the country whose intentions may be less innocent than finding work.“If you can get a corrupt inspector, you have the keys to the kingdom,” said Andrew P. Black, an F.B.I. agent who supervises a multiagency task force focused on corruption on the San Diego border.Comparing corruption among police agencies is difficult because of the varying standards and procedures for handling internal investigations, said Lawrence W. Sherman, the director of the Jerry Lee Center of Criminology at the University of Pennsylvania and an authority on corruption.But he described policing the border as “potentially one of the most corruptible tasks in law enforcement” because of the solitary nature of much of the work and the desperation of people seeking to cross.Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, declined an interview. But in response to questions at a recent news conference, he suggested that the breadth and depth of border security improvements would inevitably produce problem officers.“There is an old expression among prosecutors,” he said. “Big cases, big problems. Little cases, little problems. No cases, no problems. Some people take the view we ought to make no cases and then we would have no problems. I think that is a head-in-the-sand view, which I do not endorse.”The customs inspector stands just outside his booth, his hand waving a stream of cars through the Otay Mesa crossing just east of San Diego. They zip past, one after another, no questions asked, an unusually easy welcome into the United States where inspectors are known to grill citizens about their travels before allowing them through.But time was running short for this Customs and Border Protection officer, Michael Gilliland, a revered veteran on the late shift expecting a special delivery — a vehicle with several illegal immigrants — in his crossing lane.Rather than intercept them, he had arranged for their safe passage through his lane, federal prosecutors said.Mr. Black, the F.B.I. agent from San Diego, shook his head as he watched a surveillance videotape of Mr. Gilliland.“You’re basically giving that smuggling organization an opportunity to conceal whatever else they want in that vehicle,” he said, “whether it's drugs, weapons, terrorists.”The smugglers use any ruse available to lure border workers but seem to favor deploying attractive women as bait. They flirt and charm and beg the officers, often middle-aged men, to “just this once” let an unauthorized relative or friend through. And then another and another.Prosecutors believe this is how smugglers ensnared Mr. Gilliland, who eventually pleaded guilty to taking $70,000 to $120,000 in exchange for letting hundreds of illegal immigrants pass through his lane. He was sentenced last year to five years in federal prison. Two women he had befriended also pleaded guilty.The case against Mr. Gilliland, 46, stands out for the number of immigrants he helped and the shock of a respected veteran gone bad.To young inspectors, Mr. Gilliland was a mentor, quick with advice, even an embrace, a burly go-to type with 16 years under his belt.“He knew the laws backward and forward,” said Edward Archuleta, an internal affairs agent with Customs and Border Protection who once worked with Mr. Gilliland and eventually helped bring him down.A tip steered F.B.I. agents to Mr. Gilliland’s illegal activities, but it took agents two years to build the case. The evidence against him included secretly recorded phone conversations in which Mr. Gilliland coordinated with Mexican smugglers when to drive their cargo of illegal immigrants through inspection lanes.One morning, while Mr. Gilliland was taking a break from his shift, agents called him over and told him he was under arrest. They had braced for Mr. Gilliland to become belligerent, but instead he collapsed into a chair, weak-kneed.“My grandfather always told me that when you’re born, the only thing you’re born with is your word, and only you can give that away, your integrity,” Mr. Gilliland said at his sentencing hearing. “And I’m sorry.”The case against the Villarreal brothers — the former Border Patrol agents in San Diego — illustrates how hard it has been for investigators to hunt for and root out corrupt officers, many of whom know how to game the system.The Villarreals would meet illegal immigrants near the border. The doors of their government-issue truck would swing open and Mexicans and Brazilians would climb in. Off they drove, Border Patrol agents at the wheel, but not to a station or jail, investigators said.Instead, they said, the migrants were taken to a drop house in San Diego and later transported by others in the smuggling ring to cities and towns far from the border.The case against the Villarreals had shock value, even to those on the inside.“Just really brazen, broad daylight,” said an investigator, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss a continuing investigation. “They could say, ‘We picked these guys up, we’re taking them in.’ ”As they closed in on the brothers, a squad of agents from several federal agencies met. Some had qualms about speaking openly in front of such a large group, fearing internal leaks.Their fears were apparently borne out when, a couple of weeks after the meeting, the brothers quit their posts, left their badges at their family’s home in National City, Calif., and have not been seen publicly since.A lawyer for the family, Jon Ronis, declined to say where the brothers were and said neither they nor family members would comment. Mr. Ronis said Raul and Fidel Villarreal were ready to defend themselves if the government brought a case.Federal officials declined to comment because the case was still open. But investigators described some aspects of it on condition of anonymity. When the public service announcement was being made for Mexico, for example, Raul Villarreal spoke excitedly about his role in producing it, even suggesting camera angles and lighting, said a person familiar with its production.Just when and why the brothers turned against the Border Patrol is unclear, even to the investigators. There is speculation that Raul had grown disgruntled with the work, chafing at having been moved back into the field from his public affairs job, considered a comfortable, high-profile position.The Villarreal case is especially alarming for the level of trust the brothers had earned within the Border Patrol. Their betrayal has had the effect, at least in some investigations, of leading the authorities to move in more quickly when agents are suspected of wrongdoing.In the case of Jose Olivas Jr., a Border Patrol agent in San Diego who was discovered serving as a scout for smugglers, an arrest was made within a year. Mr. Olivas, an agent for 10 years who had worked as a liaison between the agency and the United States attorney’s office, was sentenced in January to three years in prison.The drawback to moving in fast, investigators said later, is that they probably will never know how deep Mr. Olivas’s ties were to the smuggling organization. He suggested to a judge that he had been drawn to smuggling to help pay his bills.An internal Web site at Customs and Border Protection features a page devoted to a rogue’s gallery of agents and officers recently convicted of corruption-related charges.The intention, homeland security officials say, is to send the message that corruption will not be tolerated. That message has taken other forms, as well. When Mr. Olivas, the San Diego border agent, was sentenced to prison, several agents attended the court hearing at the behest of homeland security officials to shame him publicly.“I am truly embarrassed just looking at them,” Mr. Olivas told the judge. “I am truly sorry for the breach of trust that was given to me.”But if the department is serious about catching wrongdoers, investigators of corruption cases say it also needs to make fundamental changes in the way it polices the border police.One result of the awkward marriage of agencies that begat the Homeland Security Department is that three internal affairs units, in addition to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have a hand in corruption investigations. In the best case, having more than one unit investigate corruption can be a “force multiplier,” in the words of one investigator, but more often, it can slow cases down and lead to confusion over who should take the lead, several investigators said.The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general has nearly 170 investigators to police 208,000 department employees — including other large agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Transportation Security Administration, the Secret Service — and gets first crack at cases. When it passes on an investigation, the case is picked up by either the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s office of professional responsibility or the Customs and Border Protection internal affairs unit.The F.B.I. also develops its own cases. Don Allen, a retired agent who until 2005 supervised a multiagency task force in San Diego investigating corruption among border officers, said internal affairs units did not always readily share information and often resented any sense of being big-footed by an outside agency. He said law enforcement agencies often “had a negative impression of the bureau.”Thomas Frost, an assistant inspector general with the Homeland Security Department, said the limited number of investigators meant his office focused on “those most important cases and what resources we can bring to bear.”He suggested it would be “more efficient” if his office had more investigative resources under its control so that it could better track “everything going on.”“Let’s face it,” Mr. Frost said, “part of the issue of the border is it is kind of a balloon. When you squeeze one part, another bulges.”Jose Ramiro Arredondo, 33, a Customs andBorder Protection officerin Laredo, Tex., wasarrested in March after asmuggler who had beendetained told the authoritiesthat Mr. Arredondohad helped bring illegalimmigrants across theborder.Miguel Angel Avina, atrainee at the Border Patrolacademy in Artesia, N.M.,was arrested in May on fraudand conspiracy chargesrelated to his participationlast year in a ring thatsmuggled at least 110 gunsinto Mexico, the governmentsaid.

"'08-05-27,'1','Michael MacNair, a travel management consultant based in Alexandria, Va., who is helping to plan travel for the campaign of John McCain, also attributes the hotel renovations and upgrades to a “significant revitalization” of Washington, and to the strength of government consulting business.“When I got here 25 years ago,” Mr. MacNair said, “there was the basic Hilton and the basic Sheraton, with no personality. Now, people’s tastes have diversified. The average business traveler is looking for a unique experience, and hotels are transforming their product to deliver it.”Another factor behind the renovations, according to Bill Hanbury, chief executive of Destination DC, the city’s convention and tourism corporation, is the increase in international visitors to Washington, both for business and pleasure. The city estimates there will be 1.15 million foreign visitors in 2008, up from one million in 2007.Increasing competition from new hotels in suburban Washington has added to the pressure in the District of Columbia. Kimpton, which has seven boutique hotels in the district, is expanding in suburban Virginia, while Gaylord Hotels opened a 2,000-room convention hotel in Prince George’s County, Md., in April.The inauguration, of course, is the icing on the cake. The event “puts the city on the map worldwide,” said Adriaan Radder, general manager of the Ritz-Carlton, Washington. “Every hotel benefits from the huge demand and has the opportunity to drive higher revenues than would be generated otherwise.”Some of the greatest change has come in the high-end segment. The 28-year-old Four Seasons at Pennsylvania Avenue and M Street Northwest is undergoing a $40 million renovation, scheduled to be completed by December, that includes a new lobby restaurant, the addition and expansion of guest rooms and the addition of a fifth presidential suite.The eight-year-old Ritz-Carlton at 22nd and M Streets Northwest is undergoing a $12 million facelift. Eric Ripert, chef of the New York fish restaurant Le Bernardin, opened the Westend Bistro at the hotel last fall. The hotel’s newly renovated club lounge and suites have more contemporary, lighter décor; guest rooms are now being similarly refurbished.The St. Regis, occupying a 1926 Italian Renaissance-style building at 16th and K Streets Northwest, reopened in January after a $52.5 million renovation, which includes a refurbished lobby, spa and guest rooms.Thompson Hotels opened the Donovan House, a luxury boutique hotel, in March in the former Holiday Inn at 14th and M Streets Northwest. It has undergone a renovation that cost more than $35 million, and its unusual furnishings include egg-shaped chairs suspended from the lobby ceiling, and “cocoon” showers, resembling a nautilus shell, in guest room bathrooms.Affinia Hotels opened the Liaison Capitol Hill in April, on New Jersey Avenue Northwest between D and E Streets, with 343 guest rooms that have high-tech amenities and contemporary furnishings. The hotel was renovated at a cost of more than $12 million, and will get a rooftop pool and lounge next year, and a lobby restaurant this summer.The $100 million renovation of the Marriott Wardman Park, at 2660 Woodley Road at Connecticut Avenue Northwest, involved redecorating all 1,316 guest rooms. A steakhouse was added along with a 3,000-square-foot fitness center.The Georgetown Inn, Hilton Washington and the Jefferson are all planning to refurbish, while W and the team of Marriott and the boutique hotelier Ian Schrager plan to open hotels in Washington. But, with the exception of renovation of the Georgetown Inn, none of this will occur until after the inauguration.These upgrades and openings are good news for business travelers because they “raise the bar,” said Christopher Hunsberger, general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel Washington D.C. “As one hotel renovates, everyone looks and tries to reassess what they need to do to be competitive. The product offering has gotten substantially better for travelers, the options are greater than ever.”Mr. Radder, for one, said he believed that demand for luxury hotel rooms “has not grown as fast as the supply has increased.” This is already translating into some discounts: Donovan House is offering introductory room rates, starting at $295 a night. After Labor Day, rates will start at $375.'"
"'08-05-27,'1','There’s a lot to ponder. How much more can fares be raised before demand drops even below the capacity of a shrunken system? How many annoying new fees can be added before customers push back harder than the market can bear?After all the major airlines, and a few low-cost carriers, announced a $25 charge for the second checked bag for most coach passengers, American Airlines raised the stakes and said it would begin charging $15 for the first checked bag.The extra bag charges are now starting to appear at airports as summer peak season bears down. That is incremental revenue, certainly. But what about the added commotion? After all, curbside skycaps and terminal ticket clerks have to collect that money and make change. Lines inevitably grow.And more passengers certainly will try to cram even more into carry-on bags — adding one more brick to the load for flight attendants who already struggle mightily to fit everything into overhead bins. So the cumbersome task of getting everyone seated for takeoff now becomes more challenging.“Airlines need to realize that they have to get the customer on their side, and you don’t do that by making them line up longer at the counter checking bags,” said Mr. Boyd.Every business traveler I know understands that the airlines are not intended to operate profitably at oil prices anywhere near $130 a barrel, incidentally. Fares undoubtedly will rise.But “nickel and diming” customers is counterproductive, argued Mr. Boyd. Like many other industry analysts, he thinks airlines need to come to terms better with the huge costs of a delay-riddled system, and to plan more intelligently to dig themselves out of it.Last week, the majority staff of the Joint Economic Committee in Congress issued a report that underscored the second biggest problem in air travel, after oil prices. That is the extra costs on airlines imposed by an air transportation system that has not been able to cope with demand for years.Last year, “air traffic delays raised airlines’ operating costs by $19 billion,” counting fuel, crew, maintenance and other costs incurred by planes circling and waiting to land or sitting at gates or on tarmacs beyond departure times, the report said.Officially, about a quarter of all flights arrived late last year. But airlines routinely build extra time into the schedule for many flights, which “significantly underestimates the problem,” the report said.There are no easy answers. Mr. Boyd says airlines need to fix inefficient internal flight operations systems, while passengers need to insist politically that the national air traffic control system gets fixed.Imposing annoying extra fees for marginal revenue “just makes it harder for the rest of us to do business,” he said, adding: “I understand it’s crisis time for the airlines, but when you panic in a crisis, you’re doomed.”'"
"'08-05-27,'1','I am starting to wish the magazine had chosen to illustrate the piece some other way, though. Between those rumpled, vaguely cheesecakey photographs of me, the whole sharing-in-order-to-assess-the-risks-of-oversharing paradox and the fact that I implicitly criticized what professional bloggers are doing with their lives, the whole thing is beginning to seem like a perfect storm of Asking for It. Bloggers hate that they think I'm speaking for them. People who hate blogs and bloggers hate that a blogger was given such a prominent platform. And everyone seems to hate that I didn't come to some neat conclusion wherein I swore off everything having to do with the Internet and writing about myself. Haters may still be jealous, but it's becoming less and less clear to me what, exactly, it is that they're envious of.Q: You may all wish that the N.Y.T. had published an article on Iraq, or China, or latrines in Guatemala, and those are all important, but a generation of people is growing up learning how to deal with a self-imposed lack of privacy. Will we all one day acquiesce to more government-sponsored monitoring because, hey, it's already all over the Internet, right? Will our kids have a backlash against the openness we're comfortable with now? Will our president in 20 years keep a blog? (Go to Comment)A: I don't have a crystal ball, and I'm not a spokewoman for everyone with an online presence. But like you, I wonder whether people my age and younger feel less attached to their personal privacy because they recognize that they live in a country where their government can monitor their cellphone conversations or track their whereabouts via their cars' own G.P.S. systems. Is a backlash imminent, though? While I don't think that people are capable of having easy access to technology and choosing not to use it, maybe it's possible for us to learn to use technology more responsibly. I'm reading an interesting book right now about reputation and the Internet by Daniel Solove, and in it he posits that we've traditionally thought of privacy as a binary: private vs. public. He thinks that we should begin to think of degrees of semi-privacy, in terms of both self-regulation and legal regulation.Q: I do want to say, Emily, I am sorry you get so many negative and hate-filled responses, but what do you expect? (Go to Comment)A: I did expect that there would be an overwhelmingly negative response. The Internet makes it possible and, for professional bloggers, necessary — to immediately form conclusions and then immediately broadcast them. If I was still working at Gawker or another media blog, rushing to move on to the next post, I probably would have glanced through an article this long for maybe five minutes, skimmed the initial responses and gotten the sense that other people hadn't liked it, and then started formulating a post along these lines:a) Aw, poor doddering New York Times, trying to clue us into the niceties of this nutty ""Web blogging"" trend. What a pathetic attempt to boost online readership. And, like, soooo long!b) Look at that picture. And she clearly can't write — hello, that ""my life was cozy and safe""? Is she in a freshman-year personal-essay class? — so obviously she is only in The Times because she's marginally attractive. Or maybe she's sleeping with someone influential there.c) And if I'd actually read the article, I probably would have read the part describing Gawker and the self-reflexive world Gawker describes and I would have felt personally attacked, like someone was telling me my all-consuming job and, therefore, my life, were meaningless. So I would have responded defensively. Like, how dare this person position herself as somehow above the stuff she used to do! She's no better than us, really. In fact, she's worse.d) And you know, on some level I would have felt jealous, so I probably would have called me an attention whore or a narcissist, because that's what you call people who are getting the kind of attention you feel you deserve but are, unfairly, not getting.Q: It seems as if blogging is in its adolescence, with its excesses right now sticking out like gawky limbs and jutting shoulder blades. Do you think that, as [the] Internet grows up a bit, people will really start to say, ""Boy, that sure didn't work,"" and change the medium to become less comment-centered and more about the satisfied customer, like the way digg is doing? Or do you think that there are too many people out there craving attention, ready to make the same mistakes you've made? (Go to Comment)A: It's probably a pretty safe bet that people will continue to make mistakes online — after all, there is absolutely nothing stopping them from doing so besides themselves. This is the best and worst thing about the blogosphere. Other people's mistakes, which is to say, their impulsively revealed thoughts and opinions, can be fascinating. But I don't think people write online exclusively because they crave attention.Q: Like you, Joni Mitchell was extremely self-referential. Many people liked this at first, but they eventually grew tired of it. When she finally stopped writing about herself and turned her attention elsewhere, most people had already lost interest and moved on. Do you worry that the same thing will happen to you? (Go to Comment)A: Have people grown tired of Joni Mitchell's self-referentiality? I haven't. ""Like a cop, like a thief, like a mother/you want me to be truthful/and then you turn it on me like a weapon, and I need your approval"" will always be one of my favorite lyrics.Q: At the end of your piece you mention that you don't delete negative comments, and that you feel you should leave your old posts online, for better or worse. Is this some kind of unwritten blogging code? Blogging ethics? Do they exist? (Go to Comment)A: Everyone who maintains a blog for more than a few months evolves a set of rules for themselves, I think. It seems unfair to me to post some comments and delete others, and it seems odd for me to remove older posts. To do so would be to imagine that the way I feel now has some kind of inherent finality to it.'"

"'08-05-28,'1','The Malaysian filmmaker Yasmin Ahmad tells deeply personal and intensely humanistic stories based largely on her own experiences. For her fourth film, “Mukhsin,” she revisits the loving and liberal family of her previous features, continuing her portrait of one woman’s journey from childhood through adolescence and marriage.It’s summer vacation, and the 10-year-old Orked (Sharifah Aryana Syed Zainal Rashid), a multilingual tomboy more interested in playing soccer than brides-and-grooms, is thrilled when a new boy arrives in the village. The boy, Mukhsin (Muhammad Syafie bin Naswip), may be only two years older, but his troubled home life and rising hormones give him an emotional complexity that Orked and their growing friendship are ill equipped to manage.Deceptively simple and threaded with gentle humor, “Mukhsin” paints the turmoil of puppy love on a canvas of family relationships as delightful as it is believable. With a free-spirited English-speaking mother and a father who helps with housework (“Malays who have forgotten their roots,” grumbles a local busybody), Orked’s family is as likely to arouse envy as it is disapproval. This is exemplified by a pregnant neighbor who is hauling laundry while her philandering husband polishes his motorcycle.“How nice to be a motorcycle,” she murmurs resignedly, in a moment that perfectly captures the film’s calm acuity and its maker’s empathy for those whose dreams may never come true.Written (in Malay, with English subtitles) and directed by Yasmin Ahmad; director of photography, Keong Low; edited by Affandi Jamaluddin; art director, Zaini Abdul Latiff; produced by Ahmad Puad Onah; released by Grand Brilliance.

"'08-05-28,'1','The Constitutional Court threw out smuggling charges against the head of a Western-backed independent media organization last year. Manana A. Aslamazyan, the director of the Educated Media Foundation, had been charged with failing to declare about $13,000 in cash upon arrival in Russia in January 2007. The authorities confiscated documents and computers from her organization, forcing it to shut down. Human rights advocates said the incident was part of a broader government crackdown on independent media.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','The other case was brought by a former assistant manager of a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a black man named Hedrick G. Humphries. Mr. Humphries had complained that a white assistant manager had been motivated by racial discrimination in dismissing a black employee. In his lawsuit, Mr. Humphries claimed that he then lost his own job in retaliation for his complaint.Retaliation complaints are a growing subset of workplace discrimination cases, because it is often easier for employees to demonstrate that they were retaliated against than that they were victims of discrimination in the first place. Retaliation complaints filed annually with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission doubled in the last 15 years to 22,000 from 11,000.Congress has provided explicit protection against retaliation in two major federal statutes. One is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of race and sex. The other is the provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that applies in the private sector.However, there is no such explicit protection in the portion of the age-discrimination law that applies to federal government workers. Nor is there explicit language in a post-Civil War-era statute that gives “all persons” the same right “as is enjoyed by white citizens” when it comes to making and enforcing contracts, such as contracts of employment. Those were the two statutes that the court interpreted on Tuesday.In both decisions, the majority relied heavily on precedent, reasoning by analogy from recent cases that dealt with claims of retaliation under other statutes. The most recent such case was a ruling issued in 2005, before either Justice Alito or Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joined the court. By a vote of 5 to 4, the court held then that a law known as Title IX, which bars sex discrimination in schools and colleges that receive federal money, also prohibits school officials from retaliating against those who bring sex-discrimination complaints. The statute itself does not mention retaliation.In his opinion on Tuesday in the federal age-discrimination case, Justice Alito said that the provision in question, broadly prohibiting “discrimination based on age,” was “not materially different” from the anti-discrimination language the court had interpreted both in the Title IX case and in an earlier decision from 1969, interpreting a Reconstruction-era statute that bars racial discrimination in property ownership.“The context in which the statutory language appears is the same in all three cases,” Justice Alito said. “That is, all three cases involve remedial provisions aimed at prohibiting discrimination.”In the Postal Service case, Gómez-Pérez v. Potter, No. 06-1321, the federal appeals court in Boston, which has jurisdiction over federal cases from Puerto Rico, dismissed the suit on the ground that the age-discrimination provision that applies to federal workers does not cover retaliation claims.In his opinion, which overturned the appeals court and reinstated the lawsuit, Justice Alito said that understood in the context of its enactment, the provision did cover retaliation. He noted that while the basic age-discrimination law was passed in 1967, it was not extended to federal workers until 1974.In the interval, the Supreme Court had issued its decision deeming that the 19th-century property-rights law covered retaliation. Congress was “presumably familiar” with that case, Justice Alito said, and “had reason to expect” that the new age-discrimination provision would be interpreted with similar breadth.In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Roberts said that, to the contrary, Congress was “well aware” that the Civil Service Commission had issued detailed regulations protecting federal employees against retaliation. The chief justice said that Congress should be understood to have made a judgment that retaliation problems in the federal work force should be dealt with administratively rather than judicially.These two justices were the only dissenters in Mr. Humphries’s case, CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, No. 06-1431, which held that Congress intended to cover retaliation claims brought under the provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 that is usually referred to as Section 1981. The court upheld a ruling by the federal appeals court in Chicago, rejecting an appeal brought by the company that operates the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain.The Supreme Court’s decision last September to hear the company’s appeal was a surprise, because all the federal appeals courts that had weighed in on the question interpreted Section 1981 as covering retaliation. Resolving disputes among the lower federal courts is the Supreme Court’s main reason for accepting a case. The decision to grant this case in the absence of such a dispute spread alarm throughout the civil rights community on the assumption that a majority was prepared to shut the door on retaliation claims.There was ample reason for that assumption, since Chief Justice Roberts had earlier made clear his distaste for precedents in which the court has gone beyond a statute’s text to infer a basis for a lawsuit.It was especially significant, therefore, that both he and Justice Alito signed on to Justice Breyer’s discussion of the importance of “stare decisis,” the court’s doctrine of adherence to precedent. Even if the court’s approach to statutory interpretation was changing, Justice Breyer wrote, “we could not agree that the existence of such a change would justify re-examination of well-established prior law.”He added: “Principles of stare decisis, after all, demand respect for precedent whether judicial methods of interpretation change or stay the same. Were that not so, those principles would fail to achieve the legal stability that they seek and upon which the rule of law depends.”In a dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, accused the majority of hiding behind “the fig leaf of ersatz stare decisis,” relying on precedents that had been incorrectly decided in the first place.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','The suit, initially filed in 2006, contends that get-out-the-vote activists who help voters with mail ballots have been “interrogated, harassed and intimidated” by state investigators.J. Gerald Hebert, the lawyer for the Democrats, said his first witnesses would be several elderly black women prosecuted on fraud charges for what Mr. Hebert described as help given other elderly voters in the mailing of early ballots in Texarkana, Fort Worth and Dallas.Mr. Abbott and Mr. Wilson say they have a duty to prevent voter fraud. To complaints that any infractions at issue have been insignificant, they say that in pursuit of that duty, they must pursue violations of provisions like one that requires anyone mailing in a ballot to sign the envelope.They say that “there is no evidence of any voters who have been unable to vote due to enactment or enforcement” of the provisions, which, they also note, were sponsored in the Texas House by a Democrat. Further, they say, there is no evidence that enforcement has intimidated anyone into stopping voter assistance efforts.The Dallas Morning News reported on May 18 that all 26 cases of voter fraud prosecuted by Mr. Abbott had been brought against Democrats, almost all of them black or Hispanic.But in their legal brief, Mr. Abbott and Mr. Wilson said that the state had brought voter fraud cases against Republicans as well and that “mere questioning” of people about activities that might have broken the law did not deprive them of a constitutional right.The brief said the two officials’ position was strengthened by the Supreme Court’s Indiana ruling, on April 28, which allowed states, as a way of preventing fraud, to require voters to show photo identification.The suit against Mr. Abbott and Mr. Wilson involves enforcement of provisions that make it a crime in certain cases to carry someone else’s filled-in early-voting ballot to the mailbox, to possess another person’s blank ballot or to provide early-voting ballot assistance to anyone who has not asked for it.The case, to be tried without a jury before Judge T. John Ward, has put Mr. Abbott at odds with Judge Charleston and some campus activists at Prairie View, who say they once looked to the attorney general as a champion of their voting rights.In 2004, Oliver Kitzman, then the Waller County district attorney, challenged the students’ right to cast ballots here rather than in their home communities, although the Supreme Court had long ago decided they could. Students, claiming that the county’s white residents feared the voting power of the predominantly black 9,000-member student body, marched in protest, and Mr. Abbott wrote an opinion supporting them. Mr. Kitzman soon retired, and students continued to cast ballots here.But other voting rights disputes have since erupted. Before the 2006 election, Judge Charleston said in an interview, he personally registered about 1,000 students. But on Election Day, he said, hundreds of them were turned away as not registered to vote. The registration cards were later found in county offices, he said.Ellen C. Shelburne, the county tax assessor and registrar, who took office in January 2007, said she had recently been questioned by investigators from Mr. Abbott’s office and had told them that she knew nothing about the matter. Jerry Strickland, a spokesman for Mr. Abbott, said, “We cannot comment on ongoing investigations.”Jamie Hais, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said, “We do have an ongoing investigation into the matter,” but declined to comment further.Judge Charleston said he had also complained to federal and state officials that Waller County had denied Prairie View students convenient polling locations. Further, he told them that for the May 10 school board election, not only did district trustees use public money to issue a voter guide, the guide also gave short shift to two black candidates, Jemiah Richards and Charli Cooksey, both Prairie View students, who subsequently lost to incumbents.Patrick W. Mizell, a lawyer for the firm of Vinson & Elkins, which was hired to represent the school board, said that this was the first time the trustees had put out a guide but that he saw nothing wrong with it.Anyway, Mr. Mizell said, “I don’t think a large number of Prairie View students have kids in the local school district.”'"
"'08-05-28,'1','The Borders Group said its same-store sales fell and its losses narrowed in the first quarter, and Wall Street greeted Tuesday’s unveiling of the bookseller’s redesigned Web site with a sell-off of its shares.Borders, the nation’s No. 2 retail bookseller behind Barnes & Noble, said it lost $31.7 million, or 53 cents a share, in the three months ending May 3, compared with a loss of $35.9 million, or 61 cents a share, for the comparable period of 2007. Thomson Financial said analysts had expected a loss of 47 cents a share.Borders released its earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday. Its shares fell 47 cents, or 7 percent, to $6.25 in regular-session trading on Tuesday and dropped 5 cents to $6.20 in after-hours dealings.The company says its results were hurt by store closure costs, severance costs and fees related to strategic alternatives.“It was a tough sales environment we did it in,” said George Jones, the chief executive of Borders.Mr. Jones said a revamping announced last year is expected to save $120 million a year.

"'08-05-28,'1','In fact, the Twin Cities committee has budgeted $58 million for the convention, nearly $20 million more than it is contracted with the Republican National Committee to raise. Half of that $58 million is to be raised from Minnesota companies, and half from national fund-raising, according to the committee’s marketing material.Ms. McFarland said that her committee had been aided by the fact that 19 Fortune 500 companies are located in the region and that “we have been thrilled with the generous support of the local community.”Mr. Lopez cited a lagging economy in explaining the Democrats’ fund-raising problems. Since the bulk of the money is raised from major corporations, corporate financial restraints are affecting all charitable contributions, the Denver committee included.“We’ve got to deal with the fact that there is belt-tightening all across corporate America,” Mr. Lopez said. “They are reducing spending, and that has had a big impact. We are no different than others trying to raise money in this environment. Everyone is facing it.”Even so, Mr. Lopez says Denver is ahead of where Boston was in 2004 at this time.The Boston host committee was far behind in fund-raising before the Democratic convention, but made it up in a last-minute blitz headed by Senator John Kerry, the party’s nominee, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the committee’s co-chairman.Denver’s mayor, John W. Hickenlooper, has suggested that the Democrats’ long nominating battle has distracted potential donors. But, no matter the obstacles, the Denver host committee is aggressively packaging corporate sponsorships that promise corporate executives access to key politicians in return for writing a check to the host committee.In addition, the Denver committee is appealing to civic pride.“This is a historic event for Denver,” Mr. Lopez said. “It’s the first national convention in the interior West. It gives Denver a chance to demonstrate that it can host a national convention and show that Denver has the wherewithal to raise money and be the place where you want to be.”In addition to the millions in corporate donations to the host committees, each party will get $16.3 million in federal dollars to pay for convention expenses, generally the salaries and travel expenses of party officials who work on the convention. On top of that, each city will also get $50 million in federal antiterrorism money to pay for security at the conventions.Over the years, the price of the conventions has continued to rise, causing many campaign finance experts to raise questions about whether the host committees are really civic boosters or have become yet another venue for special interest groups to gain access to politicians.The money raised by the host committees goes to build the podium, buy the balloons, build the skyboxes and the news media centers, rent the arena, and make all the internal changes to the structures where the conventions will be held. While the money is raised by the host committee, it is spent by the party.Clearly, Denver is marketing political access to corporations. One big selling point is that host committee donors will be able to come into contact with 232 members of Congress, 51 senators and 28 governors, according to the committee’s promotional literature.Big ticket corporate donors — at the presidential level ($1 million), the platinum level ($500,000) and gold ($250,000) — are promised invitations to private events sponsored by Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado and Ken Salazar, the Democratic senator from the state, according to the literature.Companies that have already donated to the Denver committee and whose logos appear on the committee’s Web site include the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Merck, Lilly, Allstate, Travelers, Lehman Brothers, A.T.& T., Visa, Target and Western Union.Even though the Denver Host Committee has missed its fund-raising targets, the Democratic Party does not appear to be concerned.“We remain focused on planning and executing a world-class convention that showcases our nominee, our party and the best of Denver and the Rocky Mountain West,” Natalie Wyeth, press secretary for the party’s convention committee, said in a statement.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) — A man who had a role in a racial profiling scandal weathered by Christie Whitman while she was governor has been killed.The authorities said Saturday that the man, Sherron Rolax, 28, was shot and killed just before 1 a.m. Saturday during a fight on a Camden street. No one has been charged.In 1996, Mrs. Whitman joined state troopers patrolling sites in Camden believed to be drug-dealing hotspots so she could observe a crackdown then under way for herself. During the night, the governor was photographed as she patted down Mr. Rolax, who was black and was then a teenager. No drugs or weapons were found.The photo appeared in the news media in 2000, just before the Republican National Convention was held in nearby Philadelphia. At the time, allegations of racial profiling by troopers had become an important public issue in New Jersey, and eventually a federal monitor was assigned to help end the practice.After the photo was made public, Mrs. Whitman said it was a mistake for her to pat down a suspect.Mr. Rolax later sued Mrs. Whitman, who resigned as governor in 2001 to become administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. A judge threw out the civil rights suit, saying Mr. Rolax filed after the statute of limitations had run out.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','If Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein were looking for allies in his latest battle with state officials over education funding, he would have found few in the City Council chamber on Tuesday.During a nearly four-hour hearing filled with skepticism that bordered on hostility from council members, Mr. Klein testified that the city badly needed more flexibility from the state to avoid significant cuts at dozens of public schools.But several council members said they found the argument difficult to believe. They also said that rather than appealing to the state, the Bloomberg administration should restore millions to the education budget so that no individual school would face cuts.“There is no doubt and no way around the fact that this city, state and country are in difficult economic times, but even with that reality those level of cuts are not ones that I can, in good faith, support,” said Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who added that the Council would work to find “other cuts in other places” to reduce those faced by schools.Several council members criticized Mr. Klein for not doing more publicly to fight the mayor’s education budget, which allocated $428 million less than what had been planned for education. Still, Mr. Klein insisted that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was acting responsibly as the “fiscal steward” of the city.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','“You have a problematic scenario: falling home prices, rising food and energy prices, the credit crunch, and the labor market isn’t doing that well,” said Stephen Carl, head of equity trading at the Williams Capital Group. “We’re going through this period right now, and it’s going to take some time to come out of it.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 68.72 points, or 0.55 percent, to 12,548.35. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index advanced 9.42 points, or 0.68 percent, to 1,385.35, and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 36.57 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,481.24.The advance came after the Dow lost 3.91 percent last week, its worst showing since February, while the other indexes showed similar declines.Bond prices fell with the 10-year Treasury note down 19/32, to 99 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.92 percent, up from 3.84 percent late Friday.The July contract for a barrel of light sweet crude oil fell $3.34, to settle at $128.85 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Earlier Tuesday, the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller home price index indicated that prices fell 14.1 percent during the quarter. The drop, however, was expected by most investors, and the government’s report on new-home sales was considered more important because it is the most recent gauge on the industry.Todd Salamone, director of trading at Schaeffer’s Investment Research in Cincinnati, noted that more economic data is expected during the week.“There’s a ton of reports that will give us a better idea about the consumer, and that’s what we’re watching,” he said.Economic reports scheduled include Wednesday’s government data on durable goods, which will provide more insight into consumer spending on big-ticket items.The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President, Janet L. Yellen, who is not a voting member of the central bank, said in prepared comments for a speech in California that any interest rate increases are still some way off. She also reiterated that the economy should pick up during the second half of the year.In corporate news, Vodafone posted a full-year profit and said its chief executive, Arun Sarin, plans to resign. He will be succeeded by his deputy, Vittorio Colao.Shares of Flotek Industries, a provider of oil field services, fell $1.91, or 10 percent, to $17.26, after it reduced its full-year profit forecast because of increased costs and delays in the delivery of parts.Following are the results of the three-month and six-month Treasury bills:'"
"'08-05-28,'1','Despite his record, Mr. McCain has been obliged to deal with the burden that falls on any Republican candidate to deal with the party’s conservative wing, which demands commitment to its goal of tilting the courts rightward. In a speech on May 6 at Wake Forest University, Mr. McCain took pains to use the language of the conservative faithful, notably inveighing against “activist judges,” to signal his dedication to continue placing conservative judges on the courts.In 2005, Mr. McCain aroused the suspicion of some conservatives alert to ideological heresy when he joined six other Republicans and seven Democrats in the Senate to form a compromise on appeals court nominations to break a nasty deadlock. Under the plan brokered by the group, known as the Gang of 14, the Democrats agreed to end their filibuster blocking some of Mr. Bush’s appeals court nominees, in exchange for other conservative nominees being dropped from consideration.Although the plan averted an impasse, some conservative leaders spoke of it in terms of a near-betrayal and said it suggested that as president, Mr. McCain might use judicial appointments as bargaining chips on other issues.In response, Mr. McCain has chosen to do everything in his power to demonstrate his fealty to their cause.He announced an advisory committee on the courts headed by Theodore B. Olson, a leading conservative lawyer and former solicitor general, that is full of people like Charles J. Cooper, who had been influential in selecting reliable conservative nominees in the Bush and Reagan administrations.In an interview, Mr. Olson said he was confident that Mr. McCain’s nominees would be carefully screened to assure that they were in the mold of reliably conservative recent Supreme Court appointments like Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.In his 22 years in the Senate, Mr. McCain has never been a major player in the judicial wars. Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, said Mr. McCain “has never been really interested in judges.”“It’s sort of something far afield because his interests are otherwise,” Mr. Specter said.Like Mr. McCain, neither Mr. Reagan nor Mr. Bush was a lawyer and, adopting the same rhetoric as Mr. McCain is now using, they became enthusiastic instruments of those conservative lawyers who were diligent in choosing conservative judicial nominees.Mr. Obama, on the other hand, is a lawyer and has had a long and deep interest in the courts and the law. Cass R. Sunstein, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School and an Obama adviser, said in an interview that because Mr. Obama had taught constitutional law for 10 years at Chicago, “he is immersed in these issues.”“The first thing to know,” Professor Sunstein said, “is that he knows this stuff inside and out, and he has the credentials to be easily appointed to the court himself.”From his remarks in the Senate opposing the nominations of Judges Roberts and Alito, among others, Mr. Obama made clear that he would look to name judges with an expansive, progressive view of the Constitution.In explaining his opposition to the Alito nomination, Mr. Obama said that Judge Alito’s record showed “extraordinarily consistent support for the powerful against the powerless” and “for an overreaching federal government against individual rights and liberties.”On March 3, Mr. Obama spoke of what he would look for in a Supreme Court justice and held up Earl Warren, a former governor of California and the former chief justice, as an example.Chief Justice Warren, who led the court in forging its landmark 1954 ruling outlawing school segregation, “had the wisdom to recognize that segregation was wrong less because of precise sociological effects and more so because it was immoral and stigmatized blacks,” Mr. Obama said. “I want people on the bench who have enough empathy, enough feeling, for what ordinary people are going through.”Although there are no vacancies on the Supreme Court, there has been a rich traffic in speculation as to whom either Mr. Obama or Mr. McCain would name to fill any vacancy. Mr. Obama’s comment about Chief Justice Warren has led some to note his close association with Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, an accomplished lawyer and the former head of the government’s civil rights division.If Mr. Obama wanted to name the court’s first Hispanic justice, Sonia Sotomayor, an appeals court judge based in New York, has been named as a possibility by many lawyers. Another possible candidate is Harold Hongju Koh, the dean of the Yale Law School, an esteemed legal scholar and former human rights official in the Clinton State Department, who would become the court’s first Asian-American justice.Others who have been talked of as candidates in a Democratic administration include Judge Merrick B. Garland of the Washington-based appeals court, Judge Diane P. Wood of the appeals court based in Chicago and Barrington D. Parker Jr. of the court based in New York. Some commentators have raised the decidedly remote but intriguing possibility that a President Obama could turn to Mrs. Clinton for the court.Prof. Charles J. Ogletree Jr. of Harvard Law School, who taught both Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, sought to dispel the idea that Mr. Obama’s nominees would be especially ideological. “It seems likely to me that he won’t have an agenda of trying to pack the courts to necessarily move it in a different direction,” Professor Ogletree said in an interview.Speculation about Supreme Court choices in a McCain presidency has included a few conservative appeals court nominees who had been considered by Mr. Bush, notably Judge Michael W. McConnell, who sits in Salt Lake City.Another candidate cited by many on the McCain advisory committee is Maureen E. Mahoney, a Washington lawyer who has argued dozens of cases successfully before the Supreme Court as a deputy solicitor general and a private practitioner. She is often compared to Chief Justice Roberts, who had also made his mark as a skilled advocate before the court.A President McCain also could reinforce his own maverick status by turning to Judge Alex Kozinski of the appeals court based in California, who is often described as a libertarian and an independent conservative.The next president will most likely have an opportunity to make an extraordinary impact on the ideological shape of the nation’s federal courts for years to come.“There’s been an ideological imbalance on the courts, given that Republicans have controlled the White House for 20 of the last 28 years,” said Prof. David A. Yalof, a lawyer and political scientist at the University of Connecticut, who has written extensively about the judicial-appointment process.A majority, about 60 percent, of the 167 judges on the nation’s 12 regional appeals courts are Republican appointees. Many were named after establishing their conservative ideological credentials through their writings or affiliations like involvement with the Federalist Society. Moreover, Professor Yalof said, the average age of Republican appellate appointees is below 60, compared with 64 for the Democratic appointees.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','“It’s like eating beyond your stomach’s capacity,” Mr. Peltier said in a recent interview. “We have huge indigestion.”Sellers confront a sober reality: There are more than 4.5 million homes on the market nationwide. The way houses are selling, it would take nearly 11 months to clear the market. The last time so many homes were for sale was in the early 1980s, when the economy was in a deep recession and interest rates were two to four times as high as they are today.For the most part, sales keep falling. Sales of existing single family homes tumbled 20 percent in the first four months of the year from the comparable period a year ago and are running at their lowest levels since 1998. Sales of new homes have fallen 42 percent over the last year. The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that sales increased 3.3 percent in April from March, when sales tumbled 11 percent, although the increase largely reflected a statistical revision to the earlier figures.In Seattle, where housing had held up better than much of the rest of the country in the last two years, home sales have slowed sharply. Sales in King County, which includes Seattle, fell more than 33 percent in April from the same month a year earlier while the number of homes for sales is up 55 percent. Prices of single-family homes have fallen about 6.5 percent from their peak in July 2007 to February, according to the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller index.As in other regions, the slowdown is hitting outlying areas first and hardest. Sales and prices are still robust in downtown Seattle and affluent suburbs like Bellevue because they are more desirable and closer to big employers like Microsoft, Starbucks and Boeing.“We are still getting multiple offers on properties there,” Phil Rodocker, a Seattle-based real estate agent, said about the downtown area and Bellevue. But “as you move south, every 10 miles south you go, you see more and more short sales and repossessed houses.”Builders are having trouble selling units in some newer condominium buildings. Mr. Rodocker got an e-mail message from one developer last week who a few months ago had quickly sold 251 units in a project under construction. Now, investors who had signed contracts to buy 40 of those units had reneged. The units in the Belltown section of Seattle are now being resold for as little as $225,950 for a one bedroom with one bathroom, prices that Mr. Rodocker said were so low as to be “ridiculous.” Last fall, one-bedroom condos in the neighborhood were selling for between $260,000 and $290,000, he said.Seeing the number of homes on the market rise and prices fall, buyers are becoming more picky and negotiating harder, he and other agents said. Basic economics would suggest that lower prices should increase demand, but if buyers expect that prices will be lower still they will wait.One of Mr. Rodocker’s clients, Dennis Humphrey, lives south of Seattle in Tukwila and has been looking to buy a home with three or four bedrooms and one or two bathrooms. Parents of 10-year-old twin boys, Mr. Humphrey and his wife live in a rental home and want a bigger place.Mr. Humphrey, who works in the home improvement division of Sears, has made offers on two homes but the sellers have refused to negotiate with him. He is willing to spend up to $300,000 and has enough money to put 20 percent down, but Mr. Humphrey said he is afraid to buy right now because he is worried prices are going to fall further and could wipe out any money he puts into a home.“I am not afraid of the monthly mortgage payment, and I am not afraid of taxes, but I am afraid of losing the value I am putting in,” he said, adding that a friend recently bought a home near San Francisco that has fallen in value by $70,000.“I believe the right deal will come along,” he added. “And I am in no rush.”While Mr. Humphrey is waiting by choice, many other buyers have essentially been locked out.Since early 2007, lenders have dramatically scaled back the easy-lending policies that powered the boom and pushed homeownership rates to nearly 70 percent in 2004, up from 68 percent at the start of the decade. Gone are the days when borrowers could get 100 percent financing to buy homes without having to provide proof of their income and assets.“Part of the increase in homeownership rate was a result of people being able to become homeowners because of easy credit,” said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Lehman Brothers. Now, “you are pricing out many people from homeownership.”Most lenders are now only making loans that conform to the standards set by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration, which all require either a substantial down payments or mortgage insurance. These government sponsored agencies are evaluating mortgage applicants more diligently and scrutinizing borrowers who have second homes or recently became self-employed, loan officers say.“Once the credit pendulum starts swinging from too easy, it never stops at neutral — it goes to too tight,” said Lou Barnes, a mortgage broker in Boulder, Colo., who said he is turning down about two applicants a week. During the boom, he rarely had to turn down borrowers.Some analysts say the scrutiny is well deserved even if it slows borrowing and home sales because it will assure better loans are made and that future gains in homeownership are sustainable. Compared to standards over a long period of time, these people say, lending guidelines are not all that conservative; it is just that the nation became accustomed to credit at very easy terms.“One could say there is less money available,” said Marc McGree, a real estate consultant outside Washington. “But today’s standards really aren’t so different from eight years ago or so, before the market over-heated.”'"

"'08-05-28,'1','Renting involves one obvious, recurring cost that can never be recouped: the monthly rent check. Buying, on the other hand, involves multiple expenses, some of which aren’t so obvious. On top of closing costs, there are repairs, property taxes, mortgage principal and mortgage interest. (The mortgage-interest tax deduction reduces this last cost but doesn’t eliminate it.) When you own, you also lose the ability to invest your down payment elsewhere, like the stock market.Of course, owning also brings benefits that have nothing to do with money. You can settle into your home, confident that no landlord will kick you out. You can repaint the walls and redo the kitchen. All else being equal, owning seems far preferable to renting.Knowing all this, my wife and I were willing to buy a house even if it was ultimately going to cost us a bit more than renting. We just weren’t willing to have it cost a lot more than renting.Over the last several years, I’ve come to like a simple, back-of-the-envelope way to compare the costs of renting and owning. You find two similar houses, one for sale and the other for rent, and divide the sale price by the annual rent. You can call the result the rent ratio.The concept will probably sound familiar to stock market investors. It’s the real estate market’s version of a price-earnings ratio — a measure of how expensive an asset is, relative to the underlying economic fundamentals. Like a P/E ratio, the rent ratio provides something of a reality check.Throughout the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, the average rent ratio nationwide hovered between 10 and 14. In the last few years, though, it broke through that historical range and hit almost 19 by the time the housing market peaked, in 2006.And while home prices — and rent ratios — have always been higher on the coasts, they reached whole new levels recently. In the Washington area, the ratio went above 20. In , New York, Los Angeles and south , it topped 25. In , it approached 35, higher than it had been in any city, at any point on record.In concrete terms, a rent ratio above 20 means that the monthly costs of ownership well exceed the cost of renting. At current mortgage rates, for example, a $500,000 house would typically bring monthly expenses of about $3,000 (taking into account taxes, repairs, a typical down payment and, yes, the mortgage deduction). When the rent ratio is 20, that same house could be rented for only about $2,000 a month.There are two problems with buying a house in this situation. The first, plainly, is the extra $1,000 you’re paying each month for the privilege of owning, on top of the thousands of dollars you spent on closing costs. The second problem is that a rent ratio above 20 is a good indication of a bubble. When the prices of houses get out of line with the competition’s prices — that is, those in the rental market — a correction is coming.The question facing my wife and me was whether we were entering the market before the correction had gone far enough. I really didn’t know what the answer would be. So as we looked at houses, I started calculating rent ratios.In the neighborhoods where we were looking, two-bedroom condominiums were selling for $400,000 and being rented for about $2,100 a month, which makes for a rent ratio of 16. Four-bedroom houses were selling for $700,000 and being rented for almost $4,000, which makes for a rent ratio of 15. No matter the price range, pretty much every apples-to-apples comparison produced a similar ratio.Historically, this is still a bit high. But it’s very different from where the market was just a couple of years ago. With house prices having fallen over the last two years and rents continuing to rise, the decision became a much closer call. We would now have to spend only a little more each month for the privilege of owning.This month, we found a house that we really liked, and we made an offer. It was accepted.I’m still not sure how good our timing was. Based on the backlog of houses on the market, I fully expect that our new house will be worth less in six months than it is today. I’m also not sure that we would have been willing to buy in Boston, New York or much of , where the rent ratios remain above 20, according to data from .In fact, if you’re now renting — almost anywhere — and do not need to move, I’d probably recommend that you wait to buy. The market is still coming your way.But it’s O.K. with me if our timing wasn’t perfect. After several years of reporting on the housing market, I’m convinced that the most common real estate mistake is viewing a house first as a financial investment and only second as a home. That’s one big reason we ended up in this bubble-induced mess.Most of the time, the decision whether to rent or buy should be based above all on life circumstances. Do you expect to move again in a couple years? Or is there a good chance that you’re ready to settle in — and stop worrying about real estate for a while?The housing bubble, unfortunately, forced a reconsideration of this standard, because houses became so overvalued. But they’re slowly coming back to reality, which means that buying has again started to make sense for more people. Apparently, I’m one of them.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','THE SCRIPT A narrator says: “1982. One of the lowest points in New Jersey political history. Frank Lautenberg bases his campaign against Millicent Fenwick on her age. She is 72. Using not-so-veiled language, Lautenberg actually says it’s O.K. for a man to make fun of a woman’s age. Now, Lautenberg will be 91 at the end of his term. 91. Newspapers have said it’s time for a change. It’s hard when your words come back to haunt you. Isn’t it, Mr. Lautenberg?”ON THE SCREEN The 30-second spot begins with the numbers “1982” flashing across the screen, followed by photo of a younger Mr. Lautenberg alongside a photo of Ms. Fenwick. Then headlines from newspapers at the time flash across the screen: “Lautenberg attacks Fenwick,” “Lautenberg boosts attacks on Fenwick” and “Lautenberg Pictures Fenwick As ‘Eccentric’ Who Can’t Do Job.” Then the number 91 flashes across the screen, as the photo of a younger Mr. Lautenberg is switched with a more current photo of an older-looking Mr. Lautenberg. That is followed by headlines from recent newspapers articles, including: “For Lautenberg, the age-old question remains.”ACCURACY Mr. Lautenberg, if re-elected, would be a few weeks short of his 91st birthday at the end of a fifth term. More important, Mr. Lautenberg never explicitly made Ms. Fenwick’s age a campaign issue when he ran against her. But he did quote former President Gerald R. Ford as saying that Mrs. Fenwick was “a little eccentric.” He also said voters would have to determine the 72-year-old senator’s fitness to serve. Both comments were viewed at the time as efforts to inject the question of her age into the race.SCORECARD After weeks of skirting the issue of Mr. Lautenberg’s age, the Andrews campaign introduced it by invoking the memory of the nasty Fenwick-Lautenberg race of 1982. The ad has already accomplished something for Mr. Andrews: It has people talking. And in addition to raising the touchy issue of age in the campaign, the ad also reminds viewers of Mr. Lautenberg’s history of bruisingly aggressive politicking.While the Lautenberg campaign dismissed the advertisement as false and desperate, the Andrews camp responded that it was holding Mr. Lautenberg to the same standard that he had held Ms. Fenwick.

"'08-05-28,'1','But Mr. McCain’s talk of nuclear cooperation with Russia raised questions about how receptive Moscow might be to Mr. McCain if he were elected, when another of the senator’s proposals — excluding Russia from the Group of Eight industrialized countries — seems sure to test relations.Mr. McCain’s remarks were his most extensive as a presidential candidate on nuclear policy and were part of his effort to advance his national security credentials compared with those of Senator Barack Obama. Although Mr. McCain touched on the subject in late March in a major foreign policy address in Los Angeles, his speech in Denver served as a marker of where a McCain administration would stand on nuclear proliferation and arms deals with the Russians.He spoke less expansively about Iran and North Korea, the two other nations whose nuclear programs will present the next president with a tough set of decisions. But he did not signal any substantive departure from the course set by Mr. Bush in dealing with those countries.Mr. McCain made some nods to the neoconservatives in his party who have advocated a tougher line in foreign policy. But his emphasis on greater engagement with Russia and his apparent willingness to continue the administration’s current policy of maintaining contact with North Korea, primarily through multilateral talks, led some analysts to describe his approach as owing more to the so-called foreign policy realists, who tend to be less hawkish and more focused on diplomacy and multilateral institutions.In his speech, Mr. McCain also departed from Bush administration policy by promising to strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty, proposing increased financing for the International Atomic Energy Agency and requiring that undisclosed transfers of sensitive nuclear technology from one country to another be deemed “illicit and subject to interdiction” and by calling for nuclear talks with China.Tactical nuclear weapons are typically short-range missiles, with a reach of as little as 300 miles, but experts consider them a threat to global security because they are small, more susceptible to theft and the least regulated of weapons covered in nuclear agreements. They represent 30 percent to 40 percent of the American and Russian arsenals.In an opinion article on Tuesday in The Wall Street Journal Asia, Mr. McCain used somewhat tougher language than the administration had been using in describing how to handle North Korea. In comments viewed within the State Department as critical, Mr. McCain, writing with his good friend, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said: “American leadership is also needed on North Korea. We must use the leverage available from the U.N. Security Council resolution passed after Pyongyang’s 2006 nuclear test to ensure the full and complete declaration, disablement and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear facilities, in a verifiable manner, which we agreed to with the other members of the six-party talks.”Mr. McCain’s aides said the language did not represent a break with the substance of Bush administration policy but reflected Mr. McCain’s insistence that the United States be able to verify effectively any agreement in which North Korea promises to abandon its nuclear weapons. Mr. McCain has long supported six-party talks — among the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia — intended to reach such a deal.In his speech in Denver, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, like his Democratic competitors, called for a world free of nuclear weapons, and cited as his model the standard bearer of the Republican Party, President Ronald Reagan.“A quarter of a century ago, President Ronald Reagan declared, ‘Our dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth,’ ” Mr. McCain said. “That is my dream, too.” He added, “It is time for the United States to show the kind of leadership the world expects from us, in the tradition of American presidents who worked to reduce the nuclear threat to mankind.”Nuclear policy experts said it was politically notable that Mr. McCain reached back to what Republicans consider the glory days of Reagan, whose views on the arms race evolved until he ultimately broke with the hardliners in his administration. More recently, the experts noted, a so-called Gang of Four of national security statesmen have called for a nuclear-free world: former Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz; former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry; and former Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee.Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton have endorsed the Gang of Four approach.Mr. Obama called last October for “a world in which there are no nuclear weapons,” a fact his campaign underscored on Tuesday. “By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama’s nonproliferation agenda today,” said a statement from Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Bill Burton, “John McCain highlighted Obama’s leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate.”Mr. McCain’s advisers said many people had had a hand in the speech, among them Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s chief foreign policy aide; Mr. Kissinger; Mr. Shultz; Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; former Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman; R. James Woolsey, a former director of the Central Intelligence Agency; Richard Burt, a former United States chief negotiator to the Start talks; and Rich Williamson, a former deputy United States ambassador to the United Nations.'"
"'08-05-28,'1','Mr. Olmert, who is formally suspected of receiving illicit funds, has described the money as legitimate contributions for election campaigns and has emphatically denied ever taking a bribe. He has not been indicted in the case but has pledged to resign if charged.After Tuesday’s deposition, politicians on the right and the left said that if Mr. Talansky were telling the truth, Mr. Olmert must go. But the prime minister, who is the focus of at least three other current police investigations, has proved a deft survivor so far.In an unusual move, the Israeli courts ruled last week that Mr. Talansky should give an early deposition even though Mr. Olmert has not been charged. Mr. Talansky, who lives in Woodsburgh in Nassau County, has been eager to return to the United States, and the Israeli authorities feared that he might not return to Israel if Mr. Olmert were put on trial.The prime minister’s lawyers tried, and failed, to prevent the early deposition, arguing that it would prejudice the case. On Tuesday they received the court’s approval to delay their cross-examination of Mr. Talansky until mid-July, by which time Mr. Talansky has promised to return.In the meantime, Eli Zohar, one of Mr. Olmert’s lawyers, urged patience and said the truth would come out in the cross-examination.While Mr. Talansky denied that he had ever expected anything in return, at times it sounded as if he had acted as Mr. Olmert’s personal A.T.M. Mr. Talansky, a fund-raiser and financier, said he would get calls from Mr. Olmert’s office manager at the time, Shula Zaken, another suspect in the case, asking for money for Mr. Olmert’s expenses during speaking tours in the United States.Mr. Talansky said that at such times he would provide $3,000 or $4,000, perhaps to get Mr. Olmert a more expensive hotel suite, or to allow him to stay an extra day or two, or to upgrade his plane ticket from business class to first.Asked by the state prosecutor, Moshe Lador, if he knew how his money was spent, Mr. Talansky said of Mr. Olmert, “I only know that he loves expensive cigars, pens, watches; I found it strange, but you know. ...” He shrugged.Mr. Talansky occasionally launched into impassioned monologues about the failings of American Jewry and his own love of Israel. He twice broke down in tears, once when Mr. Lador suggested that he might not complete his testimony in one day, and again when he accused the Israeli authorities of making him “feel like a criminal.”Mr. Talansky is being treated as a witness, but he could end up a suspect as well. Mr. Lador clarified that “no decision of any kind” had been made “about anyone involved in the case.”Late in the afternoon, Mr. Lador focused on the fall of 2005, apparently trying to establish a link between Mr. Talansky’s cash transfers and what he may have gotten in return.In late October 2005, Mr. Talansky paid $4,717 to cover Mr. Olmert’s bill for three days at the Ritz-Carlton in Washington, money that Mr. Talansky described as a loan.Less than a week later, Mr. Olmert sent a letter to Chile’s defense minister, according to Mr. Lador, who implied that it was in connection with a satellite company in which Mr. Talansky had some interest. Mr. Talansky denied knowing of the letter.Soon after, in mid-November of 2005, Mr. Olmert and Ms. Zaken made introductions for Mr. Talansky to billionaires in the hotel business to help promote Mr. Talansky’s new minibar business, Kool-Tech.But Mr. Talansky said that nothing ever worked out, and that one of the billionaires had hung up on him when he called.Finally, on Nov. 23, 2005, Mr. Talansky withdrew $15,000 in cash from a New York bank at the request of Mr. Olmert, the prosecution said.Mr. Talansky said he took the money in two Citibank envelopes to the Regency hotel, where Mr. Olmert was staying. Mr. Olmert “told me it was a loan and that he would pay me back,” Mr. Talansky said. “I said I’d like to get it returned as soon as possible. Famous last words.”Mr. Talansky said his generosity reflected “extreme, extreme admiration” for Mr. Olmert, who he believed could heal divisions between religious and secular Jews. “He represented new leadership to me,” Mr. Talansky said. “I truly loved him.”But at the same time, he said, he always felt “very, very uneasy” about having to give Mr. Olmert money in cash. “I said to myself, this is absolute insanity,” Mr. Talansky told the court, saying he had long felt that “something was wrong.”Now, he said, he is angry with Mr. Olmert. “This is no way to build a relationship or to run a country,” Mr. Talansky said.'"

No more Bill YouTube meltdowns.”“You know, Barack, the more I’m seein’ what you’ve got in mind for me, the more I’m worryin’ that Hillary’s just not cut out for this job. You don’t want her glomming on to everythin’. Since she’s almost even with the delegates, she’ll want to go halfsies in the government.

"'08-05-29,'1','From prisoner of war to politician in a hurry, it was the turning point that started Mr. McCain on the trajectory toward the Republican presidential nomination this year.After five and a half years of listening to senators’ antiwar speeches over prison camp loudspeakers, Mr. McCain came home in 1973 contemptuous of America’s elected officials, convinced Congress had betrayed the country’s fighting men by hamstringing the war effort. But in the halls of the Senate, he discovered a new calling, at once high-minded and glamorous.One of several Senate military liaisons assigned as advocates for their services and escorts for official travel, Mr. McCain quickly emerged as the senators’ favorite. He had a thick head of hair as white as his dress uniform, and he showed a natural politician’s gift for winning over an audience. He excelled at leavening official business with a spirit of fun — telling deadpan stories about his years “in the cooler,” playing marathon poker games on flights overseas or surprising senators at a refueling stop in Ireland with a side trip to Durty Nelly’s, a 17th century pub.He was the epitome of cool, one senator’s son recalled, with a pack of Marlboros in one hand and Theodore H. White’s memoir “In Search of History” in the other.Mr. McCain relished the push-and-pull of legislative battles, eventually even plunging into defense budget fights with a personal agenda that was sometimes at odds with President Jimmy Carter’s secretary of the Navy. He built personal friendships and professional collaborations across ideological divides, a hallmark of his later Senate career. And he applauded the Senate’s leading hawks as they waged what they considered an epic struggle with the Carter administration over America’s place in the post-Vietnam world.Under Mr. Tower’s tutelage, Mr. McCain turned his anger over the management of the Vietnam War into an all-or-nothing view of international conflict that became one of the few guiding principles in his otherwise unpredictable political career — from his opposition to sending Marine peacekeepers into Lebanon in 1983 to his current staunch support for the Iraq war. And when prominent conservative Christians later protested Mr. Tower’s nomination as defense secretary over accusations of drinking and womanizing, Mr. McCain’s furious counterattack opened the hostilities with that wing of his party that have persisted ever since.Mr. McCain has often said he decided to run for office because he felt his war injuries would make attaining the same rank as his father and grandfather “impossible.” But Mr. Lehman, now an adviser to the McCain campaign, and two other top Navy officers familiar with Mr. McCain’s file insist that was not the case.Instead, many who knew him say, Mr. McCain seemed bored by Navy life. “Sitting down with Anwar Sadat or Deng Xiaoping and being treated as an equal — that is pretty heady stuff,” said Rhett Dawson, a former aide to Mr. Tower who is now president of an electronics trade group. “It had opened his eyes to a much broader world.”Mr. McCain was captivated, recalled Jeffrey Record, then an aide to former Senator Sam Nunn, the hawkish Georgia Democrat. “He thrives on competition, and he thrives on political combat,” Mr. Record said. “He saw the glamour of it. I think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power.”It is unclear how long Mr. McCain has dreamed of the White House. Languishing in a North Vietnamese prison camp in 1970, he once mused aloud about the presidency, a cellmate, Richard A. Stratton, told a reporter eight years ago.But when he returned from Vietnam in March 1973, Mr. McCain was so determined to continue as a Navy pilot that in defiance of his doctors he underwent a year of excruciating physical therapy to force an injured knee back to the required range of motion.A steady trickle of other former P.O.W.’s were running for office, and Mr. McCain’s well-publicized valor as a captive had made him a minor celebrity. But he rebuffed invitations to enter politics, focusing instead on his assignment commanding a fighter squadron near Jacksonville, Fla. He blamed Congress for “willfully breaking America’s word,” he later wrote, which he considered “shameful.”But Adm. James L. Holloway, the chief of naval operations, saw other uses for Mr. McCain. Mr. Holloway knew that Mr. McCain’s father had once excelled as a Senate liaison. And though the son had earned a reputation as a playboy at the Naval academy, Mr. Holloway thought then-Commander McCain might have inherited the skills and judgment needed to deal with senators.“He could smoke a cigar and play a little poker,” Mr. Holloway recalled in an interview. “But he didn’t let the situation get out of hand. He could tag along and take care of them and pay the bills and remember where they parked the car. And he was very circumspect. He didn’t get them in trouble.”Mr. McCain, for his part, was turning 40 and unsure of his path. A shoulder injury still limited his reach, complicating his prospects as a pilot. His marriage to Carol McCain, a former model who was nearly crippled in a car accident while he was imprisoned, was coming apart. He was engaged in a series of extramarital “dalliances,” he later told his biographer, Robert Timberg.Mr. McCain, in a recent e-mail message, said he was excited about the liaison job. After his release from prison, he wrote, “almost every duty seemed enjoyable.” But some former Senate aides who knew him then say that, at first, he seemed discouraged, stuck at one of several desks in a spartan office. “He looked down and depressed,” recalled William Bader, a former aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.But Mr. McCain, promoted to captain, threw himself into courting the lawmakers who shaped Navy policy. He formed especially close friendships with two relative liberals about his age: Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican who represented a major shipbuilding state and later became defense secretary, and Senator Gary Hart, a Colorado Democrat who had managed the antiwar presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota in 1972.A trip to Asia in late 1978 cemented their bond. Mr. McCain and the two senators stole away from official briefings to stroll in the Ginza district of nightclubs and restaurants in Tokyo, visit the Temple of the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok and take a memorable midnight tour of what Mr. Hart remembered as that city’s “light and dark sides.” In a memoir, Mr. Cohen recalled drinking beer with Mr. McCain at the Hyatt Regency bar overlooking Seoul, watching beautiful Korean women seduce a tipsy traveler.“He was a salesman par excellence,” Mr. Cohen recalled in an interview, crediting Mr. McCain with redirecting his career by persuading him to join the Armed Services Committee.The three became regulars together at the Monocle, a watering hole near the Senate. “We would laugh and tell stories about our colleagues,” Mr. Hart recalled. “ ‘So-and-so said something in a caucus meeting.’ He found it fascinating.”In turn, Mr. McCain helped Mr. Hart become an officer in the Navy Reserves. For Mr. Cohen, Mr. McCain became a model for the P.O.W.-politician heroes of two novels the Maine senator later wrote. After Mr. McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley at a Honolulu bar on another trip in 1979, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Hart were groomsmen at the couple’s wedding the following year.Mr. McCain later said that he was inspired to seek public office in part by the example of Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, the staunch cold warrior who led the defection to the right of the foreign policy thinkers now known as neoconservatives.“Thank God for Scoop Jackson,” Mr. McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir, “Worth the Fighting For.” “Without his courage, I doubt we would have recovered from Vietnam as quickly as we did, which would have left those who sacrificed there all the more haunted by the futility of the experience.”The strait-laced “soda-pop Jackson” sometimes brought his school-age children along on official trips, and Mr. McCain played baby sitter. But Mr. Jackson never went in for the kind of camaraderie Mr. McCain enjoyed with Mr. Hart and Mr. Cohen.In Mr. Tower, however, Mr. McCain found both a social companion and a political mentor. “Tower treated him like a son,” recalled I. N. Kiland, one of Mr. McCain’s colleagues in the liaison office. “And John idolized John Tower.” (Mr. McCain, in his memoir, acknowledged the “familial” comparisons.)Mr. Tower was a high-living political powerhouse. But he was also a former Navy man who had served under Mr. McCain’s grandfather in World War II and was so sentimental about his service that he stayed in the reserves through his Senate career and packed his uniform for every trip abroad, his aides said.One of Mr. McCain’s first jobs as liaison was accompanying a delegation Mr. Tower led to the Wehrkunde conference, an annual security meeting in Munich during the Bavarian equivalent of Mardi Gras. The conference became known as kind of senatorial spring break.The event has grown “a lot tamer” since the late ’70s, recalled Mr. Cohen, who described the heyday of the conference vividly in his novel, “Dragon Fire”: “Beer and passions flowed. All restrictions were off. Grounds for divorce were suspended. Members of Congress, particularly the unmarried ones, would look at the German women, who were ready and willing for the taking, and think they had slipped the surly bonds of moral conformity.”In Washington, Mr. Tower began summoning Mr. McCain for a drink at the end of the day. And when they traveled, Mr. McCain took charge of supplying Mr. Tower’s hotel rooms with Johnnie Walker Black. One night at a hotel in Saudi Arabia, one of many Middle Eastern countries where alcohol is banned, Mr. McCain amused his patron by leaving empty bottles for the authorities to find outside the room of a group of Frenchmen — a prank Mr. Tower later delighted at recounting.The Texan also influenced Mr. McCain’s approach to politics. Mr. Tower, who as a graduate student in London had studied the prewar British Conservative Party, saw in President Carter shades of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement, his former aides recalled. As the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Tower hammered Mr. Carter over the hostages in Iran, support for Taiwan, SALT II and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan — debates Mr. Tower and other hawks saw as skirmishes in a larger battle over whether America would shrink from confrontation or return to the offensive after Vietnam.“McCain was a rapt student,” said Mr. Dawson, the former Tower aide. “He followed the debates, and he would take part in them in ways that went way beyond his position as bag-carrier or representative of the Navy.”Mr. Tower was so close to his protégé that he sometimes raised eyebrows by including Mr. McCain in committee staff meetings that were closed to other military liaisons, Mr. Kiland said. His close ties with Mr. Tower, in turn, helped Mr. McCain earn high marks from his Navy bosses, although with some reservations about his grasp for details.“Sometimes you had to really explain things to him and put him in a context that he really appreciated,” said former Adm. George Kinnear, Captain McCain’s Pentagon superior. “But he was a hard worker once he bought off on an issue.”Mr. McCain, with his fame and family, would circumvent the Navy’s chain of command for senators with issues like fighting a base closure, pushing for a new Navy hospital or helping a local contractor, aides said. “McCain had a big Rolodex, we used to say,” recalled Michael Hastings, a former Cohen aide. “He could really deliver for senators on both sides of the aisle.”Over time, Captain McCain also became a minor political player in his own right, sometimes working against the Navy’s official position under the Carter administration. To agitate for laws boosting military pay, former aides said, Mr. McCain steered senators on a trip to Norfolk, Va., toward Navy seamen collecting food stamps. And when the secretary of the Navy declined to replace a giant aircraft carrier, Mr. McCain collected information inside the Navy for lobbyists pushing to build a new one, eventually helping to override a presidential veto.In his e-mail message, Mr. McCain said he had only been exercising his responsibility to provide senators “the latest and most accurate information.” But former Adm. Clarence A. Hill Jr., then a lobbyist for a new carrier working with Mr. McCain, said: “He was going behind the back of the secretary of the Navy. It is as simple as that.”Mr. McCain said in his e-mail message that he had found his Navy job “rewarding and fascinating until my last day of service,” but his former colleagues say that by 1980 they knew he was wrestling with his future.“There was always this question, ‘Didn’t he want to be an admiral like his father and grandfather?’ ’ Mr. Hastings recalled. “He would say, ‘I don’t think that is what I want to do with the rest of my life.’ ”Navy psychiatrists offered another explanation. Mr. McCain had long struggled to escape “the shadow of his father,” Dr. P. F. O’Connell wrote in Mr. McCain’s Navy file after his return from Vietnam. But his hero’s homecoming had liberated him, bringing a “smile of fulfillment and relief” when he first heard Admiral McCain introduced as “Commander McCain’s father.” Dr. O’Connell wrote: “He had arrived.”Finally, in the spring of 1981, Mr. McCain told his father that he was leaving the Navy.His Senate friends were already moving to jump-start Mr. McCain’s new career. Mr. Cohen connected Mr. McCain with an experienced political consultant, J. Brian Smith, who had initially dismissed working for such a neophyte. And, Mr. Cohen said, he also encouraged Mr. McCain to look away from his previous home in Florida and toward Arizona. His new wife came from a prominent family there, a safe Republican House seat was expected to open up, and Senator Barry Goldwater was expected to retire soon.Mr. Tower did more than anyone else to help. He lent Mr. McCain his fund-raising consultant, raised money for him and enlisted one of Arizona’s most popular Republicans to endorse Mr. McCain over two more experienced primary candidates. “Whatever I asked him for, he gave without hesitation,” Mr. McCain recalled.He won his House seat in 1982, a year after he left the Navy, and his Senate seat four years later. Mr. Tower retired in 1985, but their paths crossed again when the Texan was nominated to be secretary of defense by President George Bush. The influential Christian conservative organizer Paul M. Weyrich accused Mr. Tower of public drunkenness and philandering, imperiling his confirmation. A chorus of others echoed the charges.Mr. McCain was stunned at the Senate’s outrage. “There were too many hearty drinkers around the place who might not always have been the most exemplary of devoted spouses to begrudge John his vices,” he wrote in a chapter of his memoirs. “The sins Tower was accused of were hardly Washington novelties.”Leaping to his mentor’s defense, Mr. McCain denounced Mr. Weyrich as a holier-than-thou hypocrite, scrambled to discredit the charges and exploded in fits of rage at colleagues. At Mr. Tower’s defeat, Mr. McCain choked back tears.“God bless you, John Tower,” he said from the Senate floor. “You’re a damn fine sailor.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','The new policy was meant to head off embarrassing questions about connections of members of the McCain campaign to special interests that run counter to Mr. McCain’s reformist reputation. But adhering to that standard has proved complicated.The new rules were prompted this month in part by revelations that Craig Shirley, a consultant to the campaign, was also paid by a 527 group that was criticizing Mr. Obama. Mr. Shirley stepped down from his role on Mr. McCain’s Virginia leadership team.Vets for Freedom put out its first advertisement last Friday, featuring an Iraq war veteran saying Mr. Obama “hasn’t once sat down one on one with our commander in Iraq, General Petraeus,” adding: “Worse, he hasn’t been to Iraq in two-and-a-half years. He’s unwilling to get the facts on Iraq, yet he’s willing to travel to Iran to meet their leader, or anyone else who hates our country.” The veterans group’s latest commercial continued on the same theme.Vets for Freedom is not organized as a 527, which refers to a section of the tax code. The designation often carries a negative connotation because of the attacks of 527 groups like Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in the 2004 campaign. Instead, Vets for Freedom is organized as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, an increasingly common tactic for outside groups seeking to get involved in campaigns.The group also has a political action committee, which financed the Internet advertisements.“We are not supporting the candidacy or opposing the candidacy of anybody,” Pete Hegseth, the group’s chairman, said. “We’re merely asking serious questions about a sitting senator.”Mr. Hegseth said the advisory board that Mr. Graham and Mr. Lieberman served on is “honorary” in nature and is “not involved in any day-to-day operations or strategic decision-making.”Political action committees and other independent groups are barred from coordinating with campaigns.Mr. Hegseth, however, was also identified in a January news release from the McCain campaign as a member of its Virginia leadership team. But Mr. Hegseth said that was a mistake and that he had not been aware of his name being on the list, pointing out he has never lived in Virginia.The group’s founder, Wade Zirkle, is also identified as a member of Mr. McCain’s Virginia leadership team. Another member of the group’s policy board is Max Boot, an outside foreign policy adviser to the McCain campaign.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','These confidential findings could set the stage for a negotiated settlement, Mr. Austell said, particularly if the trade organization sent a clear signal that subsidies for civil aircraft were illegal.The ripples may extend beyond the United States and Europe — to Brazil, China, Japan and other countries that are seeking to build their aircraft industry as more of their residents can afford to travel.“With other countries aspiring to build large civil aircraft,” he said, “these cases are even more important to the future of the industry than they were when they were filed.”Other specialists, though, argue that whatever the W.T.O. decides, governments will always find ways to funnel money to expensive, but politically popular, civil aircraft programs.“They can reconfigure aid packages in different ways,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aircraft analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. “The W.T.O. only rules on a specific configuration.”The discussions of support for the A350 already reflect this reality. Speaking at an air show in Berlin on Tuesday, the German deputy economics minister, Peter Hintze, said the state backers of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the corporate parent of Airbus, had agreed to provide financial aid for the A350 within the confines of the impending legal decision.“We granted such loans for the development of the A380,” Mr. Hintze said, according to Bloomberg News. “We agree in principle that we will also do so with the A350, clearly complying with the rules of the World Trade Organization.”On Wednesday, Airbus sought to clarify its position, saying it had not formally requested financing.“There is no request whatsoever,” a spokeswoman, Barbara Kracht, said. “What was discussed was that in order to achieve a level playing field, we should look into possibilities of W.T.O.-compliant means.”Lawyers for Boeing said they would be curious to see what form this takes, though in fact, there are many ways to finance planes.The European Union, for example, contends that Boeing has received $23 billion in aid since 1992 in the form of Pentagon research and development grants, tax incentives from states like Washington, and subsidies to suppliers of aircraft parts from the Japanese government.The state backers of Airbus — Britain, France, Germany and Spain — typically financed a third of the development costs of planes through low-cost loans known as launch aid. The United States argues that this aid — more than $15 billion — gave Airbus an unfair advantage over Boeing.As a practical matter, few analysts believe Airbus can afford the 11.6 billion euro, or $18.1 billion, in development costs for the A350 without some kind of help. Although Airbus has accumulated a lot of cash from record sales of its airplanes, that boom is likely to be coming to an end.Mr. Aboulafia said he figured that the heaviest expenditures at Airbus for the A350 — around 2013, when the plane is scheduled to be introduced — would coincide with the low ebb in its production cycle. By then, he predicted, Boeing will turn out 447 planes a year, compared with 296 for Airbus.The W.T.O. is unlikely to be moved by the ups and downs of Boeing or Airbus, lawyers said.Boeing has won hundreds of orders for the 787, putting the A350 at a disadvantage. On the other hand, EADS and its American partner, Northrop Grumman, stung Boeing by winning a $35 billion contract from the Air Force to supply aerial refueling tankers. And both Boeing and Airbus have suffered embarrassing production delays with their newest planes.What may follow this long-awaited ruling, lawyers said, is an even longer debate over what constitutes improper support.“Even offers of W.T.O.-consistent financing could be a concern,” Mr. Austell of Boeing said, “since the European Commission and Airbus have argued that launch aid is W.T.O.-consistent.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','A longstanding assumption of American energy policy has been that natural gas would be plentiful abroad, and therefore readily available for importation, as production falls off in North America, where many fields are tapped out.But some experts are starting to question that idea, saying natural gas could be subject to the same explosion in overseas demand that has made oil so expensive.As it is, the supertankers that were supposed to deliver cargoes of gas from Africa and the Middle East to the United States are taking them to places like Spain and Japan instead, pushing up gas prices and depleting the nation’s stockpiles as the hurricane season approaches.“A few years ago people looked at L.N.G. as a solution to North America’s gas needs,” said Nikos Tsafos, an analyst with PFC Energy, a consulting firm. “But today we see that there is less L.N.G. around than people expected, and there is more competition for that L.N.G. from markets that are willing to pay more than the United States.”Not long ago, Cheniere was a darling of Wall Street. It was widely praised for having the vision to plan four new liquefied gas terminals around the Gulf of Mexico to connect the country with supplies of natural gas from places like Nigeria and Egypt, gas once considered so worthless it was burned off.Now the company’s stock price has sunk from $40 to just over $5 since last fall.“The question that people ask is if L.N.G. doesn’t come to the United States for another year or two or three, what is going to happen to Cheniere,” acknowledged Charif Souki, the chief executive officer of the company.While natural gas prices in the United States have spiked to over $11.80 per thousand cubic feet from $7.50 at the beginning of the year, the price that gas producers can draw in many other countries in the world is several dollars higher. All they need are terminals in producing countries that can chill natural gas to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit for shipping across oceans and terminals in consuming countries that can regasify cargoes.Just about the only place where demand for L.N.G. seems not to be growing is the United States, an abrupt shift from expectations as little as one year ago.The Sabine Pass terminal was part of an estimated $7 billion construction of eight new L.N.G. receiving terminals being built around the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Coast over the last five years to guarantee plentiful domestic supplies. With imports about 40 percent of the level of a year ago, and national receiving terminal capacity poised to double this year, the excess construction of import capacity has alarmed industry executives.However the executives predict that it is only a matter of time before the white elephants begin to look like a more robust breed. They say American gas suppliers will eventually be willing to pay the higher world prices on the spot market, especially if a gas shortage ensues after a punishing hurricane season or frigid winter.They also predict future American consumption of natural gas is poised to increase because of hardening opposition to building new coal-fired electricity generating plants and delays in new nuclear plants. “Over time, we will need to start importing more gas,” said Darcel L. Hulse, president of Sempra LNG, a division of Sempra Energy, which is building receiving terminals in Mexico and Louisiana. “We will not have enough.”That was the thinking that spurred the L.N.G. expansion in the United States in the first place. At the beginning of the decade, government officials and energy experts predicted a decline in domestic natural gas production as conventional fields on-shore and in the Gulf of Mexico declined. Companies like Cheniere, Sempra Energy and Exxon Mobil began snapping up coastal land and requesting regulatory approval for scores of terminals. Several other terminals were taken out of mothballs and expanded.But recently domestic natural gas production has been stronger than expected and events abroad have drawn L.N.G. from the United States to countries that needed it more.Last July an earthquake in Japan forced the closing of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant, which in turn has forced Japanese utilities to import huge amounts of L.N.G.World L.N.G. supplies grew even more scarce because of a persistent drought in Spain that has crimped that country’s hydroelectric capacity, forcing the Spanish to increase L.N.G. imports.Prices in Asia and Europe have soared, as producers have sold more supply on the spot market where prices are higher than those in traditional long term contracts.World demand for natural gas has grown about 2.6 percent a year over the last decade, but in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa it has averaged 7 percent over the same period, according to a recent UBS report. Growth in the developing world is expected to be supported in the years ahead by a construction boom in refineries and power and petrochemical plants.Supplies of L.N.G. are going to grow in the next few years, but experts say they will not be enough to satisfy the growing demand. Liquefaction plant projects that prepare the gas for shipping in producing nations like Nigeria and Russia are being delayed and even shelved because of political turbulence, cost overruns and increasing domestic demand for gas in their own countries. Production in one major terminal in Indonesia is sliding because of a declining field, and production in another in Norway is facing mechanical difficulties.With L.N.G. providing only about 3 percent of total American natural gas consumption in recent years, the fall in L.N.G. imports has made few headlines. But some experts say those responsible for importing gas are making a mistake by not buying more L.N.G. at current prices.They warn that the failure to import more L.N.G. is leaving natural gas reserves precariously low should the country be hit by a harsh hurricane season or cold winter. They say low L.N.G. imports have helped push American natural prices higher, just not high enough to match the prices of Europe and Asia whose ability to produce and store gas is far inferior to the United States.Andrew D. Grams, head of North American power and gas trading at Deutsche Bank, said the United States may eventually pay dearly for not importing more L.N.G. now. He calculated that given the reduced L.N.G. imports and expected energy use through the summer, the country will have only 3.1 trillion cubic feet of gas in storage at the end of October — almost 1 trillion cubic feet below full storage.“Under a normal scenario, that’s just barely enough to get through winter,” Mr. Grams said. “It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that we may not get enough L.N.G. supply in the United States unless our pricing structure becomes more competitive with the rest of the world.”Natural gas, unlike oil, is still a regional commodity and its price is only loosely connected to world oil benchmark prices. But L.N.G. has tied regional markets closer, and the arc of natural gas prices appears to be following close behind oil in recent months because of tightening L.N.G. supplies.The same increases in the prices of steel and other materials and shortages in labor that are making it more expensive to explore for oil are making L.N.G. development more costly too. Meanwhile, countries that produce oil and gas like Libya and Algeria are replacing their oil-powered electricity plants with natural gas-burning plants. That way, they are able to export more oil, which costs less to ship than L.N.G.“The value of gas to you is what people are willing to pay for the oil you are exporting,” said Don Hertzmark, a consultant who has advised several oil companies on L.N.G. projects. “At that point, the gas is worth a lot of money.”Nevertheless hopes for L.N.G. still survive here. The secretary of energy, Samuel W. Bodman, and a Cajun zydeco band came last month to celebrate the opening of the Sabine Pass terminal, and a tanker delivered L.N.G. from Nigeria for testing purposes.Workers are testing generators and painting and building five huge storage tanks, each capable of providing a full day’s supply of gas for Louisiana. Tugboat crews are practicing for any future cargo arrivals.“I know the L.N.G. will come and we’ll make a profit on this,” said Darron Granger, a Cheniere senior vice president. “I just can’t say when.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','By the end of the business day on Wednesday, the state had received 40 applications from stations wanting to charge for gasoline in half-gallon increments. There is a backlog of up to 17 weeks for the replacement machines from various companies, so state officials expect half-gallon pricing to be around for about five months.“It’s an interim fix to this problem,” said Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. “There is a national shortage of these computing devices.”There was little rush to get the new pumps until a few months ago, when gasoline prices kept climbing. As prices blew past $4 this month, stations with older pumps turned into bargains overnight for drivers lucky enough to spot them.Of course, what the drivers saved, the owners lost. Mr. Staiano said his profits were trimmed by 6 cents to 8 cents a gallon when the pumps were stuck at $3.99 (and 9/10). That is why he began charging by the half-gallon a couple of days ago, when, he said, state officials told him an approval was imminent.“I could absorb it for a little while,” he said. “But we’re not here to lose money.”The state previously let stations charge by the half-gallon in the fall of 2005, when gas prices passed $2.99, but only for 90 days. This time, prices have risen so high so quickly that the manufacturers of the replacement parts have been unable to keep up. Mr. Staiano has sent a $1,000 deposit for his new pump computers to U.S. Petroleum Equipment in Combined Locks, Wis.The gauges in the older gas pumps are computers but look more like the innards of an old adding machine or cuckoo clock. Gears of different sizes spin at different speeds depending on the digits they represent. Station attendants flick tabs to change the digits, which are written on hard black rubber spools. The digit representing $2 on one of Mr. Staiano’s pumps was written in what looked like white-out.Mr. Staiano called his older pumps, which were bought in the 1980s, “war horses” because they rarely break or lose their calibration. New digital pumps that accept credit cards and sell multiple brands of fuel can cost as much as $15,000 each. But because 80 percent of his customers pay cash, Mr. Staiano said, the investment is not worth it.The higher gas prices go, the more often stations have to repair pump computers, according to Robert Renkes, the executive vice president of the Petroleum Equipment Institute, a trade group in Tulsa, Okla., that represents manufacturers of station equipment.While gasoline is still dispensed at no more than 10 gallons a minute, higher prices mean the mechanical equipment must spin faster to keep up, leading to more problems.“When gas was a dollar a gallon, the penny wheel went to a dollar in one minute,” Mr. Renkes said. “But anything that goes four times faster is going to wear out quicker.”For now, Mr. Staiano has placed yellow tape on his pumps alerting customers that the prices are for half-gallons. He also tells them when they first pull in that the price on the meter would be doubled. Customers using credit cards on Wednesday paid $4.15 a gallon, lower than at many stations in the area. Those using cash paid $4.05, since Mr. Staiano did not have to turn over 2 percent or more to the credit-card companies.“I know he’s trying to keep it reasonable,” said Mary Romano, a regular customer. “But he’s in business to make money.”'"

"'08-05-29,'1','Stocks rose for a second day as a rebound in oil prices set off a late-day rally in energy shares, and a better-than-forecast report on durable goods orders lifted industrial companies.Exxon Mobil, the nation’s largest oil company, led gains in 34 of 36 energy companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index after oil erased a decline of more than $2 a barrel. Caterpillar and Alcoa helped send the Dow Jones industrial average higher after the government said durable goods orders, excluding transportation, unexpectedly increased in April.The S.& P. 500-banks index erased half its retreat after falling below its lowest closing level since 2000 on forecasts of more charges from bad debts at KeyCorp.The S.& P. 500 added 5.49 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,390.84.

"'08-05-29,'1','Stout and tattooed, with long gray hair and beard, Mr. Devlin is the embodiment of the transition of the Woodstock generation into the AARP generation. But he figures that if Woodstock is about nostalgia, it’s about more than nostalgia, too.“Is it over yet?” he asked. “We’re still here talking. We’ve now got this wonderful museum, but I don’t call it a museum, I call it a time capsule. And without me getting too political, a lot of the same ingredients are still the same — we’ve got a war, we have civil rights, we have women’s issues. Back then, we got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I don’t know if this can be recreated, but something like it can happen again. We’re back in the ’50s, man. The reason we’re all here is because we’re not all there.”Which is not to say that the museum, housed in a lovely laminated wood structure built by a company that long ago built Mr. Yasgur’s silos, tries to be the personification of the Woodstock ethos, whatever that was. Centered on a 6,728-square-foot permanent gallery, it’s part of Alan Gerry’s re-creation of Woodstock not as a vehicle for peace and love but as a vehicle for Sullivan County’s economic development. The site has become a $100 million arts center with a 15,000-seat outdoor performance space.And along with voices marveling about how much fun they had in the mud or how Woodstock changed the world, we get to hear old Nixon-era stalwarts lambasting all that Woodstock has come to stand for. “The ’60s were just a terrible time for the country,” says former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, the biggest downer in a chorus of voices, yea and nay, that museumgoers hear after a 21-minute film of music from the concert. “It was the age of selfishness. It was the age of self-indulgence. It was the age of anti-authority, an age in which people did all kind of wrong things. That was the start, really, of the drug problem in the United States.”But yea or nay, and it’s mostly yea, the most striking thing about the museum is the way that in the end, it’s less about the famous concert and yoga in the mud than about the era that the concert has come to represent.“When I came to this project, there was this idea to memorialize the concert, which was about as far as it had gone,” said Patrick Gallagher, president of the firm that designed the museum. “And I said, ‘If it’s just a celebration of a celebration, what’s the purpose?’ And the more we peeled back the onion the more it was clear that the idea wanted to be Woodstock as the culminating moment, the capstone of the 1960s. We had to look back to look forward.”So about 60 percent of the museum is about the politics and culture and music of the ’60s: pillbox hats, Elvis, the Bay of Pigs, the Beatles, civil rights, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., and Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. And the rest is a quite vivid re-creation of the chaotic and unlikely process that led to 500,000 people shouting, “No rain, no rain, no rain,” during the summer downpours, Jimi Hendrix’s legendary performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” and all the rest.As for the music, Mr. Sebastian said that in the end, some was revelatory and a lot was something of a mess. “No matter what we say after the fact, most of us disliked our performances at Woodstock,” he said. “I can find you a quick dozen people who would look back on that performance and say, ‘Oh, man, I bit the big one.’ ” But as for the event, he said, he went home knowing that he had been a part of history.He wonders why, if people love Woodstock so much, they don’t find ways to act on the things about it that matter. “It evaporated so fast,” he said. “One minute we were there and the next we were in Reagan-land.”Still, he said, as one of the voices in the exhibit: “I guess it did give you the illusion of infinite possibilities. And maybe that’s the part that we have to say bye-bye to. Because that can’t be for your whole life or for every moment in history that you might happen to live through.”As for saying bye-bye to Woodstock, not a chance. The museum opens a year before the 40th anniversary, probably the last big milestone at which most of the musicians will be able to perform without walkers. They’re just beginning to draw up plans, but Mr. Meese notwithstanding, don’t expect it to come and go quietly.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','While the report did not go into the precise causes of each ranking, it provided hints at the factors that correlated with higher or lower scores. Population density and the availability of rail transportation were associated with lower per capita carbon emissions; the Los Angeles area is the most densely populated in the country, according to Brookings figures.Other metropolitan areas in the top 25 included Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, New Haven, Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Rochester.Also associated with high rankings were government policies that promoted energy efficiency, particularly electricity rate-setting policies. Rate-setting by state regulators has traditionally been geared to make more money for a utility if it sells more electricity. While rates may remain relatively low, pleasing customers, utilities have little incentive to encourage energy conservation.“The worst footprints are in the traditionally regulated states,” said Marilyn A. Brown, a professor of energy policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who is one of the report’s three authors. “Utilities are reacting to what turns a profit for their shareholders,” and get no economic benefit from conservation, Dr. Brown said.The Washington metropolitan area ranked No. 100 in per capita residential carbon emissions and No. 89 on the overall list; also in the bottom 25 over all were the Augusta, Ga., Birmingham, Ala., Knoxville, Tenn., Nashville, Oklahoma City and St. Louis metropolitan areas.“The Washington, D.C., metro area’s residential electricity footprint was 10 times larger than Seattle’s footprint in 2005,” the report said. “The mix of fuels used to generate electricity in Washington includes high-carbon sources like coal while Seattle draws its energy primarily from essentially carbon-free hydropower.”By contrast, California set extensive energy efficiency requirements for home appliances; per capita energy use has remained largely flat in the state for 30 years. This factor, combined with its low-carbon electricity and warmer climate, were the most likely reasons that 8 of 10 California metropolitan areas ranked in the top 25 on the Brookings list.Among the report’s recommendations was a change in federal law that would require home sellers to disclose the annual energy costs of the dwelling in the years before the sale.The combination of transportation and residential emissions data sometimes masked the forces driving a region’s per capita carbon emissions up or down.For instance, the proximity of a port, with its related freight traffic, depressed the overall scores of some areas, including Jacksonville (No. 80 over all) and Sarasota, Fla. (No. 81) and the Riverside-San Bernardino area east of Los Angeles (No. 32).Considering only residential emissions, Jacksonville and Sarasota ranked Nos. 42 and 46, respectively; the Riverside area ranked No. 4. But both Florida areas have ports, and the Riverside area is the destination of many trucks carrying freight from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. All three ranked near the bottom on the list of transportation-related carbon emissions per capita.The measurement system was created by three Brookings authors — Dr. Brown, Frank Southworth, who is on the senior research staff at Oakridge National Laboratory, and Andrea Sarzynski of the Brookings Institution.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','DOES Barack Obama have a problem with the white working class? Despite the ubiquity of the term during this presidential campaign, it’s hard to say what, exactly, “working class” means. If you define class by education, which is polled more consistently than occupation or income, Mr. Obama certainly seems to have trouble with these crucial swing voters. In almost every Democratic primary, he has lost white voters who didn’t graduate from college to Hillary Clinton. But that doesn’t mean those voters will snub him in the fall.First, there is no relationship between how candidates perform among any particular group of voters in primaries and how they do with that segment in the general election. In 1992, Bill Clinton lost college-educated voters to Paul Tsongas in the early competitive primaries, but he went on to win that group in November by the largest margin any Democrat ever had. Similarly, John Kerry lost young voters in the competitive primaries in 2004 before going on to win them by a record margin in the general election.Second, Democrats running for president have been losing white, non-college-educated voters since before Mr. Obama was elected to the Illinois legislature. Al Gore and Mr. Kerry each failed to win a majority of this bloc in the general election. With these voters, the size of the losing margin is what matters.Mr. Gore lost them by 17 percentage points while winning the national popular vote. Mr. Kerry lost them by 23 points and the country by fewer than two and a half points. The last Democrat to win white, non-college voters was Bill Clinton, who carried them by a single point in the three-way races in 1992 and 1996.By comparison, Mr. Obama is only two percentage points behind John McCain among these voters in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll. Another recent survey shows him down seven points.In other words, Mr. Obama is faring better today with the white working class than did either Mr. Gore or Mr. Kerry.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','MILAN — A top Italian terrorism investigator on Wednesday described the government’s ease in unraveling an alleged C.I.A. operation to kidnap a radical imam: all that was necessary, the investigator said, was to trace the cellphones in use near the spot in Milan where the imam disappeared while going to a mosque in February 2003.“The evidence led us to believe that the operative group consisted of Americans,” the investigator, Bruno Megale, the head of Milan’s antiterrorism police force, told a packed court. “Some of the phones had called numbers in the United States, some had called the state of Virginia,” where the Central Intelligence Agency has its headquarters.During a courtroom break, the prosecutor, Armando Spataro, suggested that the few steps needed to uncover the American operation could indicate that the people involved felt they had “some sort of impunity,” noting the number of Italian officials also accused in the kidnapping.Mr. Megale spoke on the second day of testimony in the trial of 26 Americans — all but one identified as C.I.A. operatives — charged in the disappearance of the imam, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, known as Abu Omar, as part of the contentious American program of “extraordinary rendition,” in which terrorism suspects are kidnapped on foreign soil. In this case, the Americans are accused of whisking Mr. Nasr to his native Egypt, where he claims he was repeatedly beaten and tortured.The case is sensitive in the United States as the first trial dissecting the extraordinary rendition program and also here in Italy, since several top Italian officials — including the nation’s former spy chief, Nicolò Pollari — have also been charged. The question is how high up in the Italian government — led then, as now, by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi — any approval went.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','The Dow Chemical Company, the chemical giant, said Wednesday that it would raise its prices by up to 20 percent almost immediately to offset the soaring cost of energy, and the company’s chief executive criticized Washington for failing to develop a sound energy policy.“For years, Washington has failed to address the issue of rising energy costs and, as a result, the country now faces a true energy crisis, one that is causing serious harm to America’s manufacturing sector and all consumers of energy,” Andrew N. Liveris, Dow Chemical’s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement.Dow Chemical’s spiraling costs are “forcing difficult discussions with customers,” he said.The company, based in Midland, Mich., supplies a broad swath of industries, from agriculture to health care, and any sizable price jumps would likely affect almost all of them.The price increases will take effect Sunday and will be based on a product’s exposure to rising costs. Dow Chemical said it spent $8 billion on energy and hydrocarbon-based feedstock, or raw materials, in 2002 and that could climb fourfold to $32 billion this year.Dow Chemical makes products ranging from the propylene glycols used in antifreeze, coolants, solvents, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals to acrylic acid-based products used in detergents, wastewater-treatment and disposable diapers.'"
"'08-05-29,'1','PARIS — As protests against the soaring cost of fuel threatened to widen in Europe, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain warned on Wednesday that the world confronted a global shock caused by skyrocketing oil prices.“The global economy is facing the third great oil shock of recent decades,” Mr. Brown said in an article published in The Guardian newspaper and on his Web site (www.pm.gov.uk).The challenge, he wrote, demanded “global solutions” that should top the agenda of the forthcoming G-8 summit of industrialized nations in Japan.“There is no easy answer to the global oil problem without a comprehensive international strategy,” Mr. Brown said.“As continuing high oil prices present us all with an immense challenge,” he said, “the way we confront these issues will define our era.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','PARIS — Sixty years after the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, governments in scores of countries still torture or mistreat their people, Amnesty International said Wednesday in a report that again urged the United States to close down the Guantánamo Bay detention camp in Cuba.In its annual report, the London-based human rights watchdog said “flashpoints” in Darfur, Zimbabwe, Gaza, Iraq/ and Myanmar “demand immediate action.”“World leaders are in a state of denial but their failure to act has a high cost,” Irene Khan, the secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement accompanying the report. “As Iraq and Afghanistan show, human rights problems are not isolated tragedies, but are like viruses than can infect and spread rapidly, endangering all of us.”The report singled out for criticism China, the United States, and Russia and accused the European Union of complicity in the rendition of terrorism suspects. The European Union, it said, must “set the same bar on human rights for its own members as it does for other countries.”It urged Washington to close down the Guantánamo facility and other “secret detention centers,” and to “prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','Thousands of companies, large and small, embraced the ensuing tax benefits by creating employee stock ownership plans, known as ESOPs. U.S. Sugar, the largest American producer of cane sugar, took its stock off the public market in the transaction that created its ESOP, in 1983.Nearly 95 percent of the country’s 10,000 ESOPs are now at privately held companies, like U.S. Sugar. Because their shares are not publicly traded, there is no market price. So workers cash out shares without knowing what the price would be on an open market.The former employees accuse U.S. Sugar insiders — descendants of the industrialist Charles Stewart Mott — of scheming to enrich themselves by buying back workers’ shares on the cheap. They say “the principal actor” is William S. White, the company’s longtime chairman, who is married to Mr. Mott’s granddaughter. They also say he improperly exerted his influence as chairman of the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, whose mission is to advance human rights and fight poverty and which holds a big stake in U.S. Sugar.“They robbed us,” said Loretta Weeks, who worked in U.S. Sugar’s lab, testing sucrose levels in cane juice. “It’s like the last 15 years we were working for nothing.”U.S. Sugar said in a statement that the lawsuit had no merit and that the company would vigorously contest it, but it did not respond to any specific accusations.Through his lawyer, Mr. White denied that he had improperly exerted control over the U.S. Sugar board, or that the Mott Foundation had anything to do with the decision not to sell to the outside investor. The lawyer, H. Douglas Hinson, also said that Mr. White and the Mott Foundation had no role in deciding what price employees received for their stock, because the price was set in an independent appraisal.Members of Congress tried to prevent disputes over the fair market value of shares in employee stock plans by requiring private companies to get independent appraisals each year. But workers at U.S. Sugar say the chairman and his allies withheld crucial information from the appraiser and artificially depressed the share price, something the chairman denies. The employees do not accuse the appraiser of wrongdoing.To document their claims, the former workers cite two offers to buy U.S. Sugar for $293 a share — offers that came as the workers were being cashed out of their shares by the company for as little as $194 a share. The worker-owners were not told about these outside offers and had no chance to tender their shares. They found out only through word of mouth, after the board of U.S. Sugar had rejected both offers.As retiring workers cash out their shares, the company then retires their stock. That leaves fewer shares outstanding over time, the lawsuit says, allowing the insiders’ control of U.S. Sugar to grow, without their having to spend a penny buying stock. In this way, Mr. White’s immediate family increased its stake in U.S. Sugar by 19 percent from 2000 to 2005, the lawsuit says.The Charles Stewart Mott Foundation issued a statement saying that as a major U.S. Sugar shareholder, it was confident that U.S. Sugar’s board had “acted responsibly and within its duties.” It also said the workers’ lawsuit contained accusations that were inaccurate.While they wait for their lawsuit to inch through federal court, U.S. Sugar’s former employees say they are struggling to get by on fewer retirement dollars than they should have received. Many are former field workers, machine operators and mechanics, paid by the hour and living in one of Florida’s poorest counties. Some said the disputed stock plan was their sole retirement nest egg.“I had to go back to work,” said Randy Smith, who retired last year after 25 years as a welder and machinist. He was only 55, but said U.S. Sugar had forced him to retire after declaring him no longer qualified to do his job. The company has been cutting staff aggressively for several years.Mr. Smith said he cashed out of the retirement plan for about $90,000, but could have received about $53,000 more, if he had had the chance to tender his shares and the company had accepted the outside offers. The extra money would help a lot, he said, because his wife, Sandra, has rheumatoid arthritis, and after he retired, U.S. Sugar canceled its retiree health plan.Mr. Smith has since found a new job, with health benefits — but it pays $10 an hour, compared with the $23 an hour he once earned at U.S. Sugar.“My wife, she’s having to work two jobs just to make ends meet,” he said.Mr. McCorvey said that he and his wife, Marilyn, also a former employee, have calculated that the outside offers would have been worth $137,000 more to them. He was laid off in 2004; an executive assistant, she was laid off in 2002.Even though they no longer work at the company, they cannot cash out their stock, because of plan vesting rules, they said.Meanwhile, the stock price has been falling, based on appraisals and cash-out values supplied by the company.“I’m scared I’m going to lose it all,” Mr. McCorvey said.To make matters worse, U.S. Sugar announced in April that it was eliminating its dividend. The McCorveys had been receiving dividends worth about $7,000 a year on their shares.They and other former U.S. Sugar workers said they had planned to attend the company’s annual meeting this month, so they could tell management their complaints as shareholders.But this year, for the first time, the company announced that employee-shareholders would not be allowed to attend the annual meeting. It said that they were not the shareholders of record, and that as a result they would be represented by the trustee of their plan, the U.S. Trust Company.A spokeswoman for Bank of America, which owns U.S. Trust, said the company believed it had fulfilled all of its duties as the trustee.Experts said it was unusual to bar participants in employee stock plans from shareholders’ meetings.“It is legal,” said Loren Rodgers, project director for the National Center for Employee Ownership. But he cited research indicating that worker-owned companies tended to have better results when workers had a say in operations.Mr. Rodgers said that Congress had decided to limit the workers’ powers as shareholders out of concern that companies might avoid the structure if workers received full rights.Many former workers at U.S. Sugar acknowledged that they had never tried to attend an annual meeting until now. But that did not quell their anger at discovering they could not. “It was real nasty, the company to do us like they did us,” said Tommy Miller, who retired last fall after 32 years as a supervisor in a locomotive repair shop. He was only 56 but was caught in a mass layoff.He said he cashed out his shares and invested in an individual retirement account, only to learn that a bidder had been willing to pay him a lot more.“So you took my job and you took my stock, too,” Mr. Miller said.The workers describe a harsh new face on a company once known as paternalistic. U.S. Sugar was bought out of bankruptcy during the Great Depression by Mr. Mott, an entrepreneur who said companies should strengthen the towns where they did business.Mr. Mott, who started out making bicycle wheels and ended up with the largest single block of General Motors stock, created charities in Flint, Mich., and also provided Clewiston with swimming pools, libraries and a youth center.“When somebody’s child got hurt or was seriously ill, the company would fly that child to a hospital in Tampa, or wherever they needed to go,” John Perry, a former mayor of Clewiston, said. “This was a wonderful, wonderful place to live.”But that homey culture did not survive the tide of globalization. The North American Free Trade Agreement raised the prospect of a flood of cheap sugar from Mexico and other countries with low wages. U.S. Sugar scrambled to lower its costs.Ellen Simms, U.S. Sugar’s former comptroller, said that when the company had to trim its payroll, it seemed to choose people with many years at the company.“It was very obvious, with few exceptions, that they were targeting the employees who had been there the most time and who had the most ESOP shares,” she said. She resigned in protest in 2004.Meanwhile, the falling stock price reported in the appraisals was a boon to the company, she said, because it made it cheaper to buy out the workers.The reported declines in the stock price might not have been questioned, had it not been for two offers to acquire U.S. Sugar, one in the summer of 2005 and the other in early 2007. Both were made by the Lawrence Group, a large father-son agribusiness concern in Sikeston, Mo., for $293 a share in cash. Gaylon Lawrence Jr. confirmed the price but declined to comment further.The worker-shareholders were being paid $205 to $194 a share at the time, based on ESOP appraisals.But to help vet the Lawrence Group’s offer, U.S. Sugar hired a second appraisal firm to calculate the company’s breakup value. This appraiser came up with $2.5 billion, or about $1,273 a share.U.S. Sugar then rejected the Lawrence Group’s offer as inadequate.Mr. McCorvey said he would have tendered his shares to the Lawrence Group without a moment’s hesitation. “But we were never given the opportunity,” he said.John Logue, an ESOP specialist at Kent State University, said federal law does not require worker-owners to vote on acquisition offers. But, he said, “when you’re in doubt, let the participants vote. We have kind of an innate sense in the United States that people are entitled to do what they want with the property they own.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','A newly softened tone has already paid political dividends. After Andijon and a volley of criticism from Washington, Uzbekistan ejected the United States from a military base that was supplying the war effort in Afghanistan. Though there are not yet plans for the base to reopen, the Uzbeks have allowed the Americans limited access to a German base at Termez, and Uzbekistan recently offered NATO the use of its railway to ship goods to Afghanistan.That highlights the difficult questions that relations with Uzbekistan raise for American foreign policy: How much influence should the United States try to exercise — if any at all — over another country’s behavior? And will that country be receptive, given the abuse, indefinite detentions and closed tribunals that have been part of the United States’ record in recent years?As the gateway to Afghanistan and Iran, and an area where both China and Russia vie for influence, the five Muslim countries of Central Asia — the other four are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan — have a strategic importance to the United States well out of proportion to their size. Uzbekistan is the region’s heart, with its most religious population, and also, at 28 million, its largest.The killings in Andijon tested that strategic bond for the United States. The government of President Islam Karimov acknowledged 187 deaths but dealt so viciously with those who gave information about it — a gravedigger who spoke to an Uzbek journalist was stabbed to death shortly after publication, and the journalist fled the country — that the true figure was impossible to establish. Human rights groups put the toll around 750.Western nations pressed the government to allow an independent investigation. The European Union imposed a visa ban on officials involved in the crackdown, and the United States resettled a large number of refugees and is considering a visa ban of its own. Yet, three years later, the Uzbeks have not budged. In a five-part report in 2006 it said perpetrators of the uprising — “terrorists” and “bandits” — were responsible for the deaths of the 62 “civilians,” or nonparticipants, who it acknowledged were killed.A spokesman for the Uzbek Foreign Ministry said there had been no response to a request for comment sent two weeks ago.So when European and American attitudes toward Mr. Karimov began easing late last year — the European Union partly suspended the visa ban in October, and in January, Adm. William J. Fallon, the most senior American military commander in the region, visited Tashkent, the first high-level visit in two years — many human rights advocates were bitterly disappointed.“To be honest, they abandoned us,” said one, a former ecologist who fled Uzbekistan in April because he believed that a criminal case was being prepared against him. He has not been identified for safety reasons.Supporters of engagement with the Karimov government argue that punishing the country with sanctions leads only to less leverage over its policies.“Uzbekistan is simply too important to ignore,” said one Western official who said diplomatic rules forbade him to use his name. “People on the ground want contact with foreigners. They value it. Once you go into isolation mode, you lose the ability to engage with the rest of the population.”Mr. Karimov, 70, who has been in power since the Soviet Union collapsed, is not known for his democratic instincts, and many analysts are skeptical that any policy will encourage him to open up. He won a third term in a tainted election in December, though under Uzbek law, only two terms are allowed. Some say Mr. Karimov has not chosen a successor for fear that the president-in-waiting would kill him.“He is totally fixated on remaining in power,” said Paul Quinn Judge, an analyst at the International Crisis Group and a former journalist, who has observed Mr. Karimov since the 1980s. “He is not the kind of person who would allow things to seriously open up.”Indeed, some Uzbek human rights advocates say that Mr. Karimov has increased the pressure on them since the warming with the West began. In December the authorities arrested a poet, Yusuf Juma, on what human rights advocates and family members say were trumped-up charges, after he and his sons held up hand-lettered signs in a one-family protest against Mr. Karimov’s candidacy. In April, Mr. Juma was sentenced to five years in prison.In March the authorities broke up a small group of protesters who had been gathering for weekly demonstrations since last year. The government then seized the offices of the group, Human Rights Movement of Uzbekistan. Two members fled.“The silence of the West gave a good opening to Karimov to arrest my father,” said Alisher Yusufjon Ugli, the poet’s son.Andrea Berg, an expert on Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, said that without the threat of sanctions, “Tashkent has no incentive to improve human rights.”But at a time when the United States is fighting an increasingly complicated war right next door in Afghanistan, some analysts argue that realpolitik must prevail.“It’s a really bad set of choices that the U.S. faces,” said Martha Brill Olcott, a Central Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington. “If we didn’t have a war in Afghanistan we might have the luxury to take a moral stance.”Nor is Uzbekistan quite the prison colony it is reputed to be. Despite the political arrests and brutality in prisons, the overwhelming majority of citizens are more concerned with making ends meet than with fears that the secret police will knock down their door.“You can’t compare Uzbekistan and North Korea,” said a European who has lived in Tashkent for years, and who was not identified for safety reasons. “Not every right is violated all the time. It’s not that systematic.”In Tashkent, a glittering city of clipped lawns and fountains, an Uzbek in his 20s, who is expanding his fashionable nightclub in central Tashkent, noted that there were long lines of Uzbeks in banks to apply for credit cards, and construction was booming. He said he did not read newspapers, but believed that Uzbekistan had press freedom because “there are fresh newspapers every day and they seem to be writing something.”But good mojitos are far easier to come by than independent political articles. By the end of 2007, after Andijon and the ensuing crackdown on civil society, a large portion of foreign nongovernmental organizations and news outlets were forced to stop their work. Ms. Innoyatova, the human rights worker, estimates about 900 organizations closed. In an Orwellian twist, government-controlled nongovernmental organizations sprang up.Yet, with the economy outside the capital stagnating, wages below subsistence level and millions of people migrating to Russia and Kazakhstan for work, most Uzbeks do not count freedom of expression among their top concerns. “None of this will work until there’s a critical mass of people who feel they have rights and are ready to protect them,” said the ecologist turned human rights advocate, making the point that, under Soviet rule, no one had rights.Even the plight of the poet, Mr. Juma, left some residents from his southern town, Karakul, unmoved. “He had money. Why did he do it?” asked one young unemployed man.Uzbeks have become poorer, less educated and more isolated in the 17 years since the Soviet Union collapsed. At the same time, the most religious parts of society have been brutalized by the government. It is a combination that has proved poisonous in other countries, including Iraq.Ms. Olcott argues that Uzbek society is much less inclined toward secular values than it was 10 years ago, a shift that could eventually lead to Uzbekistan’s becoming a religious state. “There’s a lot riding on transition,” said Ms. Olcott, who has researched the role of religion in Uzbekistan. “I think you’re going to get another Islamic state down the road. The question is whether it’s going to be tolerant or intolerant.”The Bush administration’s counterterrorism practices since 2001 have eroded its moral authority with countries like Uzbekistan, analysts said. “The U.S. doesn’t have the kind of leverage it had,” said Sarah Mendelson, a Russia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “We’ve got this elephant in the room.”In Andijon, the policy of forgetting is rigorously enforced. On the anniversary, newspapers ran headlines about sports competitions and the grain harvest. Even those who took part in the uprising seemed to have rehearsed the government line.“The past is in the past,” said one participant, who lived in Baltimore as a refugee but returned to Uzbekistan in 2006. “People don’t want to remember.”'"
"'08-05-29,'1','FOR pool owners who don’t want to spend thousands to go chemical-free, there are more affordable ways to at least reduce chlorine use. Sean Trotter, who owns an air-conditioning business in Plano, Tex., spent $900 for an ozone generator from DEL Ozone after his wife and daughter said that the chlorine in their pool irritated their skin. The system works this way: ozone kills microorganisms and keeps chlorine in its “free” state rather than turning into chloramine, the odorous compound chlorine becomes after it attaches to organics in the water. Beth Hamil, vice president for corporate compliance and market development at DEL, said the system allows chlorine use to be cut by 60 to 90 percent.Mr. Trotter says he no longer has to shock the pool with a high dose of chlorine, something he used to do once a week in the summer, and expects to save money in the long run by buying less chlorine. And he describes the water in terms similar to those used by owners of chlorine-free pools: “No more burning eyes. No more dry hair. My wife says it feels better than the shower water in the house.”Another inexpensive option is Nature2, a system that delivers trace amounts of silver to kill bacteria and trace amounts of copper to fight algae. The unit is housed in a plastic cartridge and, according to Buzz Robinson, a training manager with Zodiac Pool Care, the Vista, Calif.-based company that manufactures the system, chlorine consumption can be reduced by 50 to 80 percent. A Nature2 unit for a pool with up to 25,000 gallons of water would run a homeowner about $180 for one swimming season, according to Mr. Robinson. Cartridges last six months.'"

"'08-05-30,'0','On Thursday, the governor, who is still largely unknown to many New Yorkers, appealed to them to recognize what he called the basic common sense of allowing gay men and lesbians married elsewhere to gain the same rights here as heterosexual couples.In doing so, he is stepping to the forefront of an issue that has often tripped up his party nationally, and he is going further than either of the two Democratic presidential candidates have been willing to do.“People who live together for a long time would like to be married — as far as I’m concerned, I think it’s beautiful,” he said in a news conference called to discuss his directive to state agencies to revise their regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions, like California.“I think it’s fine, regardless of the tenets of religion or the beliefs of some,” he added. “It’s something that the government should allow for people. It’s maybe misunderstood in this generation.”But already on Thursday, there were signs of a backlash against his decision, with some conservative groups mulling whether to mount a legal challenge to the directive. Some Republican legislators said that Mr. Paterson is wading into an issue that should be settled by the Legislature, and likened it to the ill-fated attempt by his predecessor, Eliot Spitzer, to grant driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants without seeking legislative support.“It’s outrageous that the governor did what he did,” said Michael Long, chairman of the state’s Conservative Party. “He’s for same-sex marriage, that’s fine. I have no problem with that. To do this in the dark of night, through the back door, to begin the process of destroying the sanctity of marriage, is really wrong.”It was shortly after Mr. Paterson was sworn in, on March 17, that his legal counsel, David Nocenti, approached him to discuss a February appellate court ruling in Rochester. In that case, the court said that because of New York’s longstanding practice of recognizing marriages from other jurisdictions, a community college in Monroe County must provide health benefits to the wife of a woman who was married in Canada.Mr. Nocenti recommended that Mr. Paterson order all state agencies to bring their policies in line with that decision.Mr. Paterson quickly agreed to do so, not only because the state risked legal exposure if it did not, but also because such a directive would be a strong statement of principle about an issue he cares about deeply. He met with his inner circle, and there was no dissent.On May 14, Mr. Nocenti’s memo went out to the agencies. The governor’s plan called for not publicizing the directive until after June 30, when the agencies were asked to report back to Mr. Nocenti with the revisions necessary to comply with the court ruling. Once the governor approved those changes, he planned to announce them publicly. But Mr. Nocenti’s memo was reported on Wednesday night by The New York Times, and the governor described its contents at a dinner with gay advocates on May 17.In the interview, Mr. Paterson said he believes deeply that gay men and lesbians today face the same kind of civil rights battle that black Americans faced. He acknowledged that this position put him at odds with some black leaders, who bristle at such comparisons.“In many respects, people in our society, we only recognize our own struggles,” Mr. Paterson said. “I’ve wanted to be someone in the African-American community who recognizes the new civil rights struggle that is being undertaken by gay and lesbian and transgendered people.”When Mr. Paterson became governor, gay activists cheered, saying they would have an ally in Albany even more committed than Mr. Spitzer. The Web site of The Advocate, a gay magazine, ran a story headlined, “Could Spitzer’s woes have a silver lining?” The story called Mr. Paterson “the best-case scenario for gays and lesbians in the state.”Mr. Paterson introduced the State Senate’s first hate crimes bill in the 1980s and refused to support a compromise that did not include gay men and lesbians. When the Senate ultimately agreed to pass a hate crimes bill in 2000, it marked the first time the phrase “sexual orientation” appeared in New York State laws.Mr. Paterson, then a senator, said: “Now I can die in peace,” adding, “If nothing else ever happens here, I feel that I can point to a contribution that I made.”During his years as minority leader of the Senate, from 2002 to 2006, his warm relations with the majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican, helped pave the way for laws extending civil rights protections to gay men and lesbians, and coincided with a softening of Mr. Bruno’s views on gay rights.“From the get-go, when I first introduced marriage, which was in, like, 2001, he put his name down right away as a sponsor,” said Senator Tom Duane, a Manhattan Democrat and the only openly gay member of the Senate. “The second I asked him if he wanted to be a sponsor, he said yes. When he was minority leader, he also fought for funding for groups and he’s been great on H.I.V./AIDS issues, as well. He has been 100 percent behind us.”Some lawmakers said they particularly admired Mr. Paterson’s position on gay marriage because it would have been easy for him to let the issue rest once he became governor.“I just think it shows the steel in his spine,” said Assemblyman Micah Z. Kellner, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side. “He knows he is now the governor of all people in New York State, gay and straight.”Mr. Paterson said he does not see his support for gay marriage as an issue of political fortitude, but rather something more human and almost reflexive.“All the time when I’d hear Uncle Stanley and Uncle Ronald and my parents talk, they were talking about the civil rights struggle,” Mr. Paterson said. “In those days, I knew I wanted to grow up and feel that I could change something.”'"
"'08-05-30,'0','Less audible, but no less angry, are French nurses fretting about the cost of making home visits in their cars, Italian travel agents worried about fueling tour buses, and families from Madrid to Moscow who are leaving their cars at home or reducing spending in other areas.European governments, already under pressure from slowing economic growth and falling tax revenue, are increasingly concerned the anger could grow. On Tuesday, faced with furious truckers, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for the European Union to cap fuel taxes — a proposal immediately rejected by other countries that count on the income to bolster their budgets.The problem in Europe is that the upsurge has come faster and harder than in previous cycles. For instance, the cost of a liter of unleaded gasoline surged 17 percent in the last 12 months in Britain, 15 percent in Austria and 8 percent in France.Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, a major opponent of the Sarkozy proposal, warned that the world was facing an oil shock. His solution was to persuade governments around the world to take coordinated global action to mitigate price increases.Britain, which has Europe’s highest fuel consumption taxes, granted licenses Wednesday for two new North Sea oil fields.But as protesters and industry groups press for immediate tax breaks, analysts, European officials and consumer groups are concerned that artificially lowering prices would only engrain a consumption pattern that is not sustainable.Instead, they say, politicians should provide long-term incentives to reduce fuel use and increase energy efficiency. The European Commission said Thursday that short-term relief should be narrowly focused on the poorest families, and warned European Union states not to provide tax relief to interest groups.In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the Federation of German Consumer Organizations is lobbying the government to invest 5 billion euros in public transportation and to allocate 10 billion euros in subsidies to households that install energy saving devices.“Dealing with the issue through taxes is not the solution,” Holger Krawinkel, director of the federation’s energy department, said Thursday. “We need a serious commitment to investing in energy saving schemes.”Such incentives to reduce consumption have worked in the past. Fuel taxes imposed after an oil shock in the 1980s are the main reason Europe has a vastly more fuel-efficient car fleet than the United States, said Lawrence Eagles, chief market analyst at the International Energy Agency.But greater energy efficiency in Europe has also made it harder for Europeans to make further substantial improvements, analysts say.Yet, the latest price shock has reignited the trend. Moshiur Rahman, a 28-year-old newspaper vendor in London, said higher fuel prices meant that he could no longer afford to drive to work. He now travels more than an hour by train every day.“I have been sharing a car with a friend but it has just become too much money,” he said.In Warsaw, where gas prices are nearing 5 zloty ($2.31), a liter, Leszek Tumkiewicz tries to leave his Polonez — a fuel-intensive communist-era car — at home. “I drive a lot but I also try to be fond of the Warsaw Metro,” said Mr. Tumkiewicz, 50, a business consultant who lives 12 miles from the city center.Higher gas prices have prompted motorists to look for the best possible deal around. Drivers in Northern Ireland are making the trip south to fill their tanks in the Republic of Ireland, where fuel duties are considerably lower.Not everyone is able to find cheaper fuel or reduce their driving. In Milan, Marco Germani, a self-employed salesman who is constantly on the road, said he had no choice but to pay up. “Unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it because I need to use the car for work,” he said.Particularly in rural areas, where public transport is more limited, high energy costs take their toll elsewhere. Analysts call it the “Starbucks effect” — a decline in discretionary consumption in response to higher fuel bills.The effect is hard to measure, especially because many products have increased in price as a result of rising transportation costs. In Spain, for example, where gasoline costs 1 to 1.25 euros a liter, many consumers are grumbling more about the accompanying rise in grocery bills than the price at the pump.Even in Russia, one of the world’s largest oil producers, consumers have cut back spending and demonstrations by disgruntled drivers have erupted after prices at the pump rose by more than 7 percent from a year ago.“The prices are nightmarish,” said Arutsun Hachaturyan, the manager of a jewelry business, who said he pumps about $1,200 in gas a month into his black Range Rover. “This is Russia,” he said, while filling his tank at a Moscow gas station. “We live on oil.”The only solution, said Ms. Schneberger, the airline worker in Paris, is to “become less dependent on oil.”But as fears of high energy costs merge with broader concerns about slipping standards of living, the calls for tax cuts are growing louder, suggesting that farmers, truckers and fishermen may end up with broader support in the general public.In London, for instance, expectations of government tax cuts are high. Julian Popa, the manager of a hauling company, said he had not yet raised the prices he charges customers because “we’re waiting for the government to do something like reducing the levy or subsidize” oil.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','But the usual suspects are bankers, analysts and executives — not academicians like Dr. Marshall, the author of books like “Financial Engineering: A Complete Guide to Financial Innovation.”Yet, like many business school professors, Dr. Marshall, 56, and Dr. Tucker, 47, built twin careers by hopscotching from teaching to consulting. Dr. Marshall’s stature in the field of finance eventually lead a board position at a fledgling electronic exchange for stock options — a position the S.E.C. said he had used to pass illegal tips to Dr. Tucker, a friend and business associate. The men declined to comment for this article.It’s a remarkable turnabout for Dr. Marshall, who co-founded the leading professional society for practitioners of financial engineering, the International Association of Financial Engineering, the math-heavy discipline that revolutionized Wall Street in recent years.Ms. Kim recalled how her former professor gave away complex computer software to his students. Dr. Marshall helped establish a graduate program in financial engineering at Polytechnic University in Manhattan and fostered the explosive growth of financial derivatives. He also became a popular lecturer at banks like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch.Few people on or off Wall Street moved in such rarefied financial circles. During a long, distinguished career, Dr. Marshall mixed with Nobel laureates like Myron S. Scholes, Fischer Black and Franco Modigliani — whose pioneering theories transformed the world of finance — while he himself lived modestly on Long Island.“Everybody loves Jack Marshall” said David F. DeRosa, president of DeRosa Research and Trading and a former Wall Street trader. “He is like the uncle of derivatives.”In an essay published in the 2007 book, “How I Became a Quant,” Dr. Marshall wrote that his work on Wall Street had informed his academic research.“What I was seeing during the day in the Street was growing increasingly at odds with what I saw being taught in business schools,” Dr. Marshall wrote. “Most of academia was missing the great transformation that was taking place in finance.”He recruited Dr. Tucker to help edit the financial engineering society’s journal, and together they proposed new types of options that companies might use to protect themselves from economic downturns. The pair also opened a small consulting firm in Port Jefferson, N.Y.Their work was notable for its real-world applications, professional colleagues said.“A lot of academics publish papers that have very little to do with practical applications,” said Anthony Herbst, a retired finance professor at the University of Texas in El Paso. “Jack Marshall bridges the gap.”Dr. Marshall retired from St. John’s in 2000 and went on to help form the International Securities Exchange, the electronic options exchange. He later became a member of its board and the chairman of its finance and audit committee.The trouble began in late 2006, when Eurex, a German exchange, expressed interest in buying the I.S.E. According to the S.E.C., Dr. Marshall tipped off Dr. Tucker about the deal, sharing insider details of the proposed transaction through multiple phone calls.Dr. Tucker later bought options giving him the right to buy I.S.E. stock, as well as shares in the American exchange, through an Ameritrade account, the S.E.C. said in its complaint. In e-mail exchanges, Dr. Tucker referred to the scheme as “the program,” according to the S.E.C. Dr. Marshall’s brother-in-law, Mark R. Larson, 45, bought shares of I.S.E. stock based on the tips, S.E.C. says.When Eurex agreed to buy I.S.E. for $67.50 a share in 2007, the value of the I.S.E. stock and options soared, producing a profit of $1.1 million. It is unclear if Dr. Marshall profited personally. But the options trades set off alarms with market regulators because Dr. Tucker was the only person buying some of the instruments just before the takeover.Since the S.E.C. filed its complaint in March, the men have fallen out of touch with friends and colleagues, longtime acquaintances said. Dr. Tucker finished out the spring term teaching at Pace but did not turn up at a recent finance conference he was scheduled to attend in China. Dr. Marshall has resigned from the I.S.E.’s board. Recent calls placed to his consulting firm on Long Island were unanswered.At universities and on Wall Street, people who know Dr. Marshall are dumbfounded.Manuchehr Shahrokhi, a finance professor at California State University at Fresno, said he was so surprised to hear about the allegations that he looked up the S.E.C. complaint to double-check. He could not reconcile the accusations with the man knew — someone he once heard speak on ethics in the derivatives markets.“You know, sometimes greed takes over your knowledge and your skills and everything else. But he is not a greedy man,” Dr. Shahrokhi said. “Really, the only conclusion I can come up with is it must have been an accident. I do not believe that a person of his stature would do this.”'"
"'08-05-30,'0','In 2000, yellow grease was trading for 7.6 cents per pound. On Thursday, its price was about 33 cents a pound, or almost $2.50 a gallon. (That would make the 2,500-gallon haul in the Burger King case worth more than $6,000.)Biodiesel is derived by processing vegetable oil or animal fat with alcohol. It is increasingly available around the country, but it is expensive. With the right kind of conversion kit (easily found on the Internet) anyone can turn discarded cooking oil into a usable engine fuel that can burn on its own, or as a cheap additive to regular diesel.“The last time kids broke in here they went for the alcohol,” said Mr. Damianidis, who fries chicken wings and cheese sticks. “Obviously they’re stealing oil because it’s worth something.”While there have been reports of thefts in multiple states, law enforcement officials do not compile national statistics and it remains unclear whether this is part of a passing trend or something more serious.The suspects in a growing number of grease infractions fall into a range of categories, people interviewed on the matter said, as grease theft is a crime of opportunity. They include do-it-yourself environmentalists worried about their carbon footprints, warring waste management firms trying to beat each other on the sly, and petty thieves who are profiting from the oil’s rising value on the black market.“It’s a new oddity,” said Officer Seth Hanson of the Federal Way Police Department, near Tacoma, Wash. He said thefts occur outside at least a couple of restaurants there each week. “We’re trying to get an eyeball on how well-organized it is, if at all. To date, we haven’t been very successful in finding anybody.”Thefts have been reported in at least 20 states, said Christopher A. Griffin, whose family owns Griffin Industries, one of the largest grease collection and rendering companies in the country. The problem has gotten so bad, Mr. Griffin has hired two detectives to investigate thefts around the country.“Theft is theft,” said Mr. Griffin, who is based in Cold Spring, Ky. “I don’t care if you’re stealing grease or if you’re stealing diamonds.”Fryer oil from a restaurant that does a high volume of frying one kind of food — for example, a fried-chicken chain — is at a premium because of its relative purity. The large-scale producers of grease, restaurants mostly, own their old oil and in recent months have even made a small profit by selling it to collectors.Because of the grease’s rancid odor, most restaurants usually store it out back with the trash.“Once you put something in the trash, it’s abandoned property,” said Jon A. Jaworski, a lawyer in Houston who represents accused grease thieves. “A lot of times, it’s not theft.”Even so, most restaurant owners and grease collectors say that grease is not free for the taking.“There’s a new fight for the product, definitely a whole new demand sector,” said Bill Smith, a market reporter for Urner Barry’s Yellow Sheet, an industry newsletter that tracks yellow grease. “Grease theft is becoming a bigger and bigger issue.”In the case of the Burger King theft, in Morgan Hill, Calif., the police were alerted to suspicious activity by a neighbor who runs his own grease collection and recycling business and is on the lookout for rustlers.Driving through town, the neighbor, Mark Rosenzweig, said he spotted the suspect’s truck because “it stuck out.” He said he followed it for blocks before it pulled into the Burger King. Mr. Rosenzweig said he knew the man who holds the Burger King grease account, so he called him.“I had to give everybody a roadside tutorial on grease theft,” Mr. Rosenzweig said of his next call — to the police. “Ten years ago we couldn’t give this stuff away. Now everybody’s fighting over it.”The suspect in the case, a 49-year-old man who said he was from Las Vegas, has yet to enter a plea, and is due in court next in July.A typical fast-food restaurant produces 150 to 250 pounds of grease a week. Many do not even know when a theft occurs because it usually happens overnight. Most security cameras and night watchmen are focused on cash registers, not the trash.“Who do you go after?” said Jason Christensen, a trader of fats and oils for the AgriTrading Corporation, in Minnesota. “I sense you’ll start seeing more surveillance equipment put in to monitor these storage facilities at the restaurant. As the price goes up, you can afford to spend a little more to protect your interest.”And there is so much interest in grease these days.The City of San Francisco has its own grease recycling program run through the Public Utilities Commission called SFGreasecycle, which collects discarded vegetable oil from city restaurants at no charge and recycles it into biodiesel for use in the city fleet.Healy Biodiesel, a company in Sedgwick, Kan., says it offers a top-quality fuel made from local cooking oils.Ben Healy, the owner, has contracts to collect the raw grease from several franchises around town.“One particular night not too long ago, 9 out of 15 were stolen,” he said of the grease bins. “That’s a majority of the oil and it was a big kick in the stomach.”At Olympia Pizza and Pasta, Mr. Damianidis, who now sells his grease for a small monthly fee, finds the problem of stolen fryer oil quite annoying and distracting. And he wants to stop the thefts. He is leaning toward a security camera and hoping for the best.“I cook food,” Mr. Damianidis said. “I’m not going to stay up until 2 in the morning trying to catch someone stealing a barrel of grease.”'"
"'08-05-30,'0','WASHINGTON — Hoping to bring their party’s presidential nomination fight to an end, the two top Democrats in Congress said they were pressing superdelegates who had yet to declare a preference in the race to make their choice public by the middle of next week.Party officials said Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, had been contacting uncommitted superdelegates, encouraging them to prepare to go public and resolve any last question about the contest between Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.“By this time next week, it will all be over, give or take a day,"" Mr. Reid said in a Thursday appearance at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, where he was promoting a new memoir.Given Mr. Obama’s lead in the delegate race and potential support among the approximately 200 members of Congress and Democratic insiders who have yet to declare, the push to wind up the race works to his benefit. While Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid have remained publicly neutral in the nominating clash while emphasizing its potential benefits to the party, they now appear to have concluded that prolonging it much further could be detrimental.In an interview on the San Francisco talk radio station KGO, Mr. Reid said that he had spoken with Ms. Pelosi on Thursday and that they had agreed to take steps to avoid a contest that would extend into the convention in August. “We all are going to urge our folks next week to make a decision very quickly,” said Mr. Reid, who added that “simple math” indicated that by next Tuesday Mr. Obama would have the necessary number of delegates to prevail.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','Faced with enormous political pressure to tighten the oversight of energy trading, federal regulators said Thursday that they have been investigating oil and derivative markets for six months to look into potential price manipulation.The revelation came as the agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also announced a series of measures intended to heighten regulatory supervision of energy trading and bring “greater sunshine” into the commodities markets.The commission, which does not typically disclose ongoing investigations, said that since December 2007 it had been conducting a nationwide inquiry of “practices surrounding the purchase, transportation, storage and trading” of oil contracts. It did not say whom it was investigating, nor did it say when it expected the investigation to be completed.The commission seems keen to address concerns raised in Congress this year that oil prices have been somehow artificially lifted by investors’ enthusiasm for energy commodities.Oil futures have risen 32 percent this year and have more than quadrupled since 2003. On Thursday, oil futures fell $4.41 a barrel to $126.62 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gasoline prices touched a national average of $3.95 a gallon, up from about $3.20 a gallon a year ago.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','Ms. Sewell, in partnership with Susan Toffler, knew she wanted feminism or, more specifically, the political clout or lack thereof experienced by young women, to be the topic of her second film. Getting Hollywood to bankroll it proved impossible, so she and Ms. Toffler, a producer of the 1997 film, “The Cost of Living,” are schlepping it around the country themselves, with screenings benefiting nonprofit women’s leadership groups, including Girls Incorporated of New York City. Paramount Classics bought “Mad Hot Ballroom” after its premiere at the Slamdance Festival, a renegade spawn of the Sundance Festival.“Nobody in Hollywood would touch the topic with a 10-foot pole,” she says of her new film. “What they told me was, ‘Feminist movies don’t do well.’” All the more reason for her to make one with some financial help from her mother-in-law, Phyllis Sewell, a former director of the Federated Department Stores. “Never has it become more evident that women don’t matter up on the silver screen unless we are bimbos, whores, or princesses,” she wrote in a letter to the editor published recently in The New York Times.Ms. Sewell — a former marketing director for Thomson Publishing; a painter who works in oils; a reporter for her local paper, The TriBeCa Tribune (where “Mad Hot Ballroom,” the tale of a dance competition for the city’s public school children, germinated); an author of three books; and the married mother of twin 10-year-old girls — seems to have the pertinent bases covered in the Steinemesque sense of the well-functioning feminist.She also has an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan, where she met her husband, Charlie Sewell, a teacher at the Rudolph Steiner School on the Upper East Side. Their twins, she emphasizes, attend nearby Public School 234. Call it a family philosophy thing.“We’re kind of like the type of parents who throw kids into a pit and see if they survive,” she hollers from the bathroom of her Reade Street loft, where she’s applying a final coat of mascara. “Not that TriBeCa isn’t a nice little urban bubble, but at least it’s still a diverse bubble,” she adds. “Charlie and I brought white trash to TriBeCa,” she jokes about their hand-me-down decorating scheme and Hamburger Helper culinary skills. “We alone will manage to bring down the property values.”Not likely. Not when she’s sold the stage rights — her business degree has come in handy here and there — to “Mad Hot Ballroom” to Jerry Mitchell, a veteran of film-to-Broadway hits like “The Full Monty” and “Legally Blonde.”Not unless Geoff Gilmore, the director of the Sundance Festival, decides to sue for the return of the bright yellow reserved V.I.P. parking placard — his — she swiped as a lark, and as a bit of revenge for having her documentary snubbed by Sundance in 2005. The purloined placard is propped beside the computer in her office, a messy room where she reports at 4 a.m. to write for an hour before the rest of the household rises. She has four bins of discarded writings beneath her bed: “I’m not that bright, but I’m productive.”Ms. Sewell, and her husband, for whom she converted to Judaism pre-wedding, bought their 1,500-square-foot apartment as a foreclosure in the early 1990s. “You could punch your fist through the walls, that’s how cheaply it was built,” she says. “But what we really bought was the deck,” she says of the gigantic, sun-splashed terrace with Weber grill, orphaned B.J.’s shopping cart and ancient beer fridge. “We’re porch people.” That tan and those freckles: homegrown.MS. SEWELL grew up in the Midwest, where her father worked his way up the ladder from salesman to executive at Union Carbide. Her mother was a nurse, and the family — she has two older siblings — wound up in Grosse Pointe Shores, Mich., where she competed on the swimming and sailing teams. Sailing is a passion. So is working.“It’s my theory that every woman should work at something that gives her self-esteem, and that kids, if she decides to have them, will fit into the total picture,” says Ms. Sewell, who raises hers without assistance from nannies but with the help of her husband. He handles sports, homework and general discipline. “Not that there’s anything wrong with nannies,” she says. “It’s just not what we’re about.”'"
"'08-05-30,'0','The Bush administration, bowing to a court order, has released a fresh summary of federal and independent research pointing to large, and mainly harmful, impact of human-caused global warming in the United States.The report, released Thursday, is online at climatescience.gov, along with a new report updating the administration’s priorities for climate research.Most of the findings, like the spread of warmth-loving pests and the inevitable loss of low-lying lands to rising seas, are not new. But the report included new projections of how the poor, elderly and communities with lagging public-health and public-works systems will face outsize health risks from warming.Among the report’s new conclusions on health: “An increased frequency and severity of heat waves is expected, leading to more illness and death, particularly among the young, elderly, frail and poor.” It added that deaths from cold would decline, but said uncertainties on both projections made it impossible to characterize the overall risk.It gave high odds (essentially a two out of three chance) that Lyme disease and West Nile virus would have expanded ranges because of warming. The report gave the same odds that some food- and water-borne diseases would also increase among susceptible populations, but said “major human epidemics” were unlikely as long as public-health systems remained effective.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','Re “In New Book, Ex-Spokesman Has Harsh Words for Bush” (news article, May 28):Scott McClellan is the latest to join a long list of former Bush officials and confidants disillusioned with the president’s and his administration’s “decision to turn away from candor and honesty when those qualities were most needed” — as Mr. McClellan himself puts it.It is good that Mr. McClellan has finally realized and admitted his complicity, but I refuse to use the adage “better late than never.” There is no “better late than never” when it comes to the damage done to our nation’s reputation, to our freedoms, and — perhaps most of all — when it comes to the more than 4,000 fallen heroes in Iraq.I am glad that Scott McClellan has finally come clean about the Bush inner circle, but how much better for us all if, instead of waiting for his lucrative book deal to be honest with his countrymen and women, he had stood on principle once he knew the truth and spilled what he knew to Congress, the newspapers or law enforcement. Then maybe he could have helped to return our country to one governed by law rather than hubris.I, for one, cannot forgive any of the Bush co-participants, no matter how many books they write, as long as they pretend that they have no personal culpability. Talk is cheap, as they say.Scott McClellan is expressing the wrongs while working for the Bush administration. My recent government job as a tobacco prevention specialist lasted 42 days.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','But he has changed his direction this season with the help of the top coach José Higueras and has reached the semifinals in three hardcourt events. Now, with a world ranking of 88, he is in the third round at Roland Garros, where Higueras is also coaching his latest pupil — Federer.“At first he was concerned for me and definitely wanted to keep me as No. 1 priority. He told me that if I had any issues at all with the situation, that he would not go through with it,” said Ginepri, who is playing with his right arm taped more heavily than a weekend warrior to avoid aggravating a tricep problem.Another American, Mardy Fish, was beaten, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2, in the second round by Lleyton Hewitt, the Australian now seeded just 25th in Paris.Chardy’s 3-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 victory was the latest blow to Nalbandian, who finished last season feeling close to the summit after winning two straight indoor Masters Series events in Madrid and Paris, beating Federer and Nadal in each city. But the big move that seemed imminent has not materialized.Federer, for a change, has had his problems this year, too, losing in the semifinals at the Australian Open with what turned out to be mononucleosis. He seems to have recovered his speed and strength in recent weeks, but he was erratic in the early stages of his match with the Spanish clay-court specialist Albert Montañés.His unforced errors piled up early, and with the drizzle turning into heavy rain, he had to save two set points at 4-5 before holding and then taking a 90-minute break until the sky cleared. When the top-seeded Federer returned, he wound up losing the set in a tie breaker. But the rest of the match was his. He closed out a 6-7 (5), 6-1, 6-0, 6-4 victory with Higueras in the stands, without dropping his serve, which has been one of his strengths so far.While Federer was working his way past Montañés, Nadal was at the Suzanne Lenglen Court wearing down the French qualifier Nicolas Devilder, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1.“He’s serious; he’s in his bubble; he’s not there to crack jokes,” Devilder said. “He’s a machine, truly.”Nadal is 29-3 against his fellow left-handers in his career and has faced nothing but lefties here so far, with his next opponent being Jarkko Nieminen of Finland. “It’s not usual, because we are not a lot left on the tour,” Nadal said. “It’s strange, but I accept it.”Blake was not so accepting of his latest early defeat at Roland Garros. He has never won more than two rounds there, but he may feel better about this defeat in a few years.Gulbis may be ranked 80th at the moment, but he is one of the game’s more promising talents.“I knew that James doesn’t like clay too much,” Gulbis said. “Me and my coach, we were talking before the match about some tactics, how I should play him. I knew that he’s going to get frustrated in some moments, because he’s playing a young guy on clay.”As the drop shots piled up — not a tactic Blake faces often considering his excellent speed — he shouted, “Every game!” at one stage in the fourth and final set after he reached the ball yet failed to win the exchange.Gulbis kept his focus and finished off his 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory with an ace and two winners.“I think I played the way too many commentators think I should play,” said Blake, who criticized himself for being too conservative in the match.“Granted, he didn’t play like 80th in the world,” Blake said of Gulbis. “He played better than that. But there are a lot of guys out there that can dictate play against me if I try to play like that.”The consolation is that it has been a better French Open for the American men, who lost all nine of their opening singles matches last year. Wayne Odesnik, a wild card, has also made it into the third round. But Odesnik’s joy ride is in danger of screeching to a halt: his next opponent is third-seeded Novak Djokovic. Ginepri has a better chance to keep accelerating , facing either Victor Hanescu of Romania or Florent Serra of France; each is unseeded.'"
"'08-05-30,'0','From prisoner of war to politician in a hurry, it was the turning point that started Mr. McCain on the trajectory toward the Republican presidential nomination this year.After five and a half years of listening to senators’ antiwar speeches over prison camp loudspeakers, Mr. McCain came home in 1973 contemptuous of America’s elected officials, convinced Congress had betrayed the country’s fighting men by hamstringing the war effort. But in the halls of the Senate, he discovered a new calling, at once high-minded and glamorous.One of several Senate military liaisons assigned as advocates for their services and escorts for official travel, Mr. McCain quickly emerged as the senators’ favorite. He had a thick head of hair as white as his dress uniform, and he showed a natural politician’s gift for winning over an audience. He excelled at leavening official business with a spirit of fun — telling deadpan stories about his years “in the cooler,” playing marathon poker games on flights overseas or surprising senators at a refueling stop in Ireland with a side trip to Durty Nelly’s, a 17th century pub.He was the epitome of cool, one senator’s son recalled, with a pack of Marlboros in one hand and Theodore H. White’s memoir “In Search of History” in the other.Mr. McCain relished the push-and-pull of legislative battles, eventually even plunging into defense budget fights with a personal agenda that was sometimes at odds with President Jimmy Carter’s secretary of the Navy. He built personal friendships and professional collaborations across ideological divides, a hallmark of his later Senate career. And he applauded the Senate’s leading hawks as they waged what they considered an epic struggle with the Carter administration over America’s place in the post-Vietnam world.Under Mr. Tower’s tutelage, Mr. McCain turned his anger over the management of the Vietnam War into an all-or-nothing view of international conflict that became one of the few guiding principles in his otherwise unpredictable political career — from his opposition to sending Marine peacekeepers into Lebanon in 1983 to his current staunch support for the Iraq war. And when prominent conservative Christians later protested Mr. Tower’s nomination as defense secretary over accusations of drinking and womanizing, Mr. McCain’s furious counterattack opened the hostilities with that wing of his party that have persisted ever since.Mr. McCain has often said he decided to run for office because he felt his war injuries would make attaining the same rank as his father and grandfather “impossible.” But Mr. Lehman, now an adviser to the McCain campaign, and two other top Navy officers familiar with Mr. McCain’s file insist that was not the case.Instead, many who knew him say, Mr. McCain seemed bored by Navy life. “Sitting down with Anwar Sadat or Deng Xiaoping and being treated as an equal — that is pretty heady stuff,” said Rhett Dawson, a former aide to Mr. Tower who is now president of an electronics trade group. “It had opened his eyes to a much broader world.”Mr. McCain was captivated, recalled Jeffrey Record, then an aide to former Senator Sam Nunn, the hawkish Georgia Democrat. “He thrives on competition, and he thrives on political combat,” Mr. Record said. “He saw the glamour of it. I think he really got smitten with the celebrity of power.”It is unclear how long Mr. McCain has dreamed of the White House. Languishing in a North Vietnamese prison camp in 1970, he once mused aloud about the presidency, a cellmate, Richard A. Stratton, told a reporter eight years ago.But when he returned from Vietnam in March 1973, Mr. McCain was so determined to continue as a Navy pilot that in defiance of his doctors he underwent a year of excruciating physical therapy to force an injured knee back to the required range of motion.A steady trickle of other former P.O.W.’s were running for office, and Mr. McCain’s well-publicized valor as a captive had made him a minor celebrity. But he rebuffed invitations to enter politics, focusing instead on his assignment commanding a fighter squadron near Jacksonville, Fla. He blamed Congress for “willfully breaking America’s word,” he later wrote, which he considered “shameful.”But Adm. James L. Holloway, the chief of naval operations, saw other uses for Mr. McCain. Mr. Holloway knew that Mr. McCain’s father had once excelled as a Senate liaison. And though the son had earned a reputation as a playboy at the Naval academy, Mr. Holloway thought then-Commander McCain might have inherited the skills and judgment needed to deal with senators.“He could smoke a cigar and play a little poker,” Mr. Holloway recalled in an interview. “But he didn’t let the situation get out of hand. He could tag along and take care of them and pay the bills and remember where they parked the car. And he was very circumspect. He didn’t get them in trouble.”Mr. McCain, for his part, was turning 40 and unsure of his path. A shoulder injury still limited his reach, complicating his prospects as a pilot. His marriage to Carol McCain, a former model who was nearly crippled in a car accident while he was imprisoned, was coming apart. He was engaged in a series of extramarital “dalliances,” he later told his biographer, Robert Timberg.Mr. McCain, in a recent e-mail message, said he was excited about the liaison job. After his release from prison, he wrote, “almost every duty seemed enjoyable.” But some former Senate aides who knew him then say that, at first, he seemed discouraged, stuck at one of several desks in a spartan office. “He looked down and depressed,” recalled William Bader, a former aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.But Mr. McCain, promoted to captain, threw himself into courting the lawmakers who shaped Navy policy. He formed especially close friendships with two relative liberals about his age: Senator William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican who represented a major shipbuilding state and later became defense secretary, and Senator Gary Hart, a Colorado Democrat who had managed the antiwar presidential campaign of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota in 1972.A trip to Asia in late 1978 cemented their bond. Mr. McCain and the two senators stole away from official briefings to stroll in the Ginza district of nightclubs and restaurants in Tokyo, visit the Temple of the Reclining Buddha in Bangkok and take a memorable midnight tour of what Mr. Hart remembered as that city’s “light and dark sides.” In a memoir, Mr. Cohen recalled drinking beer with Mr. McCain at the Hyatt Regency bar overlooking Seoul, watching beautiful Korean women seduce a tipsy traveler.“He was a salesman par excellence,” Mr. Cohen recalled in an interview, crediting Mr. McCain with redirecting his career by persuading him to join the Armed Services Committee.The three became regulars together at the Monocle, a watering hole near the Senate. “We would laugh and tell stories about our colleagues,” Mr. Hart recalled. “ ‘So-and-so said something in a caucus meeting.’ He found it fascinating.”In turn, Mr. McCain helped Mr. Hart become an officer in the Navy Reserves. For Mr. Cohen, Mr. McCain became a model for the P.O.W.-politician heroes of two novels the Maine senator later wrote. After Mr. McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley at a Honolulu bar on another trip in 1979, Mr. Cohen and Mr. Hart were groomsmen at the couple’s wedding the following year.Mr. McCain later said that he was inspired to seek public office in part by the example of Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, the staunch cold warrior who led the defection to the right of the foreign policy thinkers now known as neoconservatives.“Thank God for Scoop Jackson,” Mr. McCain wrote in his 2002 memoir, “Worth the Fighting For.” “Without his courage, I doubt we would have recovered from Vietnam as quickly as we did, which would have left those who sacrificed there all the more haunted by the futility of the experience.”The strait-laced “soda-pop Jackson” sometimes brought his school-age children along on official trips, and Mr. McCain played baby sitter. But Mr. Jackson never went in for the kind of camaraderie Mr. McCain enjoyed with Mr. Hart and Mr. Cohen.In Mr. Tower, however, Mr. McCain found both a social companion and a political mentor. “Tower treated him like a son,” recalled I. N. Kiland, one of Mr. McCain’s colleagues in the liaison office. “And John idolized John Tower.” (Mr. McCain, in his memoir, acknowledged the “familial” comparisons.)Mr. Tower was a high-living political powerhouse. But he was also a former Navy man who had served under Mr. McCain’s grandfather in World War II and was so sentimental about his service that he stayed in the reserves through his Senate career and packed his uniform for every trip abroad, his aides said.One of Mr. McCain’s first jobs as liaison was accompanying a delegation Mr. Tower led to the Wehrkunde conference, an annual security meeting in Munich during the Bavarian equivalent of Mardi Gras. The conference became known as kind of senatorial spring break.The event has grown “a lot tamer” since the late ’70s, recalled Mr. Cohen, who described the heyday of the conference vividly in his novel, “Dragon Fire”: “Beer and passions flowed. All restrictions were off. Grounds for divorce were suspended. Members of Congress, particularly the unmarried ones, would look at the German women, who were ready and willing for the taking, and think they had slipped the surly bonds of moral conformity.”In Washington, Mr. Tower began summoning Mr. McCain for a drink at the end of the day. And when they traveled, Mr. McCain took charge of supplying Mr. Tower’s hotel rooms with Johnnie Walker Black. One night at a hotel in Saudi Arabia, one of many Middle Eastern countries where alcohol is banned, Mr. McCain amused his patron by leaving empty bottles for the authorities to find outside the room of a group of Frenchmen — a prank Mr. Tower later delighted at recounting.The Texan also influenced Mr. McCain’s approach to politics. Mr. Tower, who as a graduate student in London had studied the prewar British Conservative Party, saw in President Carter shades of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement, his former aides recalled. As the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Tower hammered Mr. Carter over the hostages in Iran, support for Taiwan, SALT II and the Soviet invasion in Afghanistan — debates Mr. Tower and other hawks saw as skirmishes in a larger battle over whether America would shrink from confrontation or return to the offensive after Vietnam.“McCain was a rapt student,” said Mr. Dawson, the former Tower aide. “He followed the debates, and he would take part in them in ways that went way beyond his position as bag-carrier or representative of the Navy.”Mr. Tower was so close to his protégé that he sometimes raised eyebrows by including Mr. McCain in committee staff meetings that were closed to other military liaisons, Mr. Kiland said. His close ties with Mr. Tower, in turn, helped Mr. McCain earn high marks from his Navy bosses, although with some reservations about his grasp for details.“Sometimes you had to really explain things to him and put him in a context that he really appreciated,” said former Adm. George Kinnear, Captain McCain’s Pentagon superior. “But he was a hard worker once he bought off on an issue.”Mr. McCain, with his fame and family, would circumvent the Navy’s chain of command for senators with issues like fighting a base closure, pushing for a new Navy hospital or helping a local contractor, aides said. “McCain had a big Rolodex, we used to say,” recalled Michael Hastings, a former Cohen aide. “He could really deliver for senators on both sides of the aisle.”Over time, Captain McCain also became a minor political player in his own right, sometimes working against the Navy’s official position under the Carter administration. To agitate for laws boosting military pay, former aides said, Mr. McCain steered senators on a trip to Norfolk, Va., toward Navy seamen collecting food stamps. And when the secretary of the Navy declined to replace a giant aircraft carrier, Mr. McCain collected information inside the Navy for lobbyists pushing to build a new one, eventually helping to override a presidential veto.In his e-mail message, Mr. McCain said he had only been exercising his responsibility to provide senators “the latest and most accurate information.” But former Adm. Clarence A. Hill Jr., then a lobbyist for a new carrier working with Mr. McCain, said: “He was going behind the back of the secretary of the Navy. It is as simple as that.”Mr. McCain said in his e-mail message that he had found his Navy job “rewarding and fascinating until my last day of service,” but his former colleagues say that by 1980 they knew he was wrestling with his future.“There was always this question, ‘Didn’t he want to be an admiral like his father and grandfather?’ ’ Mr. Hastings recalled. “He would say, ‘I don’t think that is what I want to do with the rest of my life.’ ”Navy psychiatrists offered another explanation. Mr. McCain had long struggled to escape “the shadow of his father,” Dr. P. F. O’Connell wrote in Mr. McCain’s Navy file after his return from Vietnam. But his hero’s homecoming had liberated him, bringing a “smile of fulfillment and relief” when he first heard Admiral McCain introduced as “Commander McCain’s father.” Dr. O’Connell wrote: “He had arrived.”Finally, in the spring of 1981, Mr. McCain told his father that he was leaving the Navy.His Senate friends were already moving to jump-start Mr. McCain’s new career. Mr. Cohen connected Mr. McCain with an experienced political consultant, J. Brian Smith, who had initially dismissed working for such a neophyte. And, Mr. Cohen said, he also encouraged Mr. McCain to look away from his previous home in Florida and toward Arizona. His new wife came from a prominent family there, a safe Republican House seat was expected to open up, and Senator Barry Goldwater was expected to retire soon.Mr. Tower did more than anyone else to help. He lent Mr. McCain his fund-raising consultant, raised money for him and enlisted one of Arizona’s most popular Republicans to endorse Mr. McCain over two more experienced primary candidates. “Whatever I asked him for, he gave without hesitation,” Mr. McCain recalled.He won his House seat in 1982, a year after he left the Navy, and his Senate seat four years later. Mr. Tower retired in 1985, but their paths crossed again when the Texan was nominated to be secretary of defense by President George Bush. The influential Christian conservative organizer Paul M. Weyrich accused Mr. Tower of public drunkenness and philandering, imperiling his confirmation. A chorus of others echoed the charges.Mr. McCain was stunned at the Senate’s outrage. “There were too many hearty drinkers around the place who might not always have been the most exemplary of devoted spouses to begrudge John his vices,” he wrote in a chapter of his memoirs. “The sins Tower was accused of were hardly Washington novelties.”Leaping to his mentor’s defense, Mr. McCain denounced Mr. Weyrich as a holier-than-thou hypocrite, scrambled to discredit the charges and exploded in fits of rage at colleagues. At Mr. Tower’s defeat, Mr. McCain choked back tears.“God bless you, John Tower,” he said from the Senate floor. “You’re a damn fine sailor.”'"
"'08-05-30,'0','Responding to criticism that he did not voice his objections when he was in the White House, Mr. McClellan said that he was swayed at the time by his affection for the president and respect for the president’s policy team. “I gave them the benefit of the doubt, like a lot of Americans,” he said. Mr. McClellan said he later concluded that “things went terribly off course” in Iraq after he left what he termed “the White House bubble,” where outside views often were not considered.Also speaking Thursday morning on “Today,” Dan Bartlett, a former counselor to the president, sought to minimize Mr. McClellan’s participation in events leading up to the Iraq war, noting that during that time he was deputy press secretary for domestic affairs. He said that Mr. McClellan’s assertion in his new book that intelligence was shaded to justify the war “is wrong.”Mr. McClellan responded that, as deputy press secretary at the time, he often filled in as press secretary and he participated in meetings leading up to the war.Mr. McClellan’s remarks came a day after the White House and a tight-knit group of former aides sought to depict him as disgruntled and trying to cash in with sensational allegations to sell books.The result has been a kind of public excommunication of Mr. McClellan by some of the people he once worked most closely, among them Karl Rove, the political strategist; Frances Fragos Townsend, the former domestic security adviser; Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush’s first press secretary, and Mr. Bartlett.Mr. McClellan said on Thursday that he was expressing his views now because of “a loyalty to the truth and the values I was raised on.”The cries of betrayal from former aides served as a stern warning to other potential turncoats that, despite some well-publicized cracks, the Bush inner circle remains tight. Their language was so similar that the collective reaction amounted to a big inside-the-Beltway echo chamber.All seemed to take their cues from Dana Perino, the current press secretary. Ms. Perino used the words “sad” and “puzzled” to describe the White House response, as if Mr. McClellan had undergone some kind of emotional breakdown, while making the case that if Mr. McClellan had problems with Mr. Bush he should have raised them while in the president’s employ.And all seemed to suggest that maybe Mr. McClellan had been hijacked by liberal New York book editors who prodded him to turn out a memoir that did not reflect his own beliefs.“This does not sound like Scott; it really doesn’t,” Mr. Rove said on Fox News Channel.“You’ve heard the way Scott briefed — it doesn’t sound like him,” Mr. Fleischer said. He said he could not wait to hear Mr. McClellan talk about the book on television, “to see if there’s a written Scott and an oral Scott.”Later on Thursday, Ms. Perino was asked by a reporter aboard Air Force One about a passage in Mr. McClellan’s book that involved the exposure of the wife of Joseph C. Wilson IV, Valerie, as a C.I.A. agent.The reporter said the book said that a question about the issue was shouted to Mr. Bush as they were boarding Air Force One. Mr. McClellan says the question prompted him to ask Mr. Bush directly if he was the one who had authorized the leaking of her name. The passage says Mr. Bush told Mr. McClellan, “Yes, I was.”Ms. Perino answered the question, saying: “I don’t know. Obviously, I wasn’t there, and obviously I don’t know the context.”Ms. Perino went on to say, “I don’t think that’s what Scott says in the book, and I think that everyone should go back and look at it a little bit more carefully.” When asked directly if Mr. Bush ever authorized the leaking of classified information, she said she was “not aware of that.”Mr. McClellan’s book, “What Happened: Inside the Bush White House and Washington’s Culture of Deception,” is due out next week, but copies leaked out Tuesday night. In it, Mr. McClellan, who was press secretary 2003 to 2006, bluntly accuses Mr. Bush of misleading the nation into war.Mr. McClellan uses the book to drop a personal bombshell, recounting a phone conversation between Mr. Bush and a political supporter in which, he says, he overheard the president dismiss “ridiculous campaign rumors” about accusations of cocaine usage by saying he could not recall if he had tried the drug.“We had some pretty wild parties back in the day,” Mr. McClellan wrote, recounting Mr. Bush’s words, “and I just don’t remember.”'"

"'08-05-31,'0','State Department officials have assembled a team of reactor experts and translators to go through the seven boxes of plutonium documents in hand. The documents go back to 1987 and contain information about North Korea’s three major campaigns to reprocess plutonium for weapons — in 1990, 2003 and 2005, administration officials said.The documents do not include any information about North Korea’s uranium program or proliferation activities. The declaration is part of what officials call a six-party nuclear agreement — still a work in progress — among North Korea, the United States, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.The declaration and the agreement are facing skepticism from Congress and from more hard-line North Korea experts who say that the North cannot be trusted. A former diplomat who recently met with North Korean officials said Thursday at a forum on North Korea that the North was not planning to give up all of its nuclear weapons or material.The former diplomat, Charles L. Pritchard, who is now head of the Korea Economic Institute and was a North Korea policy coordinator under Presidents Clinton and Bush, said the North Korean officials told him they would destroy their nuclear facilities but not necessarily destroy the weapons and material already manufactured. Mr. Pritchard said the North Koreans also told him they expected to be provided with light-water reactors for dismantling their nuclear installations.Tom Casey, the deputy spokesman for the State Department, said: “With all due respect to Mr. Pritchard, he’s a former government official. I’m not sure who he’s talking to. But I think the secretary, the president and Chris Hill have all made clear that we expect the North Koreans to provide us a declaration that meets the requirements of the six parties.”The question of uranium could also eventually confront American intelligence agencies with an even bigger challenge, if the North Koreans ever get around to completing a declaration about any nuclear activities involving uranium. The United States has long asserted that North Korea’s weapons efforts included the enrichment of uranium, but the North has denied having an uranium program.SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — North Korea fired three short-range missiles into waters off its western coast in what appears to be a routine test, the news agency Yonhap reported Saturday.The three ship-to-ship missiles were fired into the sea on Friday, Yonhap reported, citing South Korean officials whom it did not identify. The report said that two of them seem to have misfired.The agency quoted an unidentified defense official as saying the tests did not appear to be meant to provoke the South, since they were fired well away from contested waters.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','So bitter and passionate, it turns out, that global warming can divide families. Even the Rockefellers.Last year was another fabulous year for Exxon Mobil. It made a record $40.6 billion in profits. It replaced its reserves, no easy task with oil so hard to find and extract these days. Its safety record was stellar. Its return on capital was an astounding 32 percent, another record. It spent $21 billion in capital investments while also paying out $36 billion on a combination of dividends and stock buy backs. It share price rose 22 percent.You can argue, as many do, that this performance is nothing more than a case of holding out the umbrella while it rains money — that it’s all due to the dramatic run-up in the price of oil. But it’s a lot more than that. Exxon Mobil’s competitors are operating in the same environment, and they can’t touch its performance.As he laid out the company’s results during a 45-minute speech that opened the annual meeting, Mr. Tillerson kept using the word “discipline.” “By maintaining discipline and rigor in everything we do” the company would continue to outperform the competition, he said, for instance. Discipline and rigor are indeed at the heart of the company’s engineering culture, and have a lot to do with why Exxon Mobil is so successful. When you’re spending literally billions of dollars building a refinery in China, as Exxon Mobil is, you can’t afford to be sloppy. “I wish our government were run as efficiently as Exxon Mobil,” said Fadel Gheit, an oil analyst with Oppenheimer & Company.That discipline is drummed into Exxon Mobil executives very early — which gets at another characteristic of the company: it is extremely insular. Like most Exxon Mobil executives, Mr. Tillerson signed on in his early 20s and never left. And that bugs its critics. Many of those who spoke out against the company at the annual meeting — including Ms. Goodwin — talked about the need to bring “fresh perspectives” to the board. That, she said, was why she and other Rockefellers supported the resolution to bring in an independent board chairman.“Their strength is that they are an inward-looking company with discipline,” said Mr. Monks, who has sponsored his independent chairman resolution for a half-dozen years. “Their weakness is that they are an inward-looking company with discipline.” He’s got a point; the same qualities that make Exxon Mobil the world’s best producer of oil and gas also cause it to be a terrible articulator of its own message. Its executives really only feel comfortable when they’re speaking to each other.But let’s be honest here: gaining fresh perspective is hardly the primary reason the dissident Rockefellers got behind Mr. Monks’s resolution. The Monks proposal was a stalking horse for the issue that matters most to them: global warming. Most of the members of the family who are critical of Exxon Mobil are staunch environmentalists, who feel that “their” company should be doing more — much, much more — to help the world move to alternative sources of energy. Here they are on far shakier ground.During his presentation to shareholders, Mr. Tillerson laid out Exxon Mobil’s core belief: despite climate change concerns, and efforts to come up with alternatives to oil, “there would be enormous growth in energy demand,” he said. And, he added, oil and gas would still supply over 60 percent of that demand in the year 2030. When it was her turn to speak, Ms. Goodwin passionately objected to that forecast.Exxon Mobil’s projections “depend on two critical but untested assumptions,” she said, reading from notes. “First, developing countries will enjoy strong economic growth. And second, global consumption of oil and gas will significantly increase. This second assumption is wrong.” In her view, there was a high likelihood that new technologies would reduce the world’s reliance on oil and gas — and Exxon Mobil would suffer because of its stubborn refusal to spearhead new technologies back when it still had a chance.What’s more, she added, if Exxon Mobil turned out to be right, and demand for oil and gas continued to grow for the next quarter century and beyond, that would bring about its own set of disastrous results — namely the environmental consequences of global warming. “It will cause weather disasters,” she predicted. “It will have a huge and harmful effect on the global economy upon which Exxon Mobil depends.”What she and the other family members seem to really want is for Exxon Mobil to begin taking steps to transition away from the thing it does better than any entity in the world: find and produce oil. But where is it written that oil companies should be the ones to lead us into the promised land of alternative energy? The world doesn’t work that way. Transforming technologies will most likely come from innovators who have never set foot in an oil company, and don’t have an oil company’s baggage. Expecting Exxon Mobil to move the world to an oil-free future is a little like expecting buggy-whip manufacturers to invent the automobile.What the Rockefellers were trying to do at the annual meeting is push Exxon Mobil toward their belief system — their global warming religion — and that is a place the company is unwilling to go. Its hard-headed view is that it is doing the most good for the most people by finding the oil and gas the world is going to need for the foreseeable future — and that global warming is not likely to lessen that need. Realistically, I find that notion difficult to disagree with.As for Ms. Goodwin’s prediction of weather catastrophe, it could certainly happen. But it might not. We just don’t know enough yet. It would be lovely if we had new technologies that made the world much less reliant on oil but that’s not likely. India and China, just for starters, desperately need more energy to fuel their ambitions, and it is hardly fair to ask them to halt their economic progress — nor are they likely to do so. The best we can hope to do is dampen our need for oil — with such things as hybrid cars — by making, continual, small, practical breakthroughs. Believe it or not, Exxon Mobil has scientists working on precisely those kinds of practical breakthroughs.In the end, most shareholders agreed with Exxon Mobil. And why not? If a company’s stock price is its report card, then Exxon Mobil is getting straight A. Ms. Goodwin’s primary resolution, calling for the company to produce a climate change report, got only 10.4 percent of the vote. Mr. Monks’s resolution got 39.5 percent — about the same as last year. The Rockefeller support made zero difference.At his press conference afterward, Mr. Tillerson was asked about global warming. “My view is that climate change policy is so important to the world that to not have a debate on it is irresponsible. We don’t know everything about it. Nobody has this figured out. Anybody who tells you they have this all figured out is not telling you the truth. We have to understand that climate change policy, whatever it turns out to be, is going to hurt some people. But let’s at least have an open debate about it, so everybody knows what the facts are.”Would that the Rockefellers had said something as sensible — and as disciplined — as that. Maybe next year.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','WASHINGTON — A special three-judge court ruled Friday that Congress acted constitutionally when it extended the law requiring sections of the country with a history of racial discrimination to get federal approval for any changes in voting procedures.The unanimous decision upheld a central provision of the Voting Rights Act, which Congress initially passed in 1965 and has extended several times since, most recently for 25 years in 2006. Section 5 of the law prohibits several states, mostly in the South, and some local government agencies from changing their election practices without permission from the Justice Department or the courts.Each renewal of the law has been followed by a legal challenge from some state or local agency to this “preclearance” requirement. The latest challenge was undertaken by the board of a public utility near Austin, Tex., which said the requirement conferred a “badge of shame” over “conditions that existed 30 or more years ago but have long since been remedied.”The Northwest Austin Utility District argued that Congress lacked sufficient evidence of racial discrimination to justify the intrusion on state sovereignty.Judge David S. Tatel, who wrote Friday’s decision, agreed with the Justice Department, however, that Congress was appropriately concerned about discrimination against minority voters. The law was extended, Judge Tatel said, only after substantial Congressional findings that “attempts to discriminate persist and evolve.” He noted that from 1980 to 2000, the attorney general acted to block 421 voting changes that the Justice Department had found “intentionally discriminatory.”The law initially applied only to the states of the Confederacy and was intended to address schemes like poll taxes, which, dating from Reconstruction, were devised by local officials to discourage black voter participation. But its requirements have since been expanded to some parts of New York, Michigan and California, where the concern is about the rights of ethnic groups other than African-Americans.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','It is unclear whether they discussed makeup, but on Thursday in Stockholm, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had a late-night meeting with the rock group Kiss. Ms. Rice was in Sweden for an international conference concerning Iraq; the band was there to play a sold-out concert and asked to meet her. After a dinner with Carl Bildt, the Swedish foreign minister, Ms. Rice joined Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer in the executive lounge of the Sheraton Hotel, where they signed autographs and gave T-shirts to her staff. “It was really fun” to meet them, Ms. Rice said, according to The Associated Press, adding that they seemed well informed about politics. Though she said she had never seen the band perform, she named “Rock and Roll All Nite” as her favorite Kiss song.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','A four-foot-high metal and fabric sculpture of a spider by Louise Bourgeois sold for $4.5 million, a record price for the artist, at Christie’s International in Paris, Bloomberg News reported. The sculpture by Ms. Bourgeois, 96, was bought by a European collector on the telephone, competing against three other bidders on Tuesday, the auction house said. Works by Ms. Bourgeois, known for her spider sculptures, already commanded the highest prices for a living female artist. Her most expensive sculpture, an eight-foot-high arachnid, fetched $4 million with fees at Christie’s New York in November 2006, according to Artnet.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','Dr. Richard R. Lower, whose daring heart surgeries on animals in the 1950s helped pave the way for the first successful transplant of a human heart in 1967, died on May 17 in Twin Bridges, Mont. He was 78.The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.As a surgical resident at Stanford University in 1959, Dr. Lower transplanted part of a dog’s heart to a second dog, which lived for eight days, shattering a previous survival record of seven hours. He was working with Dr. Norman E. Shumway, who became a towering figure in cardiac surgery and eventually oversaw the transplanting of 800 human hearts.One innovation was to leave in place sections of the recipient heart’s upper chambers, which shortened the duration of the operation. But when an infection took hold, Dr. Lower and Dr. Shumway euthanized the dog and drew a prescient conclusion: that difficulties in transplants would no longer be technical or tied to problems in surgery so much as to conquering infection and the patient’s immune response.Dr. Lower (pronounced LAU-er) continued to experiment with animal transplants after moving to the Medical College of Virginia, in Richmond, in 1965. A rush to apply the procedure in human cases of severe cardiac disease and malfunction was inevitable, and a South African surgeon, Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard, performed the first successful human heart transplant in 1967. Dr. Barnard had visited Dr. Lower’s laboratory in 1966 and studied the Shumway-Lower approach and technique.Dr. Lower declined an opportunity to perform an early heart transplant because of incompatibility of the blood types of the potential donor and recipient. Then, in 1968, he operated on a 54-year-old man, who died a week afterward. In the same year, Dr. Lower operated on a 43-year-old man, and that surgery proved to be highly effective; the patient survived for six and a half years.Scientific caution and startling patient mortality reduced the pressure for transplants in the 1970s, although Dr. Lower and others continued to refine the procedure. At Stanford, Dr. Shumway combined the use of cyclosporin, an immunosuppressant drug, with an innovative biopsy technique that enabled him to readily check the body’s acceptance or rejection of a new organ. In time, survival rates in the first year for transplant patients rose from roughly 60 percent in the 1970s to nearly 90 percent today. Transplant recipients have lived as long as 27 years after the surgery.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','Q. Many companies are flocking to new media for advertising. Are you following their lead?A. We are. That’s a fun thing about a company our size — we had more than $110 million in revenue in 2007 — and the fact that we’re family-owned. We don’t have a lot of red tape. We’ve been involved in blogging and social networking and online videos for a couple of years, and we’re having a ball. I’m young, 47, and it’s fun for me to do videos so that people can put a face and personality to Bigelow Tea. There are not a lot of family-owned companies that are national. It’s great that we have this opportunity to let the consumer get to know us, and it’s another way we can get to know them.I’ve always called consumers personally if they had a problem. So using the new media is an extension of a philosophy we already knew — take care of your customers, talk to them. I create videos for YouTube and young people respond with their own. I watch a few every week and laugh. It’s so great to see a 23-year-old from the middle of the country holding up her box of Bigelow Tea. How great is it to be able to see all kinds of people, with their own styles, wanting to talk about Bigelow Tea on the Internet?Q. Two years ago you teamed up with Arizona Beverage Company. How is that working?A. We have a wonderful alliance. We make their tea bags and distribute and market them, and they make our ready-to-drink beverages. From October to the end of April, Bigelow sold over 10 million cups of Arizona tea. They make ready-to-drink vanilla chai and mocha chai for us and distribute them on the East Coast. They are working with us on some other projects as well that have not yet been announced.They’re also a family company and like to have fun like we do. They’re quality-minded and have a great business model. There’s never a time I meet with them that I don’t walk out saying, “Holy cow.” Some people congratulated me on buying Arizona. Buy Arizona? Not so. It’s a billion-dollar company.Q. If you don’t have to worry about shareholders, what are the pressures on a family-owned business?A. I can’t even imagine the pressures on a publicly owned company. One of our competitors, with whom we have a good relationship, is the publicly owned Celestial Seasonings. Celestial has the pressure of financial reports, closing statements and the like. We don’t have that. The pressure I feel is to be successful for the families of our 330 employees. And, of course, we have to take care of the consumer. You have to do due diligence on consumer safety day in and day out so you don’t have any problems in that area. You don’t worry about safety after you have a problem, you worry about it when you have none.Q. Researchers occasionally reverse themselves on the health benefits of certain foods. Do the health benefits of your product still hold true?A. I’ve been lecturing on the benefits of tea for 15 years, and the research has been consistent. It’s not a new phenomenon. What you have to realize is that you’re drinking the brew of a vegetable, and it’s loaded with antioxidants. It doesn’t matter if it’s green or black. In March, a study reported that drinking tea while taking antibiotics boosted or enhanced the benefit of the antibiotic and is helpful in fighting bacteria that is not normally receptive to antibiotics.Q. Have you not directed your efforts toward the international market over the years because of the difficulty of competing with countries that produce tea, like China, Sri Lanka, Kenya and Turkey?A. Years ago we did not place much emphasis in this area, but we changed that about three years ago. Today it is a business that is bringing us much growth. In the last few years, that segment of our company has grown in triple digits.'"

"'08-05-31,'0','ROME — The Vatican on Friday reaffirmed a ban on ordaining women as priests, warning that the consequences of any such ordination would be the automatic excommunication of anyone involved.The decree was a reaction to specific episodes of “so-called ordinations in various parts of the world,” according to Msgr. Angelo Amato, the secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which issued the decree. In recent years, dozens of women have been ordained by individuals acting outside of the church’s authority.The document was also drafted to give bishops uniform guidelines on an increasingly contentious matter, as a growing number of Catholics contest the church’s position that only men can be ordained as priests.In an interview for Vatican Radio, Monsignor Amato reiterated that the church did “not feel authorized to change the will of its founder, Jesus Christ.” The Vatican, he added, felt “in good company” because the Orthodox and ancient Eastern churches have also preserved what he said was a 2,000-year-old tradition.The decree went into effect on Thursday, after it was published in the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano.Last March, the archbishop of St. Louis, Raymond L. Burke, excommunicated two women in his diocese and another living in Germany after they were ordained as priests as part of the Roman Catholic Womenpriests organization.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','PARIS — French judges have filed preliminary charges of insider trading against Noël Forgeard, a former chief executive of EADS, as they investigate stock sales executed ahead of the announcement of major delays in building the Airbus A380 superjumbo.Mr. Forgeard, 61, continued to maintain his innocence during two days of questioning by the examining judge, Xaviere Simeoni, Mr. Forgeard’s lawyer, Jean-Alain Michel, said Friday.The executive was forced out of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, the parent of Airbus, in July 2006, in the fallout over delays with the A380. The French financial markets regulator, the Autorité des Marchés Financiers, is investigating whether Mr. Forgeard, along with 16 other executives, traded on insider knowledge of those delays and others involving the smaller A350 jetliner.Mr. Forgeard was released on bail of an unspecified amount and did not have to surrender his passport, according to two people with knowledge of the case. He is forbidden from contacting another individual who was questioned by the police, but is not under investigation, in the same case, these people added.Other individuals are also likely to be interviewed, possibly before a summer break, according to the people with knowledge of the case.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','LONDON — The British Bankers’ Association said on Friday that it planned to strengthen the oversight of the London interbank offered rate after questions arose about the veracity of the 22-year-old benchmark used to set borrowing costs around the world.The group rejected calls by some analysts and investors to change the way it calculates the rate, known as Libor, after accusations that it may be based on inaccurate information. But the group said it would give more details soon about how it planned to improve supervision of the process.“The committee will be strengthening the oversight of B.B.A. Libor,” it said in a statement on its Web site. “The details will be published in due course.”Libor moved into the spotlight in August when the subprime mortgage crisis made banks more cautious about lending and many preferred to hold on to their money. As a result, Libor, or the cost of borrowing among banks, spiked and treasurers and central bankers have struggled to bring the rate back down.The credibility of the rate, used to price more than $360 trillion in financial products, came under threat in April when the dollar rate shot up after the bankers association said it would ban any bank from its panel that deliberately misstated rates.Every morning, the London-based association asks a panel of 16 banks to say at what rate each would be able to borrow a reasonable amount and then calculates a single rate for different currencies and borrowing periods. The British Bankers’ Association brought forward its annual review of the Libor process by a month after claims that some banks had quoted lower rates to make it cheaper to borrow or dispel concerns that it was difficult for them to borrow.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','He added: “Even airlines with the strongest balance sheets find their cash flow under pressure these days.”But the appointed administrator for Silverjet, Begbies Traynor, said Friday that “a number of interested parties have already been in contact,” making the company confident that it can find a buyer.Small business-class-only airlines mushroomed over the last two years, pledging to change the face of air travel by catering to a growing market of business passengers. But competition from larger network carriers and a record oil price that increased more than 40 percent over the last six months meant that airlines without strong financing started to run out of cash.One Silverjet rival, Maxjet Airways, stopped flying in December and another, Eos Airlines, grounded its planes last month. L’Avion, a French privately owned airline, still flies between Paris and New York.Andrew Fitchie, an airline analyst at Collins Stewart in London, said it was just a matter of time for the smaller business-class-only carriers to close down because they lack the economy of scale.“It’s very difficult for the stand-alone operator without a large portfolio of offerings and a strong franchise to pull it off,” Mr. Fitchie said. “The high oil price has just precipitated their problems.”That does not mean that the business-class-only concept is doomed, he said. Atlantic business class travel is the most lucrative for larger airlines, and as the likes of Silverjet dwindle, larger carriers started to adopt the all-business-class idea. British Airways, one of Europe’s biggest airlines, announced plans in February to start its own business-class-only flight from London to New York next year. Singapore Airlines started a similar service on May 17, and Deutsche Lufthansa operates such flights through a subsidiary.Larger airlines are not immune to the increase of fuel prices, and some analysts predicted more companies would go out of business. British Airways said this month that higher oil prices were expected to contribute to a “particularly difficult” first quarter, and several carriers announced plans to eliminate routes, retire aircraft and raise fares. American Airlines, the world’s largest carrier, plans to cut thousands of jobs and added a $15 fee to check one bag.Rising fuel costs also squeezed independent low-cost airlines. Oasis Hong Kong Airlines left thousands of passengers stranded when it ran out of money last month, and American carriers ATA Airlines, Aloha and Skybus Airlines also stopped flying.Silverjet, based in London’s Luton airport, never made a profit and struggled to stay in business. The company had to suspend its shares from trading a week ago when the money did not arrive.Mr. Hunt set up Silverjet with the help of his cousin Christopher Foyles of the British bookstore family empire after he had a string of disappointing experiences flying across the Atlantic. With money from an initial public offering, the airline started flying Boeing 767s with 100 flat-bed seats between Newark and London Luton airport in 2007 and added a route to Dubai in December.'"
"'08-05-31,'0','PARIS — French judges have filed preliminary charges of insider trading against Noël Forgeard, the former co-chief executive of European Aeronautic Defense and Space, Europe’s largest aerospace group, his lawyer said Friday. The charges relate to delays in the program to build the A380 superjumbo.Mr. Forgeard was detained by the French police on Wednesday but released early Friday after agreeing to post bail of an unspecified amount, his attorney, Jean-Alain Michel, told reporters.Regulators and judicial officials are investigating the possibility that up to 17 executives of Airbus and EADS knew as early as June 2005 that development costs and production delays at Airbus would lead to a decline in profit.That information should have prevented them from selling EADS shares, according to a document from the French regulatory agency Autorité des Marchés Financiers, which was obtained in April by a French online news service.Mr. Forgeard, who was ousted in July 2006 after delays in the A380 program, was listed in the document as having gained the most from his options, reaping more than 4.3 million euros, or $6.7 million. When the delays were announced in June, 2006, EADS shares fell by over a quarter of their value.Mr. Foregeard has denied any wrong-doing. Mr. Michel said his client told judges during his detention that had “had not committed insider trading,” The Associated Press reported. The charges against him do not signify “an element of guilt,” Mr. Michel was quoted as saying.Under French law, preliminary charges do not imply guilt and do not necessarily lead to a trial.Separately, the Airbus unit of EADS said Wednesday that orders for the A380, a superjumbo jet, would be a third lower than it previously forecast, as airlines grapple with higher fuel costs and slowing demand for air travel.'"
