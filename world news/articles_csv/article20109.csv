"'10-09-01,'1','This 860-square-foot unit on the top floor of a 19th-century apartment building has two bedrooms and one and a half bathrooms. The foyer has a floor-to-ceiling mirror, and frosted glass door to the guest bathroom, which has Italian fixtures made by Boffi. The master bedroom has a private balcony overlooking the courtyard, and red lacquer closet doors. A multi-paned transom window above the door lets light into the hallway. The second bedroom is currently being used as a dressing room. The master bathroom has gray-and-white marble floors and walls, and an oval bathtub made by Philippe Starck. A separate shower stall has royal blue floor tile. Glass block lets in light from the kitchen, on the other side of the wall.The eat-in kitchen has a rounded stainless steel sink with a squared-off faucet. The countertops and backsplash are granite. In the living room, a pull-down screen can be used to watch films with a home theater projector. The living room and kitchen both face the street, and each has a kakelugn, which are tiled wood-burning stoves found in most Swedish homes. There are parquet floors and radiator heat throughout.The building has a shared garden with an outbuilding that contains laundry facilities and a party room available to residents.Stockholm’s Ostermalm district is a quiet residential area with many older homes. From this apartment, the City Center is five minutes away on foot, on the other side of the Humlegarden park. The park has a playground, a soccer field, and walking paths. The international airport is 30 minutes away by car.The property market in Stockholm has been insulated from the worst of the housing crisis by low interest rates (currently as low as 1.5 percent for mortgages) and by a shortage of apartments in the city, said Anders Elbe, senior broker at Skeppsholmen Fastighetsmakleri Sotheby's International Realty, a real estate firm in Stockholm. The rental market is tightly regulated, Mr. Elbe said, and the difficulty of obtaining a lease means that many people hold onto leases after they move out, creating a ripple effect of renters subletting from other subletters. In addition, many rental apartments have been converted to condos in recent years, said Claudia Wormann, the head analyst at the Swedish Association of Real Estate Agents.'"

"'10-09-01,'1','Moreover, the commission’s chairman, Phil Angelides, and vice chairman, Bill Thomas, are finding it challenging to maintain support from all eight other commissioners. While squabbling within the panel has not broken into open dissent, several commissioners are divided over how much to blame specific individuals and banks, how and when to release the documents it has gathered and whether to make available testimony of government officials and bank executives it has interviewed privately.In a joint interview by phone on Tuesday, Mr. Angelides, a Democrat, and Mr. Thomas, a Republican, said that the turnover’s effects had been exaggerated and that they were optimistic about a consensus.“We’re doing our very best, and we will do our level best,” said Mr. Angelides. He said he had spoken recently with Thomas H. Kean, the former New Jersey governor who led the 9/11 Commission, which produced an acclaimed report that was a surprise best seller. “Several weeks out, they doubted whether they would get any kind of agreement on anything,” Mr. Angelides said.Mr. Thomas said that the law establishing the commission did not mandate unanimity, but “it’s always desirable,” he said.Created in May 2009, the commission got off to a slow start. Congressional leaders named the 10 members that July, and the commission met for the first time last September. Not until December did the commission name 14 senior staff members.The departures also include: Martin T. Biegelman, a veteran corporate fraud investigator; Bradley J. Bondi, a lawyer who returned to the Securities and Exchange Commission; Bartly A. Dzivi, a banking lawyer; and Beneva C. Schulte, who had been in charge of communications.Mr. Angelides, a former California state treasurer who unsuccessfully challenged Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s re-election campaign in 2006, said the departures had not delayed the commission’s work. “It’s difficult in your first year of operation to assemble a new team,” he said. “You always have a lot of dynamism, people coming and going.”On July 27, after Congress added $1.8 million to the panel’s initial budget of $8 million, Darrell Issa of California, the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, asked for details of its staff and budget.Mr. Issa noted the turnover and questioned the decision to appoint Wendy M. Edelberg, an economist on loan from the Fed, as executive director. She replaced J. Thomas Greene, who had worked in the California attorney general’s office.Another top staff member, Gregory H. Feldberg, who replaced Ms. Edelberg as research director after she was promoted, is also on loan from the Fed. He is the son of Chester B. Feldberg, one of three trustees overseeing the government’s majority stake in the American International Group, the giant insurer that collapsed in 2008.The father, known as Chet, is a former chairman of Barclays America and before that was in charge of bank supervision and regulation at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which critics say failed to regulate banks and then helped bail them out.Mr. Issa said the appointments of Ms. Edelberg and Mr. Feldberg raised the appearance of conflicts of interest — a claim Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas denied.“Wendy is in the position she’s in because she’s bright, talented, has an economics degree,” Mr. Thomas said, adding that she “knows how to work with bright, strong ego-driven people as well” because she worked with the Bush and Obama White Houses.Mr. Angelides called Gregory Feldberg “a wonderful, talented guy” and added: “He signed an ethics agreement and a confidentiality agreement and has recused himself from any matters relating to A.I.G.”Borrowing employees from other agencies, Mr. Thomas said, was the only way to get people who “had to be up to speed” on complex financial matters.In a letter on Aug. 9 to Mr. Issa, Mr. Angelides said that the commission was “devoting all our time, energy and resources” to the report, and that the $1.8 million would be used for “engaging additional investigators, researchers and report writers, and expanding our computerized document analysis resources.” (In comparison, the 9/11 Commission had a $15 million budget.)Mr. Angelides called the criticisms “silly, stupid Washington stuff,” adding: “I don’t know what Mr. Issa’s agenda is, but I can tell you what ours is.”The commission will also have field hearings this month in Bakersfield, Calif., Las Vegas, Miami and Sacramento.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','No lawsuits have been filed by the Lehman estate against the hedge funds, nor has anyone from the estate accused them of colluding in an effort to hurt Lehman’s stock price and profit from bets they might have placed that the firm’s shares would decline in value.But as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the Lehman estate issued subpoenas in April seeking documents from Goldman and the hedge funds that make reference to their Lehman-related investments, to see if any documents could provide a basis for a lawsuit to recover potentially billions of dollars in damages from the funds. None of the companies that received subpoenas would comment.Some Wall Street experts said that the law firm retained by the Lehman estate, Kasowitz Benson Torres & Friedman, has produced mixed results pursuing these types of cases, adding that the Lehman estate was looking under several rocks for money that it could return to the firm’s creditors.“The subpoenas appear to be part of a fishing expedition to see if there is any ammunition useful for a lawsuit that can shake some money out of the hedge funds,” said James J. Angel, an associate professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University. “If anyone digs deep enough they can find some e-mail that can be spun to look bad in court.”And these days, it is fairly easy to put a black hat on hedge funds, particularly those involved in short-selling, or trying to profit by betting that a given company’s stock price will fall. That puts them at odds with the management, stockholders and employees of the target company.Not that long ago, short-sellers were admired for their in-depth research and contrarian points of view. James S. Chanos of Kynikos Associates, for instance, was credited with exposing the lies behind the numbers at Enron well before anyone else did.The reputation of short-sellers, however, changed during the financial crisis, when they were sometimes viewed with suspicion by nervous investors and bankers. Soon they were painted as unpatriotic for profiting from the widespread distress in the nation’s banks and brokerage firms.Of course, short-sellers have been blamed for broad market losses before, like during the stock market panic in 1907 and through the huge market swings during the 1930s, said Robert Sloan, author of “Don’t Blame the Shorts: Why Short Sellers Are Always Blamed for Market Crashes and How History is Repeating Itself.”“You think these six guys brought down this firm? They didn’t. Incompetence brought Lehman down,” said Bill Fleckenstein, who said he was short on the stocks of many financial companies in 2008 and today runs a hedge fund that can hold both short and long positions in stocks.Questions about coordinated selling among hedge funds began to swirl when Bear Stearns ran into trouble in 2008.Later, Mr. Fuld and others inside Lehman became increasingly convinced that a cabal of short-sellers had collaborated with individuals inside Goldman Sachs to bring down his firm. In the spring and summer before Lehman collapsed, top executives of the company sent more than 20 complaints about damaging rumors and aggressive short-sellers to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Still, despite the feverish post-mortem analysis on the cause of Lehman’s failure, little evidence has surfaced that short-sellers brought down the company, according to experts who have followed the many inquiries into Lehman’s demise.For instance, the effect of short-sellers on Lehman was discussed in just four pages of the 2,200-page report from the examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court to determine what went wrong at Lehman and who was at fault.The report pointed instead to numerous factors that contributed to Lehman’s downfall, including accounting maneuvers that shuffled billions of dollars in assets off of Lehman’s books and demands from rival Wall Street banks that Lehman post collateral on loans it needed badly.This spring, the Lehman estate sued JPMorgan Chase, contending that the bank required Lehman to turn over $8.6 billion in collateral, setting off a cash squeeze at the firm. The estate hopes to recoup billions of dollars in collateral as well as damages.JPMorgan, which has denied the accusations in the Lehman suit, filed documents last month in court arguing that it offered financial support to Lehman in the crisis and that the suit “attempts to erase this history, breathing new life into the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.”Furthermore, lawyers for Och-Ziff, the fund run by Mr. Och that was subpoenaed for its records, argued in court documents that the S.E.C. had received and sifted through all of this same data two years ago. That inquiry “has gone nowhere because there is nothing,” a lawyer for Och-Ziff argued last month before Judge James M. Peck in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.But the S.E.C. examination of short-selling activity in 2008 is still active, according to two people with knowledge of the S.E.C.’s inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The funds could still be asked to produce documents beyond those in the initial request, which centered on activities in June 2008, one of the two people said. Lehman filed for bankruptcy in September 2008.Even if the Lehman estate finds a smoking gun in the hedge funds’ records and decides to pursue a claim against them, the case could be difficult to prove in court, some defense lawyers said.Proving that the hedge funds had positions that would have allowed them to profit from Lehman’s demise is the relatively easy part, they said. Proving that the hedge funds spread false rumors — and that those rumors caused direct harm to Lehman’s business or its stock price — are much tougher hurdles.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','It seemed to be the defining narrative of the 2009 elections in New York City: a billionaire mayor pouring $108 million of his own money into a re-election bid and undermining the fairness of the city’s publicly funded campaign finance system.But the most detailed examination of that election to date tells a very different story beyond the mayor’s race: a record-shattering surge in small donations from individuals, propelling an unusually large number of challengers to victory over incumbents.The examination, to be released on Wednesday by the city’s Campaign Finance Board, shows that changes enacted before the race encouraged 34,000 New Yorkers to make campaign donations for the first time; drastically curtailed the role of businesses, political committees and lobbyists in campaigns; and caused a major drop in donations from those doing business with the city.Perhaps most intriguingly, the new data suggests that, in a year when voter turnout was historically low and pundits treated the mayoral election as a foregone conclusion, many New Yorkers of more modest means felt compelled to participate in the election process.New York City adopted a sweeping campaign finance overhaul in 2007, aiming to create a more level playing field for candidates running against incumbents, who have historically had streams of big donations from special-interest groups and wealthy donors, helping them remain in office.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','Mark Ingram’s run for a second Heisman Trophy has been slowed, and possibly even derailed, before he has a chance to gain a yard.Ingram, Alabama’s star tailback, will miss the top-ranked Crimson Tide’s opener against San Jose State after injuring his left knee late in practice Monday, Coach Nick Saban said Tuesday.Saban said in a statement that Ingram, a junior, had an arthroscopic procedure and should recover in a “relatively short time.”Saban added, “Mark will definitely be out for this week’s game against San Jose State, and we will manage this on a week-to-week basis.”If the absence extends to more than one game, it figures to have more of an effect on Ingram’s bid to join Ohio State running back Archie Griffin as a two-time Heisman winner than it does on Alabama’s hopes for a repeat national title.San Jose State went 2-10 last season, but the Crimson Tide faces a much stiffer test in the second week of the season: No. 19 Penn State visits Tuscaloosa on Sept. 11, and then Alabama travels to Duke.'"

"'10-09-01,'1','Gadi Taub (“In Israel, Settling for Less,” Op-Ed, Aug. 30) appears to assume an either/or choice for Israel between secular and religious Zionism. To many of us religiously committed Jews in the diaspora, there is no conflict. We believe that the rebirth of the Jewish commonwealth is an affirmation of biblical prophecy as well as an achievement of the dreams of the original Zionists.But we also recognize that the immigration of a large Arab population into the entire Middle East, including the West Bank, since the Islamic conquests imposes constraints on any peace agreement that would be consistent with Jewish conceptions of justice.But that does mean that we do not hold strong convictions on the parameters of a just agreement that go beyond those of secular Zionism. In particular, many of us would oppose any imposition of borders that did not include the Old City of Jerusalem. To us, an Israel that did not include the City of David and the site of the Holy Temple would be bereft of its heart.It is good to read Gadi Taub call on the Israeli government to stop the religious settlers from undermining peace talks and to recognize that the future of Israel relies on a Palestinian state alongside Israel. The Obama administration should take his words as its core principle in guiding the talks starting this week.President Obama must use all the carrots and sticks, mostly sticks, at his disposal to persuade the Israeli leaders to extend the moratorium on settlement expansion. This should not be difficult considering that all settlements are illegal.The United States must be ready to bring the settlement issue to the Security Council. If religious Jews want to live in the West Bank, they may continue to do so, as Jewish citizens of Palestine, not as Israelis.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','It would be a first. “Nigeria,” Mr. Jega said quietly, “has never done anything like this.”The last election, in 2007, was widely viewed as a seriously flawed, leading to numerous court challenges that overturned the results in many races, though not the one for the presidency. “Nigeria has yet to hold a credible election,” Human Rights Watch said afterward.Now January is mentioned most often as the likeliest month for the next election, though April is also a possibility, and Mr. Jega, a political scientist, knows how much is riding on him.“Jega is not an angel or a magician,” he said with a quiet chuckle last week, pushing away the popular clamor that has penetrated even the thick double-locked doors and armed guards behind which he works. Violence is often a fixture of the pre-electoral maneuvering here, amply documented in human rights reports, and the authorities have confirmed that there have been fatal clashes recently between supporters of rival parties in northern Nigeria.The odds are against Mr. Jega, the new president of Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission, which until now has not lived up to its name — neither independent nor truly national because it has often served the interests of local politicians.The commission has been sharply criticized for sluggishness in revamping a voters’ list seen as manipulated by local incumbents, stuffed with the names of the dead, children, celebrities, triple-voters and whoever else politicians thought would be useful in improving their chances. There have even been thefts of voter registration machines by local politicians bent on compiling their own personal lists of voters, Mr. Jega said.The task is “herculean,” he acknowledged to Nigerian reporters shortly after his appointment. He must come up with an entirely new list of voters, perhaps 70 million people, by early December at the latest.To do this, he must deploy tens of thousands of voter registration machines — laptop computers with video and fingerprinting-technology — to Nigeria’s 120,000 polling places; he must train 360,000 workers, three per machine; and he must do all this in a country with bad-to-nonexistent roads and electricity. Where electricity exists, it is mostly supplied by someone’s gas-powered generators.As if that were not enough, Mr. Jega estimates that once all the registration equipment is in place, he will have only two weeks to compile the entire list.Some spots in this vast country, the size of California, Nevada and Arizona combined, are inaccessible by road. The machines, not yet in hand, will have to be to be delivered by the Nigerian Air Force or Navy, Mr. Jega said. And once the machines are in place, his workers must contend with governors who hold all the levers of power in their states, able to “frustrate the process at the local level,” he said.“The challenges are enormous,” he said. “What needs to be done is difficult but not impossible.”Others are more blunt. A Western diplomat in Abuja, who was not authorized to speak on the record, described Nigeria’s speeded-up electoral efforts as “a disaster in the making” and said the country was “totally unprepared for a general election.”Independent Nigerian observers are more optimistic about Mr. Jega’s chances, but barely.“It’s going to be a very, very uphill task to deploy the logistics, the whole gamut of logistics, required to mount effective elections,” said Olisa Agbakoba, a past president of the Nigerian Bar Association.Festus Okoye, president of Human Rights Monitor, said: “He is walking a very tight line. There is a possibility he may get people registered.”Wole Soyinka, the writer and Nobel laureate who is a leading critic of the governing People’s Democratic Party, said Mr. Jega “began with a minus.”Adding to the electoral uncertainty is the refusal so far of President Goodluck Jonathan to say whether he is running. Billboards in this capital, erected by supporters, urge him to do so. State television news broadcasts lead with panegyrics to the incumbent, and his government has been distributing hundreds of million of dollars in what it calls excess petroleum revenues to state governments and local councils.But Mr. Jonathan has held back, mindful of an unwritten rule in his party that says candidacies should alternate between northerners and southerners. Though he is from the south, he is merely finishing the uncompleted first term of Umaru Yar’Adua, a northerner, the former president whose illness led to Mr. Jonathan’s ascension this year.Some other candidacies have inspired dismay and derision in the Nigerian press. Brutality and corruption were hallmarks of Mr. Babangida’s rule, according to historians, but he is best known for having canceled the 1993 election, considered the fairest in Nigeria’s modern history until then, thus ushering in a new period of military dictatorship.Another announced candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, was named in a recent Senate report on money laundering; the report said his wife helped her husband transfer more than $40 million in questionable funds to the United States. Mr. Abubakar also figured in the corruption trial of former Representative William J. Jefferson of Louisiana as the target of a bribery scheme. Mr. Abubakar denied any wrongdoing.Both will fight Mr. Jonathan for the right to represent the governing party. Neither inspires enthusiasm from civil society activists, including Mr. Soyinka, who played an important role this year in forcing a transition from the terminally ill Mr. Yar’Adua to Mr. Jonathan, the vice president at the time.Mr. Jonathan has been an unobtrusive presence since assuming full control of the presidency early in May — he had been only acting president since February, during the last months of Mr. Yar’Adua’s illness. The former vice president has announced a few major initiatives, like overhauling the nation’s faltering electricity system, and his identity as a fellow southerner appears to have quieted militants in Nigeria’s volatile oil region, for now. But hints of familiar patterns — Mr. Jonathan was sharply criticized in the press here for buying three costly new presidential jets — have dampened the initial enthusiasm, as has indecision over his possible candidacy next year.As for the challenges facing Mr. Jega, the election commission president — a person of “integrity” in Mr. Soyinka’s estimation — the writer sees some grounds for optimism in what he describes as a new spirit among his fellow citizens.“The mental orientation has been changing,” Mr. Soyinka said. “It’s moved from resignation, to activism, to angry activism. There have been signs of a collective sense of rejection. There’s a cumulative impact.”'"
"'10-09-01,'1','Consider this observation, by the discreetly misanthropic Ackerley as he marvels at his new pet’s exuberance: “It seemed to me both touching and strange that she should find the world so wonderful.”The film’s hand-drawn animation by the directors Paul and Sandra Fierlinger (they are married) and Mr. Plummer’s understated conversational voice combine to make “My Dog Tulip,” which opens on Wednesday at Film Forum in the South Village, one of the most sophisticated dog movies ever created.The animation, consisting of 58,320 drawings, involves four graphic concepts: finished-looking color drawings that portray Mr. Ackerley’s day-to-day life; simpler drawings in the elongated style of a New Yorker cartoon that evoke Mr. Ackerley’s fantasies; black-and-white line illustrations of his distant memories; and fanciful yellow-pad scribblings.The movie only fleetingly succumbs to anthropomorphism in line drawings that show a half-human Tulip in a dress, holding court. John Avarese’s agreeable light-jazz score, which occasionally dips into a classical mode, lends the film a jaunty buoyancy.Besides Ackerley, “My Dog Tulip” (whose title character is mercifully never given a human voice) is peopled with eccentrics, each given an astutely chosen actor and a sharply drawn personality by the animators. Lynn Redgrave, who died in May and to whom the movie is dedicated, plays Ackerley’s sister Nancy, who moves in to be Tulip’s daytime caretaker while Ackerley is working and competes with her brother for Tulip’s affection.A veterinarian of astonishing empathy with animals is voiced by Isabella Rossellini. Examining Tulip for worms, she gently explains to Ackerley: “Tulip is a good girl. You are the trouble. She is in love with you.”Brian Murray plays the dual roles of Ackerley’s indolent World War I army buddy, Captain Pugh, whom he visits at his country farm with an unruly Tulip in hand, and Mr. Blandish, a dog owner whose proud German shepherd, Max, is rebuffed by Tulip.With its meticulously detailed observations of Tulip’s excretory rituals and anatomical changes when in heat, “My Dog Tulip” might almost be called a dirty movie. It unblinkingly observes the messes Tulip makes and shows her being mounted while in heat.One of the most embarrassing messes takes place in front of the store of a green grocer whose wife (Redgrave) is so irate that she refuses to thank Ackerley even after he cleans it up. Another is made in an off-limits area of Ackerley’s home after Tulip finally produces a litter and senses that Ackerley intends to kill the pups. Their father ends up not being a male with a pedigree but Dusty, the “disreputable dirty ragamuffin” from next door.In a final printed statement scrolled across the screen, Ackerley contemplates a dog’s frustration at trying to understand the human mind. As his imagination soars, he wonders if thousands of years ago, humans came under the protection of dogs, which tried to tame them and failed.Directed and animated by Paul and Sandra Fierlinger; written by Mr. Fierlinger, based on the book by J. R. Ackerley; music by John Avarese; produced by Norman Twain, Howard Kaminsky and Frank Pellegrino; released by New Yorker Films. At Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Running time: 1 hour 23 minutes. This film is not rated.WITH THE VOICES OF: Christopher Plummer (J. R. Ackerley), Lynn Redgrave (Nancy/grocer’s wife) and Isabella Rossellini (Miss Canvenini).'"

"'10-09-01,'1','“This could be catastrophic for the country,” a senior Afghan banking official said. “The next few days are critical. I am worried.”Kabul Bank and its chairman, Mr. Farnood, lie at the heart of the political and economic nexus that sustains — and is sustained by — the government of President Hamid Karzai. Mr. Frozi was an adviser to Mr. Karzai’s presidential re-election campaign last year, and Kabul Bank provided millions to Mr. Karzai’s campaign.American investigators say that Mr. Farnood’s unorthodox financial dealings, which included lending tens of millions of dollars to himself and other politically connected Afghans, have long been shielded from scrutiny by his close ties to Mr. Karzai.American officials said the intervention by the Central Bank was personally approved by President Karzai himself, after he was briefed about the details of Kabul Bank’s financial condition and its irregularities.Investigators and bank regulators say Kabul Bank is also tied to the inquiry into New Ansari, the money-transfer firm, or hawala, that is suspected of moving billions of dollars out of the country for Afghan politicians, drug traffickers and insurgents. Kabul Bank used the firm, whose dealings are nearly impossible to track, to transfer at least $60 million out of the country, a bank shareholder said.For a bank to use a hawala to move money is inherently suspect, investigators say, because a financial institution like Kabul Bank already has the means to transfer the money electronically. Electronic transfers are easier for regulators to follow.Neither Mr. Farnood nor Mr. Frozi could be reached for comment on Tuesday.Bank regulators emphasized that the Afghan government had not taken over Kabul Bank. The regulators said they were worried that the bank would not be able to cover a run of withdrawals from nervous creditors.Afghan officials and businessmen said other financial institutions here might be affected by similar troubles; the shareholders of other banks also indulge in the practice of lending large sums of money to themselves.In interviews, Afghan officials and businessmen described Kabul Bank as Mr. Farnood’s personal fief, which he used to reward himself, shareholders and political allies who could advance his financial interests.First among the beneficiaries was Mr. Farnood himself, the officials said. He invested about $140 million of the bank’s money in the real estate market in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, said Mahmoud Karzai, the president’s brother and a Kabul Bank shareholder. Among those properties were more than a dozen multimillion-dollar villas in Mr. Farnood’s name, some of them on Palm Jumeria, an island off Dubai’s coast, Mr. Karzai said.The Dubai real estate market collapsed in 2008, wiping out much of Mr. Farnood’s investment and leaving Kabul Bank with the losses. A senior Afghan banking official said that the bank’s estimated losses were believed to be about $300 million, with assets of about $120 million.It is not clear what Mr. Farnood did with all the properties he purchased, but he made at least some of them available to his friends and allies. One of them was Mahmoud Karzai, who owns about 7 percent of the bank. Speaking in an interview from Dubai, Mr. Karzai said he had rented one of Mr. Farnood’s villas for the past year and a half.Mr. Karzai said the bank’s troubles — and Mr. Farnood’s opaque dealings — had made him decide to vacate soon.“I want to move to a different house,” Mr. Karzai said. “I want to cut this out.”Kabul Bank also lent some $100 million to Haseen Fahim, a shareholder. Mr. Fahim is the brother of Muhammad Fahim, Afghanistan’s first vice president and a close political ally of President Karzai. Haseen Fahim is the owner of Gas Group, a large distributor of natural gas, and the developer of several large construction projects.“I am not completely aware of what he has done,” Mr. Karzai said of Mr. Farnood.Mr. Farnood was a banker before Afghanistan had a modern financial system, opening a hawala in the 1970s. A hawala allows a person in Afghanistan, say, to hand someone a bundle of cash and have it instantly credited to an account in another country — say, in the United Arab Emirates.Mr. Farnood closed his hawala and started Kabul Bank in 2004. From the beginning, the Afghan banking official said, Mr. Farnood ran Kabul Bank outside the law, daring regulators to rein him in. Kabul Bank often exceeded the limit of what it was allowed to lend on any particular project, and it sometimes skirted collateral and deposit requirements.“Sherkhan Farnood is a very clever individual,” the Afghan banking official said. “Keeping the bank in line with the law was a constant challenge for us.”New Ansari is known to be intimately connected to another financial institution, Afghan United Bank, officials say.Asked why Mr. Farnood would use a hawala to transfer money abroad, Mahmoud Karzai, a shareholder, said he did not know. “This a very legitimate question,” Mr. Karzai said. “You should ask Sherkhan.”The New Ansari case has drawn close attention, and not only because American investigators say the money trails lead to Afghan political elites, insurgents and suspected criminals. One of the men arrested in connection with the inquiry is a senior aide to President Karzai. The aide, Mohammed Zia Salehi, was released in early August after investigators were pressured by President Karzai himself.Afghan officials say they hope they can avoid a meltdown of Kabul Bank — and of the country’s financial system. Mr. Farnood has promised to transfer the title of all of his properties to the bank, Mr. Karzai said, which would provide the bank with at least some assets to cover the loses. But it is not clear, after the collapse of the Dubai property market, how much Mr. Farnood’s properties are worth.Mr. Farnood and Mr. Frozi together owned more than half of the bank, meaning that the other shareholders had little leverage with them, officials said. It was only recently, as the bank’s losses mounted, that the two men began to disagree.Mr. Karzai and other Afghan officials said the departure of Mr. Farnood and Mr. Frozi would allow the bank to finally be run properly. Without federal depositors’ insurance, the senior Afghan banking official said, that might be the only chance depositors had of getting their money back.“The only government guarantee is the effective supervision of this bank,” he said.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration, under Congressional pressure to take a tough stance on Chinese trade policies, determined on Tuesday that Beijing had unfairly subsidized $514 million in aluminum products last year.But the Commerce Department stopped short of making a stronger ruling on claims by American leaders and manufacturers that an undervalued Chinese currency gave Beijing’s exporters a lopsided price advantage.The preliminary finding means that some Chinese aluminum importers must post cash deposits or bonds at a rate set by American officials.The White House has been trying to strike a delicate balance ahead of the November elections that will be dominated by the weak economy. The Obama administration wants to address worries by lawmakers who say the United States is losing jobs because China’s currency policy keeps its currency undervalued against the dollar and makes Chinese products cheaper in the United States. But it also wants to maintain a good relationship with a country seen as crucial to dealing with global economic and environmental issues and with nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea.On the currency issue, the Commerce Department refused to investigate allegations that China’s currency practices amounted to an unfair subsidy. It said the claims did not meet American requirements needed to start such an inquiry.Aluminum companies in the United States that requested the duties assert that the Chinese industry benefits from its currency policy.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','They were not the only ones who were delayed on a day when matches were backed up like rush hour on the Long Island Expressway. Andrea Petkovic upset No. 17 Nadia Petrova, 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (4), in a match that ended on Armstrong Stadium at 10:59 p.m., almost 12 hours after the first match of the day session began.The match was slated for Court 11, but when David Nalbandian’s 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-4, 6-7 (6), 6-4 victory over Rik De Voest required 3 hours 59 minutes, Petkovic and Petrova were moved to Armstrong, where they played 2 hours 33 minutes.It was nearing midnight when the women’s No. 1 seed, Caroline Wozniacki, took the court to face the N.C.A.A. singles champion Chelsey Gullickson after the Nadal match.Of the mental tests that players faced, including the blast-furnace heat that baked the courts during the day, Novak Djokovic’s seemed the stiffest. For much of the afternoon, he looked as if he would fail it spectacularly. He looked lost in falling behind two sets to one against Victor Troicki, a fellow Serb and Davis Cup teammate. Djokovic was barely running after shots, wearing a look of disgust, and he even threw his racket at his chair after one lackluster game.But just when Djokovic appeared ready to live up to his reputation as being unable to handle the heat, he rallied and the big-serving Troicki faltered. By the end of Djokovic’s 6-3, 3-6, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory, he was rejuvenated and thumping his chest after big points. By then, the Arthur Ashe Stadium court, where the surface had been nearing 100 degrees earlier, was mercifully covered in shade.“Somebody in the stands over there kept saying, ‘Hold on, hang in there,’ ” Djokovic said. “So that’s exactly what I did. I have to give credit to Victor. He played really well, served really well. A couple of points turned the match.”Troicki was close to writing a very different story. He was up a break in the fourth set and two points from being up two breaks when he seemed to lose his focus. Djokovic escaped in that game, and that was where he turned the momentum of the match.Djokovic prevailed in 3 hours 20 minutes and joined another Serb, the fourth-seeded woman Jelena Jankovic, in fighting off a potential upset. Jankovic needed three sets to escape an upset bid by 18-year-old Simona Halep of Romania, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Jankovic was fighting off a summer of injuries and cramped confidence.Marcos Baghdatis was not so lucky. In a grueling five-set defeat against Arnaud Clément, he failed to erase his painful run of losses here. But Mardy Fish used his match to feel even better about having lost 30 pounds and feeling fit at the end of a five-set victory over Jan Hajek.By the time No. 14 Maria Sharapova took the court for the final match of the day session, shadows had cooled the playing surface and she was able to overcome a cold start to beat back a spirited challenge from Jarmila Groth, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1.“She came out firing and didn’t give me any good opportunities,” Sharapova said.Sharapova, the 2006 champion and a popular pick to win this year, will play Iveta Benesova in the second round.Jankovic played on the Ashe Stadium court before Djokovic, and with a similar pained expression on her face for much of her match. She battled the heat, a rash of unforced errors and double faults, and the sinking feeling that she was ill prepared for the final major of the season.Her prospects looked most dire when Halep was serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set. But Jankovic played one of her best games, dictating points and turning Halep into the frustrated one. Halep bounced her racket off the ground after losing the game.“I just said to myself, you know, there are days when you’re not going to be feeling the ball, you’re not going to be moving your feet,” Jankovic said. “In those days, you just really have to fight and really have to try your best and give your maximum and try to get through these kinds of matches.“If you are able to do that, then it gives you a lot more confidence for the next round.”'"
"'10-09-01,'1','For years, long before the recession began, job growth had become increasingly polarized in this country. High-paid occupations that require significant amounts of education and training grew rapidly alongside low-wage, service-type jobs that do not, according to David Autor, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.The growth of these low-wage jobs began in the 1980s, accelerated in the 1990s and began to really take off in the 2000s. Losing out in the shuffle, Dr. Autor said, were jobs that he described as “middle-skill, middle-wage” — entry-level white-collar positions, like office and administrative support work, and certain blue-collar jobs, like assembly line workers and machine operators.The recession appears to have magnified that trend, Dr. Autor wrote in a recent paper, released jointly by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy group, and the Hamilton Project, which has a more centrist reputation. From 2007 to 2009, the paper said, there was relatively little net change in total employment for both high-skill and low-skill occupations, while employment plummeted in so-called middle-skill occupations.A new analysis by the National Employment Law Project, a liberal advocacy group, takes a different approach, identifying industries that have experienced job growth in 2010 and examining their median wages. It is a blunter measurement because it focuses on whole industries, within which there is often great diversity in income. Economists also cautioned that it was still too early to know exactly which sectors would eventually lead the way in a sustained recovery.Nevertheless, the law project analysis offers a snapshot of where the employment growth has been so far. It found that job expansion to this point had been skewed toward industries with median wages that are low to middling, with a disproportionate share of job growth happening in industries whose median wages fell below $15 an hour.“There’s a striking contrast so far between which industries have lost jobs and which ones are growing,” said Annette Bernhardt, policy director for the law project. “If this kind of bottom-heavy job creation continues, it could pose a real challenge to restoring consumer demand and making sure working families have a way to support themselves.”Both studies are disquieting because of the potential import for many who had once scratched out middle-class livings and are now looking for work. A unifying theme is the stubborn march of labor-intensive, low-paying service jobs, like the ones Ms. Ings and Ms. Nelson found.There is typically a downward slide during recessions, said Till von Wachter, a Columbia University economist, in which higher-skilled and higher-educated workers are re-employed first, often landing jobs for which they are overqualified, squeezing out the lesser skilled and lesser educated. Indeed, in the current downturn, the unemployment rate has climbed the most for the least-educated workers, suggesting they have been hit the hardest.However, while researching workers who lost their jobs in California in the 1990s, Dr. Wachter found that people who fell in the middle when it came to their educational background — possessing high school degrees or some college — and to the skills required for their occupation tended to experience larger and longer lasting income losses after job loss than people on both the lower and higher end of the scale.Ms. Ings had worked in a variety of office and administrative roles in the wholesale tuxedo industry. Her wages of just over $16 an hour were enough to build a relatively comfortable life for her and her daughter, Jillian, now 21 and in college.“During her whole growing up, I never got child support,” Ms. Ings said. “I always had to try to find a job that paid well to help support her. That’s my job, being a mother.”When Ms. Ings was laid off in March 2009, she dove into finding another “corporate job.” But she found that nearly everyone seemed to be looking for people with at least a college degree, if not more. She had only a high school diploma.As a teenager, Ms. Ings had worked in a nursing home and enjoyed it. So, after getting her certified nursing assistant license, she applied at the Home Instead office in Lexington, which has been steadily hiring, said Jack Cross, the franchise owner. Nationally, the company has created more than 2,400 jobs this year, and home health aides are one of the country’s fastest growing occupations.Ms. Ings adores her job, but her finances remain taut, even though she is working 50 hours a week. She had been without health insurance for her first few months, but soon the company will begin deducting for it — a further pinch on her already meager paycheck.“I’m going to be coming home with nothing,” she said.In Arkansas, Ms. Nelson has been hampered by her decision several years ago to quit college after a semester. She has worked a variety of jobs, including a three-year stint as a secretary, earning about $12 an hour.Last year, she and her husband, Kenneth, and their son, Riley, now almost 2, moved to Colton, Calif., where they had relatives and believed the job market would be better. They moved back to Arkansas this year, however, after struggling to find steady work.He quickly accepted a factory job at $8 an hour, but she got rejection after rejection trying to find office work.Ms. Nelson eventually gave up and took up waitressing. The couple is living with her mother, trying to save enough for their own place.“I don’t know, with the jobs we have, if we’re ever going to be able to make it on our own,” Ms. Nelson said.'"
"'10-09-01,'1','But he suggested that he sees his role in addressing domestic issues as dominant, saying that it would be difficult to get the economy rolling again but that doing so was “our central mission as a people, and my central responsibility as president.”With his party facing the prospect of losing control of Congress in this fall’s elections and his own poll numbers depressed in large part because of the lackluster economy and still-high unemployment, he said the nation’s perseverance in Iraq must be matched by determination to address problems at home.Over the last decade, “we have spent over a trillion dollars at war, often financed by borrowing from overseas,” he said. “And so at this moment, as we wind down the war in Iraq, we must tackle those challenges at home with as much energy and grit and sense of common purpose as our men and women in uniform who have served abroad.”Mr. Obama acknowledged a war fatigue among Americans who have called into question his focus on the Afghanistan war, now approaching its 10th year. He said that American forces in Afghanistan “will be in place for a limited time” to give Afghans the chance to build their government and armed forces.“But, as was the case in Iraq, we cannot do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves,” the president said. He reiterated that next July he would begin transferring responsibility for security to Afghans, at a pace to be determined by conditions.“But make no mistake: this transition will begin, because open-ended war serves neither our interests nor the Afghan people’s,” he said.This was no iconic end-of-war moment with photos of soldiers kissing nurses in Times Square or victory parades down America’s Main Streets.Instead, in the days leading to the Tuesday night deadline for the withdrawal of American combat troops, it has appeared as if administration officials and the American military were the only ones marking the end of this country’s combat foray into Iraq. Vice President , and Adm. , the chairman of the , are all in Baghdad for the official ceremony on Wednesday.The very sight of Mr. Obama addressing Americans from the Oval Office — from the same desk where Mr. Bush announced the beginning of the conflict — shows the distance traveled since the Iraq war began. On the night of March 20, 2003, when the Army’s Third Infantry Division first rolled over the border from into Iraq, Mr. Obama was a state senator in .Mr. Bush was at the height of his popularity, and the perception at home and in many places abroad was that America could achieve its national security goals primarily through military power. One of the biggest fears among the American troops in the convoy pouring into Iraq that night — every one of them suited in gas masks and wearing biohazard suits — was that the man they came to topple might unleash a chemical weapons attack.Seven years and five months later, the biggest fears of American soldiers revolve around the primitive, basic, homemade bombs and old explosives in Afghanistan that were left over from the Soviet invasion. In Iraq, what was perceived as a threat from a powerful dictator, , has dissolved into the worry that as United States troops pull out they are leaving behind an unstable and weak government that could be influenced by .On Tuesday, a senior intelligence official said that Iran continues to supply militant groups in Iraq with weapons, training and equipment.“Much has changed since that night,” when Mr. Bush announced the war in Iraq, Mr. Obama said. “A war to disarm a state became a fight against an insurgency. Terrorism and sectarian warfare threatened to tear Iraq apart. Thousands of Americans gave their lives; tens of thousands have been wounded. Our relations abroad were strained. Our unity at home was tested.”The withdrawal of combat forces represents a significant milestone after the war that toppled Mr. Hussein, touched off waves of sectarian strife and claimed the lives of more than 4,400 American soldiers and more than 70,000 Iraqis, according to United States and Iraqi government figures.“Operation Iraqi Freedom is over,” Mr. Obama said, using the military name for the mission, “and the Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country.”As Mr. Obama prepared to observe the end of one phase of the war, he called Mr. Bush from , as he was en route to Fort Bliss in to meet with American troops home from Iraq.The two spoke “just for a few moments,” Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters aboard the plane, declining to give any additional details.American troops reached Mr. Obama’s goal for the drawdown early — last week Gen. , the American commander in Iraq, said that the number of troops had dropped to 49,700, roughly the number that would stay through next summer.That is less than a third of the number of troops in Iraq during the surge in 2007. Under an agreement between Iraq and the United States, the remaining troops are to leave by the end of 2011, though some Iraqi and American officials say they think that the agreement may be renegotiated to allow for a longer American military presence.The remaining “advise and assist” brigades will officially concentrate on supporting and training Iraqi security forces, protecting American personnel and facilities, and mounting counterterrorism operations.Still, as Mr. Obama himself acknowledged Tuesday, the milestone came with all of the ambiguity and messiness that accompanied the war itself.A political impasse, in place since March elections, has left Iraq without a permanent government just as the government in Baghdad was supposed to be asserting more control.Republican critics of the president were quick to point out Tuesday that Mr. Obama opposed the troop surge that they for decreased violence in Iraq.“Some leaders who opposed, criticized, and fought tooth-and-nail to stop the surge strategy now proudly claim credit for the results,” Representative of , the House Republican leader, told veterans at the national convention of the American Legion in .'"

"'10-09-02,'1','Aerial search teams found no trace of Arum on Monday on the peak of Storm King Mountain or the ridgelines around it. A helicopter search resumed Wednesday after snow, rain and clouds grounded flights on Tuesday. “It’s impossible for me to speculate about what happened,” Olson said. “We don’t have any clues to tell us. There are a billion scenarios.”Lee Samuels, the elder Arum’s spokesman, said that Arum had not missed a significant news conference in the 25 years they have worked together at Top Rank. “Our whole company is rocked,” he said.Arum’s stepson, Todd duBoef, the president of Top Rank, pitched the fight in a ballroom.“This is what he loves,” duBoef said. “Hanging out with you guys and making preposterous statements.”In recounting Pacquiao’s ascent to the boxing’s pinnacle, duBoef briefly imitated his stepfather’s vocal style. “Bob in his own way would say: ‘I knew from the beginning. I knew it was going to happen,’ ” duBoef said.Arum called during the news conference from Marble Mountain, where he and his wife, Lovee, were with park rangers. “He sounded uplifted,” said Dena duBoef, his stepdaughter and a Top Rank vice president, referring to the renewed aerial search. “Then he asked, ‘How’s the press conference? How many people are there?’ And I let him listen to the roaring crowd.”She and her brother described John Arum as a devoted mountain climber. Olson said he was known as a repeat climber in the park.Pacquiao is seeking a title in an eighth weight division in what will be his second fight at Cowboys Stadium. Since defending his welterweight title against Joshua Clottey last March at Jerry Jones’s football palace, Pacquiao has been elected to the Congress in the Philippines. Margarito is a former three-time welterweight champion.On Tuesday, Arum was choked up before he spoke about the bout at a news conference in the Beverly Hills Hotel ballroom. But then he delivered a spirited defense of Margarito, whose license was revoked in California after plaster inserts were found in his gloves before a fight against Shane Mosley in January 2009. Margarito, he said, “did not know those illegal hand wraps were in there and there’s not one shred of proof he did.”Afterward, Arum left for Seattle and then the mountainous region where his son disappeared.“I saw the look in his eyes,” said Mark Taffet, a senior vice president of HBO. “He left with a heavy heart.”Freddie Roach, Pacquiao’s trainer, said Wednesday: “I lost my brother last year, and it’s affected my mother the most. I feel for Bob. Hopefully, his son will be O.K. He’s going through a tough time.”'"
"'10-09-02,'1','One of the few positives for the Mets this season has been the surprising performance of Hisanori Takahashi, the Japanese left-hander who signed a minor league contract in February and developed into one of the team’s most versatile players.Though he is technically a rookie, the 35-year-old Takahashi is one of the only Mets who can become a free agent on Oct. 31, and there is a distinct chance he may end up elsewhere in 2011.Takahashi has enjoyed his time with the Mets, but probably sees himself as a starting pitcher and may opt to sign with a club that can assure him he would have that role. Like any player, he would also prefer the longest deal possible.“He has obviously established himself in the major leagues,” said Peter Greenberg, Takahashi’s agent. “He liked it in New York and would love the chance to take the next step here.“But we’ll have to wait until the season ends to sit down with him to see what he’s thinking for next year as far as if he has a preference to any particular role,” Greenberg said of Takahashi, who has been a starter, set-up reliever and closer for the Mets.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','Boy George had offered to donate the proceeds of one of his concerts to the city instead of playing janitor for a day. That request also was denied.“A defendant’s name, occupation or level of notoriety won’t make an assignment better, or make it worse,” said Erin M. Duggan, the chief spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney’s office.In Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island, community service is usually assigned by the district attorney. In the Bronx, it is assigned by Bronx Community Solutions, which is overseen by the Center for Court Innovation, a nonprofit group.In some of the city’s specialized treatment courts, community service is often determined by concerns from residents, said Greg Berman, the director of the Center for Court Innovation.After complaints about crack vials and graffiti in De Witt Clinton Park in Manhattan, and illegal dumping at a vacant lot in Red Hook, Brooklyn, the center sent defendants there, Mr. Berman said.“We think of community service as an opportunity for someone to pay back their debt to society for the harm they committed,” Mr. Berman said. “It’s not supposed to be an exercise in public shaming, and it’s not supposed to be an exercise in P.R.”Naturally, image makers may try to spin a celebrity’s community service into a story of giving back, not of punishment for a crime. Eric Dezenhall, who does public relations crisis management for corporations and celebrities, said such attempts were futile. “It doesn’t change the fact that your obit will still say, ‘convicted of x, y, z crime,’ ” Mr. Dezenhall said.Even if a celebrity is doing noble work, it will not overshadow the criminal matter, said Benjamin Brafman, a defense lawyer for many high-profile clients. “Everyone in the process knows this is part of a sentence,” Mr. Brafman said, “so the humiliation factor is there even if the community service is a step up from picking up trash.”Some would rather skip community service altogether, Mr. Brafman said. “I’ve had clients who would rather spend three months in jail than spend 600 hours doing community service,” he said. “In jail, they lounge around and watch television. Community service, they’re working every day.”Indeed, of the 23,000 defendants who were sentenced to community service in Manhattan last year, 8,400 — 36.5 percent — did not complete it.In Manhattan, the district attorney’s office usually assigns defendants to do manual labor with the city parks, sanitation, transportation, correction or juvenile justice departments, or NYC Community Cleanup, which assigns low-level offenders to address neighborhood problems.But defendants who are physically unable to perform manual labor will be assigned to office work like collating envelopes.Prosecutors consider the defendant’s schedule and the needs of the various agencies when determining where to assign someone, Ms. Duggan said. Defendants with prior convictions automatically do their service with the Correction Department.Judges sometimes choose where a defendant will work. And sometimes, external circumstances dictate the assignment. Many years ago, the Sanitation Department said it needed extra people to clean the Van Wyck Expressway for a presidential visit. Prosecutors sent more defendants its way.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','The economic projections that were the basis for Mr. Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package of spending and tax cuts were based on data from late 2008, before Mr. Obama took office. Ms. Romer, in her speech at the National Press Club, said that she, like most analysts, had underestimated American businesses’ reaction to the near collapse of the financial system in 2008 and the global nature of the recession.“What was not clear at the time was how quickly and strongly the financial crisis would affect the economy,” she said. Because such financial shocks are rare, she added, “to this day economists don’t fully understand why firms cut production as much as they did, and why they cut labor so much more than they normally would.”Ms. Romer, a scholar of the Depression who is returning to the University of California, Berkeley, to resume teaching, said economists would be studying those questions for years.“In any event,” she added, “almost all analysts were surprised by the violent reaction.”The analysts, and the new Obama economic team, also were surprised that the reaction turned out to be global, Ms. Romer said. She recalled that until reports in 2009 showed slowdowns in Asian and European countries, she and Mr. Obama’s other advisers had anticipated that those trading partners would help bolster the American economy.Even so, by then the advisers had greatly increased the size of the proposed stimulus package by hundreds of billions of dollars; Congress passed it within a month of Mr. Obama’s inauguration.Against Republicans’ continued claims in this campaign season that the stimulus package was a waste — a claim many nonpartisan analyses dispute — Ms. Romer offered an emphatic affirmation.“I am proud of the recovery actions we have taken,” she said. “I believe they have made the difference between a second Great Depression and a slow but genuine recovery. And the passage of health care reform and financial regulatory reform are accomplishments that will be with us long after the recession is over.”Congress is divided over further action. “Concern about the deficit cannot be an excuse for leaving unemployed workers to suffer,” Ms. Romer said. “We have tools that would bring unemployment down without worsening our long-run fiscal outlook, if we can only find the will and the wisdom to use them.”Her speech came on a rare day of good economic news, which spurred trading on Wall Street. Reports from China and Australia and one concerning American manufacturing were better than expected.And while one report showed a slight decline in private-sector jobs in August, another showed that layoffs plunged to the lowest level in a decade.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','Protests against rising food prices turned deadly in the capital, Maputo, on Wednesday when the police opened fire on demonstrators. The police and hospital officials said the toll was at least 6, but President Armando Guebuza, speaking on state television and radio, said that 4 had died and 167 had been arrested. Sporadic violence continued into the night; earlier, youths had rampaged through Maputo, throwing stones and looting shops in the worst violence in the country since 2008.Mr. Guebuza said that his government would try to meet demands to bring down prices, but that Mozambique produced only 30 percent of the wheat it needed and imported the rest. Mozambicans have seen the price of a loaf of bread rise by 25 percent in the past year. Fuel and water costs have also risen.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','The agency will ask a committee of experts on Sept. 15 whether further steps are needed.Dr. David J. Graham, a drug-safety official at the F.D.A., said the agency’s decision to allow continued marketing of Meridia was mistaken and resulted because officials who approved the drug remain in charge of assessing its safety.“This once again emphasizes the need for a separate center to oversee the safety of presently marketed drugs,” Dr. Graham said.Karen Riley, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency had been aware of most of the trial’s findings since last year and issued a public warning on Nov. 20.In the study, called the Scout trial, 10,744 overweight or obese patients with a mean age of 63 and histories of cardiovascular problems were all given Meridia for six weeks. Patients who showed immediate problems on the drug were dropped from the study, and the 9,804 remaining were given either Meridia or a placebo for the remainder of the study. Patients on Meridia lost about nine pounds in the first year; those who received placebos lost about four pounds. The Meridia patients suffered 28 percent more heart attacks and 36 percent more strokes, although there was no difference in heart-related deaths.Scott Davies, an Abbott spokesman, described Meridia “as an important option to treat a serious condition for which there are few treatments available.”Dr. W. Philip T. James, a professor of nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the lead author of the study, said that Meridia was beneficial for many obese people without heart problems. Dr. James dismissed the editorial that attacked his study’s conclusions. He was paid by Abbott to conduct the study, and his co-authors disclosed a dizzying array of research and marketing relationships with drug companies.“I think the editors are cavalier in their approach in basing their decision on statistics and not looking at it in clinical terms,” Dr. James said in an interview.Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University, said in an interview that the Meridia dispute revolved around an argument between those who viewed drugs from a population basis and those who viewed them from an individual patient basis.A small number of patients lose considerable weight while taking Meridia and therefore benefit enormously from the drug, Dr. Leibel said. But a far larger number of people get no benefit from the drug, and some of these patients may suffer heart attacks and strokes as a result of taking it.“The question is do you withdraw the drug to protect the large number of individuals who have no benefit and could have a bad response and thereby eliminate the opportunity for that small number of people who respond well?” Dr. Leibel asked.It is a dilemma often faced by the F.D.A. in part because the agency has no power over how doctors use medicines. Even when agency officials warn against the use of drugs in certain patients, some doctors prescribe them dangerously anyway and patients die.In some cases, the agency has forced drugs off the market after some doctors have proven unable to prescribe them safely. In other cases, the F.D.A. has only strengthened warnings — particularly when the injuries associated with the drug’s use are common problems like heart attacks and strokes that in individual patients are difficult to blame the medicine for.Meridia’s safety woes and modest efficacy are part of a long history of disappointing efforts by the drug industry to cure the obesity epidemic and cash in on the estimated $59 billion that Americans spend annually fighting fat. Xenical, another diet drug made by Roche, can cause flatulence and oily discharges. A federal advisory panel voted in July against endorsing Qnexa, an experimental fat pill developed by Vivus. And highly promoted scientific efforts to control appetite through leptin, a hormone involved in appetite and metabolism, and through suppression of appetite receptors activated by marijuana have so far failed.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','A former hedge fund manager and a pharmaceutical executive have agreed to settle federal insider trading charges related to the 2007 takeover of the biotechnology company MedImmune, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday.Stephen R. Goldfield, 46, who ran the hedge fund firm Imperium Capital Management in Tampa, Fla., was charged with making $13.98 million in illegal profits by trading in MedImmune securities before AstraZeneca agreed to acquire the company for more than $15 billion.The S.E.C. also accused James W. Self Jr., 45, Mr. Goldfield’s friend and former classmate at the Wharton business school, of tipping him off about the MedImmune sale process with information he learned as an executive director of business development of a New Jersey pharmaceutical company.Merck’s Web site lists a James W. Self as an employee in business development at its vaccine division. Merck did not return a call for comment.Federal regulators have brought several insider trading cases in recent months after facing criticism for having missed fraud in previous years.According to the S.E.C., Mr. Goldfield’s settlement called for him to pay $16.65 million, reflecting the profit he made plus interest. But he will pay only $600,000 because he lost all the illegal profit by aggressively trading index put options. Mr. Goldfield did not admit wrongdoing.“Mr. Goldfield is happy with the settlement and is looking forward to putting the matter behind him,” Robert Heim, his lawyer, said.'"

It shows again that bridge is a bidder’s game, and that nothing beats counting high-card points.South’s two-club overcall was not without risk, but it worked well; West passed, showing a minimum opening with fewer than three hearts (no support double); North also passed because South was a passed hand; and East (the “am”) cautiously but understandably passed.If East had made an aggressive takeout double, West would have bid two spades, and North would have competed with three clubs. Then, if East-West bid to three spades, North should double. The defenders should take one spade, two diamonds and two clubs for down one. Plus 200 is a magic number in pair events, and was worth 21 match points out of 23. Plus 100 gained only 9 match points.However, East-West, who do not have a nine-card fit, should not compete to the three-level, being happy to have pushed North-South that high.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','Kyle now takes one drug, Vyvanse, for his attention deficit. His mother shared his medical records to help document a public glimpse into a trend that some psychiatric experts say they are finding increasingly worrisome: ready prescription-writing by doctors of more potent drugs to treat extremely young children, even infants, whose conditions rarely require such measures.More than 500,000 children and adolescents in America are now taking antipsychotic drugs, according to a September 2009 report by the Food and Drug Administration. Their use is growing not only among older teenagers, when is believed to emerge, but also among tens of thousands of preschoolers.A Columbia University study recently found a doubling of the rate of prescribing antipsychotic drugs for privately insured 2- to 5-year-olds from 2000 to 2007. Only 40 percent of them had received a proper mental health assessment, violating practice standards from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.“There are too many children getting on too many of these drugs too soon,” Dr. Mark Olfson, professor of clinical and lead researcher in the government-financed study, said.Such radical treatments are indeed needed, some doctors and experts say, to help young children with severe problems stay safe and in school or day care. In 2006, the F.D.A. did approve treating children as young as 5 with Risperdal if they had autistic disorder and aggressive behavior, self-injury tendencies, tantrums or severe mood swings. Two other drugs, Seroquel from and Abilify from , are permitted for youths 10 or older with bipolar disorder.But many doctors say prescribing them for younger and younger children may pose grave risks to development of both their fast-growing brains and their bodies. Doctors can legally prescribe them for off-label use, including in preschoolers, even though research has not shown them to be safe or effective for children. Boys are far more likely to be medicated than girls.Dr. Ben Vitiello, chief of child and adolescent treatment and preventive research at the National Institute of Mental Health, says conditions in young children are extremely difficult to diagnose properly because of their emotional variability. “This is a recent phenomenon, in large part driven by the misperception that these agents are safe and well tolerated,” he said.Even the most reluctant prescribers encounter a marketing juggernaut that has made antipsychotics the nation’s top-selling class of drugs by revenue, $14.6 billion last year, with prominent promotions aimed at treating children. In the waiting room of Kyle’s original child psychiatrist, children played with Legos stamped with the word Risperdal, made by . It has since lost its patent on the drug and stopped handing out the toys.Greg Panico, a company spokesman, said the Legos were not intended for children to play with — only as a promotional item.Dr. Lawrence L. Greenhill, president of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, concerned about the lack of research, has recommended a national registry to track preschoolers on antipsychotic drugs for the next 10 years. “Psychotherapy is the key to the treatment of children with severe mental disorders, and antipsychotics are adjunctive therapy — not the other way around,” he said.But it is cheaper to medicate children than to pay for family counseling, a fact highlighted by a Rutgers University study last year that found children from low-income families, like Kyle, were four times as likely as the privately insured to receive antipsychotic medicines.data obtained by showed a record $96 million was spent last year on antipsychotic drugs for teenagers and children — including three unidentified infants who were given the drugs before their first birthdays.In addition, children seem to be medicated more often, prompting a Senate panel in June to ask the to investigate such practices.In the last few years, doctors’ concerns have led some states, like and , to put in place restrictions on doctors who want to prescribe antipsychotics for young children, requiring a second opinion or prior approval, especially for those on Medicaid. Some states now report that are declining as a result.A study released in July by 16 state Medicaid medical directors, which once had the working title “Too Many, Too Much, Too Young,” recommended that more states require second opinions, outside consultation or other methods to assure proper prescriptions. The F.D.A. has also strengthened warnings about using some of these drugs in treating children.Kyle was rescued from his medicated state through a therapy program called Early Childhood Supports and Services, established in through a confluence of like-minded child at Tulane, Louisiana State University and the state. It surrounds troubled children and their parents with social and mental health support services.Dr. Mary Margaret Gleason, a professor of and child psychiatry at Tulane who treated Kyle from ages 3 to 5 as he was weaned off the heavy medications, said there was no valid medical reason to give antipsychotic drugs to the boy, or virtually any other 2-year-old. “It’s disturbing,” she said.Dr. Gleason says Kyle’s current status proves he probably never had bipolar disorder, autism or . His doctors now say Kyle’s tantrums arose from family turmoil and language delays, not any of the diagnoses used to justify antipsychotics.“I will never, ever let my children be put on these drugs again,” said Ms. Warren, 28, back tears. “I didn’t realize what I was doing.”Dr. Edgardo R. Concepcion, the first child psychiatrist to treat Kyle, said he believed the drugs could help bipolar disorder in little children. “It’s not easy to do this and prescribe this heavy medication,” he said in an interview. “But when they come to me, I have no choice. I have to help this family, this mother. I have no choice.”Ms. Warren conceded that she resorted to medicating Kyle because she was unprepared for parenthood at age 22, living in difficult circumstances, sometimes distracted. “It was complicated,” she said. “Very tense.”Kyle was a healthy baby physically, but he was afraid of some things. He spent hours lining up toys. When upset, he screamed, threw objects, even hit his head on the wall or floor — not uncommon for toddlers, but frightening.“I’d bring him to the doctor and the doctor would say, ‘You just need to discipline him,’ ” Ms. Warren said. “How can you discipline a 6-month-old?”When Kyle’s behavior worsened after his brother was born, Ms. Warren turned to a pediatrician, Dr. Martin J. deGravelle.“Within five minutes of sitting with him, he looked at me and said, ‘He has autism, there’s no doubt about it,’ ” Ms. Warren said.Dr. deGravelle’s clinic notes say Kyle was hyperactive, prone to tantrums, spoke only three words and “does not interact well with strangers.”He prescribed Risperdal. At the time, Risperdal was approved by the F.D.A. only for adults with schizophrenia or acute manic episodes. The following year it was approved for certain children, 5 and older, with autism and extremely aggressive behavior. It has never been approved by the F.D.A. for use in children younger than 5, although doctors may legally prescribe for any use they see fit.“Kyle at the time was very aggressive and easily agitated, so you try to find medication that can make him more easily controlled, because you can’t reason with an 18-month-old,” Dr. deGravelle said in a telephone interview. But Kyle was not autistic — according to several later evaluations, including one that Dr. deGravelle arranged with a neurologist. Kyle did not have the autistic child’s core deficit of social interaction, Dr. Gleason said. Instead, he craved more positive attention from his mother.“He had trouble communicating,” Dr. Gleason said. “He didn’t have people to listen to him.”After the neurologist review, the diagnosis changed to “oppositional defiant disorder” and the Risperdal continued.“Yes, I did ask for it,” Ms. Warren said. “But I was at my wit’s end, and I didn’t know what else to do.”Dr. deGravelle referred her to Dr. Concepcion, who in turn diagnosed Kyle’s condition as bipolar disorder.“Some children, when they come to me, the parents are really so frustrated,” Dr. Concepcion said in a phone interview. “Especially the mothers are so scared or desperate in getting help. Their children are really acting psychotic.”Dr. Concepcion also spoke with Dr. Charles H. Zeanah, a Tulane medical professor, who disagreed with both the diagnosis and the treatment. “I have never seen a preschool child with bipolar disorder in 30 years as a child psychiatrist specializing in early childhood mental health,” Dr. Zeanah said.“It’s a controversial diagnosis, I agree with that,” said Dr. Concepcion. “But if you will commit yourself in giving these children these medicines, you have to have a diagnosis that supports your treatment plan. You can’t just give a nondiagnosis and give them the atypical antipsychotic.”He also prescribed four more pills.Kyle’s third birthday photo shows a pink-cheeked boy who had ballooned to 49 pounds. and are childhood risks of antipsychotics. Kyle smiles at the camera. He is sedated.“His shell was there, but he wasn’t there,” Ms. Warren said. “And I didn’t like that.”Dr. Concepcion referred Kyle to the early childhood support program, which has helped about 3,000 preschoolers from low-income families at risk for mental health problems since 2002.His speech improved. He threw fewer tantrums. “They started working with us as a family,” said Ms. Warren, who also received parenting advice. “That helps.”Kyle’s treatment was directed by Dr. Gleason, a Columbia medical graduate who had led a team that wrote 2007 practice guidelines for psychopharmacological treatment of very young children.“Families sometimes feel the need for a quick fix,” Dr. Gleason said. “That’s often the prescription pad. But I’m concerned that when a child sees someone who prescribes but doesn’t do therapy, they’re closing the door that can make longer-lasting change.”Off most drugs, Kyle started losing weight and his behavior improved. Ms. Warren’s life also improved. She met a man and they moved into their own house five miles out of Opelousas, a town of 25,000. They were married last Saturday.At their home recently, Kyle and his brother, Jade, ran and played while their baby sister watched from a playpen. Their clothes were neatly folded in a shared bedroom. They often responded “Yes, ma’am” or “Yes, sir.”“They’re respectful, but they’re hyper kids,” Ms. Warren said. “Once he came off the medication, he’s Kyle. He’s an intelligent person. He’s loud. He’s funny. He’s smart. He’s bouncy. I mean, there’s never a dull moment. He has a few little behavior issues. But he’s like any other normal 6-year-old.”Kyle paused to show a reading report card from the end of his kindergarten year, with an A grade.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','A new blog, smallbustbigheart.com, has become a venue for these women, according to its author, to “gush about the lingerie and clothes that scream, ‘Can you handle me?’ not ‘Am I enough?’ ”That is not to say handwringing over a Lilliputian bust no longer exists. Some women still find a soulmate in , whose 1972 essay in Esquire, “A Few Words About Breasts,” perfectly articulated the lament of women who realized they were never going to fill out. Bust magazine, with its feminist streak, has a support group for those laid low by their tiny breasts, and its recent entries are poignant. One woman wrote: “I hate getting outbreasted by teenagers.”Still, the persistent strain of A-cup pride running through our culture is unmistakable. Facebook groups like Flat Chested and Proud of It! and Flat Chested Girls United exist, and their members trade bon mots as profound as “im flat as a tack :)” — which garner male support like “you are blessed.” For all their entourage to see, more than 2,300 people joined another Facebook group to declare “flat chested girls are prettier!!”In recent years, as people’s weight has ballooned, breasts (mostly made up of fat) have only gotten larger, and commensurately bra cup sizes, too. K-cups now exist. Brandishing a tiny bosom may be a reaction to that trend.Unlike many women who struggled as teenagers to make peace with their minimal assets, Sabrina Lightbourn, 37, a photographer in , the , never second-guessed her A-cups, even in a land of bikinis. “In my mind, they are fabulous,” she said. Sometimes, she favors down-to-the-sternum cuts that make it “really obvious that you don’t have much.”Small-breasted women have also begun to express their anger on the Internet when they suspect one of their brethren has decided to artificially augment what nature has given her. This year, pictures of a bikini-clad — along with a symbol of modest-breasted seductiveness to the A-cup population — surfaced showing what looked like modest implants. Afterward, Jen Udan, who works in Internet marketing in , Tex., felt as if she had been slapped in the face. “I don’t need to look up to you, Kate Hudson,” Ms. Udan, 25, wrote in a blog post entitled “Diary of a Mad, Small-Breasted Woman.”With its motto “Small is Beautiful,” Lula Lu is just one of several retailers and bra makers serving the band of women who make no excuses for their inconspicuous bosoms. Some brands, like the Itty Bitty Bra sold online and in Fred Segal Silk in , Calif., require women to have a sense of humor about being “bust-challenged,” as the Web site jokes. “Some people are taken aback by it, especially the name,” said Jane A. Hodgdon, the designer and owner of the brand, which is sized 32 AA to 38B and retails for $45 to $60. Mrs. Hodgdon, 42 and an AA cup, was tired of bras that “were so heavily padded it just wasn’t me. It looked ridiculous. I’m proud of what I have. I wanted coverage and lift.”Lailides.com, pronounced LAY-leed, offers come-hither wireless lingerie for $46 to $72 and a healthy dollop of self-love. “Having small breasts and wearing A-cup bras (or AA cup or B cup) is a cause to rejoice,” the site declares. “Women who wear A-cup bras do not experience pain from running or dancing, they can sleep on their stomachs, and best of all, sagging is minimal compared to larger women.” (Their $68 Firebird bra, semi-sheer and scalloped, may make women reconsider underwire altogether.)This kind of cheerleading is not about girl power. This message of empowerment is resolutely intended for adults who wish their lingerie to reflect their age and station. No woman in her 40s wants to disrobe to reveal a polka-dotted training bra, and unfortunately for too long, grown women have had ill-fitting options or unsexy mood killers in the bra department.“We are supplying sexy, chic lingerie for grown-up women, not teenagers, who are proud of what they have and not worried about trying to look bigger,” said Fiona Goad, 44, the managing director at LittleWomen.com, an English site with a vast selection whose sales of AAA-cup bras have overtaken AA-cups recently.Women with flat to small chests disagree about what they want from a bra. One camp consists of traditionalists who take little issue with push-up bras; their complaint is never being able to find one with a small enough band and with cups close enough together to create yelp-worthy cleavage. The Little Bra company, which has 28 to 36 in the A to B range, delivers this kind of instant gratification.Emily Lau, the chief executive and the designer, said most padded bras look and feel as subtle as “two pillows over a flat board.” Often a push-up bra stands away from the body in an unflatteringly way that makes even the most assured woman wish she had more to “fill” the cup. By contrast, Ms. Lau created her line with contoured-to-the-body padding so that minuscule breasts can be enhanced with no gaps at the bustline.At the other extreme are the au-naturels who would just as soon go braless if it wasn’t for this little thing called the office and the awkwardness of erect nipples in cold conference rooms. Exquisitely designed soft bras with no underwire appeal to this camp for gorgeous details and “nipple discretion,” as it’s called in the industry, said Susannah Hornsby, an expert bra-fitter at Journelle, a boutique in New York.In fact, soft bras have come such a long way from their training-bra lineage that Claire Chambers, the chief executive of Journelle, says her saleswomen, most of whom are 32D, regret that they cannot fit into all the crush-worthy fashion pieces from brands like The Lake & Stars. Really.The middle camp also wants a certain degree of authenticity and their real silhouette to shine under a T-shirt. In their minds, no bra should so transform your breasts that they are unrecognizable. This is tricky, said Ms. Hornsby, who also manages Web operations for Journelle.com, since such a bra has to have a “shallow and stretchy” cup, the between-the-cups spacer as tiny as possible, and a small band. One that fits the bill is Timpa’s $33 Duet Lace Underwire Demi bra, she said.For too long, bra shopping has demoralized women with just a bit on top. Some department-store saleswomen tell adults to head to the children’s department for training bras. Others are just dismissive. As a size 28A, Heidi Brockmyre, an acupuncturist in , says she has been turned away from bra-fitting boutiques. “They were like, ‘No, we can’t help you,’ ” she said. “I felt like I’m a freak of nature.”She has since bought five Little Bra Company bras, and now dabbles in the joys of cleavage — on occasion. “I’m O.K. with not having cleavage,” said Ms. Brockmyre, 33. These bras just make it “more fun to wear tank tops.”'"

"'10-09-02,'1','While you type your loyalty numbers into Cardstar, Key Ring uses your cellphone’s camera to scan the card’s bar code. This is a hit-or-miss proposition, though. Depending on which type of phone you have and how dog-eared your loyalty card is, you can waste huge amounts of time trying to enter your information this way.Fortunately you can simply type in the card number, the way a clerk might when the store’s scanner fails. You choose retailers from a list, or, if a local store isn’t on the app’s list, you can type in the name and enter your loyalty membership number, and the apps will create a new entry for you.Ideally, you could then go to the store, open the app during the checkout process, call up the store’s loyalty card and hand your phone to the clerk. The phone’s screen would show a digitized representation of your card, complete with bar code and numbers, which the clerk would then scan. The benefits of loyalty club membership would rain down on you.In the real world, you will hand your phone to the clerk with the following instructions: “Your scanner probably won’t pick up the bar code, so you may have to type in the numbers.”All BlackBerrys, many Android phones and the iPhone 4 have screens that, for various reasons, do not play well with the current slate of retail scanners. That disclaimer may prevent the clerk and everyone behind you in line from hurling your phone into the lobster tank.This extra step is also apparently torture for many reviewers in iTunes and the Android Market, who savage the apps for their failure to scan flawlessly.The clerk at my local store, however, didn’t seem to mind at all when she had to type in the numbers.The app developers suggest that phones and scanners may improve enough in the future to spare users from such verbal interaction with clerks. Until then, consider it the price of doing business.On the flip side, the benefits of using these apps are quickly growing. Starting this week, Key Ring will alert you whenever coupons are available from your list of retailers. More to the point, when you open the app and choose specific coupons, those discounts will automatically be applied at the checkout counter. Key Ring will initially cover 27 grocery stores, including Kroger, Tom Thumb and others, which will typically offer 12 to 40 coupons a week.Cardstar is scheduled to begin a nearly identical service this week. Cardstar will work with retailers and grocery chains, including A&P and Pathmark.Even better things are in store for iPad owners. This week, Cardstar plans to introduce a new iPad app that will essentially build a Sunday circular based on the retailers that you assign it to follow. Flip through the in-app circular, drag the coupons onto the icon for your loyalty card, and the discount is yours the next time you shop.Key Ring’s iPad users will soon enjoy a similar upgrade. Of course, the smartphone apps will do the same thing, but it’s much less of a chore on the iPad.Both apps will already tell you about deals available to loyalty card holders, but for me, those deal alerts were no big deal. My two local grocery chains prominently mark items discounted for loyalty club members. But some focused shoppers may not venture down, say, the pet food aisle, unless they know they can stock up on a bargain. Those are the old-school professional shoppers, and I bow to their budget-balancing abilities.Using the other features on these apps, though, I can at least get a bargain or two without pawing through the Sunday paper’s circulars.If Angry Birds ($1, Apple devices) isn’t on your radar yet, it should be. This addictive game earns overwhelmingly high marks from iTunes users, and its appeal crosses age lines. ... IPads bring new promise to digital storytelling, but app developers have largely ignored adults. “Pedlar Lady” ($5) puts a beautifully high-tech spin on an ancient tale, and the app changes every time you open it. ... Ever try to find your phone when the ringer is off? Android owners can download “Where’s My Droid” (free). Send a text message to your phone and it will turn the ringer on, and up.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','An unexpected announcement from Mr. Jobs was the introduction of Ping. With it, users will be able to follow friends and see what music they have bought or enjoyed, what concerts they plan to attend and what music they have reviewed. They will also be able to follow bands and get updates on their new releases, concert tours and other events.Many other online music services like Pandora and Zune Social from Microsoft already have features that allow friends to share information about music.While other social networks have struggled in the shadow of Facebook, some analysts said that Apple had a chance to turn Ping into a success. The service will be instantly available to 160 million iTunes users, as long as they download the latest version of the software, which Apple released on Wednesday.“Apple wants to create even tighter links with iTunes users and keep them a click away from buying a song,” said Mike McGuire, a vice president with Gartner. “Ping will give people more reasons to spend frequently and rapidly.”While Ping may put Apple in competition with Facebook, its impact on the struggling MySpace may be more pronounced, analysts said. MySpace has emphasized music over the last few years.“This isn’t about reconnecting with your girlfriend from eighth grade,” said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. “This is about talking to people about music.”Mr. Jobs said Ping would have simple privacy controls. Anyone will be able to follow bands and receive their updates, and users will be able to say whether they want to be followed by anyone or only by people they approve.The new iPod Touch is thinner than the previous model and comes equipped with front- and rear-facing cameras, as well as Apple’s FaceTime video chatting software. It also has the same high-resolution retina display that Apple first showcased on the iPhone 4 earlier this year.The Touch comes in three versions; the cheapest has 8 gigabytes of storage and costs $229.Apple shrank the iPod Nano by replacing its wheel interface with a touch screen. It costs $149 for an 8-gigabyte version and $179 for 16 gigabytes.In introducing the new version of Apple TV, Mr. Jobs acknowledged that the set-top box had not been as successful as he had hoped. The new version replaces the download-to-own model with a rental service that has shows from Fox and ABC for 99 cents. Mr. Jobs said the other networks had yet to agree to Apple’s pricing.“We think the rest of the studios will see the light and get on board with us,” he said.But that is far from guaranteed. All television studios are wary of distributing their shows in new ways on the Internet for fear of harming their existing businesses, which rely on cable and satellite subscriptions.Fox and ABC agreed to Apple’s pricing model only after lengthy negotiations and heated internal discussions, especially at Fox’s parent, the News Corporation.ABC’s participation is not surprising, given that Mr. Jobs is the largest shareholder and a board member of its parent, the Walt Disney Company.For its part, Fox suggested that its agreement with Apple was something of an experiment. In a statement, Jim Gianopulos, the chairman and chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said the studio was excited to work with Apple over the next several months to “explore this innovative offering.”Other networks, like CBS and NBC, are pointedly not participating in the rentals program. “Episodic television is not a pay-per-view business,” said Keith J. Cocozza, a spokesman for Time Warner, which owns HBO, TNT and other channels. Companies like Time Warner are instead supporting the existing subscription TV model, which is being gradually extended to the Web.Analysts said that the new Apple TV was likely to be more of a hit than its $299 predecessor, in part because of its low price, but also because of software that allows users to stream content from their iPhones and iPads to their TVs through the set-top box. But they said Apple’s challenges in securing more content underscored the continuing difficulties that technology companies faced in cracking the TV market.“Apple has not yet made a significant play for control of the TV,” James L. McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester, wrote on his blog.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','Mr. Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, was initially investigated Aug. 20 on charges of rape and molestation after separate complaints from two women who had had separate sexual relationships with him. The rape inquiry was dropped within 24 hours, but the women who brought the complaints appealed for the investigation to be reinstated.According to accounts the women gave to the police and friends, Swedish officials said, they had consensual sexual encounters with Mr. Assange that became nonconsensual. One woman said that Mr. Assange had ignored her appeals to stop after a condom broke. The other woman said that she and Mr. Assange had begun a sexual encounter using a condom, but that Mr. Assange did not comply with her appeals for him to stop when it was no longer in use.Prosecutors have continued to investigate the lesser charge of molestation, which covers a wide range of offenses and carries penalties of up to a year in prison, and they said Wednesday that they were expanding that inquiry to consider charges of sexual coercion and sexual molestation.Mr. Assange has said the charges are politically motivated.WikiLeaks came under fire in July after posting tens of thousands of classified American documents related to the war in Afghanistan. The site has said it plans to post thousands of “more explosive” documents soon. The Swedish authorities have dismissed suggestions from Mr. Assange that the allegations were part of a program of “dirty tricks” against the site.One of the women, identified only as “Ms. A,” gave an interview to the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet on Aug. 22 in which she said: “The charges against Assange are, of course, not orchestrated by the Pentagon. The responsibility for what happened to me and the other girl lies with a man who has a twisted attitude to women and a problem with taking ‘no’ for an answer.”The United States Justice Department has said it is considering criminal charges against WikiLeaks and Mr. Assange for disclosing the war records.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','Two top lawyers for the Fed — Scott G. Alvarez, who represents the central bank’s board of governors, and Thomas C. Baxter Jr., general counsel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — disagreed.“The Federal Reserve did not ‘allow’ Lehman Brothers to die,” Mr. Baxter told the panel. The Fed, the Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which nominally oversaw the investment banks, “tried hard to save it,” he said.“We did not succeed, but the effort made was serious and determined,” Mr. Baxter said. “We came very close.”Several commission members, including the chairman, Phil Angelides, did not appear convinced. He said there seemed to have been a “conscious policy decision” to let Lehman fail.But in a back-and-forth that revealed the divisions in the 10-member commission, another commission member, Keith Hennessey, who was an economic adviser to President George W. Bush, said it was not clear what other options policy makers at the time had.The Lehman bankruptcy stands out as a rare instance when the government did not step in. Just six months earlier, the Fed lent $29 billion to facilitate the sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase. The day after the bankruptcy, the Fed provided $85 billion to bail out the American International Group.Then it let Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley become classified as bank holding companies, which helped to stabilize their positions. And finally, Congress passed the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to rescue the financial services industry.Mr. Baxter said the New York Fed did not have legal authority to provide a “‘naked’ guarantee, one that would be unsecured and not limited in amount, and would put the U.S. taxpayers at risk for the entirety of Lehman’s trading obligations.”In contrast to Lehman, Mr. Baxter said, Bear Stearns had a buyer, JPMorgan Chase, to assure that its deals would go through. A.I.G. had “sufficient collateral,” in its sound retail businesses, to back up the Fed’s lending commitments.Mr. Fuld said other investment banks were allowed to benefit from a Fed lending program.“Only Lehman was denied that access,” he said. “I submit that had Lehman been granted that same access as its competitors, even as late as that Sunday evening, Lehman would have had time for at least an orderly wind-down or for an acquisition, which would have alleviated the crisis that ensued.”Harvey R. Miller, Lehman’s bankruptcy lawyer, seemed to lend support to Mr. Fuld, saying that Lehman’s assets were sold at fire-sale prices unnecessarily.“When somebody comes to the emergency room and is on the operating table hemorrhaging, you don’t ask if you can pay the surgeon,” Mr. Miller said. “You save the patient.”Mr. Baxter said a Fed loan would have been a “bridge to nowhere,” while Mr. Alvarez said the Fed could not make loans that it believed would never be repaid.“If the Federal Reserve had lent to Lehman that Monday,” Mr. Alvarez said, “this hearing and all other hearings would only have been about how we wasted taxpayers’ money.”He added, “I think they failed not because government wasn’t willing to help them, but because they were a victim of circumstances, the economy and some bad decisions they had made in the years leading up that they didn’t have time to get out of.”Comments by several commission members suggested that the panel’s final report, due in December, would home in on the controversial way the bailouts of 2008 were conducted.“There are many candidates this fall for Congress who are running on a platform of ‘no more bailouts’ and are committing themselves not to support programs like the TARP should they get elected,” said Bob Graham, a Democratic commissioner and a former senator from Florida. The commission’s vice chairman, Bill Thomas, a California Republican and a former House member, said he wished Mr. Fuld would attend field hearings the commission plans to hold to hear from homeowners devastated by the crisis.“I wish I could have you all along so you can appreciate and understand why this coming election in November is under a whole lot more turmoil than anybody thought it was going to be,” he said.'"
"'10-09-02,'1','BEIJING — The Chinese government on Wednesday began to require cellphone users to furnish identification when buying SIM cards, a move officials cast as an effort to rein in burgeoning cellphone spam, pornography and fraud schemes.The requirement, which has been in the works for years, is not unlike rules in many developed nations that ask users to present credit card data or other proof of identification to buy cellphone numbers. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that about 40 percent of China’s 800 million cellphone users were currently unidentified. Those users will be ordered to furnish identification by 2013 or lose their service, according to The Global Times, a state-run newspaper.A government center that deals with cellphone complaints said that the average Chinese cellphone user received a dozen spam messages a week, and that three of every four users received messages that involved fraud, China Daily, another state newspaper, reported Wednesday.Some analysts, however, questioned whether the new requirement would substantially reduce illicit messages. Instead, they warned that the regulation potentially gives the government new tools to locate and punish individuals who send cellphone messages that censors deem unacceptable.The Chinese central government has steadily tightened its censorship of the Internet and wireless communications since 2008, blocking increasing numbers of Web sites, social networking services like Facebook and Twitter and, most recently, shutting down microblogs that it regards as subversive.'"

"'10-09-03,'1','In his 20 years as a boat captain, Dan Shaw had never tried to rescue an entire crew out of the water. But on Thursday, he received a radio alert that 13 workers from an oil platform that caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico were bobbing in choppy, fast-flowing waters not far from the flames.His boat was 25 miles away, one of the nearest to the scene of the emergency, and he volunteered to find the floating workers.“We wanted to get to them as fast as we could and make sure we didn’t lose anybody,” said Captain Shaw, 59, one of four workers aboard a 100-foot service vessel, the Crystal Clear.By the time he arrived around 11 a.m., he said, the men had been floating for two hours and had been swept a mile from the still-flaming platform.They were wearing protective wet suits and life jackets and linking arms. The Coast Guard said that fortunately the surface temperature was 86 degrees, about 80 miles off the Louisiana coast. The temperature of the ocean water was less of a safety concern than the strong tides and the fire on the platform, according to the Coast Guard, which arrived shortly after the rescue began and provided emergency helicopters for the evacuation.“It’s 86 degrees, pretty much like bath water,” said Elizabeth Bordelon, a spokeswoman for the Coast Guard.'"
"'10-09-03,'1','Second, everyone put in more hours. What families didn’t receive in wage increases they made up for in work increases. By the mid-2000s, the typical male worker was putting in roughly 100 hours more each year than two decades before, and the typical female worker about 200 hours more.When American families couldn’t squeeze any more income out of these two coping mechanisms, they embarked on a third: going ever deeper into debt. This seemed painless — as long as home prices were soaring. From 2002 to 2007, American households extracted $2.3 trillion from their homes.Eventually, of course, the debt bubble burst — and with it, the last coping mechanism. Now we’re left to deal with the underlying problem that we’ve avoided for decades. Even if nearly everyone was employed, the vast middle class still wouldn’t have enough money to buy what the economy is capable of producing.Where have all the economic gains gone? Mostly to the top. The economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty examined tax returns from 1913 to 2008. They discovered an interesting pattern. In the late 1970s, the richest 1 percent of American families took in about 9 percent of the nation’s total income; by 2007, the top 1 percent took in 23.5 percent of total income.It’s no coincidence that the last time income was this concentrated was in 1928. I do not mean to suggest that such astonishing consolidations of income at the top directly cause sharp economic declines. The connection is more subtle.The rich spend a much smaller proportion of their incomes than the rest of us. So when they get a disproportionate share of total income, the economy is robbed of the demand it needs to keep growing and creating jobs.What’s more, the rich don’t necessarily invest their earnings and savings in the American economy; they send them anywhere around the globe where they’ll summon the highest returns — sometimes that’s here, but often it’s the Cayman Islands, China or elsewhere. The rich also put their money into assets most likely to attract other big investors (commodities, stocks, dot-coms or real estate), which can become wildly inflated as a result.Meanwhile, as the economy grows, the vast majority in the middle naturally want to live better. Their consequent spending fuels continued growth and creates enough jobs for almost everyone, at least for a time. But because this situation can’t be sustained, at some point — 1929 and 2008 offer ready examples — the bill comes due.This time around, policymakers had knowledge their counterparts didn’t have in 1929; they knew they could avoid immediate financial calamity by flooding the economy with money. But, paradoxically, averting another Great Depression-like calamity removed political pressure for more fundamental reform. We’re left instead with a long and seemingly endless Great Jobs Recession.THE Great Depression and its aftermath demonstrate that there is only one way back to full recovery: through more widely shared prosperity. In the 1930s, the American economy was completely restructured. New Deal measures — Social Security, a 40-hour work week with time-and-a-half overtime, unemployment insurance, the right to form unions and bargain collectively, the minimum wage — leveled the playing field.In the decades after World War II, legislation like the G.I. Bill, a vast expansion of public higher education and civil rights and voting rights laws further reduced economic inequality. Much of this was paid for with a 70 percent to 90 percent marginal income tax on the highest incomes. And as America’s middle class shared more of the economy’s gains, it was able to buy more of the goods and services the economy could provide. The result: rapid growth and more jobs.By contrast, little has been done since 2008 to widen the circle of prosperity. Health-care reform is an important step forward but it’s not nearly enough.What else could be done to raise wages and thereby spur the economy? We might consider, for example, extending the earned income tax credit all the way up through the middle class, and paying for it with a tax on carbon. Or exempting the first $20,000 of income from payroll taxes and paying for it with a payroll tax on incomes over $250,000.In the longer term, Americans must be better prepared to succeed in the global, high-tech economy. Early childhood education should be more widely available, paid for by a small 0.5 percent fee on all financial transactions. Public universities should be free; in return, graduates would then be required to pay back 10 percent of their first 10 years of full-time income.Another step: workers who lose their jobs and have to settle for positions that pay less could qualify for “earnings insurance” that would pay half the salary difference for two years; such a program would probably prove less expensive than extended unemployment benefits.These measures would not enlarge the budget deficit because they would be paid for. In fact, such moves would help reduce the long-term deficits by getting more Americans back to work and the economy growing again.Policies that generate more widely shared prosperity lead to stronger and more sustainable economic growth — and that’s good for everyone. The rich are better off with a smaller percentage of a fast-growing economy than a larger share of an economy that’s barely moving. That’s the Labor Day lesson we learned decades ago; until we remember it again, we’ll be stuck in the Great Recession.'"
"'10-09-03,'1','“You can tell there’s concerns about whether other municipal bond issuers in the state might be having some problems,” Mr. Casey said. “It’s definitely a tap on the drum of all the bad news, but it’s not the loudest tap.”Some investors were left wondering whether Pennsylvania might have to offer assistance to Harrisburg and other troubled cities, he said. Still, most municipal bond investors seemed satisfied that states and cities were generally taking tough measures to preserve their creditworthiness during the downturn.Harrisburg’s warning to bondholders came in a letter signed by its business administrator, Robert F. Kroboth. His language suggested that the city hoped to buy time, saying it was “developing a comprehensive plan” to make the payments “in the near future.”But some bond market analysts said they thought Mr. Kroboth’s plea for forbearance would have the opposite effect, prompting creditors to put new pressure on the city and limit its ability to maneuver through the growing financial crisis.The company that insured Harrisburg’s bonds, Ambac Assurance, has authority under Pennsylvania law to take Harrisburg to court within 30 days and seek an order that it raise property taxes to pay the bonds.A spokeswoman for Ambac did not return a call seeking a statement on the insurer’s intentions.Cities rarely declare bankruptcy, so there is little legal precedent if Harrisburg were to take that route, making outcomes hard to predict. The mayor of Harrisburg, Linda D. Thompson, opposes a bankruptcy filing.“You don’t need a degree in law to understand that the issues here are very complicated, and it’s going to be very costly to work this out in a Chapter 9 filing,” said the mayor’s spokesman, Chuck Ardo. “The only ones that will benefit will be the lawyers.”Harrisburg’s financial difficulties have been mounting for some time. Even before this week, it had missed several payments in connection with another batch of bonds. It had guaranteed nearly $282 million of bonds issued by a separate entity, the Harrisburg Authority, which raised the money to build a huge trash incinerator.The incinerator has been a flop, leaving the authority wallowing in debt that it cannot pay, including $35 million that will mature in December. Harrisburg has failed to make good on its guarantee, pointing to Dauphin County, a co-guarantor on some of the incinerator bonds.On Wednesday Dauphin County authorized TD Bank, the trustee for the maturing incinerator bonds, to sue Harrisburg.But this week’s default announcement related to Harrisburg’s own general obligation bonds, a sign that the city’s problems were profound.General obligation bonds are the type considered safest for ordinary investors, because the issuer pledges its full faith, credit and taxing power to make all payments. Cities normally go to great lengths to avoid defaulting on their general obligations.“The city’s prior defaults could be blamed on how the incinerator has not functioned,” said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent consulting firm. “This default is very different, because it shows the city cannot operate under normal circumstances. It’s a default based on the structure and function of government itself.”Mr. Fabian said he thought Harrisburg had stumbled badly by defaulting on a relatively small amount of debt.“Their ability to restructure the incinerator debt is now compromised, because what could you restructure the incinerator bonds with, if not general obligation bonds?” he said. “Now their general obligation is not a credible pledge.”Mr. Ardo said Harrisburg had already selected a financial advisory firm, Scott Balice Strategies, to help it review its operations and economize. The firm specializes in helping troubled cities sell assets like parking garages and toll roads. But the city has not been able to sign a contract yet, because it does not have the money.Ms. Thompson, the mayor, has asked Gov. Edward G. Rendell for money to allow Harrisburg to hire Scott Balice and let it begin its review. On Thursday she was waiting for a response.'"
"'10-09-03,'1','The suit was filed and a reward was offered. Then it was revealed that Mr. Doyle had served at least three stints in prison and was released in December after spending more than two years behind bars after pleading guilty to stealing a bronze Degas statue from an art collector in New York.That revelation prompted the lawyer representing Ms. Trudgeon to withdraw the lawsuit.But on Thursday, there was word that the owners still planned to sue Mr. Haggerty — that word came from no other than Mr. Doyle, who answered the door to Ms. Trudgeon’s 18th-floor apartment on the Upper West Side.“We wanted to triangulate his phone,” Mr. Doyle said of Mr. Haggerty. “The only way you can triangulate his phone is if you get a court order, because he can’t remember where he was for an hour and a half.”Mr. Doyle would not comment about his criminal record and portrayed himself as a victim.“I’m out a lot of money,” he said as Ms. Trudgeon appeared in the apartment behind him, talking on the phone. “I’ve really got a lot of people mad at me.”Some of those who have said they were victimized by Mr. Doyle recalled how he ingratiated himself, figuring out what made people tick and then using those insights to lure people into schemes.Michael Richwine of Shawnee, Kan., said he had given Mr. Doyle about $2,500 in return for a promised rare violin. The money disappeared and the violin never materialized, Mr. Richwine said.“He’s got good instincts and he catches people at weak moments,” Mr. Richwine, 64, said. “He’s very personable, very likable, but the guy has got no conscience at all.”Amanda Bonar of Oak Ridge, Tenn., said Mr. Doyle absconded with several hundred thousand dollars in gold and gems that she had given him to sell. Ms. Bonar, 53, said he entered her world in 1996 or 1997, wearing scuffed Italian loafers, driving a low-end Mercedes-Benz, dropping names and exhibiting a casual confidence.“He was very relaxed, like a fisherman letting the fish come to the bait,” she said. “He wasn’t at all anxious.”Eventually, she said, she tracked down Mr. Doyle at a motel where he was staying with his mother, near the Tennessee-Virginia border. Mr. Doyle was arrested on outstanding warrants, but Ms. Bonar said she never got her gold back.“He’s got the coldest lack of conscience I’ve ever seen,” she said. “I hope I never see that again. It’s scary.”Mr. Doyle’s most recent conviction, in New York, centered on the bronze Degas sculpture of a nude dancer worth about $600,000. Mr. Doyle befriended the owner of the sculpture in part by suggesting that he was a descendant of Joseph Duveen, later Lord Duveen of Millbank, a predominant art dealer in the 1920s and ’30s.Mr. Doyle acknowledged that the latest publicity over the lost artwork could harm his efforts to gain a foothold in the market.“I’m guessing I’m probably out of the art business, but who knows?” he said. “Right now, I want my painting back. Nothing more, nothing less. That’s my concern.”'"

"'10-09-03,'1','LONDON — In a country that is no stranger to sex scandals in politics, the latest flare-up has been one of the strangest of all.Most notably, it came to broad public attention only because the man at the center of it, Foreign Secretary William Hague, made a plaintive declaration, with the support of many of his fellow lawmakers, that there had been no scandal at all.Mr. Hague, third-ranking minister in the coalition government of Prime Minister David Cameron, brought the issue into the glare of national attention when he issued a statement on Wednesday seeking to end “continued and hurtful speculation” prompted by a political blogger concerning his relationship with a 25-year-old male adviser at the foreign office.Mr. Hague, who is 49 and a former leader of the Conservative Party, is married, and his statement centered mainly on the “intensely traumatic and painful experience” he and his wife, Ffion, have had in trying to start a family, and how the stresses of multiple miscarriages had brought the couple closer together. In the statement, he rejected “any suggestion that I have ever been involved in a relationship with a man.”Complicating the story, the aide involved, Christopher Myers, resigned from his job and disappeared from public view as Mr. Hague’s statement was made public, leaving it to Mr. Hague to say that Mr. Myers was quitting because of “the pressure on his family from the untrue and malicious allegations made about him” by bloggers and in gossip at Whitehall, the center of government in the heart of London.The flurry last weekend began when a tabloid newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, published a photograph of Mr. Hague, in baseball cap, dark sunglasses and blue jeans, laughing as he walked on a London street last year with Mr. Myers. The writer of a political blog called Guido Fawkes, a play on the name of Guy Fawkes, a notorious saboteur who failed in a plot to blow up Parliament in 1605, took up the issue by reporting that Mr. Hague and Mr. Myers had on more than one occasion shared a hotel room during campaigning for the May general election that brought the Cameron government to power.'"

"'10-09-03,'1','Mr. Bernanke said that when he made his remarks in 2007 he thought the subprime problems were “manageable.”“What I did not recognize was the extent to which the system had flaws and weaknesses in it that were going to amplify the initial shock from subprime and make it into a much bigger crisis,” he said.While Mr. Bernanke stuck with his long-held stance that the Fed had not aided the housing bubble by keeping interest rates too low for too long in 2002-4, he embraced the view of Gary B. Gorton, an influential Yale finance professor.Professor Gorton has compared the crisis to a classic bank run, but with the “banks” in this case being short-term wholesale financing markets — a loosely regulated, uninsured system known as shadow banking.Mr. Bernanke offered an analogy of his own, likening the housing crisis to E. coli bacteria that can have deadly consequences when passed along through a vulnerable food safety system.“E. coli got into the food system, and it created a much bigger problem,” he said. “There was an awful lot of dependence on short-term, unstable funding, which is analogous to the deposits in banks before the period of deposit insurance.”Asked about the role of financial innovation in the economy, Mr. Bernanke, said that “innovation is not always a good thing.” Some innovations have unpredictable consequences, are used primarily “to take unfair advantage rather than to create a more efficient market,” and create systemic risks, he said.In a 2002 speech when he was a Fed governor, Mr. Bernanke argued that central banks should not try to use monetary policy to pop asset bubbles. As part of his nearly three hours of testimony on Thursday, Mr. Bernanke held to that view, but said that at the time he had called for careful supervision and regulation to maintain financial stability.“We didn’t do that,” conceded Mr. Bernanke, who became Fed chairman in 2006. “Going forward, we need to be able to do that.”As he did in an address to the American Economic Association in January, Mr. Bernanke argued against the perspective that the Fed stood by passively, “not recognizing the obvious,” as housing prices soared.“As of 2003 to 2004, there really was quite a bit of disagreement among economists about whether there was a bubble, how big it was, whether it was just a local or a national bubble,” Mr. Bernanke testified.He added: “By the time it was evident that it was a bubble and that it was going to create risk to the financial system, it was rather late to address it through monetary policy.”Mr. Bernanke said the most important lesson of the crisis was the need to end the “too-big-to-fail problem,” a view echoed by Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, who also testified Thursday.The Dodd-Frank legislation gives the Fed oversight over the largest financial institutions, including those that are not banks. It gave the Fed a prominent role in the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a body of regulators with the power to seize and break up a systemically important company if it threatens economic stability. The F.D.I.C. would manage that process, known as resolution.In deciding which large companies will fall under its supervision, Mr. Bernanke said, the Fed will look at size, complexity, interconnectedness and degree of involvement in areas like payments and settlements systems.He also said the Fed was overhauling how it supervises banks. Alongside traditional examiners, the Fed has assigned additional finance experts, accountants, economists and lawyers to work on oversight. “We really need to take a much broader, multidisciplinary approach,” he said.Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Bair said it was also imperative that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international coordinating body of regulators, impose tougher standards on how much and what kinds of capital banks must hold.The increased capital requirements should include capital that is more aligned with risk and able to absorb losses more effectively, and that works in a countercyclical manner, so that banks have more of it during times of financial stress, he said.Several European countries have expressed resistance to the Basel process, seeking either to weaken some of the requirements or to stretch out the period of time before the new rules will take effect.'"
"'10-09-03,'1','In a briefing on Thursday afternoon to reporters traveling with Mr. Gates, General Petraeus said that the United States was still trying to fix its intelligence-gathering operation in Afghanistan, which was sharply criticized this year in a report by Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, the top American military intelligence officer in the country.“We have never had the granular understanding of local circumstances in Afghanistan that we achieved over time in Iraq,” General Petraeus told reporters at Camp Eggers, an American military base in Kabul. “One of the key elements in our ability to be fairly agile in our activities in Iraq during the surge was a pretty good understanding of who the powerbrokers were in local areas, how the systems were supposed to work, how they really worked, which tribe was which.”Mr. Gates took the opportunity to repeat assurances that President Obama’s deadline to begin withdrawing troops was flexible.“Americans will still be here after July 2011, the president has been very clear, the pace will be determined by conditions on the ground,” he said.A reporter for Al Jazeera commented that “the Taliban are saying, ‘The Americans have the watch, but we have the time,’ ” and expressed a commonly held fear here that America would abandon the country to the Taliban.“We are not turning off the lights next July,” the secretary replied. “If the Taliban really believe we are leaving next summer, they will be deeply disappointed.“We learned our lessons from turning our backs on Afghanistan in 1989 and we have no intention of doing so again.”Mr. Gates made a passing reference to the corruption issue, saying President Karzai and he had agreed it was an important matter, and that General Petraeus and the American ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, would be putting into place new measures to make sure American funds are not misspent.Mr. Karzai said the secretary supported his decision to issue a legal decree regulating the Major Crimes Task Force and the Special Investigations Unit, two anti-corruption forces that have been active in arresting corrupt officials, but which have a large component of American advisers helping them.When the major crimes unit arrested a presidential adviser in July, Mohammed Zia Salehi, President Karzai intervened to get him released. He again defended that action, which alarmed many American officials, saying the manner of the arrest was reminiscent of the days of the Soviet occupation, and made his government look like a “police state.”He said he had discussed his concerns with Mr. Gates. “Mr. Gates and I discussed this and I was happy we agreed,” Mr. Karzai said.“The fight against corruption needs to be Afghan-led,” Mr. Gates said. “This is a sovereign country.”In his remarks earlier, General Petraeus also said that insurgents were still fighting hard for the farming area of Marja, the site of a major American military operation in February that is not yet under control. General Petraeus said, however, that shops and a school had reopened, the district center has been rebuilt and a voter registration drive occurred there last week.In Kandahar, he said, American forces continue to kill insurgents in the surrounding districts but said the operation would take more time. He offered these statistics: In June, July and August, United States and NATO forces killed or captured 235 insurgent leaders, killed 1,066 rank-and-file insurgents and captured another 1,673 rank-and-file insurgents.'"
"'10-09-03,'1','“Before the yen’s surge, Toyota got by with exporting lots of cars, even though it was aware that posed a big currency risk,” said Takashi Akiyama, vice president at SC-Abeam Automotive Consulting, based in Tokyo.“They held out for as long as they could, but now they’re seeing the consequences of stalling,” Mr. Akiyama said.Other big Japanese exporters, like Honda, Nissan, Sony and Canon, feel the yen’s burden, too. The country’s export growth slowed for the fifth consecutive month in July, weighed down by the strong yen. But because they have moved more of their production overseas in recent years, those companies suffer much less from currency imbalances.The difference is laid bare in a startling statistic: For every yen that the Japanese currency gains in value against its assumed dollar rate of ¥90, Toyota says, it loses ¥30 billion, or $357 million, in operating profit. If the exchange rate stays at the current ¥84 to a dollar, Toyota’s operating profit for its financial year ending next March, which the company forecasts will reach ¥330 billion, could fall by half.By that same measure, Nissan says it loses only half as much for each yen’s gain against the dollar — about ¥15 billion yen. Sony loses but ¥2 billion.The unfavorable foreign exchange has probably damaged Toyota more than its series of safety recalls has, by bringing margins to razor-thin levels, and a further rise in the yen raises the specter of operating losses, said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst for the automotive industry at the brokerage firm CLSA.“Fixing the problem takes a lot of time,” Mr. Richter said. “But given how fast the yen has strengthened, time is not Toyota’s friend.”Over the years, of course, Toyota has set up manufacturing operations outside Japan, including the United States, where it makes cars at four assembly plants, helping to buffer the effects of swings in the dollar-yen exchange rate.Still, many of the cars Toyota sells in the U.S. market are made in Japan, especially after the automaker shuttered a plant in Fremont, California, earlier this year that had made its popular Corolla compact sedan. A total of 35 percent of the cars Toyota sells in North America are imported, compared with 10 percent for Honda.Toyota is well aware of the need to move production closer to the consumer. Next year, Toyota plans to open a plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi, to build Corollas.“Our goal is to produce cars where they’re sold,” said Paul Nolasco, a spokesman for Toyota in Tokyo. “Who knows when, and 100 percent might not be possible, but the idea is to try to make as many cars locally to increase local content,” he said. “That just makes business sense.”Perhaps nowhere does Toyota need to localize production and cut costs more than in emerging markets, where its vehicles are easily undersold by competitors. Take China, now the world’s biggest auto market, where sales of the Yaris compact have fallen far short of expectations since its introduction in 2008. Although Toyota assembles the Yaris in China to take advantage of that country’s much cheaper labor, many of the parts still come from Toyota suppliers like Denso and Aisin.That helps push the Yaris’s price tag to more than 100,000 renminbi, or almost $15,000, making it hard to compete with the likes of the new Verna subcompact sedan from Hyundai, priced as low as 73,900 renminbi, or the popular Buick Excelle from General Motors, which carries a slightly higher price tag than a Yaris but has a larger, sleeker body — delivering more bang for a buck, analysts say.Toyota had only 5.2 percent of China’s auto market last year, trailing Hyundai, General Motors and the Chinese market leader, Volkswagen, whose Jetta family car starts at about 75,000 renminbi and is pervasive in the big cities.In another big emerging market, India, Toyota plans to introduce the Etios compact car later this year, which analysts expect will be priced about 500,000 rupees, or $11,000 — significantly higher than the most popular models in India like the Alto from Maruti Suzuki, which starts at 323,000 rupees, or the Hyundai i10, which sells for 350,000 rupees.Much of that pricing is deliberate: analysts say Toyota wants to build an upmarket image in India. Still, Toyota has much to learn from the market leader Maruti, a subsidiary of the Japanese automaker Suzuki that builds cars in India and procures almost all of its parts locally. Though Toyota also builds cars in India, many of its parts are from outside the country, adding to production costs. Toyota currently commands only 2.5 percent of the Indian car market, far behind Maruti Suzuki’s 40 percent.Toyota’s slim market shares in India and China are worrisome to the company because emerging markets are expected to make up for most of the growth in the global auto industry. According to the Englewood, Colo.-based research firm, IHS Automotive, car sales in emerging economies like China and India will surge 81 percent - from about25.8 million units in 2009 to almost 47 million units in 2016. During that time, sales in industrialized economies will grow at half that rate, from 31.7 million to 45.3 million, or an increase of 43 percent, according to IHS Automotive.To capture a bigger part of those burgeoning markets, Toyota says it is seeking to increase local production and its use of locally supplied parts in both India and China. But it takes time and sizable investment to set up local production networks, analysts say.“Toyota already knows that it must shift more production overseas, and it must make a push into emerging markets,” said Masatoshi Nishimoto, senior manager at IHS Automotive. “But it isn’t an easy task to build supplier networks overseas,” he said. “Then there’s the question of what to do with the excess capacity in Japan.”The challenge demonstrates how Toyota is paying for not moving more production to lower-cost countries during a manufacturing boom in the mid-2000s, when Toyota enjoyed record profits. The yen stayed weak during that time, helping to make Toyota competitive and fueling the company’s global expansion.Toyota held back from shifting production away from Japan and procuring components from overseas parts makers, analysts say, partly because of its traditionally strong relationship with many Japanese suppliers.Toyota’s smaller compatriot, Nissan, has been more aggressive in shifting production overseas. This year, it transplanted the entire production line for its popular March minicar to Thailand, for example, and now imports cars even for the Japanese market from its Thai factory — an unprecedented move for a Japanese automaker. But the shift makes sense: Personnel costs at its main factory in Oppama, Japan were 10 times those in Thailand.It is non-Japanese global automakers like General Motors, Volkswagen and a new rising star, Hyundai, that are poised to benefit most from Toyota’s troubles.Volkswagen, of Germany, was an early entrant into the Chinese market and enjoys an almost 20 percent market share there — the highest among foreign automakers. And Volkswagen continues to dominate in Europe, where Japanese automakers have recently been shut out by a prohibitively high exchange rate.Meanwhile, Hyundai, of South Korea, is reaping the rewards of a weak won, which has bolstered its competitiveness alongside its Japanese rivals. In China, it leads Japanese automakers with a 6.2 percent share in 2009, and has also garnered 14 percent of Indian market, where it plans to bring out a car that costs as little as $5,000 by 2012.In the United States, the weak won has allowed Hyundai to offer much more aggressive sales incentives than Toyota, allowing it to chip away at Toyota’s market share, which fell to 15.2 percent in August from 16.6 percent at the start of the year.Ford, Nissan and Volkswagen, by contrast, have added market share in the United States.Still, Toyota is in a tough spot. Moving production overseas would inevitably mean cutting capacity — and jobs — in Japan, something the automaker has hitherto avoided. Exporters are under immense pressure to keep jobs in Japan; however, government hesitation against taking steps to weaken the yen through intervention or monetary policy is adding to exporters’ frustrations.In a Japanese government survey of 102 exporters, released last week, 39 percent of companies said that they would transfer their factories overseas if the yen stayed at current levels.Some analysts say that it is a good chance for Japan to get over its obsession with manufacturing, move production overseas, and make a long-awaited move into services.“It would be a tough transition,” said Kazuki Ohara, a senior management consultant at the Tokyo-based Nomura Research Institute. “But instead of trying to curb the strong yen or ride it out,” he said, “it would be better for Japan to build an economy that thrives on a strong currency.”'"

"'10-09-04,'0','The Rangel race is more complicated. Mr. Rangel, who has been in office almost 40 years, is preparing for a House hearing on 13 ethics charges, including improper fund-raising and hoarding rent-stabilized apartments.Mr. Rangel wants primarily to clear his name, but he has promised repeatedly that he would serve out his term if re-elected, even if the case is concluded before 2012, rather than pulling a common New York party trick by resigning early so Democrats could handpick his replacement for a quick, unnoticed special election. A better solution would be for voters to look seriously at the five people running against him now.The biggest name in the race is Assemblyman Adam Clayton Powell IV, whose father was a political superstar in that area. Mr. Powell, however, has done little in Albany, even by Albany’s do-little standards. He has shown no reason for voters to promote him.There are four other choices: Vince Morgan, a community banker and former Rangel aide; Jonathan Tasini, a perennial liberal candidate; Ruben Vargas, another campaign regular; and Joyce Johnson, a former chief executive and educator. The best of these alternatives is Joyce Johnson, who, while struggling in the primary, has been a strong advocate for women’s rights and civil rights for many years.In the 15th Congressional District Democratic primary, we endorse Joyce Johnson.Republicans have a primary battle for the governor’s race that follows the national playbook. Voters will choose between an established Republican, former Representative Rick Lazio, and Carl Paladino, a Buffalo businessman who is riding voter anger as a member of the national Tea Party movement.Mr. Lazio looked like the easy winner earlier this summer and was endorsed by state Republicans. Mr. Paladino then got on the ballot the hard way, by getting more than enough voters to sign petitions. He has been making headlines ever since in ways that should alarm New Yorkers. Mr. Paladino defended a friend of his who referred to the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who is an Orthodox Jew, as “an Antichrist” and “a Hitler,” claiming it was a joke. It’s appalling that Mr. Paladino thinks it is remotely acceptable to make such comments.But it fits his pattern. Before he declared for office, Mr. Paladino often sent out e-mails, including pornography, bestiality and a depiction of Africans dancing entitled “Obama Inauguration Rehearsal.” He used the same ridiculous excuse that he was trying to be funny and said he was “not perfect.” These incidents are enough to disqualify him from office.His policy proposals, to shut down government if the budget is late or use upstate prisons to train welfare recipients for jobs and teach them “personal hygiene” are clownish.Mr. Lazio, who also has focused on plans to create more jobs and clean up the ethical swamp in Albany, is a far better choice. We don’t agree with him on numerous issues — especially his unseemly fulminating against an Islamic community center and mosque near ground zero. But he provides Republicans a far more reasonable option for the November election. The party could avoid the national embarrassment of a Paladino candidacy and mount a substantive challenge to the Democratic nominee, Andrew Cuomo.In the Republican primary for governor, we endorse Rick Lazio.For state races, the best advice for New York voters is to vote against anybody who has done time in Albany. That is especially true in the State Senate, where a few Democrats have used their slim majority to hold up the Legislature, usually for petty and personal reasons. There are a very few good senators like Liz Krueger, an independent voice from Manhattan. But most legislators need to find work elsewhere.At the top of that list should be Pedro Espada Jr., a Democrat running for re-election in the Bronx even though he mostly lives in the suburbs. Here are just a few reasons for voting against him: He owes more than $10,000 in fines for campaign finance violations (the maximum fine is $500 each); he is accused of milking his medical clinics for personal and political expenses including $20,000 worth of sushi delivered to his home in Westchester; he forced fellow senators to give him a fancy title and padded his office with a fawning entourage.Mr. Espada has run a sleazy campaign, even threatening voters who signed petitions for his strongest and best opponent, Gustavo Rivera. Mr. Rivera, an educator and political activist, has promised to vote for the kind of real reforms the state needs. A third candidate in the race, Daniel Padernacht, is a real estate lawyer with little understanding of state issues. He is a distraction for voters whose goal should be to oust Mr. Espada.In State Senate District 33 in the Bronx, we endorse Gustavo Rivera.Too many of the go-along senators in Albany have little or no opposition. One who does is Shirley Huntley, a Democrat from Southeast Queens. Mrs. Huntley has a scant record, but she does have support from Democratic leaders, who admire her obedience. Fortunately, she has a strong challenger in Lynn Nunes, who owns a small real estate company. Mr. Nunes, who promises to back reforms like redistricting, also wants to use his expertise to alleviate the foreclosure crisis in his area.In State Senate District 10 in Queens, we endorse Lynn Nunes.There are four contenders in the primary to replace State Senator Eric Schneiderman in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, but the race is now between two good choices: Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat and Mark Levine, an educator.Mr. Levine has impressive credentials and workable proposals for orchestrating the kinds of reforms we keep pushing for in New York. But it is Mr. Espaillat, a 14-year Albany veteran, who has been an outspoken voice for the most crucial reform of all — an independent redistricting commission to create fairer elections in the state. If Mr. Espaillat works hard to represent this diverse district, he could become an important leader in Albany as well as a proud model for Hispanics.In State Senate District 31 in Northern Manhattan and the Bronx, we endorse Adriano Espaillat.In the Assembly, there are not enough real contests. And in New York, that means one thing: the Democratic Party has given some of Albany’s worst legislators a free ride. Here’s the only solution: vote against the incumbents.In an earlier editorial, we endorsed State Senator Eric Schneiderman in the Democratic primary for attorney general.'"

"'10-09-04,'0','H&R Block told investors to ignore speculation that it faced a surge in costs tied to its defunct mortgage business. Concern about potential losses tied to buybacks of home loans “is not based on fact,” and reserves to protect the company against claims are adequate, the chief executive, Alan M. Bennett, said Thursday during a conference call about fiscal first-quarter earnings. The call included repeated queries about claims, which have totaled more than $680 million. H&R Block originated mortgages through January 2008, and some were sold to become part of mortgage-backed securities. The company’s mortgage buyback liability “remains within our reserved expectations, and we continue to view related reserves as adequate,” the chief financial officer, Jeffrey T. Brown, said. H&R Block reported a loss from continuing operations of $127.6 million, or 40 cents a share, for the three months ending July 10, compared with $130.6 million, or 39 cents, in the same period last year.

"'10-09-04,'0','It is an issue not limited to Russia alone. Harvest forecasts in Germany and Canada are clouded by wet weather and flooding, while crops in Argentina will suffer from drought, as could Australia’s, according to agricultural experts. The bump in prices because of the uncertainty about future supplies means the poor in some areas of the world will face higher bread prices in the coming months.Food prices are still some 30 percent below the 2008 levels, Mr. Abbassian said, when a tripling in the price of rice among other staples led to food riots in about a dozen countries and helped topple at least one government.The wheat crop this year globally is also the third highest on record, according to the F.A.O., but the sudden supply interruptions make the markets jittery. In June, Russia was predicting a loss of just a few million metric tons due to hot weather, but by August it announced it would lose about one-fifth of its crop. Wheat prices more than doubled in that period.“There are reasons to be watching this and to be concerned because regionally there will be supply challenges,” said Justin P. Gilpin, the head of the Kansas Wheat Commission. “There is uncertainty in the marketplace.”A decade ago, the area around the Black Sea — mainly Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan — used to supply just about 4 percent of the wheat traded internationally. But most of the growth in demand globally has been supplied from there, and the region now produces about 30 percent of the wheat traded internationally, said Mr. Abbassian. This is the first time a supply crisis has originated from that area, he noted.In early August, Russia announced an export ban that it would review at the end of the year, but Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin announced Thursday that the ban on grain exports would extend into 2011. The price of wheat jumped again, and that has had a spillover effect into other grains like corn and soybeans. The forecast for the global rice harvest has also dropped, although it is still expected to be higher than in 2009 and should be a record, the F.A.O. said.“If you look at the numbers globally, the Americans, the Europeans and the Australians can make up the supply,” Mr. Abbassian said of the wheat harvest, playing down the chances of repeating the 2008 crisis. “There is no reason for this hype, but once the psychological thing sets in it is hard to change that perception, especially if Russia keeps sending bad news.”After two days of rioting set off by price increases for bread and utilities like electricity and water, the streets in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique, were largely calm on Friday. But 10 people had been killed and 300 injured, Health Minister Ivo Garrido told a news conference, local news agencies reported. Price increases have been much sharper in Mozambique than in most of the world because the government kept prices artificially low before elections last year, some analysts said.As with any commodity, questions of wheat shortages spur speculation and hoarding, and experts suggest both are at play in the current market. They believe more money is washing through the commodity market for wheat because with interest rates so low and the stock market so volatile, investors are putting their money in the Chicago Board of Trade.But the world also has to come to grips with changing weather patterns due to climate change, argued Prof. Per Pinstrup-Anderson, an expert in international agriculture at Cornell University.“We are going to have much bigger fluctuations in weather and therefore the food supply than we had in the past, so we are going to have to learn how to cope with fluctuating food prices,” Professor Pinstrup-Anderson said.'"
"'10-09-04,'0','Joe Parker, the senior associate athletic director in charge of the project, said that he had originally hoped to have every suite and seat leased a year before the project’s completion. Instead, 65 of 81 suites and about 90 percent of 2,952 premium seats have been leased for the full season in anticipation of Saturday’s opener, with prices ranging from $55,000 to $85,000 annually for the suites and $1,500 to $4,000 annually for a premium seat, plus the ticket cost.The university has also received about $32 million in donation commitments for naming rights associated with the expansion.Parker said the university has succeeded in its goal of financing a wide-ranging stadium modernization without requiring a price increase or a surcharge for existing season-ticket holders. The new seating will generate about $12 million in revenue this season, Parker said, more than enough to cover the $9 million debt services for the renovation and expansion. The suites and preferred seating are expected to generate more than $14 million annually when they are sold out.Parker said “seven or eight” individuals or businesses who originally committed to leasing suites backed out because of the recession.“Obviously the world was a much different place” when the project was approved, Parker said. “In September of 2008, everything changed, not just in Michigan, but the whole country. There was a six- to eight-month period where it did feel very unsettling.”“But,” he added, “the response has been amazing.”Fans in suites or premium seating will be surrounded by the chrome, glass, rich wood paneling and high-definition big-screen televisions that are now standard for such projects, with added artistic elements showcasing Michigan’s athletics history. They will also have their own private elevator service and parking area, but alcohol remains banned from the stadium — including the suites — because of the university’s policy that it would be inconsistent with its educational mission.Parker said that the individuals or businesses that canceled their commitment to buy a suite have still purchased some level of premium seating.Yet while Dow Chemical, DTE Energy and BorgWarner have all leased suites, the Detroit automakers and banks — two areas particularly hard hit by the recession — are conspicuous in their absence.Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College and author of “Unpaid Professionals: Commercialization and Conflict in Big-Time College Sports,” said Michigan’s current economic and athletic uncertainty should remain a concern.“Instead of the numbers going up, the numbers might go down,” Zimbalist said. “I think they are skating on thin ice. And there’s always the question about how Michigan is going to perform on the field. This year, I believe, Michigan is not projected to have a particularly strong team in the Big Ten.”Zimbalist also questioned whether the economic picture is quite as rosy as Michigan has painted it. New and expanded stadiums typically have increased expenses beyond debt service, he said, and selling suites and premium seating in an economic downturn may include ancillary discounts such as free food or parking. (Parker said Michigan is not offering such discounts.)Still, Zimbalist predicted the renovation will ultimately be seen as a success, especially given it is paying for much-needed upgrades and modernization to the rest of the stadium.“Michigan football is a spectacular brand,” he said. “They’ve sold out every game for roughly 20 years. They had reason to think they could flex their muscles a little bit and they needed to do some renovations on the stadium anyway because it wasn’t compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act. They simply hadn’t modernized it for some time.“There were a number of choices and they went for the most aggressive choice. It’s likely to pay off because of the strength of the brand. It’s not likely to pay off as handsomely as they hoped and projected, but that’s not unusual.”'"

"'10-09-04,'0','Fulvio Fantoni is a five-time world champion. He runs bridge holidays in Italy and when he plays, his table is broadcast on bridgebase.com.This deal took place on Wednesday. How can West defeat six diamonds doubled?East opened with a modern pre-empt, in which suit quality takes a back seat. Fantoni (South) overcalled three no-trump, hoping to steal the match points in the highest-scoring strain. West made an enterprising four-spade bid. (This contract can go down three. South cashes two diamonds, North discarding a club. Then North can get a club ruff.) But Yolanda Rioli (North), assuming her partner had a big balanced hand and knowing they were vulnerable against nonvulnerable opponents, advanced with five hearts. South ran to six diamonds, which West doubled.If West had led the heart ace, the contract could have been defeated. West continues with a second heart, which East must ruff with the diamond ten. This effects an uppercut. After South overruffs, West’s diamond jack is promoted as the setting trick. (And, strangely, if West had led a low heart, that would have also defeated the slam.) But West unimaginatively chose the spade queen.Fantoni won with his ace, drew trumps and led his heart. West ducked his ace. After winning with dummy’s king, declarer continued with the heart queen, discarding his last spade. West took this trick, but South’s club loser evaporated on the heart jack, the club king being the dummy entry.Six diamonds doubled and made scored 1,540 and a top.This deal reminded me of one many years ago in England. Maurice Harrison-Gray, four times a European team champion, was in seven no-trump. The player on opening lead had an ace, but did not double or lead the ace, so the grand slam made.A kibitzer asked Gray if he would have doubled.“Not if I wasn’t going to lead my ace.”'"
"'10-09-04,'0','Citing construction delays, the Museum for African Art said on Friday that it had pushed back the planned opening of its new Manhattan home by about six months, from April 2011 to September or October of that year.The museum will occupy the lower floors of a 19-story condominium building, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, on Fifth Avenue between 109th and 110th Streets. The museum’s president, Elsie McCabe Thompson, said that the building’s developers, Brickman and Sidney Fetner Associates, had failed to complete the core and shell as expected several months ago, and that they were now planning to do so in the next few weeks.In the meantime the museum’s construction consultants, engineers and architects decided that they could not finish the interior in time for a spring opening.“It’s a complex situation — I don’t want to lay blame on any one entity,” Mrs. Thompson said. “There’s a lot of factors,” she continued, adding, “It’s quite common.”Roderick O’Connor, a principal of Brickman, however, said in a phone interview that there had not been any significant delays on its part.'"
"'10-09-04,'0','“Godunov,” set to open on Oct. 11, is one of the Met’s major new productions this year. René Pape, the renowned bass, will sing the title role for the first time at the house, and Valery Gergiev will conduct. Stephen Wadsworth is taking over the direction. He will use the work of Mr. Stein’s design team, which stayed with the production.Mr. Stein said he had been working on the production over the previous year, completing, with his collaborators, complicated sets for the whole opera, several choreographed sections, more than 600 costumes and his ideas for stage action. All that was left was to work with the singers, he said.Mr. Stein is a prominent theater and opera director in Europe. He was born in Germany and has lived in Italy for the last 13 years. He is known for marathon productions, including a 12-hour theatrical version of Dostoyevsky’s “Demons,” staged on Governors Island this summer as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. (He came for the performances and did not need a work visa.)In June he went to the consulate in Berlin for a work visa for the Met job and was forced, he said, to stand for hours in a stifling room with 50 other visa applicants. When he finally reached the consular official, “He said to me, ‘Why don’t you laugh?’ ” Mr. Stein recounted. “I said, ‘I stay here for two and a half hours standing and I am an old man.’ ”The officer replied, “ ‘In this case you will not have a visa,’ and sent me away,” Mr. Stein said. Mr. Stein said the experience left him humiliated and deeply offended.Several weeks later he returned and managed to gain the work visa, helped by a Met employee who had flown to Berlin. But the experience rankled, and Mr. Stein sent an e-mail to Mr. Gelb saying he was “terrified and demotivated” out of fear that a similar incident could occur in the United States.“If anything happens in the same way, I will leave immediately your country trembling alone thinking of the entrance procedures at the airport,” he said.On July 8 Mr. Gelb responded in an e-mail. “The Met has put its considerable resources at your disposal and spent millions of dollars for costumes and scenery to help ensure the artistic success of ‘Boris,’ ” he wrote. “We can’t now be held hostage to the possibility that an airport procedure or some other event will offend you and result in your immediate departure.”Mr. Gelb pointed out that all foreign singers and directors at the Met had to put up with “unpleasant procedures,” and he asked for Mr. Stein’s guarantee to see the production through. “Otherwise, I will be forced to look into alternative plans,” Mr. Gelb wrote.Mr. Stein then withdrew. In the interview he acknowledged Mr. Gelb’s concerns. “I must admit I understand his decision,” he said. “He knew very well it could happen once more.”At the same time, Mr. Stein said, Mr. Gelb should have heard his worries as a “cry to be protected.”“He should have written to me,” he continued, ‘We will do all we can to protect you. Come.’ ”Mr. Stein also had cold words for his experience at the opera house. He said that while that had no effect on his decision, he was happy to be out of the job.“The things with the Met didn’t go so well,” he said. “It was a factory. I’m not used to working in a factory.”'"

"'10-09-05,'0','West Virginia’s offense looked as if it was still on summer vacation for most of the first half on Saturday, but quarterback Geno Smith finally got the Mountaineers moving in his first career start.Smith threw two touchdown passes and showed maturity in the pocket, and Noel Devine rushed for 111 yards and a score, leading No. 25 West Virginia to a 31-0 win over visiting Coastal Carolina of the Football Championship Subdivision. The Mountaineers crawled to a 10-0 halftime lead before Smith and Devine scored on three of their first four drives of the second half.Perhaps the real star for the Mountaineers was the defense, which prevented Coastal Carolina from getting inside the 20. West Virginia earned its first shutout since a 38-0 win at Cincinnati in 2005.“I’m pleased with the way our defense played, reacted and took control of the game,” West Virginia Coach Bill Stewart said.Defensive lineman Scooter Berry summarized the effort with a simple message on his Twitter account: “Doughnut.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','The first week is a carnival of sideshows on a dozen courts, kept busy from morning until past midnight. Characters long forgotten in Week 2 have their moment. There was Mr. Almost, for example, Michael Russell, a 32-year-old American journeyman. He almost beat Gustavo Kuerten, the eventual winner, in the fourth round of the French Open in 2001; almost beat Lleyton Hewitt, the hometown hero, in the Australian Open in 2007; almost made it to the third round at Wimbledon this year. The crowds were still just arriving on opening day, Armstrong Stadium mostly a sea of empty blue seats when Russell grabbed a quick break in the first set. Nikolay Davydenko, his opponent, looked sluggish, pushed onto his heels. Russell leapt into backhands as if trying to add a few inches to hit down on the balls. For a while, it was a dogfight. Then the scales shifted.Davydenko started finding improbable angles. Catlike, he ran down everything. At one point, having run Davydenko all over the court and then having made him scramble to the net, Russell slammed what should have been a winner straight back at the Russian. Davydenko just barely managed to get his racket in the way. The ball plunked off the frame, hopped, nicked the tape and dribbled over. Davydenko smiled sheepishly. Russell smiled back and shook his head. Match over. Mr. Almost lost, again. (A few days later, Davydenko did, too.)And so did Andy Roddick, memorably berating an umpire for what turned out to be a correct foot fault call at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Foot faults can seem like cheap calls, but the rule exists because every millimeter closer to the net helps a player serve more powerfully. The incident raised one of the week’s discussion topics: Hawk-Eye for foot faults. It seems a no-brainer. Arlen Kantarian, a United States Tennis Association official, said of the Roddick incident that “a little controversy can be good for tennis.”Until he lost to Sergiy Stahkovsky in five thrilling sets at the Grandstand on Friday, 18-year-old Ryan Harrison emerged as America’s latest prospective replacement for Roddick as the country’s next star.Americans have come to expect homegrown champions. Call it entitlement or jingoism. It’s the same pride other countries feel, but with the presumption that, should we put our minds to it, we have the resources, money and talent to dominate the sport. But America doesn’t. So there’s endless hand-wringing about what’s wrong.Truth is, this is a golden age for tennis, with Federer and Nadal, just not for American tennis, the Williams sisters aside. But who knows? The first week saw Isner and Querrey on their way somewhere. Should one of them win, America will be congratulating itself once more.The best tennis matches, which isn’t to say necessarily the most beautifully played, are like symphonies. They have different parts, which ebb and flow, peak and fall, provide a few false endings, then lead inexorably to a conclusion. The Beethoven Pastoral of the Open’s first week, the first-round match between Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus and Arnaud Clément of France began with Cypriot fans who implored their listless hero, who for a while rallied. Maybe it was something somebody said. Having lost the first set, he won the second, breezed through the third and looked to be the winner.But then the match recapitulated its original theme. Baghdatis became lazy again while Clément found his second wind. He won the fourth set and, despite dropping a service game in the fifth, won that set, too. Baghdatis crossed himself afterward, whispered something in Clément’s ear. The Cypriot fans mourned. Baghdatis said afterward that he felt “heavy,” unfit, that it wasn’t the heat, another big topic of conversation in Week 1. It was fitness. A match Baghdatis would prefer to forget was nonetheless memorable to watch, in the way of early-round matches, for its peaks and some brilliant playmaking.To attend the Open now is to witness a species of towering, slender, muscled players roaming the grounds like the Kalahari, nothing like the fans. Tennis pros once upon a time seemed almost ordinary. There’s another musical analogy here. Middle-class people used to play instruments. The only way to hear music at home was to make it yourself. The ability to play the piano or sing was a basic part of a certain bourgeois upbringing, which meant audiences who went to hear professionals play had probably played or tried to play the music they were playing, or at least could relate to what the performer was doing. The gap in ability was great, but not so great that it was incomprehensible. Then recordings came along, and the relationship between listener and performer shifted, became far more remote and abstract.Millions of people play tennis and get a thrill out of seeing what the pros can do, but the gap is getting to be so wide that it’s becoming incomprehensible to many fans, and this can be disturbing. Hence, complaints about the equipment, and calls for the men to use wood rackets again — in effect, to narrow the gap.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','INVESTORS have been fleeing stock funds in droves, moving their money into bond portfolios, the headlines tell us. But while there is some truth in these reports, they don’t provide a complete picture.Yes, a flood of money — more than half a trillion dollars since the beginning of last year — has been pouring into bond funds as investors have gravitated toward less risky assets in the wake of renewed market volatility. But not all stock funds have been neglected.So far this year, on a net basis, more than $11 billion has actually gone into funds that focus on shares of companies based in the emerging markets, according to the Investment Company Institute. And an additional $17 billion has been invested in other foreign equity funds, including those that specialize in the developed markets of Western Europe and Japan.In fact, upon closer examination, one major type of equity fund has been bleeding most of the assets: domestic stock portfolios.According to the latest figures from the institute, funds that invest primarily in stocks based in the United States have had net outflows of nearly $30 billion this year, after losing nearly $40 billion in 2009.This has some market watchers baffled.“I certainly understand the popularity of the emerging markets,” said Michele Gambera, head of quantitative analysis at UBS Global Asset Management in Chicago, noting that many investors favor this asset class because developing economies in countries like China and India are expected to outpace the global growth rate.But he says it is odd that fund investors who are turning their backs on domestic stocks are simultaneously embracing foreign funds that focus on developed markets.After all, a big reason for concern about the global economy is a slowdown in Europe, prompted by its debt crisis earlier this year. So far this year, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index (for Europe, Australasia and the Far East) is down by nearly than 7 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index of blue-chip domestic shares is off by less than 1 percent.These choices may have less to do with investors’ appetite for European stocks and more with entrenched anxieties about the markets in the United States.David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, said the recent fund flow data validated “the distrust of Wall Street and the stock market by the large class of the investing public that uses mutual funds.”After the financial crisis inflicted traumas on Wall Street titans like Lehman Brothers and the American International Group, as well as industrial stalwarts like General Motors and Chrysler, some wariness of domestic equities is to be expected, Mr. Kotok said. “Investors are having a form of financial post-traumatic stress disorder,” he said.To be sure, the markets have made up a significant portion of what was lost in the 2007-9 bear market, with the S.& P. 500 up more than 60 percent since the market lows of March 2009.But Mr. Kotok said that the financial crisis was no ordinary Wall Street panic, and that domestic stocks didn’t suffer just a short-term scare. Investors are in the midst of a rare 11-year span in which the S.& P. 500 has lost ground, thanks to not just one but two bear markets.As a result, he said, “the scars are deep, and it may take a decade for investors to fully recover.”There is a precedent for such a slow recovery in investor trust.“We’re basically seeing some parallels to what happened after the back-to-back bear markets of 1969-70 and 1973-74,” said James B. Stack, a market historian and editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter in Whitefish, Mont. “What we saw as a consequence was an outflow of money from stock funds for the remainder of the decade of the 1970s.”In fact, even though stocks experienced a strong bull run from 1982 to 1987, it really wasn’t until the early 1990s when domestic stock funds began to see huge amounts of new money flow in.This time, the single-minded devotion that investors once had for domestic stocks may never return. “I can remember being on a panel at an investment conference in 1998 when an investor came to the mike and asked, ‘Why should I bother owning anything besides an S.& P. 500 fund?’” said Kevin McDevitt, a Morningstar fund analyst. “That was a fairly common view at the time.”But Mr. McDevitt said that another factor driving money away from domestic stocks — and toward foreign equities — was the growing belief among investors that they had been underexposed to foreign stocks for far too long.At the end of the 1990s, for example, many financial planners were recommending that investors keep a minority of their stock portfolios in foreign shares — say, 10 to 20 percent. But today, it is fairly common for advisers to recommend keeping as much as a third or half of one’s equity stake in overseas shares and funds.THAT may be, but Mike Scarborough, president of Scarborough Capital Management in Annapolis, Md., thinks that investors aren’t necessarily acting because of a rational shift in strategy. Many people are probably looking in the rearview mirror and seeing better returns overseas than in the domestic market over the past 5 and 10 years.He added that if the poor performance of the S.& P. 500 persisted this year, it might be a very long time before domestic stocks fully regain their reputation.“It’s like car buyers’ perceptions of American autos,” Mr. Scarborough said. Despite recent studies showing improvements in quality among vehicles made in the United States, “some people treat American cars like it was still 1985,” he said.He added: “I think without question what happened to Detroit could happen to Wall Street.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','AS a Harvard professor who teaches introductory economics, I have the delightful assignment of greeting about 700 first-year students every fall. And this year, I am sending the first of my own children off to college. Which raises these questions: What should they be learning? And what kind of foundation is needed to understand and be prepared for the modern economy?Here is my advice for students of all ages:LEARN SOME ECONOMICS You knew this was coming. Perhaps I am just trying to protect my profession’s market share, but I hope it is more than that.The great economist Alfred Marshall called economics “the study of mankind in the ordinary business of life.” When students leave school, “the ordinary business of life” will be their most pressing concern. If the current moribund economy turns into a lost decade, as some economists fear it might, it will be crucial to be prepared for it.There may be no better place than a course in introductory economics. It helps students understand the whirlwind of forces swirling around them. It develops rigorous analytic skills that are useful in a wide range of jobs. And it makes students better citizens, ready to evaluate the claims of competing politicians.For those who have left college behind, it is not too late to learn. Pick up an economics textbook (mine would be a fine choice), and you might find yourself learning more than you imagined.Not convinced? Even if you are a skeptic of my field, as many are, there is another, more cynical reason to study it. As the economist Joan Robinson once noted, one purpose of studying economics is to avoid being fooled by economists.LEARN SOME STATISTICS High school mathematics curriculums spend too much time on traditional topics like Euclidean geometry and trigonometry. For a typical person, these are useful intellectual exercises but have little applicability to daily life. Students would be better served by learning more about probability and statistics.One thing the modern computer age has given everyone is data. Lots and lots of data. There is a large leap, however, between having data and learning from it. Students need to know the potential of number-crunching, as well as its limitations. All college students are well advised to take one or more courses in statistics, at least until high schools update what they teach.LEARN SOME FINANCE With the rise of 401(k) plans and the looming problems with Social Security, Americans are increasingly in charge of their own financial future. But are they up to the task?Few high school students graduate with the tools needed to make smart choices. Indeed, many enter college without knowing, for instance, what stocks and bonds are, what risks and returns these assets offer, and how best to manage those risks.The evidence of financial naïveté shows up every time some company goes belly up. Whether it is Enron or Lehman Brothers, many company employees are often caught with a large fraction of their wealth in a single stock. They fail to heed the most basic lesson of finance — that diversification provides a free lunch. It reduces risk without lowering expected return.College is an investment with a great return. The gap between the wages of college graduates and those with only high school diplomas is now large by historical standards. If those college grads are going to manage their earnings intelligently, they need to study the fundamentals of financial decision making.LEARN SOME PSYCHOLOGY Economists like me often pretend that people are rational. That is, with mathematical precision, people are assumed to do the best they can to achieve their goals.For many purposes, this approach is useful. But it is only one way to view human behavior. A bit of psychology is a useful antidote to an excess of classical economics. It reveals flaws in human rationality, including your own.This is one lesson I failed to heed when I was in college. I never took a single psychology course as an undergrad. But after the birth of behavioral economics, which infuses psychology into economics, I remedied that mistake. Several years ago, as a Harvard faculty member, I audited an introductory psychology course taught by Steven Pinker. I don’t know if it made me a better economist. But it has surely made me a more humble one, and, I suspect, a better human being as well.IGNORE ADVICE AS YOU SEE FIT Adults of all stripes have advice for the college-bound. Those leaving home and starting their freshman year should listen to it, consider it, reflect on it but ultimately follow their own instincts and passions.The one certain thing about the future is that it is far from certain. I don’t know what emerging industries will be attracting college graduates four years from now, and neither does anyone else. The next generation will shape its own economy, as the young Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg shaped ours. Those now packing up their clothes, buying textbooks and meeting roommates hold the future in their hands. Every year, when I look out over my 700 eager freshmen on that first day of class, the view gives me optimism about the path ahead.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','The National Wilderness Preservation System enables us to travel back in time. When I’m rafting the Middle Fork Salmon River next week, I will be experiencing a landscape that is little changed from 1776 or even 776.The freedom and responsibility of being out in truly wild frontier is a fundamental part of our cultural legacy as Americans. Our wilderness areas play a vital role in keeping that legacy alive.There must remain parts of our world that are true wilderness, where man moves only as fast as he can walk, with only what his back can carry, and relies on a map or a memory to find his way without the safeguards and conveniences of the modern world. Lives are lost in such places, as lives are lost in the larger world, but it is nonetheless good to rely solely on ourselves when we go there.If trails mark the wilderness, let them be the natural trails that form as deer and man pick their path. To designate, mark and maintain “official” trails defeats the purpose of the wilderness, and to allow wheeled vehicles to cut them is simply obscene.I have walked through wilderness reverently, knowing that no other human had responsibility for my safety. I was empowered and liberated with only what my back carried and whatever toughness I brought to the woods. How can anyone want to make my cathedral into a track for bikes?There are many places to walk or ride in wildlands in perfect safety, following marked trails back to comfortable normalcy. The world is rich with places for road bikes, hunters’ carts and baby carriages. We must preserve the wilderness so people can leave all that behind and find themselves.I am more grateful than I can say that the Forest Service, the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management strictly enforce the 1964 Wilderness Act. Its intention was and is to preserve something from the depredations of man.I don’t know which wilderness areas Ted Stroll has been visiting, but I’d like to see them. The suggestion that the Forest Service and other land management agencies are discouraging use of wilderness areas through excessively strict interpretation of the Wilderness Act will come as news to anyone who spends much time in them.Go to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota, the Wind River range in Wyoming, Isle Royale in Michigan or virtually any of the other large national forest areas or national parks designated as wilderness and you will be hard pressed to find the solitude the Wilderness Act intended these areas to provide. One is rarely out of sight of other parties on lakes or trails, and it can even be hard to find a place to camp in areas like Boundary Waters that require the use of designated sites.The sad fact is that true wilderness areas are the last refuge for people who don’t need trail signs or other forms of hand-holding and want to use their skills, rather than some wheeled contrivance, to get away from the crowds found in “frontcountry” areas of parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.If overzealous enforcement is discouraging use of the wilderness, we need more of it, not less.“Wilderness” is only fairly called wilderness when it is wild. And “wild” means free of human convenience. Wilderness made convenient no longer deserves that name, as it is open to the despoliation of everyone who may choose to access the space.The 1964 Wilderness Act was not enacted to save the lives of irresponsible adventurers; it was enacted to preserve the purity of these environments for many generations of future responsible enthusiasts.Access to wilderness areas is limited only by the capability of those who choose to explore them. We should not be asking the outdoors to adapt to our growing insufficiencies at self-reliance. Yes, people die sometimes, but that is a cost that we should expect to bear to preserve areas of this country in their most pristine state as possible.If we expect future generations to enjoy the outdoors in the way that many previous generations have, then it is incumbent upon our current generation to teach the next how to be responsible and self-reliant in engaging nature alone. Anything less makes a mockery of the intention of laws made to protect these lands for everyone, not just those who demand convenience.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','Crews hoisted the blowout preventer that once sat atop BP’s stricken well to the surface of the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday night, and the federal leader of the spill response said that there was no longer any risk that the well might leak again.“This well does not constitute a threat to the Gulf of Mexico at this point,” the leader, Thad W. Allen, a former Coast Guard admiral, said during a conference call with reporters. “The well has been effectively secured regarding any potential source of pollution.”On Friday night, BP technicians replaced the original damaged blowout preventer — the safety device that failed when the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded on April 20 — with another one that will be better able to handle any pressure changes that might take place during the final steps in the process of plugging the well permanently. That procedure should occur this week, Admiral Allen said.The original blowout preventer is a major piece of evidence in the investigation into what caused the rig explosion, which killed 11 workers and resulted in the largest maritime oil spill in American history. Federal officials said they took possession of the device after it reached the surface.No appreciable amount of oil or gas has leaked from the well since July 15, when technicians closed valves on a tight-fitting cap that had been installed several days earlier. In early August, mud and cement were pumped into the well from the top, effectively sealing the bottom of the well from the oil reservoir below it.But all along, BP and government officials have said that the process could not be completed until the completion of a relief well, through which drilling mud and cement will be pumped into the stricken well.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','“My advice now is don’t procrastinate if you’re planning to travel over the holidays,” said Rick Seaney, the chief executive of FareCompare.com, a travel Web site.The rise in fares can seem especially steep because it follows a low point for the industry. As the economy contracted last year, consumers cut back on spending and air travel collapsed, pushing prices down to their lowest levels in a decade.Those low fares put immense pressure on the airlines, which had already been struggling with high energy prices.Airline executives have since been preaching the need to reduce the number of seats they offer, either through cutbacks or consolidation. That thinking led to the merger plans between United Airlines and Continental Airlines. The carriers recently received government approval for the deal, and the merger is expected to be complete on Oct. 1.“Airlines are continuing to show voluntary capacity discipline for the first time not just this decade, but really since the industry was deregulated in 1978,” said Hunter Keay, an airline analyst at the firm Stifel Nicolaus.Of course, the health of the economy remains the wild card in the industry’s efforts to improve revenue. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, fewer people will be flying, which, in turn, would push down prices.In the meantime, airlines have seen some marked improvements in their bottom line.The average yield — or the price paid by one passenger to fly one mile — was 14.95 cents in July, the second-highest price for that month in the past decade, according to data compiled by the Air Transport Association. (The peak for July was 15.56 cents in 2008.)Passenger revenue rose by 20 percent, marking the seventh straight month of revenue growth, the industry trade group said in its latest monthly report.Travelers like Damon Myers certainly have noticed the higher prices. “It’s difficult to get a cheap ticket these days,” said Mr. Myers, a technology consultant from Brooklyn, on his way to pick up a friend at the airport. “Fares are going up. And on most flights now you’ll hear the announcement, ‘We’ve got a packed flight today.’ ”Airlines declined to comment about pricing, citing antitrust concerns. But one executive said that while the airlines have not been able to impose fare increases across the board this year, they have been able to capitalize on the return of business travelers. With more of those higher-paying customers, the airlines were able to reduce the number of cheap seats available, raising their overall revenue per flight.At the same time, the airlines have also raised an array of fees and other extra charges.“Everything that you can charge a fee for in the process of flying, there now is a fee for,” Mr. Seaney said. “Airlines have been wanting to do this for years.”The cornucopia of new fees can feel maddeningly complicated. Most airlines now charge for food or drinks, checked bags or flying on standby. Changing tickets costs $50 to $250. JetBlue sells a “sleep set” containing a pillow and a blanket for $7; Continental charges $20 to provide a receipt if the request is made more than seven days after a flight.In the past two months, American Airlines has found a variety of new services worthy of a fee. For $9, passengers can be among the first to board a flight, a perk these days as travelers bring more bags on board than will fit in overhead compartments.For $25 or $49, passengers can double or triple the number of miles they earn on a flight.And for fees ranging from $19 to $39, American allows passengers to book seats in one of the first two rows of seats in the coach cabin. These “express exit” seats allow passengers to be among the first to board and get out.“Airlines are getting increasingly creative in charging for items they once provided for free,” said Jami Counter, the senior director of TripAdvisor Flights, a Web flight search tool. “For consumers, the result is opaque.”Matthew Paulsen, an American who lives in Argentina, said he recently balked at having to pay $3.50 for snacks on a flight from Miami to Newark. So for a flight from Buenos Aires to New York, he chose LAN Airlines over American Airlines, though both sold tickets for the flight, because American charges $7 for drinks.“I want the perks,” he said. “I want the blanket. I want the snacks. I want the free drinks, without having to worry about paying for one or two beers.”But as the fees have multiplied, airlines’ fortunes have improved. Four of the top five established airlines turned a profit in the second quarter this year.In July, Delta Air Lines, the nation’s top carrier, reported its biggest quarterly profit in a decade, $467 million for the second quarter. Its revenue from passengers, which includes both higher ticket prices and more revenue from fees, jumped 19 percent. It filled 85 percent of all its seats in that period, a much higher figure than the industry is used to.“The industry’s operational performance has significantly improved,” said William S. Swelbar, a research engineer at the International Center for Air Transportation at M.I.T.But Mr. Swelbar said that airlines might be hard pressed to hold on to some of their recent gains if the economy slows down.“As much as I want to believe that a secular trend of profitability is under way, I am not so sure this is all behind us, given the fragility of this recovery,” he said.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','Fouts had the luxury of never wishing Coryell would think more creatively.But as the high-powered offenses that Coryell helped spawn continue to exert their influence, having possession of the ball is increasingly valuable, encouraging at least a few secure coaches to buck convention for a chance to gain even a small edge. That was what drove the Saints’ Sean Payton to go for the onside kick and, during the regular season, Bill Belichick’s fourth-and-2 decision for New England against Indianapolis and Mike Tomlin’s gamble on an onside kick after Pittsburgh, which had struggled to stop Green Bay, took a lead with about four minutes remaining.Forget for a moment what this says about a coach’s faith in his defense to stop some of the game’s best quarterbacks. Consider, instead, what it may indicate about the future of play calling. If simply having the ball is so important, and if offenses are so good that points are more likely, might a coach have to channel his inner riverboat gambler more often to at least extend a possession? Might the mind-set rooted in 3 yards and a cloud of dust eventually give way to the go-go mentality of video gamers? Might the punt someday go the way of the leather helmet?“You might have to steal a possession, or be more willing to go for it, to keep guys off the field,” said Jon Gruden, a former Tampa Bay coach who is now a “Monday Night Football” analyst. “It’s no different than when you’re in a foursome with Phil Mickelson or Tiger Woods — you’ll probably have to make some birdies and steal a shot or you’re not going to win. You have to be a little more aggressive.”Slowly, it seems, that message is getting through. In 2002, David H. Romer, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper after reviewing hundreds of games. He concluded that N.F.L. coaches choose to punt or attempt field goals on fourth down rather than try for the first down far more often than they should to maximize their chances of winning a game. The paper generated considerable discussion at the time, and not a small amount of derision in some quarters of the coaching community. Coaches, though, did not read it and fling open their playbooks. The status quo seemed as immovable as a 350-pound offensive tackle.But statistics compiled by Brian Burke of AdvancedNFLstats.comindicate that while the rate of 2-point conversion attempts and onside kicks was unchanged from 2000 to 2008, offenses passed up the punt to try for the conversion on 12.4 percent of fourth downs. In 2009, the rate was 14.5 percent.Conversion attempt numbers vary from year to year based on the number of opportunities and variations in circumstances, but the increase in 2009 encompassed nearly all field positions, Burke said, and the average to-go distances were no different from those for the rest of the decade. Interestingly, the rate of attempts in the first three quarters of games — when principle was presumably driving the decision more than panic — rose to 9.8 percent in 2009 from 7.4 percent earlier in the decade.Still, Belichick, who earned an economics degree, shrugs off many statistics, holding his hands at incrementally greater distances to indicate that creating a blanket rule for going for it on fourth-and-1 will not work because the distance for the first down ranges from an inch to almost 2 yards. Coaches also take into consideration a range of factors, including the footing, which players are hurt and their trust in the defense. The former Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, for instance, said he always felt comfortable going for it on fourth-and-goal from 1 or 2 yards because he had a virtual human bulldozer in Larry Csonka.Though Belichick does not adhere to a formula, his play-calling penchants were influenced by the time he spent watching Wayne Hardin coach Navy in the early 1960s. Belichick was not yet a teenager, but he remembers Hardin’s try-to-score philosophy, which apparently made a by-any-means-necessary impression on a boy who surprised an opponent 40 years later by intentionally taking a safety to change field position.“I don’t know what’s usual or unusual,” Belichick said. “As a coach, you just try to win, whatever way there is. If you win and run the ball 70 times, there’s nothing wrong with that.”There is, though, an undeniable benefit some coaches cite when considering unorthodox plays. When Tomlin was a defensive assistant on Gruden’s 2005 staff, he stood on the sideline while the Buccaneers scored with a minute left in the game to pull to 1 point behind Washington. The Redskins were called for a penalty during the extra-point attempt. Gruden, burdened by losses in the Buccaneers’ previous two games, tried for the 2-point conversion and the win instead of settling for a nearly certain tie. Mike Alstott ran the ball in for a victory whose ripple effect reached Pittsburgh.“It was electric,” Tomlin said. “That was one of those moments I’ll never forget. I admired the belief, the fact that he didn’t ponder the potential aftermath. It left an impression on me.”Now, Tomlin acknowledges that unorthodox calls have a place in his playbook because in the era of parity, many games are determined by one play or the momentum it generates. He takes risks, he said, not just because the one play might offer the best chance of success, but also because “it has the potential to be inspirational when they know you’ll go to any lengths to win, even if it’s far outside the box.”That raises the question of why coaches are still not taking more risks, almost a decade after Romer’s analysis and with the potential for immediate and long-term gains. Why, for instance, were only eight surprise onside kicks attempted last season, although Burke’s analysis showed that from 2000 to 2008, when teams were likely to win given the score and the time remaining and they attempted the surprise kick, the recovery rate was 60 percent?“That, to me, has been a puzzle,” Romer said of the play calling. “One possible answer is that these are difficult decisions, and a lot of our gut instinct is to be cautious, so they err on the side of not taking enough risks even though they’re trying their hardest to win.“Another possible answer is that despite all statements about winning being everything, they actually have preferences not just about the outcome of the game, but about how they get there. It feels more like winning by luck if you put everything on one play. But if you punt the ball away and send the defense to do their job and stop the other team on a full set of downs, it feels like it’s more under your control.”Perhaps so. But even coaches with an aggressive streak wonder how much further they are willing to go on the risk-reward continuum. The Jets’ offensive coordinator, Brian Schottenheimer, who went for it on fourth-and-1 from San Diego’s 29 while holding a 3-point lead with one minute to go in an A.F.C. divisional playoff game last season, conceded that he watched the Super Bowl and did not know if he would have had the nerve to try an onside kick like the Saints’.For Romer, the desire to win will eventually overcome coaches’ caution.“If your offense got better and their offense got better, would you want to reconsider your decisions?” he said. “Unless a coach is insane, he’s going to reconsider. But that doesn’t mean he’s making riskier decisions. Before, not going for it on fourth-and-1 was incredibly cautious. Now, it’s not going for it on fourth-and-2 that’s incredibly cautious. I’ve always thought that in the long run, the evidence of what’s the best way to win is going to win out. I don’t see how it can’t. But it certainly doesn’t look like we’re seeing a rapid change.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','This year, the Open also renewed all of its main sponsorships with companies that include Citizen, Heineken and Wilson. The Open also added six new sponsors, including Esurance, Starwood Hotels, Panasonic and Mercedes-Benz, which replaced Lexus.Net sponsorship revenue rose 6 percent this year to more than $60 million, a record. The Open did this without raising its sponsorship prices, said Harlan Stone, the chief business and marketing officer at the U.S.T.A., which hosts the event. Stone said he expected sponsorships to grow further in 2011.“Many business leaders might be reducing the overall number of events they sponsor, but instead are focusing on the best events and doing more with fewer events, and we’re the beneficiary of that trend,” Stone said.Over all, the United States Open generates about $120 million, about 80 percent of the U.S.T.A.’s revenue.Like many other sponsors, Esurance chose to advertise at the Open because the event is so well attended, but also because it is watched on television by relatively wealthier consumers. The company, which sells car insurance, has typically attracted younger consumers who take care of their finances online.But Esurance wanted to reach older Americans who have more recently started using the Internet to take care of their household needs. When Massachusetts Mutual ended its sponsorship, the Open approached Esurance, which signed on after being promised that it would be one of the six companies with courtside signs at Arthur Ashe Stadium.“For us, it’s a good way to reach new audiences,” said Darren Howard, the vice president for marketing of Esurance, which previously took sponsorships for teams in San Francisco, where the company has its headquarters. “Tennis was a great sport to reach different audiences.”In some ways, the Open has become so large that it has overshadowed the rest of the tennis calendar. The U.S. Open Series, a string of tournaments leading to the Open in New York, has helped create some drama. Attendance at the ATP World Tour events has also risen, but television viewership is not as strong.“What tennis perhaps lacks domestically is the public’s consciousness the other 50 weeks of the year,” said Paul Swangard, the managing director of the Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon School of Business. “When the tour travels to Shanghai, I don’t think the sport gets the same kind of lift.”And despite the success of the Open, event organizers are always at the mercy of the weather, player injuries and specific matchups. Attendance dipped by more than 20,000 fans in 2006 because of inclement weather.The lack of a top-ranked American man in the tournament, Andy Roddick’s loss and the absence of Serena Williams, the No. 1-ranked woman, have hurt ticket resales. The average resale price of tickets for second-round matches on Day 4 of the tournament fell 39 percent this year compared with last year, according to FanSnap.com, which monitors activity on dozens of online ticket resellers.“Prices are down across the board, and the Roddick loss looks to be at least part of it,” said Christian Anderson, a spokesman for FanSnap. “As the Americans go, so too do U.S. Open tickets.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','His father, the 1989 ARCA champion, sees his son’s treatment as a form of hazing.“It seems like you’re a kid going to high school and you’ve got to take your initiations to make them happy,” Bob Keselowski said.Keselowski has repeatedly made it clear he is no pushover. His first knock on that imaginary door came at Talladega Superspeedway last year when he pushed Edwards toward the finish line and did not lift when Edwards tried to block his pass for the win. Edwards went airborne, upside down, sheet metal spewing in his wake as his car sailed into the safety fence in a scary crash, while Keselowski grabbed his first Cup victory in only his fifth start in Nascar’s top series.After Keselowski collided again with Edwards early in the March race at Atlanta, Edwards retaliated by intentionally wrecking Keselowski, sending him airborne.Now, they are on probation for the remainder of the season because of a frightening accident on the last lap of a Nationwide race at Gateway International Raceway in mid-July. Edwards intentionally drove into the back of Keselowski on the last lap seconds after Keselowski had made contact in a pass for the lead. Edwards won the race, leaving Keselowski’s Dodge in tatters in a chain-reaction crash that included nine other cars.“I talked to Brad the other day. I said, ‘Why does everybody think they owe you a payback?’ ” Bob Keselowski said. “I look back at the racing and I don’t know why they feel Brad has something coming.”Keselowski also angered Busch in the Nationwide race at Bristol two weeks ago while the two were racing for the lead. Busch intentionally spun him and went on to win the race. Keselowski finished 14th.Busch celebrated that win by mockingly rubbing his eyes like a crying baby and was greeted with a chorus of boos. Keselowski promised revenge over the public address system and had some choice words for Busch the next day during driver introductions for the Cup race.“There’s always been give and take in the sport,” he said. “I don’t mind give and take, but you have to know when give and take makes sense. In that same race when Kyle and I had a run-in, I let him go twice when he moved me up the racetrack. It was because of that that I didn’t let him go the third time.“It’s like, ‘Well, Brad never gives.’ I gave and I was tired of giving. There was no more give left in me. The bank was dry.”Probation seems to be having a positive effect on Edwards and Keselowski. They joked about each other in separate news media sessions at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve before Sunday’s Nationwide race.“On the racetrack, I think we’re better,” Edwards said. “All of our issues have just been on the racetrack. I think I see a little bit more respect there, but time will tell.”With the Nationwide season winding down, Keselowski, barring a total collapse, is closing in on his first Nascar title. Edwards, the 2007 series champion, is 365 points behind him in second place with 10 races remaining.“He’ll be excited, and he should be because he accomplished something really nice,” the Nascar driver and TV commentator Kenny Wallace said. “To me, it’s not Brad trying to win the championship, it’s Brad against Carl. I think these guys take advantage of each other. Every once in a while they say, ‘You’re not going to do that to me. I’m going to get you back.’ And then, all of a sudden, it becomes part of the show.“I will tell you this. What Brad Keselowski and Carl Edwards and Kyle Busch are doing for this sport right now, they should be paid for it. It’s awesome.”'"

"'10-09-05,'0','THE Jedediah Hawkins Inn in Jamesport caused a stir when it first opened on the North Fork in the summer of 2006. This stylish, refurbished 1863 sea captain’s house was a beauty, and the kitchen of its restaurant, called Jedediah’s, was run by Tom Schaudel, one of the island’s best known and most respected chefs.Mr. Schaudel left in 2008, as did his co-chef, Michael Ross; the inn closed in December 2009. It reopened in May with a new co-owner and chef, Keith Luce. The inn’s restaurant is now called Luce & Hawkins.Mr. Luce, a native of Jamesport, is returning to Long Island with an impressive résumé. Most recently the executive chef at the Herbfarm, outside Seattle, he was a sous-chef in the White House during the first Clinton administration and won a James Beard Foundation award as a Rising Star chef when he was at Spruce restaurant in Chicago (since closed).Diners familiar with Jedediah’s will notice changes at Luce & Hawkins. The two formal dining areas (the living room and dining room of the house) are now less formal. The white tablecloths are gone; tables are bare with placemats and cloth napkins. A former porch has been enclosed and now has a glass roof and marble tables, cafe chairs and two couches. I think I like this room best, because here you can watch the kitchen staff rushing out to the inn’s large garden for ultra-fresh ingredients.Keith Luce’s food is an eye-opener. This is not the usual Long Island fare. Take the appetizer called pastrami-cured bluefish mini open-faced Reubens, a tongue-in-cheek rendition of the famous sandwich: three tiny sandwiches with caraway-seeded rye supporting layers of Gruyère, sauerkraut and housemade Russian dressing along with the bluefish. They were tasty bites. Another unusual opener was flatbread topped with Moroccan spices, onions and garlic, paired with a ramekin holding an oven-roasted tomato-eggplant-garlic spread.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','MILLIE PERKINS read Anne Frank’s diary for the first time as she flew cross-country more than 50 years ago to audition for the role of Anne.“It just hit me in my heart,” said Ms. Perkins, 74. Until then, she had been reluctant to leave her successful modeling career, she said in a telephone interview from her Hollywood home, even though the film’s director, George Stevens, had been pursuing her for the project. This time, she accepted the part in “The Diary of Anne Frank,” the movie based on the Jewish girl in Amsterdam who hid from the Nazis starting at age 13 and died in a concentration camp at 15.On Tuesday, Ms. Perkins will speak about her experiences after a screening at the Cinema Arts Center in Huntington.Jud Newborn, who consults as special projects curator for the cinema and who organized the event, remembers seeing Ms. Perkins in the 1959 movie when he was growing up in Plainview.“Her portrayal of Anne Frank was so sensitive and touching,” he said.Dr. Newborn, 57, who was the founding historian and co-creator of the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, said the movie was “the first significant postwar film to inscribe in popular consciousness” the suffering of Europe’s Jews at the hands of the Nazis.Also, he said, in the 1950s survivors and their relatives rarely spoke about the Holocaust, a term not yet in wide use. “The film helped break the silence,” he said.Ms. Perkins, who grew up in Fair Lawn, N.J., said that interest in the film had grown in recent years. She traveled to Israel last year to speak about it and is scheduled to visit Germany soon. “People want to have feelings about things,” she said. “Today’s entertainment is not about touching your heart, making you care about people.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','The New York Mets lost their closer Francisco Rodriguez, a k a K-Rod, to season-ending surgery on a torn thumb ligament last month. But really the Mets lost him to two simple words: “man up.” According to The New York Daily News, that’s what Carlos Peña, the father of Rodriguez’s girlfriend, told him outside the Mets clubhouse, inciting an altercation that led to K-Rod busting his thumb and getting arrested on third-degree-assault charges for good measure.While man up may have served as fighting words for Rodriguez, the exhortation is taking on many guises in American popular culture right now. Advertisers courting young male consumers are spreading the manly message. The Web site for the No Fear energy drink smacks the “Man Up” slogan across the screen, accompanied by an aggressive rock soundtrack. Meanwhile, Miller Lite has been running television commercials featuring a voice-over that growls, “Man up, because if you’re drinking a light beer without great pilsner taste, you’re missing the point of drinking beer.” (Light beer ads often amp up the masculinity, perhaps to compensate for their watered-down product.)But man up isn’t just being used to package machismo as a commodity. Its spectrum of meanings runs from “Don’t be a sissy; toughen up” all the way to “Do the right thing; be a mensch,” to use the Yiddishism for an honorable or upright person. The Man Up Campaign, for instance, is a new global initiative that engages youth to stop gender-based violence: “Our call to action challenges each of us to ‘man up’ and declare that violence against women and girls must end,” its mission statement reads.Not too long ago, man up was simply an alternative to the verb man, in the sense of “to supply with adequate manpower.” (Staff or staff up would be the more politically correct choices nowadays.) The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1947 letter to the editor of The Times of London from Henry Strauss, a Conservative member of Parliament, complaining about man up as an insidious Americanism. “Must industries be fully ‘manned up’ rather than ‘manned’?” Strauss asked. “Must the strong, simple transitive verb, which is one of the main glories of our tongue, become as obsolete in England as it appears to be in America?”Strauss might have thought of man up as less than virile, but phrasal verbs with up have filled a wide variety of roles in both British and American English. Up gets used for literal upward movement (lift up, stand up) or more figuratively to indicate greater intensity (stir up, fire up) or completion of an act (drink up, burn up). It’s particularly handy for blunt imperatives calling for resolute action: think of wake up!, grow up!, hurry up! and put up or shut up!'"
"'10-09-05,'0','Up past 98th Street is 788 West End Avenue, a more modest house built in 1896 as part of a long-gone row. The architect, John G. Prague, developed a peculiar bow-fronted design with a recessed mansard roof. The developer and builder, Peter Brennan, lived there with his family into the 1920s.Like the Jaros house, the Brennan house was converted to apartments, but although the exterior is in good condition, little remains inside. In 1979 it was bought by Hilario Villavicencio, who was living there. Some time later he began an unusual campaign of decoration, picking out existing exterior details in high color and adding others.Thus, floral ornament and dragon heads are highlighted in brick red, gold and forest green. Mr. Villavicencio also took a woman’s head from a statue and mounted it on the second floor, giving her golden hair, bright red lips and a white hat.“I try to make something alive, something different, “ Mr. Villavicencio said in a voice resonant of his native Cuba. “But some people they don’t like it; they say it looks like a circus. Hey, you can’t please everyone.”His artistic efforts blaspheme every commandment in the preservation bible, which is why it is one of the most delicious sights on West End. But he better hurry with his latest project, which is to replace one of his dragon heads — salvaged off a school building — with a whole dragon, holding a shield and also painted, because landmark designation for West End appears to be coming in the near future.Two blocks away, east of West End, is No. 233 West 100th Street, which went up as a private house in 1889. But it was auctioned in 1894 and became the Red Cross Hospital. On May 12, 1898, The New York Sun reported that volunteers were packing sulfur powders there for battlefield use in the Spanish-American War; the lecture that afternoon was “Bandaging.”After the war the house was sold to the Nameoki Club, called the “little wigwam” of Tammany Hall by The New York Times in 1932. Later the ground floor was built out for shopfronts, and by the 1970s the building was occupied only by two stores, the whole a shambling near-wreck. It was soon rescued by John D. Kuhns and his wife, Rosemary, who gradually renovated it for their own residence. Over the last several years further renovation work by a new owner has resulted in a new bell-shape tower, made out of standing seam copper, a striking piece of metal work, although the original roofing was slate.Back at 266 West End, the owner says, restoration hardware arrived unbidden on his doorstep. Some time ago someone knocked on the door and handed him a brown cardboard box, saying that it was “the wish of a dying man” that the contents be returned, having been stolen years ago.“It was packed in newspapers from the 1970s,” the owner said, “a wild-looking bronze Neptune head a foot high that was originally on the front door — you can still see the shadow.”'"
"'10-09-05,'0','Not long ago it would have been inconceivable that Allan Sherman would ever seem timely or topical again. In the early 1960s, after a failed career as a television producer, he became the pudgy king of Borscht Belt-style song parodies, setting yuks about suburbia and clichés of Jewish life to the tunes of “Streets of Laredo” and “Frère Jacques.” His high point came in 1963, when his song “Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh! (A Letter From Camp)” reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, though irrelevance and obscurity soon followed, and Sherman died in 1973. But in the wake of “Mad Men,” nothing from the Kennedy era looks the same, and Sherman’s albums — his eight original collections on Warner Brothers Records are being reissued Tuesday on the Collectors’ Choice label — can be read as both lighthearted crowd pleasers and glimpses into a culture of rat-race conformity. He even sounds like a young Don Draper in “When I Was a Lad” from the album “My Son, the Celebrity,” in which Sherman, in his flat sing-speak, describes ladder climbing at an advertising firm: “I learned who was going out with whom, and who had the keys to the powder room/For the key to the powder room, you see, is the key to the structure of the agency.”For decades ham radio operators have been puzzled and bewitched by what they called “numbers stations”: mysterious shortwave signals with staticky noise loops and numerical codes delivered in eerily robotic voices. Dozens of them — broadcasting in English, Russian, Chinese, you name it, though they never state their origin — have been identified by amateurs who believe these stations transmit top-secret messages to spies. (A four-CD set, “The Conet Project,” released in 1997, collected 150 clips, one of which — a female voice saying, “yankee hotel foxtrot” — was borrowed by Wilco.) One of the most peculiar numbers stations is UVB-76, also known as “the buzzer,” which since at least the early 1980s has been emitting a steady, pulselike honk, with extremely rare vocal interruptions in Russian. Last month UVB-76 turned chatty again, and Web conspiracy theorists have been excitedly parsing the station’s few words (a series of numbers and Russian given names), wondering about military coordinates and errant television signals. But the hunt is always more thrilling than the find, and listening to UVB-76’s electronic foghorn fading in and out (you can follow a Web “repeater” stream at uvb-76.blogspot.com) is an addictive exercise for the imagination, like waiting for contact from another planet.It’s easy to spot the influences in “The Soft Wave” (Smalltown Supersound), the second album that Alexis Georgopoulos, a New York-by-way-of-San Francisco electronic musician, has recorded under the name Arp. There are the bright analog keyboards and bouncy lunar gravity of “Autobahn”-era Kraftwerk; Brian Eno’s lightly layered sonic textures; and, in the aptly named “White Light,” slices of the Velvet Underground’s guitars in clean, deceptively calm mode. But Arp’s vision is too broad to be a mere retro gimmick. Using those elements — as well as some judiciously placed piano, flute and even vocals — as building blocks, Mr. Georgopoulos creates enormous sound structures that, as they slowly unfold, become essays on scale. The two-part, nine-minute “Pastoral Symphony” begins with a simple keyboard pattern that repeats like a little engine as a star of analog synthesizers and overdriven electric guitar goes loudly supernova all around it; the explosion then implodes, another reassuring bass line emerges, and order is restored. Kraftwerk never dreamed so big.If you were to guess what an album by Radiohead’s drummer would sound like, you’d be forgiven for imagining a tangled forest of half-electronic beats. But “Familial” (Nonesuch), Philip Selway’s solo debut, is more like a warm, delicate nest. Surrounded by pastoral acoustic guitars and whisper-level electronics, Mr. Selway — who wrote all the songs and farmed most of the drumming out to Glenn Kotche of Wilco — sings in a breathy, almost maternally soft voice about seeking peace and raising children. “I want to show you another way/I want to keep you from my mistakes,” he tells a young son in “The Ties That Bind Us.” There are hints of danger and confusion — and whiffs of Thom Yorke’s falsetto — in the album’s second song, “Beyond Reason,” but by the next he is on a more direct path: “We’ll turn out the lights/We just want a simple life.”Any potential suitors, beware: treat Sharon Van Etten right or she will compose a song that spells out her feelings in waves of smoldering harmonies, the kind that usually indicate the rawest kind of honesty. On “One Day,” the first single from her coming album, “Epic” (Ba Da Bing), she tries to outmaneuver a tentative lover by standing steadily by him, the track’s tambourine and twangy guitar invoking you-and-me-babe late-’60s country-folk. Elsewhere on the album she recalls being chained to an addict’s wall “like a dog.” Like Jenn Wasner of Wye Oak or her fellow Brooklynite Holly Miranda, Ms. Van Etten has an incandescent, moaning alto that can be fragile or vengeful. Reserving some of the harshest words for herself, she swears, “To say the things I want to say to you would be a crime.” But she says them anyway.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','The boutique Radisson Blu hotel, Radisson’s first property in Spain, opened in December with 54 rooms in an elegant neo-Classical building in front of the Prado in Madrid. Designed by Sandra Tarruella and Isabel Lopez, the team behind some of the chicest restaurants in Barcelona and Madrid, the décor throughout is a study of steely grays and neutral wood tones, enlivened with rich purple or deep red upholstery on chairs and throw pillows. The reception desk shares the lobby with a glam whisky bar, and the Cask restaurant serves a buffet breakfast and features a market-driven menu for lunch and dinner.In the heart of the city’s densest cultural quarter, the Prado is mere steps away; the Thyssen-Bornemisza and Reina Sofía museums are a few minutes’ walk. Historic theaters, bars, restaurants and offbeat antiques shops of the bohemian Barrio de las Letras line the surrounding streets. The upscale shopping and business districts are just up the Paseo del Prado.My interior room with king bed was blissfully quiet. The bed’s fluffy comforter and oversize pillows were cloudlike but not so overstuffed as to make it difficult to turn over without waking up. The dominant design feature was a photomural of iconic Madrid buildings, which covered the wall behind the bed and the closet doors. There were a couple of drawbacks: the air-conditioner was aimed at the door instead of the room, and it was easier just to unplug a floor lamp than to disable its dim “nightlight” feature.Handsome and smart, the bathrooms were clad in matte gray tiles that feel like stone; they are neither slippery nor icy cold underfoot. The backlighted mirrors were flattering, and the large showers had terrific water pressure. The four corner suites had separate bathtubs.The hotel offers free Wi-Fi, which, paired with the plentiful accessible outlets in the room, makes for easy laptop use. The small, cardio-only gym in the basement and the spa have fairly extensive hours: 6 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. The spa pool’s powerful massage jets will blast away any postflight aches. Business Room rates include ironing of three garments upon arrival and one garment each day thereafter. The rooms contain espresso machines, and the minibar includes local treats like acorn-fed jamón ibérico (18.50 euros, or $23 at $1.24 to the euro).In a neighborhood full of great tapas bars, it’s hard to imagine staying in, but the limited 24-hour in-room dining options include a steak with fries and savory snacks like a small truffle-infused grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich (12 euros) or a mini tortilla española with aioli (10 euros). These last two were at my door 10 minutes after ordering.Though situated amid tourist attractions, this is an ideal business hotel. A standard room is a bargain at rates beginning at 120 euros ($150). The corner suites, starting at 280 euros, have spacious living rooms and an extra half-bath, making a terrific space for small meetings.'"
"'10-09-05,'0','A STUNNING Italian blonde — a real Renaissance beauty — has been turning heads in Madrid this summer, seemingly unperturbed by the heat despite the long sleeves and heavy layers of her richly brocaded dress.Her name is Giovanna degli Albizzi Tornabuoni and she died in 1488, but her portrait by the Renaissance master Domenico Ghirlandaio is the centerpiece of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum’s big summer exhibition “Ghirlandaio and Renaissance Florence,” on view through Oct. 10 (Paso del Prado 8; 34-91-369-0151; www.museothyssen.org; exhibition admission 7 euros, about $9 at $1.24 to the euro). The show places the museum’s beloved portrait, commissioned by Giovanna’s grieving husband after her death at 19 (while pregnant with their second child) in the context of other Renaissance paintings, drawings, prayer books and related works. The idea is to look at the aristocratic trappings of love, matrimony and religion in 15th-century Florence.But in 21st-century Madrid, Giovanna’s eternal beauty and allure are not to be confined by museum walls, at least not if the Thyssen gift shop has anything to say about it. The museum has developed an extraordinary range of Giovanna-ware (ceramic dishes, vases and mugs) to Giovanna-wear (T-shirts, hair combs, jewelry) that give the Florentine noblewoman a common touch. She can be spotted promenading around the city — on the small vinyl bags (4.50 euros) and bright orange umbrellas (36 euros).In the painting, Ghirlandaio portrays Giovanna in profile, elaborately coiffed and dressed and posed before a niche displaying a few well-chosen accouterments that indicate her faith and social position: a prayer book, a strand of coral beads and other precious jewelry. On the surface, it’s hardly a mother lode of merchandizing opportunities, but Ana Cela, director of the museum shop and publications, said that even a restrained masterpiece such as this can inspire clever product designs.“Some museum shops are strictly limited to the basics: catalogs, a few prints and postcards. We have more leeway here, so I try to find a range of exclusive but interesting and useful products,” she said gesturing toward a display of bracelets, pendants and earrings made of natural horn carved in swirls and vine patterns (47.20 to 118 euros).'"

"'10-09-06,'0','“We were able to demonstrate that quite a few people can paddle the falls in a manner that’s responsible, that provides a level of safety that ultimately the park was able to get some level of comfort around,” said Mark Singleton, the group’s executive director.The policy barring boaters from the falls had been in place since the late 1960s, when the area was developed as a state park and whitewater kayaking was a relatively obscure sport. But as the sport has grown, so has the appetite of paddlers eager to run waterfalls like the one in Ohiopyle.“The skill level of whitewater boaters has gotten so good in the last two decades,” Mr. Singleton said. While boaters had been running the falls illegally at night, the park’s new plan, he said, “puts it into the daylight, makes it manageable.”In the past, the relationship between boaters and park officials was “openly hostile,” he said, but management changes in recent years have altered that.“A lot has changed in 40 years,” said Jim Juran, the park’s manager. Still, Mr. Juran said, “people need to respect the river.” He added, “People don’t understand that a couple feet of water can knock you down and drag you under.”Since the early 1970s, more than 20 people have died in whitewater boating accidents on the river, which is popular for rafting trips, but none have died on the falls, Mr. Juran said.Under the new rules, rafts will still not be allowed to go over the falls, Ms. Faust said.Since the start of the one-day festivals, paddlers have hurtled over the falls about 15,000 times, said Barry Adams, an American Whitewater volunteer who helps organize the annual event.The park’s new policy has attracted hundreds more in recent weeks. More than 300 boaters ran the falls in the week after the park opened access on Aug. 22.On Saturday, kayakers in brightly colored vessels started early, aiming their bows over the falls and soaring through the air momentarily before bouncing and bobbing in a frothy pool below. Some performed tricks along the way.“I don’t think I’d be doing this if it weren’t for the adrenaline rush,” said Kenny Erskine, a carpenter from Fulton, Md., as he prepared to carry his boat to a launch point above the falls.As waterfalls go, Ohiopyle’s is relatively safe and easy for experienced paddlers, said Mr. Erskine, who is also a kayaking instructor. “This is a friendly fall,” he said.But for Pam Robson, 47, a college counselor from Clinton Township, Mich., who stood with other spectators on an observation deck above the falls, the journey through jutting rocks and churning water looked anything but easy.“I think it’s crazy,” she said after five kayakers went over the falls, one by one. “I’m amazed they all just did that. It takes amazing courage.”'"
"'10-09-06,'0','“Some advocate groups would like us to leave the horses out there and let nature take its course,” said Bob Abbey, director of the bureau. “We don’t believe that’s a sound option.”The debate over roundups dates back decades, to the passage of the 1971 Wild Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act, a federal law that protected what was then a faltering wild horse population and made it illegal for cowboys like Mr. Cattoor to round up horses on their own for sport or profit.“A cowboy really wasn’t a cowboy if you didn’t rope a wild horse,” Mr. Cattoor said. “But they stopped that. They stopped the maintenance, which costs nothing, and turned it into a multimillion-dollar deal. It’s crazy.”Questions about the roundups have intensified in recent years as costs have mounted, both in dollars and in dead horses. Seven horses have died in the current operation, and last winter, a roundup in Nevada resulted in over 100 horse deaths, prompting more than 50 members of Congress to ask Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to look for independent analysis of the bureau’s Wild Horse and Burro Program. Late last month, the bureau did just that, asking the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a technical review of the program.Horses that are captured are offered for adoption, but with demand for horses low and the cost of feed high, the government often ends up quartering them on large private ranches, primarily in Kansas and Oklahoma. In 2009, about 70 percent of the entire program’s $40.6 million budget was spent holding 34,500 horses and burros, a system that the Government Accountability Office has concluded will “overwhelm the program” if not controlled.“They are a symbol of the American West,” said Nathaniel Messer, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Missouri and a former member of the federal Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Committee. “But do we need 35,000 symbols of the American West?”For critics like Deniz Bolbol, the pattern of roundup, removal and stockpiling is an example of the bureau’s catering to private interests on public lands, namely by favoring livestock ranchers — who pay the government for the right to graze and who can sell their animals — over wild horses, which cannot be sold for slaughter.“We remove wild horses from the public lands so private livestock can graze, and then we ship the wild horses to private ranchers in the Midwest where we stockpile them and pay private ranchers,” said Ms. Bolbol, a spokeswoman for the group In Defense of Animals, which has sued to stop the roundups. “This is what you call a racket.”And while Mr. Cattoor calls Ms. Bolbol and other protesters “fanatics,” he does not think the government’s reliance on big, periodic roundups makes much sense either, saying the bureau needs more steady maintenance of the wild herds, which can double in size every four years.Perhaps the only other thing the two sides can agree on is that the horses — whose estimated populations range from about 120 in New Mexico to more than 17,000 in Nevada — are magnificent. Art DiGrazia, the operations chief for one of the bureau’s wild horse and burro offices in California, said that some of the mustangs on the range were descended from Army cavalry horses, which were bred for size, speed and strength and left here or given to ranchers.“They have the intelligence and endurance to work out in this country,” said Mr. DiGrazia, a bearded New Jersey native who speaks in a hoarse whisper. “They’ll know before you know that there’s something out there going on.”The method of capture is simple: horses are located from helicopters, which have been used in roundups since the mid-1970s, and pushed toward the trap site, essentially a funnel shaped by two netted walls that lead into a temporary corral. Once the herd runs into the funnel, Mr. Cattoor lets loose a so-called Judas horse, which is trained to lead the rest into the trap, where — uncombed, unshod and often stomping and biting — they slowly settle into their new lives as kept animals.All of which is more humane than the old days, said Mr. Cattoor, who recalls cowboys using rope and brawn to bring in a herd, often injuring horses and horsemen alike.“You have to really put the pound on them,” he said. “You’d have to get them sore footed and tired, and there’s a lot of problems with getting them really tired. Today, at this point, this is the best we can do.”One recent morning, Mr. Cattoor and his team conducted several successful runs — 10 horses in one, a handful in another — before a small herd of four horses, their black manes and wild tails flying, came running full-tilt across the desert. The helicopter was close on their heels, whipping up curlicues of dust in the horses’ wake.They were headed straight for the trap, when suddenly the herd broke, with three horses escaping across a field, while a single stallion — the leader — galloped in another direction. The pilot, perhaps 50 feet up, chose to follow the larger group, but horse sense had its way; the three headed into a patch of trees, where helicopters cannot pursue. The stallion, meanwhile, disappeared up a ridge and back into the wild.Mr. Cattoor watched it all, standing near his Judas horse with a resigned smile, as roundup opponents watched happily from a public viewing station several hundred feet away.“These wild horse advocates love it when the horse beats the helicopter,” Mr. Cattoor said. “And they do sometimes win.”'"
"'10-09-06,'0','“For some reason, I kept leaving every putt just a few inches short when I shot the 72,” Ogilvy said.So what did he change?“Started hitting my putts just a little harder,” he said with a snicker. “I don’t know what else to say. As I said, the mysteries of golf.”Ogilvy, 33, is a distinctive presence on the PGA Tour, a thoughtful Australian with an engaging wit and a natural gift for conversation. Even as he was winning seven tour events from 2005 to last January, he often seemed unobserved in the golf stratosphere of Tiger and Phil. He certainly does not draw attention to himself. On Sunday, he wore plain, all-black shoes, black cotton pants without a crease and a gray shirt with a small logo on the sleeve and a wrinkled collar.If his dress is basic, his goals are advanced and lofty, despite this season’s difficulties.“I think playing poorly for this long a period has perhaps reinspired me to get back to where I was,” he said. “I’ve always known that golf is hard, but this is the first year that it has been really, really hard for me.”And Ogilvy says he thinks he knows why: it comes down to not enough time off. His playing schedule has included European and PGA Tour appearances, which he said wore on him. In February, he and his wife, Juli, had their third child in four years.“I haven’t had more than two weeks off in three years and I played too much at the end of last year, so it’s like I never had an off-season,” Ogilvy said. “Having a third child was great, of course, but it means you have other responsibilities and priorities beside golf. I think it became like a perfect storm, and my golf never recovered.“I mean, strange things have happened. Missing three straight cuts at the majors — that’s pretty peculiar for me.”He recalled that at this year’s United States Open, he had a stretch of eight holes where he was eight over par. “How do you explain that?” he said.Ogilvy says he plans to take an extended break after the Tour Championship this month — if he qualifies for that event.“Hopefully, I’ll finish out well the rest of the month,” he said. “And then I’m looking forward to a long, restful break. That’s what you need to do to play well across a long season and long summer. I feel certain that will help. That’s the plan, anyway.”'"
"'10-09-06,'0','The winners are ranked on the page based on a formula that includes how much the bidder is willing to pay per click, the quality of the ad, the relevancy of the ad and the quality of the landing page, among other criteria.A marketer pays Google when the someone clicks on an ad. The cost per click depends on the amount of money needed to retain that position, the time of day, the region, the keyword and other variables.Mr. Carlson says he monitors the performance of his search campaigns about three or four times a day to determine which keywords are leading the most people to click on an ad. If a keyword is ineffective, Mr. Carlson drops it.“Our costs have gone up to acquire the customers over the past few weeks with all this hysteria,” he said. Mr. Carlson says he spends 80 cents to a dollar for every click on one of his ads, regardless of whether a customer buys his product, and about $100,000 to $150,000 a month on search advertising on Google.But Mr. Carlson is not the only one bidding on bedbug-related search terms, which is where the competition gets hot.“Our customers have figured out that search advertising is a great place to capture their target consumer,” said Sam Sebastian, Google’s director of classifieds and local advertising. “You can put your message in front of them right at that time when they’re most interested and when there’s an immediate need.”Companies use search advertising as a way to generate leads for new business and to get people to come to their Web sites. With more people fearing a bedbug infestation, however, many companies are seeing fewer leads for business and more people clicking on their ads in search of information, increasing the amount of money they spend on their campaigns each day.Ruben Quinones, 33, director of sales and social media for Path Interactive, a digital advertising agency in New York City that provides services to a handful of pest control companies, called the bedbug search environment over the last few weeks “ridiculously competitive.”Richard Calandrino, 41, one of Mr. Quinones’s clients, says he works with Mr. Quinones because managing search advertising in real time is challenging. “It’s a full-time job,” said Mr. Calandrino, who started a Web site called bedbugs-nyc.com a few weeks ago in response to the growing number of cases in New York. “It’s got the biggest problem in the nation,” he said.Mr. Calandrino owns a pest control company he runs from his home in Austin, Tex., called the Rat Patrol of New York, with locations in seven cities including Chicago and Houston.Of the competition for search terms in the last few weeks, he said: “It’s been a huge increase, and it’s become more expensive per click. It was four dollars a click, and it’s six dollars a click right now.”Mr. Calandrino says search advertising is the only type he uses because he can see the return on his investment. He now gets about 100 clicks and 6 to 10 calls a day about bedbugs, with all of the callers finding him online.A few years ago, Mr. Calandrino said he would spend an average of $60,000 on a full-page ad in the Yellow Pages in one city; he now spends that much on digital advertising that serves multiple cities.One of the largest pest control companies, Terminix, reported a marked increase in bedbug-related search traffic in the last two weeks.Edmund Mackey, director of digital strategy and marketing for Terminix, said that in response to the spike in queries for information about bedbugs, the company had changed its advertising messages to use terms that reflected that trend.Terminix, which is owned by ServiceMaster, also experienced a 30 percent increase in bedbug-related searches on mobile devices in the last two weeks compared with mobile traffic during the previous four weeks.“This spike is an anomaly driven by the infestation,” said Mr. Mackey, adding that the company spent $1.50 to $8 a click depending on where its search ads were positioned. Search advertising represents 60 to 75 percent of the company’s total digital advertising budget, he said.'"
"'10-09-06,'0','“I might be a little nervous,” Querrey said. “A lot of it is mental. Those guys are strong in their head, and they don’t give away free points. A lot of it is skill. I mean, Federer hits those ’tweener shots at will. I can’t do that.”Indeed, the 20th-seeded Querrey is not spoken of in the same league as superstars like the second-seeded Roger Federer. But he and Isner have at least asserted themselves as the faces of a changing of the guard in the United States, no small feat itself. Querrey came into the Open with four titles this year, second only to the world No. 1 Rafael Nadal’s five; Isner has won once and made the finals three other times.And although Roddick, the 2003 Open champion, may be synonymous with men’s tennis in the United States, Querrey and Isner are gaining on him.It was Querrey who took the biggest stride Sunday.On another gusty day, Querrey sometimes had the wind in his face, but it did not seem to matter, given the partisan crowd that was firmly behind him. It included a group of young men whose chants of “Sam! Sam! Sam!” seemed to throw Almagro off his game as much as anything served up by Querrey, whose 19 aces included one that whizzed by Almagro at 137 miles per hour.Querrey had 42 winners against 29 unforced errors and was not broken on his serve.“I just hung in there on his service games and played well,” he said.Isner could not match his performance in the evening, however. For one thing, he was surprised just to be playing here: he injured his ankle at Cincinnati last month and did not get medical clearance to play in the Open until a few days before the tournament was to begin.His ankle did not prove much of a problem Sunday, nor did his serve: he had 33 aces and topped out at 144 m.p.h. And he showed admirable fight; after dropping the first set and falling to 1-5 in the second, he fought back and won the tie break, sending the crowd into a frenzy.But Isner made 61 unforced errors, compared with 36 by Youzhny, and won less than half his net points.“I just didn’t have the pop I needed on my shots,” he said. “I wasn’t able to get to the balls like I thought I should have. You know, certain shots, running around a forehand, coming up late, hitting them late.”Querrey will face the No. 25 seed, Stanislas Wawrinka, who stunned Andy Murray, the No. 4 seed, on Sunday. Fish, who advanced the day before, will face the No. 3 seed, Novak Djokovic, who already disappointed the crowd at Arthur Ashe once by beating an American — Blake, perhaps the fan favorite here — on Saturday night.Things have changed quite a bit since Querrey first made the Round of 16, back in 2008.Asked after his match Sunday to reflect on how he has changed since then, Querrey suggested he is a different player these days. His return game and his backhand have gone from weaknesses to strengths, he said, while he has improved his speed and his court sense, too.And although Querrey said he had hoped he would get to face Isner in the quarterfinals, he said he would certainly be rooting for Fish. “We’re all cheering for each other, and hopefully we can just keep going,” Querrey said.'"
"'10-09-06,'0','When should investors sell Apple shares? The group’s push overseas and into the business market still holds promise, as does the steady stream of gadgets, like the updated Apple TV introduced by Steven P. Jobs last week. Apple’s trajectory should continue for some time, so its stock, which has gained more than 40 percent each year for the last five, looks attractive at 15 times estimated 2011 earnings. But no company can grow sales at that pace forever. While it may sound premature or even churlish to do so, we offer some strategic cues that could act as warning signs for investors that Apple’s growth is slowing.DISCOUNTING While Apple computers and handsets account for less than 5 percent of global unit sales, the company racks up extraordinary profits on them. Its reputation for producing quality devices means Apple can charge a premium to competing products. Its operating margin is almost 30 percent. Even small gains to its market share result in supercharged profit growth.Apple has used the so-called halo effect, rather than price cuts, to gain market share. Its devices work well together. And users who try one often adopt Apple’s other products. This can be seen now in the enterprise market, where Apple has traditionally been weak. The iPad appears to be a big hit among corporate executives and professionals. This should increase adoption of iPhones and Macs. Moreover, Apple appears to have avoided discounts typically offered to big customers.Apple could increase market share quickly by offering discounts or cheaper devices. While this would goose profits in the short term, it would be a flashing yellow light because the high end of the tech market is disproportionately profitable.While Apple could profit from selling lots of low-end gadgets, it’s a tough place to make a buck because of greater competition and lower capacity to differentiate products. Nokia’s operating margin on phones is about 11 percent. Those in the commodity PC market are no better; Dell’s are around 5 percent.'"
"'10-09-06,'0','The Apple TV box, which fits in the palm of a hand, is elegant and easy to use to rent television shows for 99 cents, though for now only from ABC and Fox. Owners of iPads, iPhones and top-of-the-line iPods will be able to transmit videos, photos and other media from their mobile devices to the television. It will also allow Netflix subscribers to stream thousands of movies and television shows without an additional fee.But more than 100 other devices can stream Netflix movies, including game machines, Blu-ray players and Internet-connected TVs. Indeed, Apple faces an increasing number of competitors that include upstarts like Roku and Boxee, powerful rivals like Google, and established players like Sony and Samsung.And its revamped Apple TV box is, as Mr. Munster put it, “an elementary effort.”Steve Perlman, a former Apple executive and a pioneer in efforts to merge the Internet and television, described Apple TV’s features as “underwhelming.” “Apple is still in a holding pattern when it comes to television,” said Mr. Perlman, now the chief executive of OnLive, an online gaming company.Mr. Perlman and others suggested that Apple TV suffered from shortcomings like limited programming choices and an inability to use the kinds of applications and games that made the iPhone so popular. They say it is a box that provides some nice additional features for TV watchers, but not a replacement for the products and services that consumers now rely on.Many of the current generation of HDTVs come with Internet capability to stream movies, YouTube videos, Twitter feeds and music. They do not cost much more than TVs without that capability. John Revie, senior vice president for home entertainment marketing at Samsung Electronics, estimates the industry will sell 6.5 million “smart TVs” in 2010.If Mr. Jobs had bolder ambitions for Apple TV, they were thwarted, in part, by the same challenges faced by most of its competitors: the established cable operators and content companies that want to protect their businesses even as they tiptoe into the world of Internet television.CBS and NBC, for example, have refused to make television shows available to Apple at 99 cents, and even Fox suggested that it views its agreement with Apple as an experiment.Mr. Jobs, a master marketer, tried to cast the device’s simplicity as a virtue, saying that Apple TV delivers many of the things consumers want. “They want Hollywood movies and TV shows whenever they want,” he said. “They want to pay lower prices for content. They don’t want a computer on their TV. They have computers.” He added: “They don’t want to manage storage.”Apple has other advantages as well. The most significant improvement Apple made to the device was the price. It dropped it to $99, or $200 cheaper than its predecessor model. Given Apple’s substantial advertising budget, many consumers who have never heard of Boxee or the movie-streaming abilities of the Xbox 360 will certainly learn about Apple TV as the holidays approach.Analysts say that with Apple TV, the company is well positioned to take a bolder step into Internet television in the next year or two. And they say that its most significant impact, at least in the short term, is likely to be not on the established television industry’s incumbents, but rather on new players like Roku, Boxee or Google.Google has yet to enter the market but is expected to release in November its first version of Google TV. The company’s approach is more ambitious, more complex and notably different from Apple’s.Google wants its software to be at the center of the television viewing experience. The software system will be built into televisions and will let people have access to any Web site and Web video, and easily search for programming. Prices for Google TV devices have not been announced.Boxee is also trying to marry much of the Web with the television set, as well as stream programming from Netflix and other sources. The company’s box is expected to go on sale in the fall for $199.“It is really aimed at a different consumer,” said Avner Ronen, chief executive of Boxee. While Apple TV will be great for access to some media, he said, “people want to be able to watch any video they see on the Internet on the TV.”Analysts say that Apple TV’s closest match in the market is Roku, whose box has been available for two years and also offers streaming from Netflix and other services. Anthony Wood, the chief executive of Roku, said he was not worried about competition from Apple. He said sales of the Roku boxes, which start at $60, were growing fast, and the company expected to have sold a million devices by the end of the year.“We try hard to offer a better product for a lower cost,” Mr. Wood said. “They’ll be a competitor for us, but I don’t think they have an Apple-sized success on their hands.”Apple will have another important advantage over many rivals: the ability to demonstrate Apple’s TV capabilities in its stores. “I can’t walk into Best Buy and ask to see how Roku works,” said Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Roku is sold only online.But Apple’s biggest challenge may be the same one facing all the new entrants in the market: An established industry that gives television consumers much of what they want and that it is itself inching toward the Internet, albeit slowly.“When Apple introduced the iPod, the music player was broken,” said Mr. Munster, the Piper Jaffray analyst. The software to connect to music players was clumsy and seemed more suited to technophiles than average consumers, Mr. Munster said, creating an opening for Apple. “Now the television works well,” he added, “and a lot of people don’t realize that they need Internet TV.”'"
"'10-09-06,'0','The race-to-judge phenomenon is fed in part by increasing competition between movie bloggers and box-office Web sites, which have started predicting how a movie will fare on opening weekend far in advance. BoxOffice.com is already projecting that “Hereafter,” a thriller directed by Clint Eastwood that Warner Brothers plans to release on Oct. 22, will have a $16 million opening.Studios say all of this prognosticating has gotten out of control. “Is a measure of success that we reach the Internet’s expectations? No, it’s not. Not even remotely,” said Joe Drake, president of Lionsgate’s motion picture group.The box office expectations game can cause turbulence in the stock prices of smaller studios. DreamWorks Animation fell into the trap with “How to Train Your Dragon” in March. That movie had a $43.7 million opening — sharply less than predicted by analysts — and shares dropped 11 percent over the next week. But it was just a slow starter. In the end, “How to Train Your Dragon” sold a huge $479 million, and a sequel is now in the works.There are other recent examples of movies that were quickly deemed misses but turned into hits. “Date Night,” the 20th Century Fox comedy starring Steve Carell and Tina Fey, was branded a disappointment when it opened to $25 million. Yet it finally captured over $152 million. “The Last Song” had a $16 million opening in March — lower than expected — but went on to sell $89 million at the global box office for Walt Disney Studios.“It got written off pretty quickly, but for ‘The Last Song’ to stick around as long as it did was pretty impressive,” said Phil Contrino, editor of BoxOffice.com.Mr. Drake said he measured success for a picture’s theatrical run on multiple levels, starting, of course, with whether it made money. “You always want more, but ‘Kick-Ass’ hit our targets and is solidly profitable,” he said. But Mr. Drake said other components are also important, like building a relationship with a budding director like Mr. Vaughn.Furthermore, Lionsgate executives insist that they always had modest expectations for the film at the box office.“We knew that the movie played like a million bucks but that the edgy nature of the material made it a tricky sell to Middle America,” said Tim Palen, Lionsgate’s co-president of theatrical marketing. “Teenaged kids in Spandex outfits cutting people’s legs off with samurai weapons — we clearly were not dealing with the Egg McMuffin of movies.”Lionsgate is particularly sensitive to the quick dismissal of the film because its parent company has been locked in a takeover battle with the corporate raider Carl C. Icahn. But, as Lionsgate is learning, it is extremely difficult to remove a negative perception from a film once it sets in.Despite the strong performance of the movie on DVD, Lionsgate is battling a new round of negative publicity about the picture — this time tied to the poor performances of two subsequent films with similar source material.“Kick-Ass,” “Jonah Hex” and “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World” are all based on unconventional comic books. Linking them together creates a nice narrative for the entertainment news media: movies based on quirky comic books don’t work.A closer look shows that both “Jonah Hex” and “Scott Pilgrim” have little chance of ever becoming profitable.“Jonah Hex,” a Warner release that cost $47 million to make, was a box-office disaster, selling just $10.5 million in tickets. “Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,” which cost Universal Pictures an estimated $60 million to produce, is still playing but has also tanked, fizzling after three weeks in North American theaters with about $27 million.'"

"'10-09-06,'0','MONTICELLO, N.Y. — The first time Iggy and the Stooges played a concert was July 1972. They had a new guitarist, James Williamson, and had changed their name from the plain Stooges.They were in London, having been brought to England by David Bowie’s management company, and there was a bit of curiosity around them: some reflected from Mr. Bowie, but some from twice-told tales about how good they’d been in Detroit and Los Angeles, before the band changed form. Some British writers and even some Americans, flown over at the expense of RCA Records to see Mr. Bowie play at a different theater earlier in the evening, were lucky to document the late-night Stooges gig as well. They noted Iggy’s silver jeans and black lipstick, his vaulting into the audience, pulling hair and sitting in laps. But what and how the Stooges played remains vague because there was no vocabulary for it then.Friday was different: there was no luck involved, and the vocabulary had been set. On the first night of the annual All Tomorrow’s Parties festival here at Kutsher’s Country Club, Iggy Pop, now 63, knew that his body language translated into still photographs resembling Mannerist paintings. And everybody there knew the band was to play “Raw Power,” the album it went on to make in London in the fall of 1972. The best of the record is fast and loud, howling and inviting, like an early ’60s R&B band with rabies. There are details of guitar riffs and drumming — and a one-note piano ostinato in the song “Raw Power” — that make a case for simplicity and repetition as the most noble things music can do.And with Mr. Williamson playing the riffs he hasn’t been playing for 30 years — between the 1970s and last year he worked for Sony as an electronics executive — the Stooges attacked the album’s eight songs, in a different order, just about perfectly. The performance followed the form of their shows since they first revived in 2003. It included an interlude of the fans invading the stage to dance (on “Shake Appeal”); the almost maniacal concentration and effort of the bassist Mike Watt, tracking Iggy like a falconer as he energized some of the simplest and best bass lines in rock; and the no-music postlude, when Iggy kept up his elegant convulsions for a minute or so after the final song, spending the last of the electricity left in him.The Stooges also played “Night Theme,” from “Kill City” — a Pop-Williamson collaboration you would probably know only if you had spent time hanging around record stores. All Tomorrow’s Parties is full of such people, and Friday, the first night of the three-day festival, was for them.Besides the Stooges and “Raw Power,” there was a committed show by the Scientists, from Perth, Australia — a rough, denatured garage-punk band from the 1980s that never made it to North America and that wouldn’t have existed without the Stooges. They played their 1983 mini-LP “Blood Red River,” with related singles, the singer Kim Salmon still twisting his words into yelps. Likewise, Mudhoney, from Seattle, which wouldn’t have existed without a combination of the Stooges and the Scientists, played “Superfuzz Bigmuff,” from 1988. It was perfect organizing; the crowd and the bands knew it. (“When I was a young boy,” the singer Mark Arm said between songs, “I never thought that I’d be in the sweet spot of a Scientists-Stooges sandwich.”)'"
"'10-09-06,'0','Although previous Middle East peace efforts have ended in failure, the current one has a few innovative components — American officials are involved from the very start and plan to stay involved; all difficult issues are to be negotiated in a package deal, so both sides are forced to compromise and acknowledge the other’s compromises; and the sides have agreed to a one-year deadline.Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas are planning to meet every two weeks. They are also planning to keep the substance of their conversations closely held in an effort to prevent leaks from becoming sources of embarrassment or pressure.Still, officials on both sides agreed that the process would soon face a difficult test: Israel’s moratorium on settlement construction in the West Bank ends Sept. 26, and the government does not seem inclined to extend it. The Palestinians have repeatedly said that if construction starts again, the talks will end.But Mr. Netanyahu spoke Sunday about the need to “embrace original thinking, to think outside the box” in these talks, and it was clear that efforts were under way to find a formula to keep the process going after the deadline. Mr. Erekat, when asked about this, said, “the key is in their hands.”He repeated something he has said often: “The Israelis have to choose between settlements and peace. They can’t have both.” But Mr. Erekat did not repeat another familiar expression: that if construction begins again in West Bank Jewish settlements on Sept. 26, the peace process halts. Instead, he said this was not an issue he wished to discuss now.One possible interpretation of his reticence is that negotiations may be under way to permit the talks to continue after the moratorium ends. Such a deal might include sweeteners for the Palestinian leadership — release of Palestinian prisoners, for example, or changes on the ground in the West Bank.Aides to Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday, as they have in the past, that if the Palestinians walked away from negotiations over the settlement construction deadline, it would be evidence that they had not been serious about reaching an agreement and were looking for an excuse.Mr. Netanyahu indicated that he would not tell most of his cabinet ministers about the substance of his negotiations until a framework was reached with Mr. Abbas. That would presumably avoid leaks and crises and increase the chances that any accord would be viewed in its entirety by all sides.In Washington last week, Israeli reporters asked Mr. Netanyahu for details of his talks with Mr. Abbas. He declined, saying: “You want headlines. I want an agreement.”'"

"'10-09-07,'0','And it will have a provision to expand and make permanent a tax credit for corporations’ research and development expenses; for three decades, the credit has been enacted temporarily, given its revenue cost, and then always extended, but with frequent lapses that frustrate businesses.Those ideas and others that Mr. Obama may propose on Wednesday have been under consideration at the White House for some time. But August’s mix of disappointing economic data and deteriorating poll numbers for Democrats heading into the midterm elections prompted the president, with evident impatience, to publicly press his economic team to quickly produce options that could help the economy without excessively increasing the debt.Though liberal and labor groups have been agitating for public works spending, Mr. Obama and his advisers are emphasizing business tax cuts in hopes of drawing Republican support — or, failing that, to show that Republicans are so determined to thwart Mr. Obama that they will oppose even ideas that they and most business groups, like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, advocate.A draft paper on the proposal permitting businesses to write off the full costs of capital spending in 2010 and 2011 said it “would be the largest temporary investment incentive in American history.”Stimulus measures enacted at the end of the Bush administration and continued in 2009 allowed businesses to depreciate 50 percent of qualified investments. A separate administration proposal to benefit small businesses with tax cuts and loans, which has been pending in Congress much of the year and remains blocked by Republicans in the Senate, would extend this smaller tax break through 2010.Mr. Obama would expand this to 100 percent through 2011 and make it effective retroactive to this Wednesday, regardless of when Congress might approve the proposal.According to the draft description from the administration, the proposal “would put nearly $200 billion in the hands of businesses over the next two years — helping companies that make new investments in the United States at a time they need it most.”But, it added: “Most of this relief would be recouped by the Treasury as businesses regain their strength. Specifically, businesses would get the upfront deduction for their investment — now when they most need it — but would give up their future annual depreciation allowances in future years when the economy is stronger.”'"
"'10-09-07,'0','That may be because she was not programmed from an early age to be part of this circus.Her father, Zoran, one of her coaches, was a member of the Yugoslavian Davis Cup team in the early 1980s and also played at South Carolina. He took his family to Germany when Petkovic was an infant, and when Yugoslavia broke apart violently in the early 1990s, the Petkovics, who are ethnic Serbs, decided to remain in Germany.Petkovic, born in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, returns often and is close friends with the Serbian player Ana Ivanovic, although she considers herself a patriotic German.She said her father never wanted her to be a professional tennis player. She chose the path herself and chose it relatively late for an elite player, finishing high school before becoming a full-time competitor.“I don’t think Rafa Nadal was practicing only two hours a day like me when he was 15,” Petkovic said with a laugh earlier this week. “I lived a normal life until I was 19. I finished high school. I went out with my friends. So when I came into the tennis world, I’m still going around like a little child who is 5 years old, and I’m still amazed by everything I see.”“When I see David Nalbandian, I’m like, ‘Ooh,’ and he came to me and said, ‘Nice dancing,’ and I said, ‘Oh really!’ ” she added. “So for me, everything is still amazing.”She performed the dance after her three-set upset of Nadia Petrova in the first round. “It started out as a bet in the beginning, because I was playing really bad in the first tournaments here in the U.S., so my coach told me, ‘If you win today and beat Petrova, you have to dance or do something special,’ ” she said. “So I said, ‘Definitely’, because I didn’t really expect to be winning against Petrova. So he looked at me after I won, and I said, ‘O.K.’ And I’m very superstitious, and I think every athlete is superstitious.”Which meant that she did it on a practice court Saturday, even though she received a third-round walkover because of an injury to Peng Shuai of China. Those who might have missed the dance at Flushing Meadows in person can see it on the Internet, where it is possible to see plenty of Petkovic.She is writing blog posts for ESPN.com in English at the tournament and regularly posts bilingual updates on her Web site or on Twitter.“I find it much easier in English than in German,” she said. “It’s easier to be funny in English than in German. German is not a funny language.”She has filmed tours of player parties that include her interviews of fellow players and has even filmed some fake newscasts long on self-parody in which she refers to herself as Petkorazzi.“I view ourselves, athletes in general, as entertainers,” she said.In one video, she wears a blazer and thick glasses, fumbles with a script and a glass of water and reads a news report that declares herself missing after her forgettable performance at Wimbledon this year.“The last time she was seen was playing mixed doubles with her partner Marx,” she says in the video, referring to her partner, Philipp Marx. “The fact that I play mixed doubles with a guy named Marx is no lead to my political attitude whatsoever.”Politics matter to Petkovic. When recovering from a major knee injury in 2008, she shadowed Roland Koch, the leader of her home state, Hessen. She is studying political science at the university level by correspondence and is interested in attending a prestigious journalism school in Hamburg, the Henri Nannen School, after her career with an eye on political journalism or perhaps even becoming a politician.But for now, Petkovic is concerned above all with improving her ability to hit a fuzzy ball over a net, again and again and again. Why does something so repetitive interest her so much?“It is really strange: I think about it a lot, you know, but I think it’s just this challenge,” she said. “I have the feeling I could do much better in other things in life than tennis, but in tennis, it’s really a challenge. Because in school, I was always the best.“But in tennis,” she added, “I can do everything — and I do it — but then the opponents come and you have to deal with them, and sometimes you could have the best preparation in the world, and it doesn’t help you because the opponent is just better that day.”And sometimes, even on the brink of a huge victory, your nerves don’t allow you to play your best. In the second round of this year’s French Open, Petkovic squandered four match pointsbefore losing to the defending champion, Svetlana Kuznetsova.It was hardly Petkovic’s first taste of tennis adversity. At the 2008 Australian Open, in the first game of her opening match, she tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee and did not play another tournament for eight months. But after falling out of the top 400, she has worked her way back to prominence relatively quickly. Her power baseline game is a work in progress, but she was willing to lose some lopsided matches this summer to work on her net play and other weaknesses that she and her coach, Glen Schaap, had identified.The reward for someone who craves new experiences was another new experience here: her first run to the second week of a Grand Slam tournament and her first spot on a major show court since she injured her knee in the Australian Open’s second-biggest arena.“The last time I was on a similar stage, I tore my A.C.L.,” she said. “I think I moved forward from there.”She said she intended to move forward from here, too, comfortable with her career choice, even if it meant ignoring the counsel of her father, who is here with her in New York.“He’s sensitive like me and he was a little bit crushed by this world, and he didn’t want me to be in the same position,” she said. “He told me: ‘You don’t play tennis. You go and study and do something serious.’“But I chose the way I did, and I think I made the right decision.”'"

"'10-09-07,'0','Last year, in the depths of the recession, Mr. Soros gave the Robin Hood Foundation, a charity that fights poverty in New York, a $50 million contribution that helped it raise significantly more than that amount. He also gave every family with children on welfare in New York State $200 to buy school supplies, a grant worth $35 million that enabled the state to gain access to some $175 million in federal money for which it would not otherwise have qualified.So far this year, Mr. Soros has donated about $700 million to various causes, including the gift to Human Rights Watch. His hedge fund, Quantum Endowment, grew 29 percent in 2009, earning him $3.3 billion in fees and investment gains.Human Rights Watch will use the gift to add about 120 staff members to its team of 300 around the world, expand translation of its reports and open new offices. The intent, said Kenneth Roth, the advocacy group’s executive director, is to increase its influence in emerging power centers. The group, which is based in New York, investigates and draws attention to human rights abuses around the world.Mr. Roth said that South Africa had more sway in Zimbabwe than the United States and other Western powers. Similarly, India, China and Japan are more influential in Sri Lanka. “We need to try to generate pressure on those governments, those emerging powers, now, which means expanding our capacity to deploy our information,” Mr. Roth said.Mr. Soros put it differently. “I’m afraid the United States has lost the moral high ground under the Bush administration, but the principles that Human Rights Watch promotes have not lost their universal applicability,” he said. “So to be more effective, I think the organization has to be seen as more international, less an American organization.”He said the gift to the organization was “also from my heart,” an acknowledgment of the training in human rights issues and philanthropy that he received from the group when he was just starting to emerge as a major donor.“Every Wednesday morning at 8 o’clock, a group at Human Rights Watch got together and discussed issues with the managers,” Mr. Soros recalled. “I was an active participant in that group, and human rights remains an important element of my foundation’s current activities.”Mr. Roth said few people then knew who Mr. Soros was. “We were just trying to figure out what we were going to do that week and so on, and he was just a guy at the meeting,” he said.The grant is structured as a challenge that asks the group to raise $10 million from new, primarily international sources, each year for the next decade, but Human Right Watch will receive the Soros grant regardless. Roughly 30 percent of its revenue comes from countries other than the United States, but less than 1 percent is from non-Western countries, where much of the organization’s work is focused.Mr. Soros wants to see the organization raise more money in places like Brazil, Mexico, India and China, which will be challenging, Mr. Roth said. “This is a transformative grant in more than one way for sure,” he said.'"
"'10-09-07,'0','The price is $1.1 million, and she said renovating the town house could cost $100,000 to $200,000.“It’s a question of how someone wants to live,” Ms. Williamson said. “TLC means that you love it as it is now and love it even more when you get it the way you want it. It’s a softer way of saying it needs a major renovation.”Craig M. Dix, a broker whose client closed last week on a $9.5 million Upper East Side town house whose listing mentioned TLC, put it this way: “It’s a euphemistic way of saying that it’s going to be in poor condition.”He gave examples of other Pollyannish words or phrasings in real estate listings and how to translate them: “ ‘Cozy’ means minute. ‘Quiet’ means it’s in the back of the building. It’s just the language of the industry. TLC means a total gut job.”Corinne Pulitzer, the broker who listed the Upper East Side property that Mr. Dix’s client bought, said she was explicit about its condition. She did not stage the town house with furniture because, she said, that would be like “putting diamonds on a monkey.” She told buyers that renovations would “conservatively” cost $1 million.“It’s really about managing expectations,” Ms. Pulitzer said.Jack Strohbach, who is selling a 170-year-old town house near Gramercy Park for $3.1 million, had his broker include in the listing that the house “needs TLC,” although he bought new appliances two years ago and spent $30,000 to have it painted five years ago. He said a buyer could move in immediately.His agent, Holly Sose of City Connections Realty, was not as optimistic. As she walked through the town house, she politely pointed out a kitchen that had not been renovated since the 1970s and rooms filled with outdated built-in cabinets covered in mirrors. Structurally, she said, the house was sound; renovations could be largely cosmetic.“This needs a hug, maybe not a face-lift,” Ms. Sose said.There’s an expression you might not see in a listing anytime soon.Karen Stone, a Citi-Habitats agent, brought a client, Danielle Altschuh, to see a two-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side listed as needing TLC. After entering, they discovered that the apartment had no operating electricity and that the seller had removed all the appliances. Ms. Stone and Ms. Altschuh had to view the apartment with flashlights. A renter was living there in conditions so bad that they first mistook him for a squatter.Ms. Altschuh, a firefighter, bought the apartment for $276,000 in December; the renovation process lasted through April. She had so many problems with her contractor that she got fellow firefighters to help her finish the work. Then she changed her locks to protect herself from the contractor.Ms. Altschuh says TLC “leaves a lot of room for interpretation.”“If you heard ‘TLC,’ you would think it needs a little paint, maybe change some handles on cabinets,” she said. “It needed a whole lot more than TLC.”But whatever TLC means, some buyers are attracted to apartments that need it. For one thing, they tend to cost less than properties that have been newly renovated.Sarah Miller looked at an income-restricted three-bedroom apartment in Harlem listed as needing — well, you know. It had many problems, including a collapsed bathroom ceiling. Ms. Miller bought the apartment for $90,000 and moved in after a six-week renovation.But Ms. Miller said she preferred overseeing the process herself.“When other people do renovations,” she said, “it’s more superficial work that gets done.”'"
"'10-09-07,'0','After a Monday practice here at the Garden-owned practice bunker preceded a flight to Atlanta for Game 2 on Tuesday night, Pondexter said she had every intention of returning for a scheduled decisive match with the Dream on Thursday. At least once more, she would love to lure her college coach, C. Vivian Stringer, to a courtside seat in support of the Liberty’s Rutgers troika — Pondexter, Essence Carson and Kia Vaughn.“Seeing Coach Stringer sitting there was funny and at the same time fun,” Pondexter said, referring to Stringer’s attendance at Game 3 of the conference semifinals against Indiana.Those in the metropolitan area who would plunk down a few dollars to watch women’s basketball would undoubtedly be familiar with the Rutgers story, from A to Imus. Pondexter wasn’t around for the foul radio commentary after the 2007 college Final Four, but she was the backbone of successive Big East powers in 2005 and 2006.She won two titles with Taurasi in Phoenix and a gold medal for the United States in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In other words, Pondexter has the all-purpose résumé to go along with her deep Rutgers roots.It could be argued that the Liberty was about a decade late in getting someone like her and other recognizable locals and that the league made a costly tactical mistake in not doing some social engineering — the N.B.A. of the 1950s and 1960s called it a territorial draft — to ensure box office appeal in the markets it deemed most crucial to its success.Wilt Chamberlain was a territorial pick back in the day. So were Tom Heinsohn, Dave DeBusschere (to Detroit) and Bill Bradley. In the W.N.B.A., teams like Connecticut and Washington have stocked their rosters with former collegians from their area. There is nothing wrong with the mining of provincial pride when trying to crawl and then walk in the cutthroat business of professional sports.It is difficult to imagine the league not being better off had a Taurasi or a Sue Bird been strategically placed on the Broadway stage via a system that allowed teams to tag players regionally on a rotating basis once every couple of years.The league did assign certain players to its original eight teams using partial geographical criteria, but Val Ackerman, the league’s first president, said a territorial draft was considered but rejected.“Our feeling was that it was ultimately unfair competitively, since not all teams had, say, a major college program in their territory or a franchise-quality player who may have been raised nearby,” she wrote in an e-mail. “We were prepared to give up the use of hometown or collegiate ties and their potential benefits at the gate in exchange for a fairer, more credible and more predictable system competitively.”Fairer, unfortunately, did not make the league all that regionally balanced. The most famous women’s basketball names — Taurasi in Phoenix, Sheryl Swoopes and Cynthia Cooper in Houston, Bird and Lauren Jackson in Seattle, and Lisa Leslie and Candace Parker in Los Angeles — have helped produce 10 of the 13 W.N.B.A. championships for the Western Conference. Only the Detroit Shock, relocated to Tulsa, has won titles out of the East.“In the past, a lot of the top players were in the West, but in my opinion, the East is the tougher conference now,” Pondexter said, noting the 2010 standings that produced one Western team, Seattle, with a better-than-.500 record. Pondexter didn’t mind adding that she, among others switching conferences, had something to do with the shift.“Phoenix was awesome, but it’s different in the Garden; the energy, the atmosphere, it’s just more intense,” she said.That wasn’t enough for LeBron James, who, like Pondexter, made a statement on market selectivity this summer. With its all-star team in Miami, the N.B.A. will no doubt have a raised profile next season, along with Heat-stoked television ratings.The W.N.B.A. has different metrics, less-lofty goals. One of them should have been a more attractive team in New York. Pondexter is at least a very good start.'"
"'10-09-07,'0','The use of devices like iPods and the PlayStation Portable in training has a couple of advantages, hotel executives say. The devices appeal to younger employees, who, in many cases, already use them at home. The content is also relatively inexpensive to create.Homewood Suites has spent as much as $250,000 to create a 20-minute training DVD, said Dawn Koenig, vice president for brand performance support at the chain. A 20-minute video iPod training module, meanwhile, costs $30,000 to $50,000, which means it is also cheaper to update and translate into languages other than English.Tom Yorton, chief executive of Second City Communications, which provides improvisation and other training to corporate clients, said “the Web has shaped how people learn.” Teaching, he added, “has to be shorter, punchier, more entertaining and more interactive.” Second City Communications is a subsidiary of the Second City, the Chicago improvisational theater.The Elysian, a luxury hotel that opened last December, hired Billy Bungeroth, a resident director at the Second City and a freelance improv teacher, to work with employees in sales, catering, security, concierge and other positions.The goal was to foster “intuitive service,” said Jennifer Lee, the Elysian’s learning and development director. “Service by most luxury hotels is based on scripts. We want our people to have interactions with guests; improv gave them tools that enabled them to be successful with their intuition.”The needs of the Andaz 5th Avenue, which opened in July, were different from the Elysian’s: Andaz hotels (part of Hyatt) do not have registration desks or traditional employees like porters, front desk workers or concierges. Rather, they employ “hosts,” who greet guests as they arrive, check them in and cater to their needs.“Guests come from all angles, and training needs to be unconventional,” said Jonathan Frolich, general manager of the Andaz 5th Avenue.Thus, the hotel hired Chicago City Limits, an improvisational group in New York that also does corporate training, to develop a course to improve hosts’ communications skills, help them read guests’ body language and establish an immediate rapport with guests, said Linda Gelman, the group’s producer.This summer, the Benjamin hired the Handel Group, an executive coaching company, to offer a series of life-coaching sessions to 10 staff members, including the general manager, sales and marketing executives and members of the wait staff. The goal of the sessions, said the hotel’s general manager, Andrew Labetti, was to help employees “set goals for their lives, set dreams of how they want their life to be.” He added, “If we help staff make real changes in their lives, create wellness for themselves, this will affect the guest experience.”Marriott’s SpringHill Suites and Homewood Suites, an extended-stay Hilton brand, both were pioneers in using devices for staff training, starting in 2007. SpringHill Suites uses the Sony PSP and Homewood, video iPods. Aloft, a midprice Starwood brand, began using iPods to train its staff in early 2009, while Hilton Garden Inn began using the PSP for training last year.Kathy Crabtree, director of design and development for SpringHill Suites and other Marriott brands, acknowledged that one risk of these devices is that they can depersonalize training. “The use of technology is important, but we will never go strictly to technology,” she said.Hotels are looking to the new forms of training to “make their learning stick,” said Ron Doney, a former Marriott executive who now is president of Think Up Consulting in Greenville, S.C., which specializes in corporate training and advises SpringHill Suites and other hotel brands.“The more engaging and fun training is for adults, the easier it is to recall memorable concepts when they need to on the job,” he said.'"
"'10-09-07,'0','“Majority of Caesareans Are Done Before Labor” (Aug. 31) sheds light on another disturbing trend: elective (medically unnecessary) deliveries performed before 39 weeks of pregnancy, often for the sake of convenience.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that scheduled deliveries, whether C-section or induced labor, occur only after 39 weeks. Studies show that infants delivered prematurely are at increased risk for chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities and behavioral problems.Yet a recent survey of more than 650 first-time mothers found that more than half thought it was safe to deliver a baby before 37 weeks.

He calls Ashe his favorite player. He professes his love of the N.B.A., and his fashionably rumpled appearance give him a decidedly New York style.Djokovic has run hot and cold with the fans here, as a temperamental player whose fits have not been endearing. And although Djokovic, 23, charmed fans with his comical imitations of other players a few years ago, he undid that rapport and drew boos when he bristled at some good-natured ribbing from Andy Roddick.Djokovic’s hope is to use his game to win New Yorkers’ hearts, something he has come close to doing in recent years. He reached the final in 2007, only to lose to Roger Federer, and reached the semifinals the past two years, where his runs came to an end.He said he hoped he had learned how to deal with the heightened expectations that have come with his success.“You’re not coming in Grand Slams anymore as somebody who is young and kind of the first 30, 20 in the world and not expected to go far, and you don’t have that amount of expectations on your back,” Djokovic said. “You’re getting into the tournaments and matches as somebody who is expected to win most of his matches he’s playing on and getting to the late stage of the second week.“So that’s something you have to deal with, and everybody deals with it. It’s a challenge you have to overcome, and it makes you mentally stronger.”Monfils has been an even tougher player to figure. He is a spectacular defensive player, using great foot speed to track down shots. On the red clay of the French Open, he is known for his sliding retrievals.“He’s physically one of the most prepared and strongest guy on the tour,” Djokovic said. “I guess he’s kind of flashy. If he starts playing well, he can beat anyone.”To get this far, Monfils has battled through some long matches, including one in which he needed five sets to get past the American qualifier Robert Kendrick in the first round. But his match against Gasquet presented a different challenge. Not only are Monfils and Gasquet countrymen, but they are also friends. After Monfils won, they exchanged double-cheek kisses at the net, and while Monfils was doing his on-court interview, Gasquet came over and threw a towel at him.“It is not that easy to play him because he is a friend,” Monfils said.Monfils turned the match by playing tougher on the big points. His most memorable one came on break point in the final game of the second set, when Monfils tracked down what looked like a sure winner from Gasquet and fired a spectacular passing shot down the line.Djokovic had an even easier time in his fourth-round match against Fish. He jumped out early in the first set and never let Fish into the match. His serve was strong, he returned well enough to negate Fish’s serve, and he appeared fresher, with Fish having played two five-set matches in the first three rounds.In the evening session, second-seeded Roger Federer was not his sharpest but nonetheless did not stray into too much danger against the No. 13 seed, Jürgen Melzer of Austria, whom he defeated, 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3. In the quarterfinals, Federer will face fifth-seeded Robin Soderling, who beat No. 21 Albert Montañés, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.It was the second Grand Slam event of the year in which Melzer and Federer met in the fourth round — Federer won in straight sets at Wimbledon — although this time, Melzer put up a bit more of a fight. Although Federer won the first set in less than a half hour, he found himself in a tie break in the second, the first time he has even come close to losing a set in four matches at the Open. But Federer walked into some good luck — he won two points on shots that hit the top of the net and dropped over — and Melzer never threatened him again.In an early women’s match, Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia, ranked 45th, upset 11th-seeded Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia, 7-5, 7-6 (4). Kuznetsova was the 2004 Open champion.In the quarterfinals, Cibulkova will play No. 1 seeded Caroline Wozniacki, who beat No. 14 Maria Sharapova, 6-3, 6-4.For Cibulkova, 21, it will be the second Grand Slam quarterfinal of her career. She made it to the quarters at the French Open in 2009 and lifted her ranking as high as No. 12, but she missed two months at the end of last year with a rib injury and came into the Open ranked No. 45.'"
"'10-09-07,'0','About 1 in 400 women carry genetic mutations that put them at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer. For these women, doctors may recommend prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy, or removal of the ovaries — even before there is any sign of cancer.Now a study in The Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that the surgery sharply reduces the risks of the two types of cancer.Scientists followed 2,482 women who learned they had inherited the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations through genetic testing done between 1974 and 2008. The women were tracked through 2009.During three years of follow-up, 7 percent of the women who did not have mastectomies developed breast cancer and 6 percent of those who retained their ovaries developed ovarian cancer. There were no breast cancers in the mastectomy group, and only 1 percent of women who had the ovarian surgery developed ovarian cancer. (These women also reduced their risk of breast cancer, the study found.)The authors acknowledged that the protective surgery was no guarantee because some residual breast or ovarian tissue remains in the body. Still, they said it provided tremendous protection.“It’s crucial for women to understand: this is their best chance to reduce risk,” said the senior author, Timothy R. Rebbeck, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.'"
"'10-09-07,'0','Children under 5 who do not get at least 10 hours of sleep at night are almost twice as likely to be overweight or obese later in childhood, a new study reports. And naps during the day don’t count.The study, published Monday in Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of 1,930 children under 14. The data included detailed diaries from two random days, in which parents recorded the amount of time a child spent in various activities, among them sleeping.The study adds to an existing body of evidence suggesting that sleep plays an important role in weight regulation, perhaps because tired children are not as active or because sleep affects hormones that influence hunger and appetite, said the paper’s lead author, Janice F. Bell, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.“What we’re saying is that adequate sleep at age 0 to 5 is probably more important than we think,” Dr. Bell said, adding that the good news is that “it’s a modifiable risk factor — it’s something we can change.”'"

"'10-09-07,'0','MADRID — Spain’s interior minister said Monday that he did not trust a cease-fire announcement from ETA, the Basque separatist group, dismissing speculation about whether the country’s long fight against terrorism had come to an end.In a video and statement issued on Sunday, ETA said that it was observing a cease-fire, a decision that it claimed to have taken months earlier. However, the group did not offer to hand over weapons, nor did it describe the cease-fire as permanent.“We have not changed by an inch our stance because this is reversible,” the minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, said in a morning interview on Spanish television, in what amounted to the first official government response to ETA’s announcement.“I don’t trust this one bit,” he added. “The only facts are that there is an ambiguous statement from ETA.”ETA, a nationalist and separatist organization, has killed more than 800 people in its 41-year campaign to establish an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southwest France. It is considered a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States.ETA called a cease-fire in 2006, which it abandoned after the collapse of negotiations with the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.'"

"'10-09-08,'1','On a day of high winds and epic five-set matches, top-seeded Rafael Nadal wasted little time in dispatching his fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in the final match of a long day at the United States Open.After waiting until 11:08 p.m. to begin their encounter because of several lengthy earlier matches, Nadal swiftly defeated his good friend and No. 23 seed Lopez, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4, in only 2 hours and 8 minutes at Arthur Ashe Stadium to advance to advance to the quarterfinals of the Open for the third consecutive year.But Nadal, who has spent most of the last five years as one of the top two players in the world, has never reached the final here, either because of aching knees that have robbed him of his mobility, or the strained abdominal muscle that limited his flexibility last year, or just an inability to cope with the fast courts here.“Without health it is impossible to have a chance to win,” Nadal said on the court after the match.But in his first four matches this year, nothing has slowed him down, including his opponents, who have yet to take a set off him.The next to try will be another Spaniard, No. 8 Fernando Verdasco, who will have to reverse an inauspicious trend in order to win. In 10 previous matches, Verdasco has never beaten Nadal.'"

She was in a great rhythm. She got to the foul line a lot. She did a great job in attacking our defense. She was aggressive from the beginning.”Pondexter’s 36 points is the third-highest total in the postseason.The Dream, the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, swept Washington in the first round before winning two straight over the Liberty in the East finals.McCoughtry, perhaps distracted by the postgame celebration, at first claimed it “was just another game.”When asked again, she said: “I take it back. This was different.”Atlanta, a third-year expansion franchise that set a league record with 30 losses two years ago, will face the Western Conference champion Seattle Storm in the best-of-five finals, which begin Sunday at Seattle.Atlanta players jumped on the scorer’s table and streamers fell from the Philips Arena ceiling after the final buzzer.'"

"'10-09-08,'1','“FOOD can be cooked from the soul,” said Marcus Samuelsson as he moved through the raw space of Red Rooster Harlem, his upcoming restaurant on Lenox Avenue near West 125th Street. “But that doesn’t make it soul food.”And so, Red Rooster won’t be devoted to the Southern cooking that has long fueled Sylvia’s, a block away. Nor will it exclusively channel the African dishes Mr. Samuelsson once served at Merkato 55, his vast, exotic meatpacking district flameout. Instead, he will preside over what he calls “an elevated American comfort food” that borrows from both cuisines, and others. “Harlem is so diverse, and our menu will be, too,” he said.Mr. Samuelsson, 39, was born in Abragodena, Ethiopia, orphaned at 3 and adopted by a Swedish couple in Gothenburg. But cooking in Harlem, where he has lived for six years, is a voyage home to his identity and ancestry, he said. “For any person of color, no matter where you come from, Harlem has special meaning.”The name of his 100-seat restaurant, opening in October, salutes the original Red Rooster, a storied, long-shuttered Harlem hangout whose clientele included James Baldwin and Willie Mays. The ground floor of the new $2 million Red Rooster will have a restaurant, a breakfast cafe, a grocery, a horseshoe-shaped bar and a communal table, all of it covering 3,400 square feet. He means to fill the 1,800-square-foot basement not only with a party space that has “a speak-easy vibe with jazz, gospel and open-mike music,” he said, but also with cooking classes and demonstrations.Mr. Samuelsson is the winner of the last “Top Chef Masters,” guest chef for the first state dinner of the Obama administration, and a city fixture who made his bones at Aquavit, where he took over the kitchen in 1995 and is still a part owner.'"
"'10-09-08,'1','“I think you’ll either see someone from Harvard Business School or a Harvard dropout,” Mr. Heyward said.Mr. Westin, who announced his resignation Monday night, spent almost 14 years running ABC News, a unit that achieved consistent, but relative, success. ABC News never really escaped its second-rank status behind NBC News, even as it never was in any real danger of falling to third place, occupied by CBS News.That certainly could have been part of the problem. Andrew Lack, who once ran NBC News and is now chief executive of Bloomberg’s multimedia group, said he could imagine the marching orders to a new president of news beginning with a question: “If ‘Good Morning America’ is No. 2, why isn’t it No. 1?’ ”NBC News is dominant in ratings and cash flow, and “if you’re No. 1 you are still going to make money,” Mr. Lack said.He and others say NBC has an advantage in owning a cable news channel, MSNBC, which not only adds revenue and helps spread costs but also serves as a training ground for new talent.The news divisions of ABC and CBS do not have a cable channel to fall back on, which is why stories continue to circulate about possible mergers with CNN or Bloomberg.Mr. Lack said Bloomberg had explored a merger with Mr. Westin. “We looked for a partnership,” he said, adding that “the conversations didn’t go anywhere. But particularly with David, I felt we had substantial interest in getting together.”Many executives inside and outside the network news divisions of ABC and CBS have said that mergers offer the only path to survival, but no deals have emerged. The stated reasons have been tied to problems related to union employees and management conflicts. But some analysts have suggested that the networks simply fear that they may lose their identities by getting involved with cable.Andrew Tyndall, who publishes The Tyndall Report, which follows the network newscasts, said that situation might change if ABC’s parent company, Walt Disney, followed the pattern it established in sports.ABC Sports was once the dominant TV unit. “But Disney moved it all over to cable, and made ESPN into the most powerful channel on cable,” he said. “Maybe Disney will see a way to do the same thing with news.”Mr. Tyndall argued for a radical approach to changing network newscasts, assuming that ABC and others decided to stay in broadcasting at all. If they do, he said, they could not abandon their news operations. Part of a network’s obligation to its affiliated stations is to provide news.The broadcasting element has diminishing relevance, Mr. Tyndall said, adding that what will continue to be valuable is high-quality news video.“The video is not going to be distributed by stations,” he said. “It’s going to be done by the audience, sharing it and embedding it and virally communicating it and putting it on Facebook. The new network is not a broadcast network; it’s a social network.”Robert J. Thompson, professor of television at Syracuse University, said all the predictions about shrinking network news operations sounded no different from forecasts about the demise of network soap operas.“And that’s scary. This isn’t soap operas, this is serious business, especially when you look at what’s happening in the newspaper industry,” he said.“I’m very alarmed when I see these institutions that we depend upon for coverage of things like the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War, institutions that totally changed the way things happened in this country, being run by people who seem to be in this state of total uncertainty about what to do,” he added.'"
"'10-09-08,'1','A parliamentary committee will hold a full inquiry into the issue of phone hacking, its chairman, Keith Vaz, said Tuesday, in the wake of continuing allegations that The News of The World had illegally intercepted, or hacked, telephone messages of British celebrities and politicians. Mr. Vaz said that in testimony before the committee, Assistant Police Commissioner John Yates had “raised a number of questions of importance about the law on phone hacking, the way the police deal with such breaches of the law and the manner in which victims are informed of those breaches.”'"
"'10-09-08,'1','Bedbugs used to be solely a residential problem, but they are showing up in commercial settings, and not just in places with beds like hotels, nursing homes and apartment complexes. Increasingly, pest control companies report finding bedbugs in office buildings, movie theaters, clothing stores, food plants, factories and even airplanes. For the affected businesses, the expense can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. For the companies that deal with the scourge, it is a bonanza, with business doubling and tripling.The costs of coping with bedbugs are significant, and they are not covered by most insurance policies because they are seen as a maintenance issue. Hiring bedbug-sniffing dogs, which is considered the most effective detection technique, costs about $250 for a 1,200-square-foot retail store and as much as $10,000 for a million-square-foot department store.“To stay ahead of bedbugs, I recommend having the dogs come through quarterly,” said Pepe Peruyero, chief executive of J&K Canine Academy in High Springs, Fla., which trains bedbug-sniffing dogs and offers inspections for large buildings like department stores and school dormitories. However, he added, many customers cannot afford it and instead choose to rely on the vigilance of employees after an initial dog check comes up clean.Eliminating infestations is also costly, ranging from $750 for a few rooms in an office building to $70,000 for a large apartment complex. And that is just for the application of the cocktail of pesticides that kills bedbugs. It costs an additional 40 percent for the gold standard regimen of placing all the contents of an office or retail space into a heat chamber — bedbugs die at 120 degrees — and then spraying pesticides in the temporarily empty rooms.“It takes about four to seven hours per room” for the combination heat and pesticide procedure and a couple of hours on three separate occasions if using pesticides alone, said Judy Black, technical director for the Steritech Group, based in Charlotte, N.C., which provides pest control and other quality control services to commercial customers. “Getting rid of bedbugs is not quick or easy.”Businesses lose money when they have to interrupt operations. In addition, they may have to destroy bedbug-infested merchandise. Abercrombie & Fitch, for example, had to close two of its stores in New York in July, one for four business days and another for five, to deal with bedbug infestations. A representative confirmed disposing of merchandise but declined to comment on the cost.The managements of the Empire State Building and the AMC Theater chain were similarly tightlipped about the cost of dealing with recent bedbug infestations.“Nobody wants to talk about this even though it’s happening everywhere,” said Ron Harrison, director of technical services for Orkin, a pest control company based in Atlanta, whose commercial business has more than tripled since 2008. “I spoke at the Mobile, Ala., chapter of the National Apartment Association and asked for a show of hands of who had experienced problems with bedbugs, and not a single hand went up, and right there in front of me were three of our customers who I know had us out to treat for them.”The silence, of course, is to avoid the stigma of an infestation. Even if businesses manage to avoid media attention, they may end up on one of several Web sites like bedbugregistry.com and bedbugreports.com, which encourage people to report hotels, apartment complexes, offices and retailers where they saw or were bitten by bed bugs.“It’s been nonstop drama dealing with hotels disputing claims,” said Maciej Ceglowski, a computer programmer in San Francisco who started bedbugregistry.com in November 2006 after he was bitten by bedbugs in a local hotel. “Everyone is scared of being publicly outed and losing business.”There is also a real fear of liability. Bedbug-related lawsuits have been increasing since 2003, and several lawyers now advertise themselves as specialists in such litigation. Typical is a recent case filed against Aaron’s Sales and Lease in Norristown, Pa., by a woman who contends furniture she bought there had bedbugs. In court documents, she said she wanted at least $50,000 in compensation because the bedbugs not only gave her itchy welts but also caused her to lose her hair and her job as an attendant at a nursing home.“Most bedbug suits are settled out of court for less than $5,000, but I’ve seen damages go as high as six figures,” said Christian Hardigree, associate professor at the William F. Harrah College of Hotel Administration at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and a lawyer who has consulted on bedbug cases involving hotels, cruise ships, movie theaters and nursing homes. “It can be a nightmare for businesses because a lot of claimants in these cases are treating the litigation system like a lottery and are going after the big win.”In addition to personal injury law firms, other businesses benefiting from the bedbug scourge include Protect-A-Bed, based in Chicago, which makes mattress encasements to keep out mites and bedbugs. The company developed the product in 2004 and had sales of $10 million last year, twice as much as in the previous year, according to James Bell, the company’s chief executive. He predicts an even larger jump in sales this year. “The response has been enormous,” he said.Bedbugs gave Linda Develasco of Des Plaines, Ill., a new career when she was laid off from her job as a new-accounts manager at Verizon two years ago. Having learned about bedbugs in the hospitality industry from her fiancé, who was general manager of a hotel, she bought a bedbug-sniffing beagle named Scooby for $9,700. She recouped the expense within three months by doing one to three inspections each week. “He was worth every penny,” said Ms. Develasco, who had been doing mostly residential work but within the last week began inspecting office buildings, retail stores and movie theaters. “It’s been crazy.”Exterminators are also enjoying a windfall after several years of declining revenue as customers cut back on pest control treatments to save money in the tight economy.“I just got a $60,000 contract to take care of bedbugs in an apartment complex,” Tony Esposito, owner of the Bug Reaper, a pest control company in Katy, Tex., shouted into his cellphone as he drove to investigate another bedbug complaint in nearby Houston. “I had to pull my truck over and do a happy dance.”'"

"'10-09-08,'1','She walked her brother’s final steps on a recent lunch break from CitiFinancial. In her suit and name badge, she was a corporate oddity among the stoop-sitters.On Oct. 16, 2005, about 2:50 a.m. in front of 366 Ridgewood Avenue in Brooklyn, the police arrived after calls about a man stabbed multiple times. Paramedics pronounced Luis Beltran dead. He lived just blocks away over the Queens line.On that skeleton of a tale, Ms. Mora has draped the flimsy fabric of what she has picked up. The stabbing occurred near where she and Luis had once lived with their mother, who worked in a nearby bodega, and stepfather. Here, Luis sought refuge in the final minutes of his life, and found none.Ms. Mora said Luis and Carlos, who was just 18 then, had been shooting pool and stopped off at a restaurant and, later, had an argument with a group of men. She said her brother was not the argument-starting kind.Luis and Carlos ran in different directions, she said. Luis called Lenny, an old neighbor up the street. “Lenny’s like, ‘I’m not home, I’m going to send my brother down to help you,’ ” Ms. Mora said. But the brother did not open the door. “He said it was a mob out there.”There was an apartment across the street where a disabled boy lived. “He used to sit in the window with his grandmother.” Ms. Mora heard that Luis banged on the window. There were several 911 calls.Ridgewood Avenue has two-story houses and little pocket gardens. They found Luis in the street, between a parked car and a van. He had been stabbed and beaten so badly that his family could not give him an open coffin.Carlos came to the wake. Luis’s family made it clear he was not welcome at the funeral.Ms. Mora married an old friend. She has not told her husband, Frankie, who Carlos is, for fear Frankie might lose his temper.Carlos Constanza was, in police parlance, an uncooperative witness. “He wasn’t giving us answers we believe he could have given,” Detective Matthew Hutchison said. “He could have helped us ID people” who were there.A man leaving Carlos’s home last week promised to have Carlos call this reporter, but then stopped and admitted that he was Carlos.“There were five guys on him and seven on top of me,” Mr. Constanza, 23, said. “I can’t point out exactly who did it.” That morning, he initially denied even being with Luis, until the detectives told him his friend was dead. The two had been drinking and smoking marijuana, he said, and Luis had called out to a stranger, “I know you!” — and that led to the fight.Two months later, the police asked him to pick out suspects from a photo lineup. He did not, because he was not sure about the photos, but the truth is, he probably would not have anyway, because, he said, “I don’t snitch.”He is a doorman with a 3-year-old child. He knows Luis’s sister, Martha. “I see her all the time,” he said. “She don’t say nothing to me.”Ms. Mora avoids this area and is surprised when a Wonder Bread deliveryman stops and says, “Long time no see.”She smiles back, but the truth is, she could go forever without seeing this place again, if the neighborhood that shopped at her mother’s store and smiled at her and watched her brother ride his skateboard would cough up a killer.'"
"'10-09-08,'1','Though the exact circumstances of Tuesday’s fight remain unknown, the meeting between the company commander and Iraqi forces at the base near Tuz Khurmato is typical of those that take place each day at army and police bases across Iraq.“This is a tragic and cowardly act,” the senior American commander in northern Iraq, Maj. Gen. Tony Cucolo of the Third Infantry Division, said in the statement, “which I firmly believe was an isolated incident and is certainly not reflective of the Iraqi security forces” in the province.The military did not identify the soldiers killed and wounded, or their unit, pending the notification of their next of kin. The military provided few other details, but said an investigation into the firefight had begun.A spokesman for Iraq’s Ministry of Defense, Mohammed al-Askari, identified the Iraqi soldier as Soran Rhaman Falih Wali and the unit as the Fourth Division of the Iraqi Army. He also said an investigation would be conducted.Niazi Uklo, a member of the provincial council in Salahuddin, said in a telephone interview that the soldier, a Kurd, opened fire after a dispute broke out during the meeting on the base.“There was a struggle between an Iraqi Army solider and an American soldier,” Mr. Uklo said. “It escalated into a brawl and ended when the Iraqi soldier opened fire.”American military casualties in Iraq have dropped precipitously since the invasion in 2003, reflecting the withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops and the end of offensive combat operations, a process that began, effectively, many months before Mr. Obama’s own deadline for ending combat by Sept. 1.So far this year, 48 Americans have been killed here, compared with 149 in 2009 and 904 in 2007, the deadliest single year for American troops in Iraq, according to icasualties.org.Most of the deaths this year have involved accidents or suicides, but combat casualties still occur, and in recent weeks there has been an increase in attacks in Iraq generally and against American bases and the American Embassy in Baghdad specifically.Three American soldiers were killed in August, all by hostile fire in Basra, Baquba and Iskandariya, a small town south of Baghdad.'"
"'10-09-08,'1','Federal regulators are examining certain practices involving “quote stuffing,” where large numbers of rapid-fire stock orders are placed and canceled almost immediately, the chairwoman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary L. Schapiro, said on Tuesday.“The S.E.C. and other regulators are looking carefully at certain practices in this area to assess whether they violate existing rules against fraudulent or other improper behavior,” Ms. Schapiro said during a speech before the Economic Club of New York.Regulators were also looking at quote stuffing in connection with the mysterious “flash crash” on May 6 when the Dow Jones industrial average dropped sharply before quickly recovering.Ms. Schapiro appeared to broaden the already wide array of issues the S.E.C. was examining in the wake of the flash crash, including the fact that some firms regularly sent more than 90 buy or sell orders for every trade they ultimately made.A report that may explain the flash crash is expected toward the end of the month, Ms. Schapiro told Reuters before delivering the speech.Regardless, the S.E.C. has introduced a pilot “circuit breaker” program that pauses trading in a single stock if that stock is in a free fall. Ms. Schapiro said the circuit breaker program — which stops trading for five minutes if a stock falls more than 10 percent in five minutes — could be improved.'"
"'10-09-08,'1','By looking good in training camp, Taylor became a subplot on HBO’s “Hard Knocks” documentary series about the Jets. Although Taylor said Thursday, after the preseason finale in Philadelphia, that he thought he had a good chance of making the 53-man roster, he was cut Friday morning.Two days later, the Jets cut Clowney, who had been competing with Taylor for a roster spot, after claiming Patrick Turner, a wide receiver who was cut by the Miami Dolphins. Taylor, 25, became eligible for the practice squad when he cleared waivers. Clowney moved on.“Well, what we’re trying to do is trying to win here,” Jets Coach Rex Ryan said Monday in explaining the move with Clowney. “Whatever we think gives us the best opportunity to win, that’s what we’re going to do. I think, at the end of the day, we get paid to win. Fantasy football, that’s someone else’s deal.”Taylor, a father of three who wears short braids and braces, was the shortest player in camp. He is two inches shorter than safety Jim Leonhard. But Taylor was a star on special teams the last two years for the Montreal Alouettes, earning the C.F.L.’s top special teams player award last season.Ryan said Thursday that another player relatively short in stature, the 5-foot-9 running back Danny Woodhead, had made the team. Aundrae Allison was one of three wide receivers cut early last week. Ryan explained why: he could not play special teams the way Clowney played them. But Clowney was less than spectacular in training camp.“Most people know that if you’re not a starting guy, you’ve got to be able to do other things — and other things are special teams,” said Woodhead, an undrafted free agent. “Your worth shoots up. If you aren’t going to play special teams, they may take a guy who can.”Taylor grew up in Florida but went to the University of Connecticut, where he caught 63 passes. He was an even better kick returner. In his final collegiate game he returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown against Wake Forest in the 2007 Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, N.C.But he was not sensational enough to draw extensive attention from N.F.L. teams. He participated in a workout at UConn for the Cincinnati Bengals, but the workout was really a showcase for defensive back Tyson Branch, now with the Oakland Raiders.“For no one to even take a look at me was kind of disappointing,” Taylor said.Someone named Jim Popp did take a look at Taylor at the Meineke Car Care Bowl. Popp is the Alouettes’ general manager, and he called UConn to find out more about him. Taylor signed with the Alouettes. By the end of his second year, he helped Montreal win the Grey Cup.Taylor led the C.F.L. in punt return yardage and scored two touchdowns in 2009, but he said he really wanted to try the N.F.L. — if a team would have him. The Jets signed him in January and he began working with the special teams coach Mike Westhoff on winning a job.“What he did here was do the most with an opportunity to perform at a pro level,” Popp said in a telephone interview. “So they’re not getting a rookie. They’re getting a pro football player. Players like that are more mature. They’re ready for it.”Taylor thinks his C.F.L. experience benefitted him. He returned seven kickoffs for 175 yards and six punts for 58 yards in the preseason. He also caught four passes, or two more than Clowney, who was also called for a holding penalty. Ryan said Jets scouts “really liked” Turner.Asked Thursday what he thought his chances of making the team were, Clowney said: “I ain’t thinking about that. I just play football.”That is all a player can do, Taylor said. The Jets will cut one wide receiver after the first regular-season game to add the veteran Laveranues Coles, then another after Santonio Holmes is eligible to return after a four-game suspension. The tinkering never ends.So Taylor will focus on each practice repetition, even if it is as inglorious as playing for the scout team offense in practice. From his perspective, being a player on the practice squad is better than not playing at all. And $5,200 a week is more than he got in Canada.“So, that’s a bonus as well,” he said, smiling again.'"

Brett Favre is back in the Vikings’ huddle after Faux Retirement IV, but the Vikings have major questions that go beyond Favre’s gimpy ankle. Their receiving corps is thin in the wake of Sidney Rice’s injury, their big-name offensive line looked like a colander during the preseason, and the superstar running back Adrian Peterson is coming off a three-fumble performance in the Vikings’ 31-28 loss to the Saints in the N.F.C. title game. Despite his age and eroded approval rating, Favre retains the power to relegate the defending champion to the second paragraph.The Saints are unassuming Super Bowl winners. Minor scandals nip at their heels (Reggie Bush’s Heisman Trophy is being melted by the N.C.A.A. and recast as a Yoke of Shame), but the most succulent story to stick to the team has been Sean Payton’s affinity for fruit-flavored gum. “Get me Juicy Fruit!” Payton yelled at the assistant Adam Bailey at the Super Bowl before expressing his distaste for spearmint.Mastication tendencies aside, the major story out of New Orleans at the end of camp was the loss of the wily safety Darren Sharper, 34, who will miss at least six games after surgery. Sharper engaged in a heated Twitter trash-talk battle with the Vikings over this game back in May. The Saints’ offense is as strong as ever, scoring 122 points in the preseason.

"'10-09-09,'1','Now, H.P.’s board needs a major shake-up. It had already shown dubious judgment over a witch hunt to uncover information leaks. Now it has overreacted to “l’affaire Hurd,” and compounded the error by failing to ensure that his departure would not hurt the company. A rearguard legal effort to restrain Mr. Hurd has come too late: the stock has lost $17.5 billion of value since he resigned. By contrast, Oracle’s is unchanged.Mr. Hewlett is no operations man, and his H.P. tenure ended bitterly. But he is an experienced corporate director, knows the company and, above all, carries the spirit of invention and enterprise — the very essence of Silicon Valley’s past half-century — that inspired the company’s founders. It is hard to see better qualities for a new chairman.Successful long-term investors buy good assets when nobody wants them, and sell when the risk-averse pile in. Bonds are considered to be havens today, after the stock market’s lost decade. That could be about to reverse; the great bull market in government bonds is probably over.Since 1982, when runaway inflation was going to destroy capital, if not capitalism itself, bond investors who took the risk that the beast would be tamed have been hugely rewarded. But the opportunity to buy 10-year Treasuries with a 14 percent yield followed a bear market that had wiped out the value of fixed-interest securities.Companies had shown more resilience to rising inflation, so around 1960 in the United States, Britain, Germany and Japan, the “yield gap” between government bonds and shares was reversed. For the next half-century, the dividend yield on shares was below that on government bonds. Until now.In Britain, Germany and Japan, shares now yield more than government debt. In the United States, the gap has shrunk to around 0.3 percent. This, says Citigroup, is the end of the cult of the equity — extinguished by two 50 percent bear markets (after the dot-com mania and then the credit bubble), a glut of equity issuance and the flight of pension funds from shares to bonds.Yet funds are buying bonds because they (or their advisers) deem them low-risk, not because they believe them to be inexpensive. Today’s bond prices signal that inflation will not return for at least a decade, despite sustained and determined efforts from the world’s central banks to stimulate it.The risk that central banks will succeed is not priced into bonds while the risk that they will not — and that economies will stagnate (or worse) — is priced into stocks. Yet companies have rebuilt their balance sheets after the crisis, and despite sluggish top-line growth, dividends — the unsung, vital part of long-term performance — look sustainable.Many companies are even raising their payouts. The FTSE 100 embraces a fair cross section of world shares. Evolution Securities estimates its forward yield at 3.8 percent, while 10-year British gilts return 3 percent. Such inversions are extremely rare — as rare as the best opportunities to buy good assets cheaply.'"

I come to work every day and work hard. Whatever happens happens.”JETS SELL OUT SEASON The Jets said they were sold out for the season at New Meadowlands Stadium and would avoid local TV blackouts. Some club seats, which are not counted in the N.F.L.’s calculation of sellouts, are still for sale.Matthew Higgins, an executive vice president, said the team was 98 to 99 percent sold out, enough to assure that the local market can watch the games. He denied a report that the Jets would pay the league to avoid blackouts.

I have no problem filling my day up.”The N.F.L. fined Ochocinco $25,000 for posting messages on his Twitter account during a preseason game, a violation of its rules on players’ use of social media.

"'10-09-09,'1','Prime Minister David Cameron’s father died Wednesday shortly after the British leader joined other family members at his hospital bedside in Toulon, France. His father, Ian Cameron, 77, had suffered a stroke while on vacation. Mr. Cameron flew to France after learning of his father’s condition Wednesday morning. The trip caused him to cancel an appearance in Parliament, where he was expected to face questioning over the role of his communications director, Andy Coulson, in a cellphone hacking scandal. In a television interview this spring, Mr. Cameron said he had been inspired by his father, who, though born with a severe deformity in both legs that led eventually to their amputation, played competitive tennis as a youth and had a successful career as a stockbroker. “My father is a huge hero figure for me, because he’s an amazingly brave man,” Mr. Cameron said. “To have a disability in the 1930s and 1940s, a different age, was really tough, but he never let it affect him in any way.”'"
"'10-09-09,'1','The nonprofit organization hired by the city to provide preventive services to the family of a bruised and severely malnourished 4-year-old girl who was found dead in her apartment in Brooklyn last week had been the subject of a scathing city audit in 2008.The organization, the Child Development Support Corporation, did not adequately monitor its cases, did not always make the required number of contacts with families required by its city contract, and could not consistently show that parents with substance abuse problems were periodically tested for drugs, according to the audit, which was conducted by the city controller’s office.The audit also said the group could not provide evidence that some of its staff members were properly qualified or had been screened for criminal history.As a result, the audit said, there was “no reasonable assurance” that the group “helped families obtain the preventive services needed to become stabilized so that the children are not placed in foster care.”The audit may help explain why the Administration for Children’s Services chose not to renew the organization’s contract when it expired at the end of June. Immediately after the death of the girl, Marchella Pierce, on Sept. 2, Children’s Services accused the organization of making “far less” than the required two to three visits a week to the girl’s family.

The officials have been missing for more than two weeks, and the discovery underscored the grip that criminal organizations have on the region.The prosecutor’s office in Tamaulipas, a northeastern state near the Texas border where the bodies of the migrants from Central and South America were found on a ranch, said that it had preliminarily identified the bodies as those of two law enforcement officials, but that final confirmation through DNA tests was pending.The officials — Juan Carlos Suárez Sánchez, the chief of police for the small town of San Fernando, and Roberto Jaime Suárez Vázquez, an agent with the state prosecutor’s office — had been missing since they made an initial report on the massacre on Aug. 24.Their bodies were found Monday night in a field about 30 miles from San Fernando, where the migrants’ bodies were found in a ranch building, a spokesman for the state prosecutor’s office said. The cause of the officials’ death is under investigation, the spokesman said.The local news media reported on Aug. 24 that the two officials had been killed, after two bodies were found near the scene of the massacre. But that afternoon President Felipe Calderón told reporters that the men were not dead, but missing.'"
"'10-09-09,'1','The men pushing Iceland as the birthplace of the pieces are two chess aficionados, Gudmundur G. Thorarinsson and Einar S. Einarsson. According to a Web site created to explain his theory, leit.is/lewis, Mr. Thorarinsson is a civil engineer and a former member of the Icelandic Parliament. Mr. Einarsson, a former president of Visa Iceland and a friend of the chess champion Bobby Fischer, is helping to promote the idea.They wrote e-mails to the organizers of the Scottish conference asking that the Icelandic theory be added to the agenda, but they said they were told the schedule had already closed. Still, they say they plan to attend and discuss the idea with scholars there.Mr. Thorarinsson concedes that the idea of Iceland as the source of the chessmen comes from circumstantial evidence, largely based on the history of the development of the rules of the game and its pieces. In a telephone interview, he said the most important clue was that the sets have bishops, which were not used in the rest of Europe until after the time the pieces were made (the equivalent piece, in the form of a messenger was called a runner, and still is in Norway).“The Lewis Chessmen are the only chess pieces found in the world then that have actually connected chess with the church,” Mr. Thorarinsson said.Yet the use of bishops in chess, Mr. Thorarinsson said, is mentioned as far back as the Icelandic sagas from the 10th and 11th centuries — predating the chessmen. The sagas even include descriptions of checkmates using bishops.He also said that Iceland was the only country that used the word bishop at the time the chessmen were made.But Alex Woolf, director of the Institute for Medieval Studies of the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, said that Mr. Thorarinsson was incorrect.“No one would claim that Norway or Iceland was the origin of the use of bishop,” said Dr. Woolf, who will be giving the talk “The Norwegian Empire: Fantasy or Fact?” at the conference. He said that the idea of the bishop came from England but that the practice spread in both directions. “In terms of historical influence,” he said, “this idea was transmitted rather quickly to Norway and Iceland.”Dr. Woolf said that Trondheim, as Norway’s political and cultural center at the time, made sense as the source of the chessmen for several reasons.The walrus tusk used to make the chessmen was expensive, and the pieces would have had to have been made where there were wealthy patrons to employ craftsmen and pay for the material. “A hell of a lot of walrus ivory went into making those chessmen, and Iceland was a bit of a scrappy place full of farmers,” Dr. Woolf said. The pieces are also exquisite works of art, he said, adding, “You don’t get the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Iowa.”He said that scholars believed that the archbishop of Trondheim, who along with the king of Norway had jurisdiction over the Hebrides, was probably the wealthy patron. He may have had them made as gifts, based on the cost of the ivory and the quality of the carving.“What seems like the smoking gun is while they were excavating in the archbishop’s palace, they found a broken queen, and it looks like it was broken before it was finished,” Dr. Woolf said, speaking of Trondheim. “It was the right period and the right style.”That is not the only evidence. In a 2009 paper called “The Lewis Hoard of Gaming Pieces: A Re-Examination of Their Context, Meanings, Discovery and Manufacture,” two of the authors, Dr. David H. Caldwell of the National Museums of Scotland and Mark A. Hall, of the Perth Museum and Art Gallery, also in Scotland, mentioned that on a visit to Trondheim they had found carving work in the Nidaros Cathedral similar to work on the chessmen; they saw a wooden, kite-shape shield that was recently excavated that was similar in design to the shields on some of the pieces; and they saw a king made of whale tooth, again of similar design, that was found on Hitra Island near the mouth of the Trondheim fjord.Mr. Thorarinsson said that the existence of the other pieces and carvings did not rule out his theory. “The artists in Iceland, they studied in Trondheim,” he said. “They knew the carving style.” He said that most walrus tusk came from Greenland, which was settled by Icelanders, so it was possible that it could have been acquired in trade, particularly as Iceland is closer to Greenland than Norway is.But Dr. Woolf said that there were additional clues that favored Norway over Iceland. For example, the pieces of armor on the carvings are perfect reproductions of what knights wore at the time. “It looks like they had access to the real thing,” Dr. Woolf said. “Iceland didn’t have knights.”In the end, Dr. Woolf said of Mr. Thorarinsson’s theory, “What he is arguing is not impossible, but a Norwegian explanation sounds more likely.”'"
"'10-09-09,'1','For the midcentury ships Mr. Knego loves, the beginning of the end was 9/11, which led to a decline in tourism that made many of the liners unprofitable. Now the end of the end is approaching. New provisions of the international Safety of Life at Sea (Solas) convention, effective Oct. 1, prohibit wooden construction in overnight passenger ships. That provision, Mr. Knego said, dooms most ships built before 1970, which would require such extensive refurbishment that it’s more economical to scrap them.Mr. Knego expects several of those ships — including the Mona Lisa (formerly the Kungsholm) — to end up in Alang. After that, he said, “It will just be the ships of the ‘Love Boat’ generation — with cheap, mass-produced details.”Mr. Knego said that as a child he had various fixations — butterflies and Henry VIII — but that he found his true passion in the eighth grade, when he wrote a paper on the Lusitania. As an adult, he took as many cruises as he could on the midcentury ships.In 2004, Mr. Knego, now 50, was working as a record promoter when he heard that one of those ships, the Stella Solaris, built in France in 1952, was headed to Alang. “I didn’t want to go,” he said, “but I knew I had to do it.”Since then, he said, “Every time I recover from one trip, I hear about another ship. It’s been non-stop for the last five years.”The process, he said, is driven more by the desire to save bits of maritime history than to make money. He supports himself in part by writing articles about cruise ships and in part from sales of a video that documents his first trip to Alang. Alang isn’t Mr. Knego’s idea of a vacation destination. He doesn’t like heat or bugs or heights — all three of which abound during his sojourns.The cruise lines sell the ships to Alang’s ship-breaking tycoons, who profit by recycling the steel and other materials recovered from the vessels. When the ships arrive in Alang, they are run onto the beaches at high tide, then allowed to sink into the sand, making it possible for workers to clamber aboard.Human rights groups say those workers are handling asbestos and other hazardous materials with little if any protection. According to the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking, a coalition of advocacy groups, ship breaking as practiced in South Asia “creates unacceptable levels of death, injury, work-related diseases and environmental pollution.”Mr. Knego’s attitude is that if the ships are going to be destroyed — however that happens — he would like to save as many of their riches as he can. But because the ship breakers would prefer to avoid prying eyes, he said, foreigners are generally unwelcome in Alang. Mr. Knego, who has light brown hair and pale blue eyes, moves around town in the backseat of a car, a Hindi newspaper covering his face.He gets to the ships by launch, or sometimes simply by wading (being 6-foot-3 helps). Once he identifies the items worth saving, Mr. Knego said, he makes the ship breakers an offer, “based on what I think the market is in India.”“Then they multiply it by 10, because I’m a Westerner,” he added. “And then we haggle back and forth.”Mr. Knego and his partner of 22 years, Mike Masino, a cost estimator for an aerospace company, have decorated their house with as much of the cache as possible. The living room is centered on a bar from the Aureol, which was built in Glasgow in 1951. Dining room furniture is from the Aureol, the Ivernia and the Stella Oceanis. A stair with a railing salvaged from the Ivernia leads to the second floor, where the master bedroom contains a mirror from the Empress of Canada and art from the Stella Oceanis by the Italian painter Emanuele Luzzati.For Mr. Knego, living among the items is a kind of déjà vu. Growing up in the Hollywood Hills in the 1970s, he persuaded his father, an actor who went by Peter Coe, to take him to see the ships when they docked in San Pedro or Long Beach Harbor.Thanks to brochures from travel agents, he knew the ships’ arrival dates as much as a year in advance, and planned his excursions accordingly.Once on the ships — in those days, there was no security to keep him off — Mr. Knego would take extensive notes on the décor. Those notes and the accompanying photographs proved handy more than 30 years later. When he hears that a ship is about to be scrapped, Mr. Knego knows exactly what’s onboard; that lets him decide whether to make the trip to India. (He generally stays in Alang, which is 500 miles northwest of Mumbai, for two weeks at a time.)Along with thousands of brochures sent to the teenage Mr. Knego by the cruise lines, the notes and photos fill more than a dozen filing cabinets. They compete for space in the house with items like a huge painting of New York Harbor by the British artist William Ware for the Olympia. Mr. Knego and Mr. Masino refuse to part with it, even though they don’t have a wall big enough to hold it, which is why it sits on its side in the family room.But Mr. Knego hopes to sell most of his stock, some of which has traveled the world to end up under tarpaulins in his backyard or the five storage units he rents in nearby Simi Valley. Until the buyers come along, he said, “I need a bigger house — or two.”'"
"'10-09-09,'1','I got a bowl of rice or something, and I suddenly woke up and left. Luckily, my friend was waiting for me in a hotel in the town. When he had dropped me off, he’d told me he’d wait. And I said: “Oh no, I’m here for a year. I’m waiting for enlightenment.”How have the monks reviewed their new buildings?They are appreciative, though I think perhaps the younger ones don’t necessarily understand why they need to have architecture. The more mature ones realize the importance of architecture in helping their daily lives. It’s a place they feel good in; it allows them to concentrate on whatever task they have at hand. They were very specific when they chose me. They didn’t want anything arty, anything pretentious. What they didn’t understand was how long it takes to design something.Bruce Chatwin, the writer for whom you designed a 150-square-foot apartment many years ago, believed that human beings were by nature nomadic. All of his books explored that theme in one way or another. So a fixed home — even so tiny and “thingless” a home — was an unusual concept for him. Did you ever discuss that?The thing about Bruce is you tended to do the listening. He was such a good mimic, and such a good raconteur, and had such a wealth of embellished stories. He would turn up unannounced in London for breakfast with “The Songlines” in draft form. When he’d used the bathroom and had some bacon and eggs, he’d start reading. He didn’t ask whether you wanted it or not.The apartment you made for him was so tiny, and you designed it like a ship’s cabin; then you began to get real nautical commissions. In your book, Alison Morris writes about the “Pantone-consistent aesthetic — white clothes, white house, white car and white yacht” of the family for whom you designed an all-white racing boat. Did their children dress in white, too?No, of course not. But the crew of the boat wore white. And the car was beautiful and white.Did you get to go sailing when the boat was finished?No, it was too windy.What are you doing this weekend — any sailing trips planned?Catherine, my wife, has persuaded me to get back on my bicycle. We’re doing a charity challenge ride for diabetes right after the show opens at the London Design Museum. It’s a three-day ride from London to Amsterdam. My son has juvenile diabetes, so it’s a charity close to my heart.That’s a long trip, I’m impressed. How are your knees?Everything is fine, except the overall feeling. I hadn’t realized you don’t stay the same strength forever. It’s the same with architecture. You get your best jobs now, when you don’t have the energy. Of course, when you’re young, you have the energy and no work. Luckily, most of the people who do the work here in my office are young.'"
"'10-09-09,'1','Juan Luis Guerra, Alejandro Sanz, Jorge Drexler and Mario Domm, far left, lead the nominations for the 11th annual Latin Grammy Awards, announced on Wednesday morning in Los Angeles. Those veteran musicians received four nominations apiece (Mr. Domm, a producer and songwriter from Mexico, shares three of his with his band, Camila), and will face one another — along with some newer faces — in most major categories. Up for album of the year are Camila’s “Dejarte de Amar”; “A Son de Guerra” by Mr. Guerra, from the Dominican Republic; “Paraíso Express” by Mr. Sanz, a Spanish singer-songwriter who has 14 Latin Grammys under his belt; “Cardio” by Miguel Bosé, also from Spain; and “Y.” by Bebe, above right, a young Spanish singer who is up for two prizes.

"'10-09-09,'1','Its counterterrorism programs have in some ways departed from the expectations of change fostered by ’s campaign rhetoric, which was often sharply critical of former President ’s approach.Among other policies, the Obama national security team has also authorized the C.I.A. to try to kill a United States citizen suspected of terrorism ties, blocked efforts by detainees in to bring lawsuits challenging the basis for their imprisonment without trial, and continued the C.I.A.’s so-called extraordinary rendition program of prisoner transfers — though the administration has forbidden torture and says it seeks assurances from other countries that detainees will not be mistreated.The A.C.L.U. vowed to appeal the Jeppesen Dataplan case to the Supreme Court, which would present the Roberts court with a fresh opportunity to weigh in on a high-profile test of the scope and limits of presidential power in counterterrorism matters.It has been more than 50 years since the Supreme Court issued a major ruling on the , a judicially created doctrine that the government has increasingly used to win dismissals of lawsuits related to national security, shielding its actions from judicial review. In 2007, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal of a similar rendition and torture ruling by the federal appeals court in , Va.The current case turns on whether the executive can invoke the state-secrets privilege to shut down entire lawsuits, or whether that power should be limited to withholding particular pieces of secret information. In April 2009, a three-judge panel on the Ninth Circuit adopted the narrower view, ruling that the lawsuit as a whole should proceed.But the Obama administration appealed to the full San Francisco-based appeals court. A group of 11 of its judges reheard the case, and a narrow majority endorsed the broader view of executive secrecy powers. They concluded that the lawsuit must be dismissed without a trial — even one that would seek to rely only on public information.“This case requires us to address the difficult balance the state secrets doctrine strikes between fundamental principles of our liberty, including justice, transparency, accountability and national security,” Judge Fisher wrote. “Although as judges we strive to honor all of these principles, there are times when exceptional circumstances create an irreconcilable conflict between them.”Ben Wizner, a senior A.C.L.U. lawyer who argued the case before the appeals court, said the group was disappointed in the ruling.“To this date, not a single victim of the Bush administration’s torture program has had his day in court,” Mr. Wizner said. “That makes this a sad day not only for the torture survivors who are seeking justice in this case, but for all Americans who care about the rule of law and our nation’s reputation in the world. If this decision stands, the will have closed its courts to torture victims while providing complete to their torturers.”Some plaintiffs in the case said they were tortured by at an agency “black site” prison in Afghanistan, while others said they were tortured by and after the C.I.A. handed them off to foreign security services.The lead plaintiff is , an Ethiopian citizen and legal resident of who was arrested in in 2002. He claimed he was turned over to the C.I.A., which flew him to Morocco and handed him off to its security service.Moroccan interrogators, he said, held him for 18 months and subjected him to an array of tortures, including cutting his penis with a scalpel and then pouring a hot, stinging liquid on the open wounds.Mr. Mohamed was later transferred back to the C.I.A., which he said flew him to its secret prison in Afghanistan. There, he said, he was held in continuous darkness, fed sparsely and subjected to loud noise — like the recorded screams of women and children — 24 hours a day.He was later transferred again to the military prison at , , where he was held for an additional five years. He was released and returned to Britain in early 2009 and is now free.There were signs in the court’s ruling that the majority felt conflicted. In a highly unusual move, the court ordered the government to pay the plaintiffs’ legal costs, even though they lost the case and had not requested such payment.Judge Fisher, who was a senior Justice Department official before President appointed him to the bench in 1999, also urged the executive branch and Congress to grant reparations to victims of C.I.A. “misjudgments or mistakes” that violated their human rights if government records confirmed their accusations, even though the courthouse was closed to them.He cited as precedent payments made to Latin Americans of Japanese descent who were forcibly sent to United States internment camps during World War II. But the five dissenting judges criticized the realism of that idea, noting that those reparations took five decades.“Permitting the executive to police its own errors and determine the remedy dispensed would not only deprive the judiciary of its role, but also deprive plaintiffs of a fair assessment of their claims by a neutral arbiter,” Judge Michael Daly Hawkins wrote.After the A.C.L.U. filed the case in 2007, the Bush administration asked a district judge to dismiss it, submitting public and classified declarations by the C.I.A. director at the time, , arguing that litigating the matter would jeopardize national security.The trial judge dismissed the case. As an appeal was pending, Mr. Obama won the 2008 presidential election. Although he had criticized the Bush administration’s frequent use of the state-secrets privilege, in February 2009 his weeks-old administration told the appeals court that it agreed with the Bush view in that case.In September 2009, Attorney General issued a new state-secrets privilege policy requiring high-level approval, instructing officials to try to avoid shutting down lawsuits if possible, and forbidding its use with a motive of covering up lawbreaking or preventing embarrassment.The administration told the court that using the privilege in the Jeppesen Dataplan case complied with that policy.Judge Fisher agreed that “the government is not invoking the privilege to avoid embarrassment or to escape scrutiny of its recent controversial transfer and interrogation policies, rather than to protect legitimate national security concerns.”Jeppesen Dataplan and the C.I.A. referred questions to the Justice Department, where a spokesman, Matthew Miller, praised its new standards.“The attorney general adopted a new policy last year to ensure the state-secrets privilege is only used in cases where it is essential to protect national security, and we are pleased that the court recognized that the policy was used appropriately in this case,” Mr. Miller said.'"
"'10-09-09,'1','Last year’s minuscule, buttonless iPod Shuffle, with its earbuds, almost looked like dental floss snagged on a tie clip. The new one, though, looks a lot like the Shuffle of two years ago, complete with playback and volume buttons, although it’s slightly smaller (1.1 by 1.2 by 0.3 inches).When you press a button on top, the new Shuffle speaks the name of the current song or playlist out loud in a computer-generated voice (a feature retained from the tie-clip Shuffle). Apple would probably tell you, though, that the Shuffle’s best feature is its price: $50. (The storage is 2 gigabytes, and you have a choice of five metallic colors.)The riskiest new iPod is the Nano, which dispenses with the click wheel that has come to define the iPod. Instead, the entire front surface is a glass touch screen like an ’s. The software looks like the iPhone’s, too. You navigate by swiping the screen left or right, you play a song by touching its name and you rotate a photo by twisting two fingers on the screen.In fact, you can rotate the entire screen that way. That’s handy, because the Nano now has a clothing clip, too, and you don’t always clip it on upright.The Nano is now about the size of a Triscuit, so only about four of the traditional iPhonish icons fit on a screen. You will have to do a lot of flipping through the screens until you find the control or the list you want. To return to the Home screen, you can either keep swiping to the right, or just hold down your finger for a moment on any empty part of the screen. (You can rearrange the icons, but you can’t install any new ones; it’s not really the iPhone software.)The touch screen is smooth as silk, quick to respond, and crazy fun to use. So much fun, in fact, that you may completely miss how inefficient it really is. In lists, only three song or album names at a time fit on that tiny screen.Note, too, that while Apple giveth, Apple sometimes taketh away, big time; in this round it has removed the previous Nano’s camcorder, video playback and alarm clock, and even its tiny speaker. Maybe that would have been too much to cram into a 1.5 x 1.6 x 0.4-inch square, but it’s sad to see them go.The FM radio is, mercifully, still there, and you can even look at your photos, although an electron microscope would be helpful. (You can’t spread two fingers to zoom in, as on the iPhone and Touch. You can double-tap to enlarge a photo a bit, but that’s it.)The really bad news: bizarrely, the earbuds supplied with all of this year’s iPods no longer have playback controls on the cord. That’s O.K. on the Shuffle, which has physical buttons for Pause and Next Song. But on the new Nano and Touch, you can’t pause or change songs without stopping your run, looking down, waking the screen and tapping buttons on the glass (or yanking out the earbuds). Bad Apple!Your only option is to pay $30 for Apple’s playback-control earbuds, or $11 for a Scosche adapter that adds these controls to any earbuds or earphones. Factor that in when you’re considering the new Nano, which otherwise costs $150 for the 8-gigabyte model and $180 for 16 gigabytes.Without question, the most droolworthy new iPod is the new iPod Touch ($230 to $400, for capacities of 8 to 64 gigabytes).Because it looks like an iPhone and can run the same 250,000 apps, the Touch is often described as “an iPhone without the phone”— and now, that’s more true than ever. The Touch gains front and back video cameras, microphone and the iPhone 4’s high-resolution screen (what Apple calls the Retina display).At 4.4 by 2.3 by 0.28 inches, the Touch is also noticeably thinner, almost nuttily so. You could use it as a letter opener.The built-in mike and speaker make the Touch a Wi-Fi cellphone. Apps like or Line2 let you make free or cheap phone calls whenever you’re in a Wi-Fi hot spot. (The speaker’s on the bottom, so you can’t really hold it to your ear, but the speakerphone or Apple’s $30 earbuds work fine.) And using a free app like TextFree, you can send all the you like without paying the phone company anything.The new Touch can also do FaceTime calls: high-quality, effort-free video chats with any iPhone 4 or this version of the Touch. (Touch-to-Touch video calls work great already. Touch-to-iPhone calling will be available when Apple releases its free iOS 4.1 iPhone software update this week.)The new cameras let you take photos and record video (in the case of the back camera, high-definition video). The Touch’s cameras aren’t as good as the iPhone’s excellent 5-megapixel camera with flash; the Touch’s photos aren’t even a single megapixel, and there’s no flash. But you know: baby steps.Above all, Apple intends for the Touch to be the ultimate game machine. Already, the company says, the Touch outsells and pocket players combined. The new Touch has the same screaming-fast chip as the and iPhone 4, along with a new Game Center app that lets you compete wirelessly with other iPhone and Touch owners.In other words, even though Apple commits itself to churning out new iPod designs every year, the 2010 crop includes a modestly improved model at a better price (the Shuffle), an exciting but risky touch-screen model (the Nano), and a home run (the Touch). (The high-capacity iPod Classic, with a hard drive inside and the last remaining click wheel, is still available, although Apple didn’t say a word about it at last week’s iPod coming-out party.)Of course, the online Apple bashers will be jumping in with their own annual prose templates. (“Once again, Apple’s arrogance is on display as it forces the _____ lemmings to buy its overpriced ____-ware.”) And it hasn’t escaped the pundits’ notice that the market for stand-alone players is no longer growing.But the new iPods are still beautiful, smooth and a pleasure to use. Yes, yes, that’s the consensus every year — but isn’t that a good thing?'"
"'10-09-09,'1','When Barbara Cook sighs the word in the opening phrases of “Cheek to Cheek,” the title song of her duet show with Michael Feinstein, you really feel as if she had just found paradise. And so have you.As a musical couple, Ms. Cook and Mr. Feinstein, whose 54th birthday was celebrated at Tuesday’s opening night performance at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency, suggest a modern-day Rogers and Astaire. Although they don’t dance, their artistic chemistry, in which Mr. Feinstein, gallantly squires Ms. Cook, 82, through the American songbook, has the same kind of courtly grace. Ms. Cook, like Rogers, is a no-nonsense gal: in her words, “a simple country girl.” Mr. Feinstein is a suave, adoring partner who gladly defers to the woman he described as “the world’s greatest interpreter of the American songbook.”Their two-part harmonies were impeccable; their comedic give-and-take on “You Could Drive a Person Crazy” carried a sharp comic bite. Katharine Hepburn’s famous observation that Rogers gave Astaire sex and Astaire gave Rogers class might be revised to say, Ms. Cook gives Mr. Feinstein reality, and he gives her fantasy. After all, you can’t have one without a little bit of the other.The simple country girl confessed to having long resisted the lyrics of Cole Porter and to feeling alienated from the blasé attitude implied by “flying too high with some guy in the sky.” Then she delivered a version of “I’ve Got You Under My Skin,” that turned it into a heart-rending description of love addiction comparable in depth to Sondheim’s “Losing My Mind,” a longtime Cook staple.Lee Musiker arranged the song in a Sondheim style underpinned with obsessive piano figures; the phrase “stop before I begin,” revolved around the “stop,” a ringingly dissonant musical alarm.In a his-and-hers medley of “The Very Thought of You” and “Tea for Two,” the abstract dreaminess of the first song melted into the second song’s picture of intimate togetherness. Marcy Heisler and Zina Goldrich’s fairy tale ballad “Ever After” was answered by “Where Do You Start?” in which the dream has shattered, and all that’s left is to pick up the pieces.'"
"'10-09-09,'1','At the same time, though, the underlying, longer-term economic problem was coming into focus: the was slowly moving away from the industrial age and into a digitized and globally competitive world, and that transformation was threatening to displace the middle class and erode the country’s economic dominance in the decades ahead.There were thoughtful liberals who argued, as far back as the 1980s, that policy makers needed to distinguish in the public mind between basic domestic spending, much of which goes to sustain less affluent and older Americans day to day, and the kind of public that might give future workers better access to the new economy.Retooling the education system, installing universal broadband, upgrading rail lines and electrical grids — these were things that only an active government could realistically do, just as an earlier generation of politicians had built the dams and highways that were the ballast of the industrial economy. Getting such projects done justified some tolerable level of public debt, proponents argued, just as a family might consider a steep on a home in a high-quality school district to be an investment in the children’s success.And yet, little was achieved by way of investing in 21st-century infrastructure, largely because the public never seemed open to the idea of huge new spending.Recall now the portentous moment when Mr. Obama assumed the presidency in 2009. In those first weeks, Mr. Obama had an approval rating that reached 70 percent, and he benefited from a clear public consensus that the United States had reached a cataclysmic moment of reckoning in its economic life — and that neither he nor his party had caused it.That was a moment, perhaps, when Mr. Obama might have given one of his trademark orations to an anxious public, an opportunity to lay out the different dimensions of the economic crisis in a way that had eluded his predecessors. You could have imagined Mr. Obama’s explaining then that the country had to respond in two related but distinct ways: first by spending hundreds of billions of dollars in the short term to avoid a depression, and second by making a series of large-scale investments over time that would modernize the foundation of the economy.What happened, instead, was this: The administration turned control of the roughly $800 billion over to Congress. Congress decided that the most expedient thing to do was to throw every kind of expenditure one could think of, short-term and long-term, into a single bill, because the public was willing to spend the money right then and the legislative politics required addressing the demands of disparate constituencies.This is what , the White House chief of staff, meant when he said that you “should never let a serious crisis go to waste” — that the stimulus bill had to pack in as much investment as possible, because the chance to spend on such transformative priorities might not come again.Whether or not this was sound economic policy, it was a fateful decision. The long-awaited teachable moment about the need for long-term investment was lost. Mr. Obama would later try, fitfully, to explain the separate need for public investment. But more often, he has done what he did again this week, which is to emphasize the argument that making investments in infrastructure is worthwhile mostly to stimulate the sluggish economy in the short run.The problem with this argument is that it builds support for neither short-term nor long-term spending. Republicans have had considerable success making the very term “stimulus” seem toxic — and since voters see no real distinction between stimulus spending and long-term investment, they are just as likely to see the latter as a waste of tax dollars, too.What all of this means for the country is that even if Mr. Obama ultimately succeeds in stabilizing the economy, he faces a political climate that seems to be growing more hostile to the scale of public investment that many economists say the nation needs to keep pace with foreign competitors.And that, you would think, is the very definition of a crisis having gone to waste.'"
"'10-09-09,'1','BAGHDAD — The killing of two American soldiers by an Iraqi soldier at a military base north of Baghdad was a “deliberate act” but would not undermine the new American mission to advise Iraq ’s security forces, the American military said in a statement on Wednesday.The deaths — the first American casualties here since President Obama declared the official end to American combat in Iraq last week — appeared to have stemmed from an argument that escalated into gunfire, according to Iraqi officials and a relative of the Iraqi soldier involved.The Iraqi soldier, identified as Soran Rahman Falih Wali, was killed in the firefight that erupted Tuesday afternoon at a small base described as a commando compound near the city of Tuz Khurmato, in Salahuddin Province. Nine American soldiers were wounded.A joint American-Iraqi force detained the soldier’s brother, Marwan Abdul Rahman Salih, according to Iraqi officials, as part of what the American military said would be a “detailed investigation” of the firefight, which marred the steady transfer of all combat operations to Iraq’s army and police forces.A police commander in Tuz Khurmato, Capt. Daham Abdullah, identified the brother as a police officer, though it was not clear whether he had any connection to the attack itself. The joint force also raided Mr. Wali’s house, not far from the base, but his family had left, Captain Abdullah said.A relative, Zargan Kfoor, described Mr. Wali as a dedicated soldier who had recently married and become more devout. Only hours before the attack, he and an official on the base said, Mr. Wali had escorted eight detainees to a police operations room on the base.“At the time, he was not angry about anything, and his attitude was good,” said the official, Awni Abdul Hussein.Mr. Kfoor, however, said that Mr. Wali had been teased by some of the Americans he worked with, possibly because of his religious views.“His reactions were very strong,” he said.The American military provided few additional details, and as a matter of policy did not release the names of those killed, pending notification of their families.“Though this incident is tragic and our first concern is for our comrades and their families, it doesn’t affect our strong commitment to the mission of advising and assisting the Iraqi security forces as they continue to sacrifice each day for security and stability in their nation,” said the senior military spokesman in Iraq, Brig. Gen. Jeffery Buchanan.The attack underscored the risks still facing the nearly 50,000 American troops remaining in Iraq as they work beside Iraqi security forces, who themselves face daily attacks from insurgents.In Tarmiya, on Baghdad’s northern edge, a suicide car bomb exploded near a gas station on Wednesday, killing 3 people, including an Iraqi soldier, and wounding 10 others, 5 of them soldiers. It was the largest of a series of attacks across Baghdad that killed at least three others and wounded two dozen.In Mosul, in northern Iraq, a television journalist was shot and killed on Wednesday, the second killed in two days. The journalist, Safaa al-Din Abdul Hamid, anchored a program called “Our Mosques” for a provincial television network. The day before, an anchor for the state Iraqiya network, Riyadh al-Saray, was shot to death on a street in Baghdad.A report by Reporters Without Borders, released Tuesday, said that 230 journalists and other employees of local and international media organizations had died here since the American invasion, making it the deadliest war for the news media since World War II.Insurgents have often attacked journalists, and bombed the Arabiya television network’s headquarters in Baghdad in July. Muayad al-Lami, the secretary general of the main union of journalists, said the government needed to increase security for news organizations and prominent journalists.“We have demanded that they provide real protection and have made proposals to the security authorities and to the Parliament,” he said, “but we didn’t get a response.”'"
"'10-09-09,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan — The first police station has been opened in Marja, seven months after United States Marines started operations to take control of that Taliban stronghold in southern Helmand Province, military officials said Wednesday.“We have all seen the past of Marja,” Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Richard P. Mills, the NATO military commander in southwestern Afghanistan, was quoted as saying in a military statement issued Wednesday about a ribbon-cutting for the station that was held Sunday. “Now we can see the future of Marja, and I think that future is a happy one.”The police station consists of tents and fortifications, and it includes living and working quarters, as well as holding cells, said the statement, released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. Construction is under way on a larger center, the statement added.The statement said that there were 300 trained police officers assigned to Marja, where as recently as April there were no trained officers. The district has a population of about 60,000.¶ Elsewhere in Afghanistan, three Afghan National Army soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb that struck their vehicle on Tuesday in the Sabari district of eastern Khost Province, said the Khost provincial police chief, Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai, on Wednesday. A Taliban spokesman said the group claimed responsibility for the attack.'"

"'10-09-10,'1','The Saints took a quick 7-0 lead on a 29-yard touchdown reception by Devery Henderson and looked exactly like the offense that dominated the N.F.L. last season. But one Brees overthrow on a deep route by Henderson on New Orleans’s second drive — which might have given the Saints an early two-touchdown lead — seemed to throw the whole offense out of rhythm even against a depleted Vikings secondary.After that, the Saints sputtered as they rarely did during their Super Bowl run, when they were held to 17 or fewer points just three times. They stalled. They staggered. And strangest of all, when Vikings quarterback Brett Favre threw his first interception of the season late in the second quarter — he didn’t throw his first of 2009 until Game 3 — they seized up, running twice to little effect, throwing incomplete on third down and missing a 46-yard field-goal attempt.The team that had battered the Vikings into one mistake after another in January’s N.F.C. championship game looked, however briefly, more like the dearly departed ’Aints than the team that was still being celebrated when the N.F.L. kicked off the season Thursday night.It was just enough to breathe hope into the Vikings. Intent on not letting Favre get battered the way he did in January, the Vikings opened the game with one run after another, relying on Adrian Peterson to take the pounding that the Vikings fear Favre can no longer tolerate with a bad ankle.With the Saints unable to convert after their brilliant opening drive despite a nonstop bombardment of Brees passes — he attempted 21 passes in the first half compared with just 3 rushes for the Saints — the Vikings’ conservative approach did exactly what it was intended to do: keep the Saints off the field for long stretches.The Vikings got only a field goal out of a 16-play drive to start the second quarter, but it took more than nine minutes away from Brees. And then, out of nowhere at the end of the second quarter, Favre showed why he just can’t walk away from football. He hit Visanthe Shiancoe with a perfect strike up the seam for a 33-yard gain and followed it with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Shiancoe for a touchdown. The Vikings had the lead, albeit 9-7 after a missed extra point, and Favre, criticized heavily for how his retirement dithering hijacked the Vikings’ off-season, had his vindication.“We rushed the ball well,” Favre said. “But we were always playing catch-up. The pressure was always on us to make the plays. I didn’t make them.”Smith said Favre, who missed all of training camp before returning to the Vikings, looked a little uncomfortable in the pocket during the night and he completed just four passes in the second half. Favre was 0-4 in the third quarter, and with his wideouts catching only three passes all night, perhaps Favre was feeling the absence of last year’s security-blanket receiver, Sidney Rice, who had hip surgery and is out for at least half the season.The absence of a reliable receiver showed up again when Hartley missed a 32-yard field-goal attempt with 9 minutes 10 seconds remaining in the game, and the Vikings could not sustain a drive.“You can attribute it to whatever,” Favre said. “People will call it rusty. It falls back on me. Those guys run the routes. I have to make the throws. I didn’t make enough of them. I know we’re better. Plays were there to be made.”How uncharacteristic was this game for the Saints? They turned to the running game early in the third quarter, running eight times on an 11-play drive, to hammer a defense that might prove to be Minnesota’s shortcoming this year.When it was over, Pierre Thomas ran around the left guard for a 1-yard touchdown that restarted the party in the Superdome.With Favre misfiring, the “Who Dat” chant went up again in New Orleans as time slowly slipped off the clock. But this time it seemed as if Saints fans were wondering what had become of their team, rather than celebrating a victory.Just before kickoff, players from both teams briefly stepped a few feet onto the field and raised their index fingers in an preplanned “We are one” gesture as a show of solidarity as the N.F.L. begins its final season before the expiration of the existing collective bargaining agreement. Saints quarterback DREW BREES, who has been active in the union, was one of the players involved in organizing the moment. “That’s to symbolize we’re one team, one group, one voice,” Brees said after the game.'"

"'10-09-10,'1','“I think it is pretty obvious that there is no other choice,” he said.William Beavers, a Cook County Board commissioner who was chairman of the council’s Budget Committee from 2001 to 2006, said, “They just about sold everything they could sell, so the next mayor is going to catch hell.”Some observers said that making the necessary cuts or tax increases would doom Mr. Daley’s successor to a much shorter tenure than the mayor’s 21-year run.The city’s financial state will be “the overarching issue of the mayoral race,” said Jerry Morrison, the Illinois political director for the Service Employees International Union, the top political campaign donor in the state.“If you want to talk about crime in many communities, we are short 2,000 officers, and hiring more means money,” Mr. Morrison said. “If you want to talk about education, there is a deficit at the Chicago Public Schools, and that means money.”Mr. Daley carefully crafted an image as the chief executive of a city government that operated like a corporation. As the city’s finances soured, he and his aides blamed the general economic downturn for the budget woes. In recent weeks, the mayor repeatedly asserted that Chicago was doing better financially than the state or federal government and other major American cities.The city’s credit rating was downgraded last month by Fitch agency analysts, who noted that Chicago’s government has been living beyond its means for years. The Wall Street analysts pointed out that the city began drawing on its reserves in 2006 and 2007, before the economy went into recession.Gene Saffold, Mr. Daley’s chief financial officer, explained the credit downgrade by saying Chicago’s bond rating was still no lower than that of New York or Los Angeles.But the analysts gave Chicago a “negative” financial outlook while rating New York and Los Angeles as “stable.” New York has saved enough money to offset its 2011 budget shortfall, along with spending cuts, a rollback of property tax cuts and conservative revenue projections, according to the Fitch analysts.They also noted that New York’s pensions were “well funded.” Chicago’s are badly underfunded, and no major reforms have been enacted, although Mr. Daley formed a commission to address the issue.Moreover, while New York generated and saved budget surpluses in the economic boom, the Daley administration did not build nearly as large a cushion into its budgets as government finance experts recommend.Chicago’s budget hole in 2012 is likely to be at least as large as the projected record deficit for 2011, said Dana Levenson, who was Mr. Daley’s chief financial officer from 2004 to 2007.“I don’t think many of the people who want the job now are thinking about it,” Mr. Levenson said of the mushrooming ranks of mayoral hopefuls.In recent years, Mr. Daley refrained from raising property taxes and relied heavily on revenues that rise and fall with the general economy, including the tax on real- estate sales.Even though the problems are worsened by the poor economy, experts speak of a structural deficit facing Chicago. The city’s costs are rising faster than inflation, at a time when revenues are dropping.Costs are high in part because the mayor entered into a 10-year deal in 2007 with major unions representing city employees. The agreement promised attractive wage increases and benefits for blue-collar city workers like garbage collectors, snow plow drivers and hoisting engineers.Unions representing city employees have agreed to forgo wage increases this year and to take as many as 24 unpaid furlough days, which amount to a 9 percent pay cut. But there is no guarantee that labor leaders will agree to those concessions as part of the city’s 2011 fiscal plans or to help balance the next mayor’s budgets.Personnel costs make up 80 percent of the city’s budget, and most of that money goes toward paying police and firefighters. That severely limits the city’s ability to address the budget deficit without sharp cuts in public-safety services.For instance, firefighters are paid $65,000 to $82,000 a year, while garbage-truck drivers receive an hourly wage of $32.95, which works out to almost $70,000 a year before the furlough days.Worker wages rose because officials wanted to offer pay that is competitive with the private sector’s, said Alderman Helen Shiller (46th Ward), who is not seeking re-election after more than 20 years in office.“The problem is really the employee costs,” Ms. Shiller said. “There was a real attempt in the 1980s and 1990s to meet the market rate for the different jobs that we had, and we were a little schizophrenic about it. On the one hand, we said we had to be competitive. On the other, why are we paying so much for these people?”One option is to tap the huge reserves in the mayor’s tax increment financing accounts, a development tool relying on tax dollars that would otherwise go to schools, parks and other units of local government. Derided by some critics as a mayoral “slush fund” for real- estate developers, the accounts have accumulated about $500 million a year. Mr. Daley has long defended the program as crucial to encouraging economic development, but he recently said he would consider draining the accounts to help bring down the deficit.“That’s not really a silver bullet,” said Mr. Burke, the finance committee chairman.By state law, only about 20 percent of the money taken from the accounts could directly aid city finances, with the rest going to schools and parks after all.Despite carrying an already heavy debt load, aldermen this week approved Mr. Daley’s plan to borrow $1 billion to continue expanding O’Hare International Airport.Bill Abolt, the budget director for Mr. Daley from 2002 to 2004, said that avoiding deficits would require a new mayor willing to do what has been unthinkable at City Hall for years: privatizing garbage collection, gradually raising property taxes and focusing a smaller police force more intensely on high-crime neighborhoods.“You simply cannot maintain Mayor Daley’s vision with the current sources of revenue,” Mr. Abolt said. “The money is not there for the services and the capital projects that the mayor was delivering. It just doesn’t add up.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','Curtailing the good times could have serious consequences, says Michael Cohen, the city’s chief of economic development.“San Francisco’s economy and vibrancy as a city is based on a lot of energetic, talented, educated, young people who want to live here,” Mr. Cohen said. “San Francisco has to be careful not to make this not a fun place to be.”A recent survey by Portfolio magazine ranked San Francisco No. 6 in its Fun Index of American cities (New York, Chicago and Boston were the top three), with the city making the top 10 primarily for its food.Trying to quantify any decline in fun is problematic, but examples seem to abound:In the Mission, neighbors complained about a popular roof deck at the nightspot Medjool , even though it had operated for years, and the Planning Department threatened to impose fines; the once-raucous South of Market neighborhood has been gentrified from the gritty bar and club scene that dominated for decades; and annual street parties have been sometimes banned (Halloween) or slapped into sobriety (alcohol forbidden at the Bay to Breakers 12K foot race).Some residents are pushing back. Phil Boissiere of Cow Hollow recently helped start the Union Street Enrichment Association, a group of merchants and citizens. The association formed to fight efforts to pacify the neighborhood after complaints against a local pub when crowds watching the World Cup soccer tournament at the pub cheered too loudly.“It’s the not-in-my-backyard people,” Mr. Boissiere said of those who groused. “They are not open to the bohemian atmosphere that the city was known for.”For Ike’s Place, the problems began when four upstairs neighbors complained. The objections led to stepped-up health department inspections, eviction proceedings by the landlord and a recent decision by the Planning Department that the restaurant now needs a different permit to operate, even though it has been in business since October 2007.Perhaps sensing that a larger issue is at stake, keeping up with the latest in the Ike’s case has captured the public’s attention. The drama peaked last month when the shop was evicted one morning because of a legal technicality, then saved a few hours later by a different legal technicality. Frantic bloggers blasted bulletins: “Only five hours and 28 minutes left for Ike’s!” Followed later by, “Ike’s saved!”Terry Connelly, Dean of the Ageno School of Business at Golden Gate University, said the city had long had a reputation for doubtful feelings toward new businesses. “In San Francisco, a business is guilty until proven innocent,” Mr. Connelly said.Rob Black, a vice president of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, said people developed strong bonds with their neighborhoods and wanted to hold onto the version of the city they first fell in love with.“There are community groups that would like to see the city covered in amber and stored,” Mr. Black said.It is a view that does not bode well for any upstart business like Ike’s. A newly formed Facebook campaign is trying to persuade Mr. Shehadeh to move from the Castro to the Lower Haight neighborhood, but he believes he would face the same backlash from residents there.As his company thrives, Mr. Shehadeh doubts he will keep his corporate headquarters in San Francisco. “We’ll probably be moving out of the city,” he said.It’s just no fun dealing with all the hassles.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The rule, she wrote in an 86-page opinion, has a “direct and deleterious effect” on the armed services.The plaintiffs argued that the act violated the rights of service members in two ways.First, they said, it violates their guarantee of substantive due process under the Fifth Amendment. The second restriction, the plaintiffs said, involves the free-speech rights guaranteed under the First Amendment. Although those rights are diminished in the military, the judge wrote, the restrictions in the act still fail the constitutional test of being “reasonably necessary” to protect “a substantial government interest.”The “sweeping reach” of the speech restrictions under the act, she said, “is far broader than is reasonably necessary to protect the substantial government interest at stake here.”The decision is among a number of recent rulings that suggest a growing judicial skepticism about measures that discriminate against homosexuals, including rulings against California’s ban on and a decision striking down a federal law forbidding the federal government to recognize same-sex marriage.It will not change the policy right away; the judge called for the plaintiffs to submit a proposed injunction limiting the law by Sept. 16th. The defendants will submit their objections to the plan a week after that. Any decision would probably be stayed pending appeals.The suit was brought by the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization. The group’s executive director, R. Clarke Cooper, pronounced himself “delighted” with the ruling, which he called “not just a win for Log Cabin Republican service members but all American service members.”Those who would have preserved the rule were critical of the decision.“It is hard to believe that a District Court-level judge in California knows more about what impacts military readiness than the service chiefs who are all on record saying the law on homosexuality in the military should not be changed,” said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative group. He called Judge Phillips, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, a “judicial activist.”As a candidate for president, Senator vowed to end “don’t ask, don’t tell.” Once elected, he remained critical of the policy but said it was the role of Congress to change the law; the Justice Department has continued to defend the law in court.In February, Defense Secretary and Adm. , the chairman of the , asked Congress to allow gays to serve openly by repealing the law. The House has voted for repeal, but the Senate has not yet acted.Richard Socarides, a lawyer who served as an adviser to the Clinton administration on gay issues when the policy was passed into law, said the legal action was long overdue. “The president has said he opposes the policy, yet he has defended it in court. Now that he’s lost, and resoundingly so, he must stop enforcing it.”The case, which was heard in July, involved testimony from six military officers who had been discharged because of the policy. One, Michael Almy, was an Air Force major who was serving his third tour of duty in when someone using his computer found at least one message to a man discussing homosexual conduct.Another plaintiff, John Nicholson, was going through training for intelligence work in the Army and tried to conceal his sexual orientation by writing to a friend in Portuguese. A fellow service member who was also fluent in that language, however, read the letter on his desk and rumors spread throughout his unit.When Mr. Nicholson asked a platoon sergeant to help quash the rumors, the sergeant instead informed his superiors, who initiated discharge proceedings.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','Mr. Fenty still enjoys the support of a majority of white voters, who praise the overhauls of schools and agencies and a visionary transportation plan with bike paths. But many blacks, especially, say he became arrogant and distant, rarely showing up at the community forums, church services and funerals that keep a politician connected to his public, and they fault him for his chilly relations with the City Council.In a hint of the racial undertones in this election, some blacks say that Mr. Fenty, while a native himself, has brought in too many nonblack outsiders like Ms. Rhee, a Korean-American, to run the city, and that he seems to care more about affluent neighborhoods than the poor.“He deserves to be in trouble now because he’s not with the people,” said James Marr, a retired truck driver, as he stood outside a Safeway in the largely black northeastern quadrant of Washington. As Mr. Marr spoke, several other people stopped to add their vehement assessments.Many black residents are comparing Mr. Fenty unfavorably with Marion S. Barry Jr., who twice defeated unpopular incumbents to become mayor, the second time, in 1994, after spending six months in a federal prison on drug charges.Mr. Barry endorsed Mr. Fenty in 2006 but soon turned against him. “In politics you’ve got to love people,” said Mr. Barry, who still represents the city’s poorest ward on the City Council and emphasized that being a politician is different from being a corporate executive. “People rarely see Adrian in the neighborhoods.”Mr. Fenty, of course, has a different take. “When you elect a hard-charging executive who’s going to fix the city, don’t be surprised if that same person misses some chances at communication,” he said in the interview this week. “We’ve made progress, and now we need to bring more people into the decision-making process. I’ve learned that lesson.”From the start, Mr. Fenty made overhauling the schools his signature issue, legally taking over the system and appointing Ms. Rhee, who previously ran the New Teacher Project, a nonprofit group based in New York, to the newly powerful post of chancellor. She has been his Patton, firing principals and teachers and closing schools with what critics call a strident manner and a shortage of public consultation. The Obama administration recently awarded the city some of its coveted “Race to the Top” dollars for its school overhaul plans.Almost everyone including Mr. Gray, agrees that the encrusted schools needed radical change. Test scores and school enrollment are rising, and Mr. Fenty notes that the city’s middle- and lower-income blacks will benefit most. But Ms. Rhee’s detractors say she has unnecessarily riled parents and staff, fired teachers without a fair hearing, put too much focus on test results and taken credit for changes already under way.“Ms. Rhee came in with an attitude that everything already there was bad and that everything new is good,” said Yvette Alexander, a council member from the largely black Ward 7.Ms. Rhee said publicly that “collaboration is overrated” when children’s futures are at stake and that “in order to make a lot of the changes that are necessary in this school district, it’s going to make some people unhappy.” Ms. Alexander supports Mr. Gray, a former head of district social services who is seen on the Council as a unifier and who, at 67, offers himself as a mature and pacifying alternative. Mr. Gray says he will continue the school overhaul but with less conflict, and will do more to promote early child and college education, although he has been vague about how to pay for it.Mr. Fenty’s image has also been tarnished by accusations, which are under investigation by the City Council, that his friends improperly received construction contracts. He says he was not involved with the awards and has tried to turn attention to what he calls Mr. Gray’s poor management of the city’s human services in the early 1990s.This week, Mr. Fenty seemed chagrined but clinging to electoral hope. He argued that in the end, many voters would think twice about returning their city to what he calls “the dark old days.” He spoke just after the ribbon-cutting for a glossy waterfront development on the once-dirty and dangerous banks of the Anacostia River — the latest sign of an urban transformation that many residents find thrilling but that some low-income residents fear is squeezing them out.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','Heavy industries like cement and steel have had to comply with cap and trade rules since 2005.European Union authorities had been optimistic that President Obama would take a fresh look at the Bush administration’s opposition to the system.But in recent days, the United States, Canada and Mexico have urged the International Civil Aviation Organization, an influential United Nations body, to pass a resolution stating that countries “seeking to implement an emissions trading system that applies to other contracting states’ aircraft operators” do so only “on the basis of mutual agreement.”In a copy of the submission seen by The International Herald Tribune, the United States, Canada and Mexico acknowledged that pressure was increasing to establish international rules on aviation emissions.But they said there was “no consensus on such a global approach at this time,” adding that disagreement remained among countries on “the application of one state’s emissions trading system to another state’s airlines.”If agreed upon, the resolution would be nonbinding. But it would add to international pressure on Europe to at least delay the start of its system.Julie Oettinger, an assistant administrator at the Federal Aviation Administration, said, “Our hope is that the language we provided can gain global acceptance, and serve as a middle option that is acceptable to the European Union as well as countries that oppose inclusion of their carriers” in the European system.Such resolutions “have a political weight behind them,” Ms. Oettinger said by e-mail Thursday.Connie Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner for climate action, said on Thursday that the United States had effectively demanded a “veto right over what measures states can take to limit the climate impacts of aviation.”That, Ms. Hedegaard said, was “obviously a recipe for continued global inaction and not what we need to move this agenda forward in a positive and constructive way.”She said it was wrong for the United States “to seek to put up barriers for others” when it had not yet even enacted any legislation of its own.Ms. Hedegaard added that changing the start date would require the law to be revised by European Union legislators.Other officials said they were determined to proceed with the plan because emissions from airlines had shot up in the last 20 years as access to air transport had spread. International aviation was left out of the Kyoto Protocol, while most other industrial sectors in developed countries had been included.Ms. Oettinger of the F.A.A. said the Obama administration “is committed to addressing climate change, including emissions from international aviation.” She said the United States was seeking agreement at the International Civil Aviation Organization “on a more ambitious global goal” of carbon-neutral growth by 2020, using 2005 as the baseline.Participation by United States carriers has always been critical to the system’s success, since without them, European carriers could argue that they faced too much of a competitive disadvantage.“If European airlines were alone in the scheme, they would fight it tooth and nail,” said David Henderson, a spokesman for the Association of European Airlines.United, American, Continental and other airlines have submitted monitoring plans to British authorities and had these approved, and are expected to apply for the free allocation, according to European Union officials.At the same time, United, Continental and American are challenging the system at the High Court in London. Led by the Air Transport Association of America, the airlines complained that the measures were adopted without the agreement of other countries and were contrary to the principle that countries had sovereignty over their airspace. The airlines also said the measures constituted an improper tax or charge.In May, the High Court announced that it would refer the case to the European Court of Justice, the bloc’s highest tribunal, on the grounds that the challenge raised questions about the wider European Union law.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','Hydraulic fracturing has been used for decades, and the industry maintains that it is safe. But in recent years, environmental groups and community activists, pointing to inconclusive but sometimes compelling anecdotes of possible water contamination, have complained that the drilling practice is far too loosely regulated. Those complaints increased after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.In a 2004 study, the E.P.A. concluded that hydraulic fracturing was essentially safe, but critics quickly condemned that analysis as sloppy and politically motivated. Congress used that study as partial justification the following year to exempt hydraulic fracturing from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act.The current Congress passed legislation requiring the E.P.A. to re-examine the issue, and the agency is currently drafting a new study with an aim of publishing results by the end of 2012.Most companies that make the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing have declined to disclose their formulas, arguing that the exact components are trade secrets.Cathy G. Mann, a spokeswoman for Halliburton, one of those named in the E.P.A.’s announcement, said the company had not yet received the official request for data, but that it planned to fully cooperate with the agency.“Halliburton supports and continues to comply with state, local and federal requirements promoting the forthright disclosure of the chemical additives that typically comprise less than one-half of 1 percent of our hydraulic fracturing solutions,” Ms. Mann said by e-mail. “We view this both as a means of enhancing public safety, and as a way to engage the public in a straightforward manner.”In addition to Halliburton, the E.P.A. said that letters were sent to BJ Services, Complete Production Services, Key Energy Services, Patterson-UTI Energy, RPC Inc., Schlumberger, Superior Well Services and Weatherford International.Stephanie Meadows, the upstream senior policy adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing oil and natural gas companies, took issue with the threat of legal action for noncompliance.“I’m not sure how they would do that, or if they even have the authority to do that,” she said. “I’m little disappointed with the threats, because I thought we’d made it clear all along that we want to be helpful.”The oil and natural gas industry has long maintained that hydraulic fracturing fluids are almost entirely a mixture of sand and water, with just trace amounts of chemical lubricants, thickeners and other compounds. None of the compounds come in contact with the water table, the industry says.An E.P.A. spokeswoman said the agency would honor the companies’ requests for confidentiality about their exact formulas unless it determined that “disclosure of the information is necessary to protect health or the environment against an unreasonable risk of injury.”The industry estimates that 90 percent of the more than 450,000 operating natural gas wells in the United States rely on hydraulic fracturing.As part of its information gathering, the agency is also asking the companies to turn over any data they have on the potential health and environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing, information on the location of all sites where it has been practiced and the procedures for its use.The E.P.A. has been conducting a series of public hearings on hydraulic fracturing, which has become a controversial topic in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and parts of western New York, where potentially huge reserves of previously unreachable natural gas have drilling companies angling for access.Two days of hearings are scheduled to be held next week in Binghamton, N.Y. Organizers expect large crowds and major demonstrations both for and against natural gas development in the state.The New York State Senate overwhelmingly passed a bill that would block natural gas exploration using hydraulic fracturing until early next year, to allow for closer examination of its effects. The State Assembly is expected to take up the matter later this month.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The nature of state judicial elections has changed dramatically in recent years, and not for the better.Expanding their influence-peddling efforts beyond executive offices, like president and governor, and legislative offices, like Congress and state legislatures, well-heeled special interests have become a dominant force in crucial state judicial races.The alarming result: raucous campaigns with cheesy television attack ads paid for by influence seekers. These trends have grievously compromised judicial neutrality and the appearance of neutrality at the core of the nation’s justice system.A valuable new report by three nonpartisan legal reform groups — the Justice at Stake Campaign, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, and the National Institute on Money in State Politics — spotlights the ballooning problem.Thirty-nine states hold judicial elections. Between 1990 and 1999, campaign fund-raising by State Supreme Court candidates totaled $83.3 million, according to the report, a troubling escalation from the previous decade but less than half the $206 million raised between 2000 and 2009. The collective $6 million raised by top court aspirants at the dawn of the 1990s now seems a mere trickle compared with the $45 million-plus reported during the 2008 election cycle.These numbers actually understate big money’s role. Increasingly, the report notes, special-interest groups operating independently of candidates’ campaigns pour millions more into judicial elections, often in ways designed to avoid financial disclosure. Business and conservative interests, unions, political parties and trial lawyers predominate in the judicial money game.The ugly trend toward corrosive big money judicial elections is apt to continue in the upcoming midterm elections, when hot judicial fights are forecast in several states, including Alabama, Michigan and Illinois. The United States Supreme Court hardly helped matters with its ignominious ruling in January allowing free corporate and union spending in political campaigns, including in judicial races.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The painting is still missing, federal prosecutors said Thursday.Mr. Doyle was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.James P. Wynne, the F.B.I. agent who drafted the criminal complaint, wrote that he began investigating Mr. Doyle, 53, as a result of a lawsuit filed last week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by Kristyn Trudgeon, who said she owned the Corot painting with Mr. Doyle.The lawsuit, which gave the painting’s value as $1.35 million, said Mr. Doyle had hired a friend and co-worker, James Carl Haggerty, to show the painting to a potential buyer. Mr. Haggerty and the buyer met at the Mark Hotel on the evening of July 28, the lawsuit said. The next morning, Mr. Haggerty called Mr. Doyle and told him that he no longer had the painting and could not remember where he had been because he had had too much to drink, the lawsuit said.Max DiFabio, the lawyer who represented Ms. Trudgeon, withdrew the lawsuit on Sept. 1, a day after he filed it, after learning that Mr. Doyle had been convicted in multiple art fraud cases.Most recently, Mr. Doyle spent more than two years in state prison after pleading guilty to third-degree grand larceny in 2007 for stealing a Degas statue from a wealthy Manhattan art collector. He was paroled last December.The criminal complaint says Mr. Doyle had two co-conspirators but does not name them.Mr. Doyle was the only person arrested on Thursday in connection with the case, but prosecutors said they were still investigating.In a brief hearing before Magistrate Judge Henry Pitman, Mr. Doyle did not say a word. He was held pending a bail hearing next week.Outside the courtroom, Mr. Doyle’s lawyer, Kevin Keating, said his client was frustrated because he did not have the painting and thought the authorities were using him in an effort to locate it. “This is a squeeze play,” Mr. Keating said. “The problem is they’re squeezing the wrong guy.”Ms. Trudgeon was in court and continued to support Mr. Doyle, despite his criminal past. Outside, she said she had nothing to do with the accusations against Mr. Doyle and believed he was innocent.“Wake me up from a nightmare; we just want our painting back,” she blurted out when approached by a reporter.“There’s no co-conspirator,” she added. “Either Haggerty stole it or it’s lost.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The House of Commons on Thursday approved a new parliamentary inquiry into the journalistic use of phone hacking, the practice of illegally intercepting cellphone messages, moving the matter to the Standards and Privileges Committee, which is to meet on Tuesday. Lawmakers in Parliament attacked the practices of tabloids in general and, in particular, those of News of the World, the News International-owned tabloid whose use of phone hacking several years ago has touched off a current furor. Tom Watson, a Labour member of Parliament, said lawmakers should stop being “scared” of the news media. “The barons of the media with their red-topped assassins are the biggest beasts of the modern jungle,” he said. “They have no predators, they are untouchable, they laugh at the law, they sneer at Parliament, they have the power to hurt us and they do so with gusto and precision.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','WASHINGTON — A dissident group that had previously revealed the existence of several hidden nuclear sites in Iran claimed Thursday that it had evidence that the country was building another secret uranium enrichment plant.The group, the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran, showed satellite photographs of an extensive tunnel-digging operation near a military garrison northwest of Tehran. But the group had no pictures of the interior and no evidence to back up its claim that the site was intended to hold several thousand centrifuges, the machines used to enrich nuclear fuel for power production or weapons. The Obama administration, which publicly revealed evidence a year ago of a hidden nuclear facility near the holy city of Qum, reacted cautiously to the group’s announcement.In recent months officials have said they had no evidence of another enrichment facility, though they have expressed suspicions about a number of deep tunnels built into hillsides or mountains. One United States government official said the evidence from the People’s Mujahedeen, which was turned over to American officials this week, would require careful examination.A new enrichment plant, if it existed, would heighten suspicions that Iran was trying to evade international inspectors and find another way to produce fuel usable in a bomb. But there are other possible explanations for an underground facility, including a location to store conventional weapons.The exile opposition group has a long and tense history with the United States government, and it has openly called for a change of government in Iran. But it accurately revealed the existence of the country’s main underground nuclear enrichment center, at Natanz, and the facility at Qum, which is still under construction. Both are now visited regularly by international nuclear inspectors.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','True, Nadal lost his serve for the first time in the tournament and he did so early, but he soon broke back against Verdasco and then did not allow him another break point. Nadal went on to win, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4, in a tidy 2 hours 22 minutes.“It’s a very nice feeling to be in the semifinal for the third time in a row in one of the most important tournaments in the world, for me right now probably the most important,” the top-seeded Nadal said on the court with the wind still whipping through his dark hair, once flamboyantly long but now no-nonsense short.The U.S. Open remains the only major individual title that Nadal lacks. He has won the French Open five times, Wimbledon twice and the Australian Open once. He also won the singles gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.But he is a clear favorite to reach the final here, even if his surprise semifinal opponent, the 12th-seeded Mikhail Youzhny, has caused him trouble here in the past. Saturday’s other semifinal will match No. 2 Roger Federer, a five-time champion here, against No. 3 Novak Djokovic.Youzhny, a smooth-moving Russian veteran with an elegant one-handed backhand, defeated Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, 3-6, 7-6 (7), 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, in Thursday’s first quarterfinal, a victory that required four hours to complete and an abundance of patience, hard running and deep thinking from both players.But Nadal, like his archrival Federer, has not lost a set at the Open this year, and although Youzhny upset Nadal here in four sets in the 2006 quarterfinals, Nadal has won seven of their 11 matches and has clearly proven himself a hard-court champion since by winning in both Australia and Beijing.Conditions in Ashe Stadium are considered quicker than in Australia, with a lower bounce. But Nadal said he feels fresh and has none of the energy issues that he believed affected his chances in his 2008 semifinal loss here to Andy Murray or any of the injury problems that contributed to his 2009 semifinal loss to Juan Martín del Potro. But Nadal chose not to contest Verdasco’s post-match assessment that Federer was still the man to beat.“For sure Roger is the favorite of the tournament, especially because he won five times and six finals in a row,” Nadal said.Youzhny reached the semifinals here in 2006 before losing to Andy Roddick. He is back there again and soon to be back in the top 10. None of that appeared likely late on Thursday afternoon when Wawrinka confidently ripped a huge ace into the corner to win the third set and take a two-sets-to-one lead.The 25th-seeded Wawrinka was still riding the wave after upsetting Murray and outlasting Sam Querrey in five sets on his way to the quarterfinals. He was carving backhands with panache and reading the flow of play with prescience despite the tricky winds that have become the rule at this blustery Open. Meanwhile, Wawrinka’s new coach, Peter Lundgren, who once tutored Roger Federer, was grinning in the players’ box, leaping to his feet and barking out encouragement. With Federer already into the semifinals, it appeared that Switzerland was about to account for half of the Open’s final four.But Youzhny quashed those plans, proving fresher and more accurate down the stretch with Wawrinka destroying one of his rackets in frustration deep in the fifth set.Youzhny has escaped from more difficult situations in the past, starting at the beginning. In 2002, in the Davis Cup final against France in Paris, his captain, Shamil Tarpischev, called on him to replace the struggling Yevgeni Kafelnikov in the fifth and final match.Just 20 then, Youzhny rallied from a two-set deficit to defeat Paul-Henri Mathieu and secure the Cup for Russia for the first time. There was quite a celebration in Paris and back in Moscow, but Youzhny’s emotions were mixed, because his father, Mikhail, had died suddenly just a few months earlier.Eight years later, Youzhny is a father himself, but he still commemorates victories with a salute to all four sides of a stadium with his tennis racket resting on his head. It is hardly as straightforward a gesture as Andre Agassi’s blown kisses and bows, but it still means plenty to Youzhny, whose father was in the military.“It’s my way of dedicating my victories to my father,” he said.Now, after four hours in the wind against Wawrinka, another victory would allow Youzhny to end any further chatter about a first Federer-Nadal final at the U.S. Open.“I’m ready to be bad person,” Youzhny said with a grin. “I love to be bad person in this case.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','“Apple is concerned enough about the shifting tide towards Android that it feels it has to loosen restrictions to keep developers on its side,” said Jeffrey S. Hammond, an analyst at Forrester Research.Although Mr. Hammond said that Apple’s App Store was outpacing opponents in both the number of applications available for download and the amount of revenue generated for developers, he said Apple’s announcement was a “pre-emptive strike.”“Google has done a better job at leveling the playing field for independent developers, and that matters,” he said. “I don’t think Apple can tolerate that, especially with the dozen or more pads that we’re going to see hit the market in eight to nine weeks.”In the newly released guidelines, which are written in an unusually conversational style, Apple acknowledges that its App Store policies could give the impression that the company is made up of “control freaks,” but adds that “maybe it’s because we’re so committed to our users and making sure they have a quality experience with our products.”Although the guidelines list many things that will lead to an app’s rejection, like the inclusion of pornography or violent images, or mimicking features that are already on the iPhone, they still leave much to interpretation. For example, Apple says that “apps that are not very useful or do not provide any lasting entertainment value may be rejected.”Even so, software developers, many of whom have expressed frustration about the app review process, said the company’s newfound candor came as a relief.“This is gold. This is great,” said Dom Sagolla, chief executive of Dollar App, a mobile development company based in the Bay Area. “It feels like we’re finally getting a clue about what Apple wants.”“This is a document I’ve been wanting to see for two years,” said Raven Zachary, president of Small Society, a software development firm. “It’s going to foster the creation of better apps because we know going in what to do and what to avoid.”Apple also said it would begin to allow developers to use third-party tools to create applications for its iOS mobile operating system, which is used on the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. It had banned such tools in April.The change means developers can more easily convert applications written for other types of mobile phones, including those that use Adobe’s Flash technology, which Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, has repeatedly said he will not support. The news bumped shares of Adobe up more than 12 percent to close at $32.86. Apple shares were little changed.Apple’s new rules also specify that developers can put advertisements in their applications that come from outside companies. Its earlier rules had raised some questions about whether developers would be limited to using Apple’s iAd service, locking out companies like AdMob, which is owned by Google.Omar Hamoui, the former chief executive of AdMob who is now the vice president for product management at Google, said in a blog post that the changes were “great news for everyone in the mobile community.”“Apple’s new terms will keep in-app advertising on the iPhone open to many different mobile ad competitors and enable advertising solutions that operate across a wide range of platforms,” he added.Good will aside, analysts said Apple may also be trying to keep federal regulators at bay. The ban on third-party tools and the uncertainty about outside ads had prompted the Federal Trade Commission to begin asking questions about Apple’s approach to competition.“At some point, Apple asked themselves whether this is doing us more harm than good, between unhappy developers and the F.T.C. sniffing around,” Mr. Hammond said. “For once, Apple is being a little bit defensive in their strategy as opposed to being offensive. It just shows how the race is starting to tighten in this market.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','Childhood emotions and memories and their persistence through life — the children we once were, the children we remain — are primary among Mr. Nara’s subjects. His art is the product of a painfully lonely childhood salvaged by an early and profound love of rock music. The girls often wield guitars and spout song titles and lyrics, from Neil Young (“It’s better to burn out than to fade away”) to the Ramones (“Blitzkrieg Bop”) to Green Day (“Promise me no dead end streets”).New York aside, Mr. Nara’s characters have earned him something like rock-star status and a cult following, not only in Japan but also throughout Asia. Factors in his popularity include his incessant blogging and use of Twitter, his books and album covers, and the proliferation of his signature characters and phrasings on T-shirts and mugs, stuffed animals, toys and so on.In this regard, Mr. Nara may be one of the most egalitarian visual artists since Keith Haring. He seems never to have met a culture or generation gap, a divide between art mediums or modes of consumption that he couldn’t bridge or simply ignore. His art is highly synthetic, representing fusions of high, low and kitsch; East and West; grown-up, adolescent and infantile; and so seamless as to render such distinctions almost moot.Although this exhibition emphasizes the connection between Mr. Nara’s art and music, its links to Japanese visual traditions and to Western Modernism are equally apparent. Built up from thin, brushy layers of acrylic, his gauzy-surfaced paintings repurpose the saturated hues and bold compositions of Color-Field painting and Japanese screens while drawing on the buoyancy of Disney and the anarchic energy of manga. They can also recall the kitschy, wide-eyed moppets of Margaret Keane while evoking Paul Klee and the ancient instinct for human portraiture that feels emotionally real but isn’t realistic.Mr. Nara’s paintings send so many different signals that they’re almost passive-aggressive. Their cuteness is slightly off-putting, but the emotional directness can hold you just long enough for the formal acuity of the images to settle in.Similarly, the dog sculptures low-ball the flawless artifice of both American Minimalist sculpture and Edo lacquer boxes while preserving a loopy elegance leavened with tender touches of reality: note the green canvas collars worn by the three large, friendly white animals converging in the sculpture “Dogs From Your Childhood.”The latest addition to the Nara repertory is a series of fey yet imposing black-and-white figurative vases with faces and symbols, and phrases in English, Japanese and German. Their undulant forms evoke Warhol’s cookie jars, Russian nesting dolls and peasant art everywhere. They are also occasions for a brushy, thick-lined drawing style that is part American graffiti, part Japanese ink painting, and either way a welcome departure from the refinement that plagues many of Mr. Nara’s drawings.The Asia Society show often feels like a village. You walk through or step into some of its structures: for example, a row of small rooms — each with a different wood floor and brightly colored door — that display one or two works each, but might easily house the Seven Dwarfs. In other spaces you can plunk down on patchwork pillows to watch a slide show of photographs from Mr. Nara’s travels while listening to the lilting songs of Mary Hopkin and Michelle Shocked.Two of the show’s largest paintings — relatively crudely rendered works on wood that the artist calls billboards — are displayed behind clapboard walls with small square openings cut in them, not unlike a countrified construction site. Looking at them is a protracted, piecemeal process, and weirdly intimate.The installation culminates in a steep-roofed little house out of “Hansel and Gretel” — minus the witch. It is a drawing studio inspired by Thoreau but surrounded by the white draping of a circus big top: an apt metaphor for the tension between private creativity and public display. Its spire is incised with a peace symbol and a circled capital A for anarchy, and topped by a glowing gold ceramic sculpture of an elephant reminiscent of Ganesha, the Hindu god of love and prosperity. The house itself sits on a group of bright colored cylinders that are worthy of that other elephant, Dumbo.The walls of this little dwelling, visible through four square windows with patchwork curtains, are lined with drawings; the interior is dominated by a low work table strewn with pencils and more drawings. Each depicts a tough little girl who has something to say. The totality intimates a driven, incessantly working artist from whom, in all probability, we will be hearing much more.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The first gallery zeros in on Abstract Expressionist works by women on the verge of something else, be it Pop or Minimalism or Pattern and Decoration. Most riveting is Miriam Schapiro’s “Fanfare,” a vividly hued gestural abstraction from 1958; it reminds you that Ms. Schapiro was an accomplished member of the Cedar Tavern gang before she rejected abstract painting in favor of fabric “femmages.”Another surprise comes from Judy Chicago, who with Ms. Schapiro spearheaded the Feminist Art Program at CalArts in the early 1970s. The work here, “Sky Flesh” (1971), reveals glimpses of her prior artistic life as a minimalist painter and sculptor. Its spray-lacquered panels arrange soft pastels in the form of a grid, and are right in line with the surf- and hot-rod-inspired works by other West Coast artists of that era.Also here is one of the last paintings made by Eva Hesse before she turned to sculpture: a concatenation of arcane symbols in a muted, blue-gray palette. (Ms. Hesse’s painting from the early 1960s is the subject of a fall exhibition at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.)In the Hesse work feminism is merely implied (the label notes that she was reading Simone de Beauvoir around the time she made the painting). In the next part of the show, it’s explicit: here you’ll find Joan Semmel’s nude self-portrait, its extreme foreshortening exaggerated by a rather cramped installation. More arresting, though, is a painting by Lee Lozano (born Lenore Knaster) of a woman’s chest with two Jewish stars where breasts should be and a nipple-shaped neck pendant.The section of the show devoted to “Pattern and Decoration” is small, and deliberately so — rare for a show of feminist art. And it acknowledges the men who were part of the movement: Ms. Schapiro’s “Blue Burst Fan,” a collage of kimono-esque fabrics on a shaped canvas, hangs opposite Robert Kushner’s messily exuberant “Blue Flounce.”A more tongue-in-cheek use of the decorative arts can be seen in Elaine Reichek’s embroidered samplers from 1994, which are as vocal about assimilation as they are about stereotypical femininity. One of them reads, in neat cross-stitches: “Don’t be loud. Don’t be pushy. Don’t talk with your hands.”In the next room works by Nancy Spero and her husband, Leon Golub, explode with righteous anger: over the Holocaust, the Vietnam War and the treatment of women generally. Mr. Golub’s paint-encrusted “Napalm Man” goes right for the jugular, while Ms. Spero’s multipaneled “Masha Bruskina” uses a smoother, Pop-inflected delivery to tell the story of a teenage girl executed by the Nazis in 1941.Texts and symbols are the focus of the next grouping, in which the emergent Dana Frankfort’s blazing-orange Star of David livens up older and more cerebral canvases by Louise Fishman, Joan Snyder and others. And with another hit of color, not to mention chutzpah, Deborah Kass’s “Double Red Yentl, Split” from her “My Elvis” series, kicks off a grand finale of satiric and otherwise humorous paintings.Warhol is again parodied in Audrey Flack’s 1962 “Matzo Meal,” a rendering of Jewish supermarket staples on a white background. And a work by one of the original “Bad Girls,” Cary Leibowitz (who is male), that reads “I’m A Jew how ’bout U?!!,” gamely sends up 1990s identity politics.“Shifting the Gaze” ends squarely in the present, though, with recent works by Ms. Eisenman as well as by Amy Sillman and Dana Schutz. Ms. Eisenman’s “Seder,” which was made specifically for the show, depicts grotesque-faced family members sharing matzo and Manischewitz. Her vision of the springtime ritual seems informed by sacred and secular gatherings, from James Ensor’s “Christ’s Entry into Brussels” to George Grosz’s “Eclipse of the Sun” to Norman Rockwell’s “Saying Grace.” It’s both smart alecky and searching, as is this unfortunately titled exhibition. Really, the only “gaze” that matters here is the artist’s gimlet eye.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','ISTANBUL — Chris Collins’s legs bounced with nervous energy as he listened to “The Star-Spangled Banner” before the United States played Russia on Thursday in the quarterfinals of the world basketball championships.Collins, the son of Doug Collins, is an assistant coach at Duke and a court coach with scouting duties for the United States team. The name Collins is frequently invoked whenever the United States plays Russia. It has been 38 years since the Soviet Union’s controversial 51-50 victory over the United States in the gold medal game at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Doug Collins, a member of that team and now the coach of the Philadelphia 76ers, became the face of the Americans’ anguish.“Obviously, it’s very personal for our family,” Chris Collins said. “When U.S.A. plays Russia, for us it brings back a lot of different things.”Not long after Kevin Durant’s 33 points led the United States to an 89-79 victory over Russia, Doug Collins, who in 1972 made two free throws with three seconds left to give the United States the apparent victory, sent Chris a text message.“Congrats, great job, way to get through it,” he wrote.The Americans trailed by 7 points in the first half, looked out of sync on offense and needed a 12-0 run late in the second quarter to take control. But they advanced to the semifinals on Saturday against Lithuania, which defeated Argentina, 104-85.'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The financially troubled Philadelphia Orchestra says it has received $4 million from the William Penn Foundation to help pay for its operations and another half-million dollars toward an “intensive strategic planning process.” The orchestra, which recently emerged from a leadership vacuum, is struggling to finance its activities. To deal with major shortfalls it established what it calls a recovery fund, which — with the William Penn gift — now amounts to $12 million in donations and pledges. The foundation describes itself as “dedicated to improving the quality of life in the Greater Philadelphia region.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','“Our policies assume that the dominant role in manufacturing will continue to be played by the private sector,” Mr. Bloom said. “We are not willing to accept manufacturing’s decline, but it is simply not feasible to make the government the principal actor in its revival.”No other sector has lost so much ground relative to the rest of the economy. Manufacturing’s share of gross domestic product topped out at nearly 30 percent in the 1950s. It is 11 percent today. The fall has accelerated since 2007, with the recession a contributing factor.The president reiterated the need for manufacturing in a speech on Wednesday in Cleveland. “We see a future where we invest in American innovation and American ingenuity; where we export more goods so we create more jobs here at home; where we make it easier to start a business or patent an invention; where we build a homegrown clean energy industry, because I don’t want to see new solar panels or electric cars or advanced batteries manufactured in Europe or in Asia. I want to see them made right here in the U.S. of A. by American workers.”The Obama administration argues, often through Mr. Bloom, that the United States cannot sustain itself as a global economic power without a thriving manufacturing sector. Too much research and development, too many well-paid jobs and too many exports flow from manufacturing.Mr. Bloom, speaking more forcefully than others in the administration, challenges the idea that research and development can be pursued entirely separate from production. In his view, Americans cannot excel at high-end innovation while factory production continues to decline or to slip overseas. “I am deeply afraid that if you lose the ability to make things,” he said, “all the intellectual activity involved in innovation and design will over time erode as well.”Grumbling by American manufacturers is fairly constant on Mr. Bloom’s trips to the heartland as the president’s senior counselor for manufacturing, his official title. On his most recent trip, to Cleveland — he has visited nearly two dozen cities since his appointment a year ago — more than 60 executives and factory owners in northeastern Ohio listened, and then had their say. In some cases, they called for a more expansive government role in manufacturing, along the lines of China, Germany or Japan.“We don’t have to reinvent the wheel,” said Andre Morrison, an executive at Green Mill Global, which makes lighting products. “But why can’t we model our policies on those of other countries, where government and private industry are in bed together?”Mr. Morrison’s biggest complaint was credit. He said he knew five or six established companies that wanted to expand within the United States but could not get loans from commercial banks. He asked, in effect, that the federal government expand its support for such loans, and Mr. Bloom replied that the administration was doing just that, but with a caveat. “It is not government’s role to direct banks to lend to particular companies or industries,” he explained.That unwillingness to interfere with the private sector is characteristic of the administration’s industrial policy. Shunning even the term, Mr. Bloom prefers to call it a “manufacturing strategy.”Still, some of the Ohio executives pushed for more intervention. Several seemed to nod in agreement when William N. McCreary, a vice president of the NSG Group, said that private equity firms and other financiers frequently asked for an American manufacturer’s “China strategy,” meaning that having an operation in China made a company more worthy of financial support.The NSG Group, which makes flat glass of the sort used in auto windshields, operates in many countries, including China, and is based in Japan. Even so, Mr. McCreary, who is based in Toledo, Ohio, sounded perplexed by this lack of faith in American producers.“The private equity world is heavily on the side that you have to be in China,” he said. “It thinks the U.S. is not a place you make things.”Mr. Bloom, working out of a Treasury Department office with few assistants, aims to reverse that way of thinking. At 55, he brings to the job the business degree he earned in 1985, followed by 11 years on Wall Street as an investment banker and a slightly longer stint as a special assistant to the president of the United Steelworkers.President Obama drafted him from the Steelworkers to serve as co-chairman of the auto task force in the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler — the administration’s initial venture into manufacturing strategy.The unions say much more is needed. Too many jobs have been lost over the years; too many factories have shut or moved overseas, and they want a more muscular strategy than the Obama administration has fielded.“There are two pieces to what it would take to rejuvenate manufacturing,” said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff to Richard L. Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “One is trade policy, a more restrictive approach than the free trade, open borders arrangement that we now have. The other is to reward domestic production. When the government makes a purchase, for example, the presumption should be that the first crack goes to manufacturers who stay within the United States.”Mr. Bloom notes the criticism and, without disputing it, replies that manufacturing strategy in the Obama administration, modest as it is, is nevertheless “huge” in comparison with previous administrations, which generally accepted the proposition that manufacturing’s decline was inevitable in a mature, service-oriented economy.Mr. Reagan, in contrast, responded to the Rust Belt crisis and the onslaught of imported cars, steel and computer chips, mostly from Japan, by imposing import quotas to protect American manufacturers. In addition, he negotiated a currency revaluation that enhanced the dollar in trade. His administration financed Sematech, which brought together semiconductor manufacturers in the cooperative development of new technology. He even got the Japanese to commit to purchases of a set amount of American-made computer chips.“In those days, you had many more U.S. companies that cared about these issues,” said Scott Paul, executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. “It was the electronics industry that went to Washington, en masse, and pushed successfully for the creation of Sematech.”The world has changed since the early 1980s. The giant corporations — General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar, Whirlpool and Intel, among others — still had most of their production in the United States. They have since become global behemoths, selling into foreign markets principally from overseas factories. As those sales rose, so did the nation’s trade deficit. And now, when these multinationals speak out, they mainly aim to support their worldwide operations through free trade agreements and lowered tariffs.The Obama administration is counting on sharp increases in exports to buoy the nation’s manufacturers. The president has set a goal of doubling exports in the next five years. But he rules out subsidies. Instead, he emphasizes stepped-up financing from the Export-Import Bank and “much more aggressive diplomacy in representing U.S. producers,” which means using embassy personnel as sales people.Mr. Bloom acknowledges that such steps take time to produce results. “We have been insufficiently committed to manufacturing for a long time,” he said. “We are not going to fix it in an afternoon.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','The results? About 7 percent of the world’s best juniors were able to make the transition to a top 100 men’s or women’s player. Barely 1 percent reached the top 10. Gaël Monfils, for example, was the International Tennis Federation junior world champion in 2004 and reached as high as No. 9 in the ATP world rankings in 2009. He was ranked 19th before losing Wednesday in the quarterfinals to Novak Djokovic.“They are pretty discouraging numbers,” said McKinley, who covers America and for Babolat, which earned more than $150 million in revenue in 2009. “But we’ve built our business at the grass-roots level by identifying up-and-coming juniors and making sure they are playing with our rackets and strings. They may not make it to Nadal’s level, but in their hometowns everyone knows who they are and what they are using. That is a lot of exposure and sales for us.”The agents, too, know it is a numbers game and follow an adage: Sign 100 of them and start picking up the phone when one or two start to win.After all, in 1998, Federer was the I.T.F. junior champion. Twelve years later, even a small percentage of the $25 million in endorsements he earns as the world’s most decorated tennis player is substantial for an agent.There is mounting evidence that older is better in professional tennis — the average age of the women occupying the first 10 spots in the world rankings is 26, a year older than that of the top 10 men. , the general manager for the ’s player development program, has been blunt in his assessment of what the search for teenage phenoms has done to weaken American tennis.“The bottom line is, we lost a generation of players the last 10 years that should have gone to college but didn’t,” he said.Still, the juniors tournament at the remains a bustling marketplace as manufacturers and agents double down on the next-not-so-sure-thing. Lagardère made the biggest noise recently by signing Monica Puig, a 16-year-old who lives in . She is ranked fourth in the I.T.F. junior rankings and won her first professional tournament in April in and advanced to the quarterfinals with a 7-6 (3), 6-1 victory Thursday over Gabriela Dabrowskiof .Turning pro hardly means instant riches. In addition to free equipment and clothing, companies like Babolat and will offer performance bonuses for tournament victories and rankings. Winning a $10,000 Futures tournament — the fledgling pro’s starter circuit — might bring a $1,000 bonus. Rising to the top 100 tour rankings can be worth $25,000 from sponsors.The out-of-pocket expenses, however, are substantial; players train and practice five hours a day for 41 weeks, receive high-performance coaching and travel, and compete in 24 events.“It’s about $100,000 or $150,000 just to start a boy or girl down the professional path,” Canter said.The hard reality and cold cash it takes to chase a dream rarely discourages young players who have been given free equipment and courted by agents since the time they could hold a racket.The American Ryan Harrison, 18, for example, who advanced to the second round of the main draw, said he was first approached by an agent as a 12-year-old and turned professional three years later.Sock, 17, the promising American, plays with Babolat rackets, wears Nike clothes and plays a mix of junior and pro tournaments, but he has yet to accept bonuses or prize money to preserve his eligibility. His father, Larry Sock, wanted his son to go to regular school and keep some semblance of a normal family life intact.They did, with great effort — for five years Jack and his mother, Pam, have lived in Overland , Kan., near Kansas City, to train with his coach and go to school. Each weekend, Larry Sock made the three-hour commute from Lincoln, Neb., where he works in securities for UBS. Jack advanced to the quarterfinals here Thursday, with a 7-6 (3), 6-3 victory over Damir Dzumhur of , and the Socks have not decided if Jack will turn professional or go to college, perhaps at , where his brother Eric plays for the Cornhuskers.“They can be very persuasive,” Larry Sock said of agents. “But college sounds pretty good to me.”European players do not have college eligibility to protect and are often at the center of the agent frenzy. But their odds of success are hardly any better. For every , there are perhaps dozens like Lera Solovieva.Solovieva, a Russian, was 11 and one of the most sought-after juniors in the world when Canter signed her. He got her deals with blue-chip sponsors like Nike, paid for her to live and train in Miami, and outfitted her down to a set of braces. Nearly four years and $650,000 of Renaissance Tennis Management’s money later, Solovieva is back in , trying to revive a career thwarted by injuries and a lack of development.“I learned my lesson,” said Canter, who represents Rohan Bopanna and Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi, the doubles team known as the Indo- Express, which will play in the Open final Friday. “Everyone is out here looking for the next or Sharapova. But they don’t come around that often.”'"
"'10-09-10,'1','NAIROBI, Kenya — Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked Mogadishu’s main airport on Thursday afternoon, shortly after a high-level United Nations delegation met with Somali officials there in an attempt to resolve an escalating internal political dispute.Witnesses said a Toyota sedan exploded at the airport gates after it was stopped by a guard. Another carload of attackers — dressed in government military fatigues, a tactic used in a hotel attack last month — arrived shortly afterward. The attackers jumped out of their car and started shooting wildly, witnesses said. At least one of the attackers detonated an explosive vest.United Nations officials said that nine people were killed, among them four attackers, three civilians and two African Union peacekeepers, but that none of the United Nations officials inside the airport were harmed.The United Nations team, led by the new United Nations special representative for Somalia, Augustine P. Mahiga, had arrived earlier on Thursday to try to overcome a recent falling out between Somalia’s president, Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed, and the prime minister, Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, that has paralyzed Somalia’s transitional government.Earlier this year Sheik Sharif tried to oust the prime minister, but he had to back down after Somalia’s Parliament failed to support him. It seems the president is trying once again to fire Mr. Sharmarke, who has been widely criticized, along with just about everyone else in the Somali government, including Sheik Sharif, for not delivering services and steadily losing territory to Islamist militants. United Nations officials and Western diplomats, including American diplomats, have urged the two men to concentrate on protecting Mogadishu, Somalia’s capital, and to resolve their personal differences later.This past month has been especially violent. The Shabab insurgent group has been waging an offensive to coincide with Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, which is drawing to a close this week. So far more than 200 people have been killed, including several government lawmakers.'"

"'10-09-11,'0','While Nokia remains the overall leader in handsets, with a global market share of 38 percent, according to Canalys, a British research firm, its share of the American market has stagnated at less than 10 percent. The company has failed to build profitable relationships with the four major phone operators, which sell more than 90 percent of all mobile phones in the United States.Nokia has also had difficulty fending off the challenge from Asian rivals like Samsung, LG and HTC, as well as Google, the search engine leader that created the Android operating system for smartphones. Adoption of Google’s Android is growing faster than Nokia’s Symbian software systems.“Despite holding 38 percent market share of the smartphone market, Nokia’s failure to compete with the iPhone and high-tier Android devices, combined with its lack of progress in gaining significant traction in the United States, has led to press and investor dissatisfaction,” said Pete Cunningham, an analyst at Canalys.Gartner, another market consulting firm, issued a report Friday that predicted Symbian would be nearly overtaken by Android in four years while Microsoft’s phone operating system would slide to a nearly insignificant portion of the market.In announcing the change, the chairman of Nokia’s board, Jorma Ollila, said Mr. Elop would accelerate the transformation of Nokia from a hardware company to one focused on software capable of competing with Apple and Google in mobile applications.“The time is right to accelerate the company’s renewal; to bring in new executive leadership with different skills and strengths in order to drive company success,” Mr. Ollila said Friday in a statement.“The Nokia board believes that Stephen has the right industry experience and leadership skills to realize the full potential of Nokia,” he added.Mr. Kallasvuo, who had served as Nokia’s chief operating officer and financial officer, was named to head the company in 2006. Nokia said he would receive 4.6 million euros ($5.8 million) in severance and bonus payments, plus 100,000 shares of Nokia, worth 811,000 euros.Mr. Elop is an engineer and holds a degree in computer engineering and management from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Before working at Microsoft, he was chief executive of Macromedia, a software maker later acquired by Adobe, and chief operating officer at Juniper Networks, a telecommunications equipment maker.At Microsoft, he oversaw the information worker, business solutions and unified communications groups, which are responsible for the Microsoft Office system of programs, servers and software-based services.Mr. Elop said he was prepared to make the changes necessary at Nokia to keep the company on top of its fast-changing market, where mobile devices are rapidly going beyond simple communication tools to become sophisticated hand-held computers.Asked whether Nokia needed to develop a convincing, compelling answer to the iPhone, Mr. Elop said: “I think Nokia requires an approach that recognizes that today’s customers are expecting a combination of great handset, an operating environment that is great to use and all within the context of the Internet.”Mr. Elop said Friday that he would begin working at Nokia in Espoo, Finland, on Sept. 21, and would move to Helsinki soon. Mr. Elop said he was a hockey fan, and had a 19-year-old son who played for the University of British Columbia’s hockey team and a daughter who was a goalie for her local school.He recounted to Nokia employees that he had watched in Vancouver as the Canadian women’s hockey team won the Olympic gold medal.“I can tell you that in four years at the next Olympic games, my loyalties will be somewhat divided,” Mr. Elop said.'"
"'10-09-11,'0','This is our Open, outdoors, exposed to the elements, as it should be. Let’s freeze the action. It could be an instant in one of the early matches, played in torrid conditions that now seem as distant as last year’s games. But it will probably be one of the wind-driven matches late in the second week.Stop everything, spectators, vendors, broadcasters, players, just as the ball meets the racket of, say, Robin Soderling, everyone glowing in the nighttime lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium. The light is the only thing the wind has not disturbed. Even in the stadium, in a crowd that is raucous by tennis standards, spectators are clinging to what might get loose — napkins, tissues, programs — for fear of disturbing play.How do you calculate all the forces at work here? Soderling’s racket is sweeping upward with incredible speed at the end of a hurtling man’s reach. The ball still carries a version of the spin that Soderling’s opponent, Roger Federer, imparted to it, as if it were some subatomic particle, a spin the court surface itself has altered. The two men are lucky to be playing tennis in a universe where, instead of accumulating, the forces at work are neutralized with each stroke — the spin respun, the velocity absorbed and redirected.But tonight there is the wind, not quite the eye-lashing wind of the previous match, but plenty. Soderling is meeting the ball where it is, which is not quite where it should be. If you could somehow have ridden the ball to where it lies, squashed, against Soderling’s racket face, you would feel the extra headwind against him on this point, the extra tailwind with Federer. The end Soderling hits to is now 10 feet deeper than the end Federer hits to. The wind recalibrates spin, too. The game’s gyroscope goes awry.Between points each player tries to neutralize another force — emotion. That, too, is harder in the wind because wind carries its own abrasive energy. It raises questions of fairness in the player’s mind that have nothing to do with calls of “in” or “out.” Suddenly, for some players, injustice is now a factor in the serve toss, usually the most predictable element in the professional game, and those players are doomed.David Foster Wallace once wrote that “acceptance is its own verve, and it takes imagination for a player to like wind.” Every year we witness fitness and skill, match in, match out. It’s a marvel to watch acceptance and imagination at work in what suddenly feels, courtside, like a much realer world than the one where tournament tennis is usually played.'"
"'10-09-11,'0','Forget about that for a moment. The Democrats are in deep, deep trouble because they have not effectively addressed the overwhelming concern of working men and women: an economy that is too weak to provide the jobs they need to support themselves and their families. And that failure is rooted in the Democrats’ continued fascination with the self-serving conservative belief that the way to help ordinary people is to shower money on the rich and wait for the blessings to trickle down to the great unwashed below.It was a bogus concept when denounced it as “voodoo economics” in 1980, and it remains bogus today, no matter how hard the Democrats try to dress it up in a donkey costume.A survey of American workers by the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at found that more than 70 percent had either lost a job or had a relative or close friend who had lost a job. Nearly two of three expect the U.S. to still be in next year, and nearly one in five are worried that a depression may be coming.This economy and the rampant it has caused would be toxic stuff for whatever party was in power.White House spokesman , commenting on the president’s recent $50 billion transportation infrastructure proposal, said: “This is about long-term economic growth. This isn’t about the next 60 days or the next 90 days. This is about how do we get our economy fully back on track, how do we get the millions that want to work back to work, and how do we repair the economic damage that’s been going on not just over the past two years but over the past 10 years.”Well, that’s the drum the Democrats should have been pounding in the earliest days of the Obama administration, and they should have backed it up with a dramatic rebuild America infrastructure campaign and every other job-creation measure they could think of, including public works projects for the young and the poor and the hard-core unemployed.With the nation losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month in early-2009, the president and his allies in Congress could have rallied the citizenry to participate in the difficult work of nation-building here at home. He could have called on everyone to share in the sacrifices that needed to be made, and he could have demanded much more from the financial and corporate elites who were being bailed out with the people’s money.The example had already been set by , who declared in his first Inaugural Address that “our greatest primary task is to put people to work.” And that task, he said, should be treated “as we would treat the emergency of a war.”For Mr. Obama and the Democrats, that would have meant that health insurance reform, however noble, would have had to wait, and the war in would have had to de-escalate.That didn’t happen. The Democrats are facing an election debacle because they did not respond adequately to their constituents’ most dire needs. The thing that is really weird is that a strengthened G.O.P. will undoubtedly make matters so much worse.'"
"'10-09-11,'0','A crucial factor is the collapse of the caste system over the last half century, a factor that undergirds many of the other reasons that the south has prospered — more stable governments, better infrastructure and a geographic position that gives it closer connections to the global economy.“The breakdown of caste hierarchy has broken the traditional links between caste and profession, and released enormous entrepreneurial energies in the south,” said Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University who has studied the role of caste in southern India’s development. This breakdown, he said, goes a long way to explaining “why the south has taken such a lead over the north in the last three decades.”India’s Constitution abolished discrimination on the basis of caste, the social hierarchy that has ordered Indian life for millenniums, and instituted a system of quotas to help those at the bottom rise up. But caste divisions persist nonetheless, with upper castes dominating many spheres of life despite their relatively small numbers.While in the south lower caste members concentrated on economic development and education as a route to prosperity, in the north the chief aim of caste-based groups has been political power and its spoils. As a result India’s northern lower castes tend to be less educated and less prosperous than their southern counterparts. Charismatic leaders in the north from lower castes have used caste identity as a way to mobilize voters, winning control over several large north Indian states. Caste so thoroughly permeates politics in the northern half of the world’s largest democracy that it is often said that people don’t cast their vote; they vote their caste.Caste is so crucial to northern politics that caste-based parties have demanded that caste be included in India’s census, and the government, bowing to pressure, agreed to collect data on caste for the first time since independence. They hope that by showing their large numbers, caste-based parties can force government to set aside more jobs for their communities.Tamil Nadu’s Nadars belong to a community in the middle of India’s caste system, occupying a place barely above the untouchables, now called Dalits. Academics and analysts have closely watched the rise of the Nadar caste for clues about the role caste barriers play in holding back India’s economic progress.Unlike northern India, where caste-based political movements are a fairly recent phenomenon, lower castes in southern India began agitating against upper-caste domination at the beginning of the 20th century. Because these movements arose before independence and the possibility of elected political power, they focused on issues like dignity, education, and self-reliance, Mr. Varshney said.Nadars created business associations to provide entrepreneurs with credit they could not get from banks. They started charities to pay for education for poor children. They built their own temples and marriage halls to avoid upper caste discrimination.“Our community focused on education, not politics,” said R. Chandramogan, a Nadar entrepreneur who built India’s largest privately owned dairy company from scratch. “We knew that with education, we could accomplish anything.”As a result, when independence came the southern lower castes, who had already broken the upper caste monopoly on economic power, enjoyed political power almost right from the start. Tamil Nadu set aside 69 percent of government jobs and seats in higher education for downtrodden castes, which helped rapidly move lower caste people into the mainstream. The north put in place affirmative action policies, but because education was widely embraced, southern people from lower castes were better able to take advantage of these opportunities than northerners.When India’s economy liberalized in the 1990s, the south was far more prepared to take advantage of globalization, said Samuel Paul of the Public Affairs Center, a research institution that has looked closely at the growing divide between north and south India. “The south was ready,” Mr. Paul said.Nadar businessmen like C. Manickavel have skillfully ridden the waves of prosperity that have crashed over India since liberalization, making small fortunes. Mr. Manickavel’s father had started a small printing business in Chennai, which at its peak made $40,000 a year. But he sent his son to one of the best engineering schools in India, and Mr. Manickavel has turned that modest business into a $1 million-a-year operation that designs e-books for big American publishers.“We are supposed to be a backward community but we don’t think of ourselves that way,” he said in an interview in his state-of-the-art paperless e-publishing facility here. “I make sure my daughter studies at the best school in Chennai. We are as good as anybody else.”It remains to be seen if the political agitation around caste in northern India will produce prosperity for lower caste people there, experts say. In India’s liberalizing economy these communities must prepare themselves to compete, not simply demand a bigger slice of the shrinking government cake, said Rajeev Ranjan, the chief bureaucrat in charge of industrial development in Tamil Nadu.He is originally from Bihar, a northern state thoroughly in the grip of caste politics, but he has been stationed in the south for 25 years. He said northern states must heed the southern example. “Without that kind of social change it is very hard to do economic development,” he said. “One depends on the other.”'"

"'10-09-11,'0','His fate could hinge on the results of the investigation, which may be completed by the end of the month. In announcing it on Aug. 19, the university’s new president, Teresa A. Sullivan, said in a statement, “The review will, I hope, provide a factual basis for understanding this workplace and deciding what corrective actions, if any, the university should undertake.”In the last few weeks, returning faculty and staff members — still reeling from the violent killing of a female university lacrosse player in the spring — have been shocked to arrive back on campus and watch the aftermath of Mr. Morrissey’s death playing out on blogs and in the national media. The Hook, a newsweekly here, ran a cover article on Aug. 18 reporting that the 52-year-old Mr. Morrissey had asked the university to intervene in the workplace situation in the months and weeks before his suicide, but his pleas had not been addressed in time.Carol Wood, a spokeswoman for the university, said that mediation had been discussed with Mr. Morrissey and was planned.Many of Mr. Genoways’s contributing writers have spoken out publicly on his behalf, attesting to his character and professionalism. But his support within the university appears to be more limited. Since Mr. Morrissey died, Mr. Genoways said, “I’ve only heard from one faculty member regularly.”From its founding as “a great serious publication wherein shall be reflected the calm thought of the best men,” The Virginia Quarterly Review has kept its offices on the stately grounds of the university. Its home at the Jeffersonian center of the University, at 1 West Range, is steps from the iconic Rotunda and the preserved and showcased room at 13 West Range where Edgar Allan Poe lived as a young student.When Mr. Genoways was brought on as editor, he replaced Staige Blackford, who had served as editor of the review for 28 years and was days away from retiring when he was killed in a car crash. Over the decades Mr. Blackford had nurtured relationships with the members of the faculty, many of whom frequently wrote for the magazine. Mr. Genoways began his time as editor by doing the same, inviting professors to meetings and asking for their input on the magazine’s design.Lisa Russ Spaar, a professor in the English department who knew Mr. Genoways when he was a graduate student at Virginia — earning his M.F.A. in poetry writing — said that he initially dazzled the literary world on campus with his energy and passion.“I do think that Ted was very interested in making V.Q.R. more competitive,” she said. “He wanted to move it from being a reader’s-reader kind of quarterly to being something that was bold and took risks.”But after Mr. Genoways was denied a position in the department, his relationship with the faculty became strained, a situation that some faculty members saw as a missed opportunity.“There are certain ways in which the journal can draw on the kind of contacts and expertise and advice that the faculty of a university can provide,” said Jahan Ramazani, a professor of English. “And in turn, the faculty can benefit from a relationship with V.Q.R.”Mr. Genoways’s relationship with the members of his staff was deteriorating as well. Beginning last fall, they said, he was showing up in the office only a few days a week for a few hours a day. He was lax about returning their phone calls. He began transferring more editing duties to them.“Ted was rarely in the office, he would rarely answer e-mails to us and he would not tell us about major decisions,” said Sheila McMillen, an editor who has been placed on paid leave while the university conducts its investigation. “When we would attempt to talk to him, he would get angry and extremely defensive.”John Casteen IV, a friend of Mr. Genoways’s who is a volunteer on the magazine’s poetry board — and a son of the former university president, John Casteen III, who hired Mr. Genoways — was skeptical.“The description of Ted’s behavior is totally inconsistent with anything I ever saw when I was in the office,” said the younger Mr. Casteen, who has contributed articles on poetry to the review.Mr. Genoways acknowledged that the office dynamics had grown tense, but said that he had successfully argued for pay raises to compensate for the staff’s increased work. While he was spending more time out of the office, he said, he was busy working from home.“They may have seen me working on V.Q.R. less,” he said. “But in the last year to year and a half the amount of work I’ve done on V.Q.R. has been at times overwhelming.”Mr. Genoways also said he was increasingly worried about the magazine’s finances. The endowments, heavily invested in the stock market, have suffered, he said, and a fund of about $800,000 had been spent down by more than half as Mr. Genoways invested in the kind of long-form journalism and color photography that contributed to its rise in the magazine world.The staff members began to grumble over the editorial direction of the magazine. It was too dark, too gritty, too morose, they said, with too many articles about war and conflict and death. Mr. Genoways, who frequently sent reporters to Iraq and Afghanistan, made no apologies for the content.“If the subject matter was dark, to me it was never presented in an air of despair,” he said, acknowledging that the magazine’s subscription numbers, which now hover around 2,400, were falling about the same time. “So were everybody else’s in the country. I didn’t see those things as related.”Molly Minturn, an associate editor, insisted that Mr. Genoways had created a “toxic work environment” that the university did not do enough to repair. Mr. Morrissey, described by his co-workers as a gentle person who never graduated from college, read voraciously and organized his life around work, seemed to have been affected the most by the tension.By July, Mr. Morrissey, who struggled with depression, appeared to be despondent over his interactions with Mr. Genoways, Ms. Minturn said. After she told university officials that month that she feared Mr. Morrissey would harm himself, they did not act quickly, she said.“The issue here is the way V.Q.R. was managed, and the questions that remain unanswered,” Ms. Minturn said. “I’m hoping that this investigation will answer them.”'"

"'10-09-12,'0','“He only threw 23 pitches; it wasn’t like he threw 35, 40 pitches,” Girardi said. “If he had thrown that many, there’s no way I would have used him tonight.”Usually, Rivera is automatic. He has blown only three saves this season, and he had not lost since Aug. 10  when the Rangers vanquished him in the 10th inning. From the first batter, Rivera felt his command was lacking. Vladimir Guerrero walked on five pitches and then was replaced by a pinch-runner, Esteban German. Wary of German stealing, Rivera used a slide-step toward the plate  he did the same thing Friday night  but Cruz was not fooled.He lined a single to right-center, putting runners on the corners for Ian Kinsler, who sneaked a double inside the third-base bag that scored German with the tying run. Chris Davis was walked intentionally to set up a potential force at home, which never happened. After Andres Blanco popped out, Rivera plunked Francoeur on the left shoulder, and the Rangers mobbed Cruz at the plate for the second straight night.“You can’t go out there and walk the leadoff guy,” Rivera said. “That’s what bothers me the most.”The sheer length of Friday’s game — 13 innings, 5 hours 12 minutes — forced the teams to exhaust their bullpens. On Saturday, a 59-minute rain delay, which occurred with no outs in the bottom of the fifth, knocked out starters A. J. Burnett and Tommy Hunter and turned the game into a bullpen battle. The Rangers fired the first salvo off Robertson, the Yankees’ third reliever of the sixth, who allowed two inherited runners to score, and then one all by himself in the seventh, when Mitch Moreland lined a two-out single to push Texas ahead, 5-3.Pedro Strop, who finished the seventh by getting Jorge Posada to ground into an inning-ending double play with the bases full, was pulled in the eighth with a runner on first and one out. In came the left-hander Matt Harrison, who allowed a single to Nick Swisher — who left the bases loaded in the second and the sixth — and a walk to Mark Teixeira. For all of the pitching changes that Texas Manager Ron Washington had made — he used 10 relievers Friday night and three before Harrison — he did not, for whatever reason, have a right-hander ready to come in and face Rodriguez.As a team, the Yankees entered Saturday hitting .390 with the bases loaded, with 10 grand slams, including three by Rodriguez. On the second pitch from Harrison, Rodriguez ripped a grounder just inside the third-base bag, and it took a nifty slide by Teixeira to score the go-ahead run.“Seemed really big at the time,” Girardi said of Rodriguez’s double.The Yankees had faced Hunter once before, in 2008, in his second career start, and blitzed him for eight hits and five runs. He has matured into the linchpin of the Rangers’ rotation, adding stability as Scott Feldman and Rich Harden have struggled, but he is hardly guaranteed a playoff start. The Rangers, should they match up with the Yankees, love the idea of throwing left-handed pitchers like Cliff Lee, C. J. Wilson and Derek Holland at them, and the right-hander Colby Lewis may also have an edge.Hunter is not known as a strikeout pitcher, but he had a career-high eight through four innings, including two each of Rodriguez and Swisher. The bottom of the Yankees’ order compensated, cramming most of the team’s offense off Hunter into the second inning, when Lance Berkman and Francisco Cervelli delivered run-scoring singles that put the Yankees up 2-1.Perhaps nothing irks Burnett more than allowing runs immediately after the Yankees score. He shut down the Rangers in the bottom of the second, but another of his pet peeves — and his manager’s — helped Texas tie the score in the third. A two-out walk to David Murphy preceded a double into the left-center field gap by Guerrero, who had driven in the Rangers’ first run with a first-inning single. Burnett issued another two-out walk in the fourth, but struck out Elvis Andrus to strand runners on second and third.“I told Skip today, I’m close, I feel it,” Burnett said. “Just bear down a little bit more with two outs. The stuff’s there, the confidence is there, and every time out I’m feeling better and better.”A recurrence of soreness in his right wrist forced Brett Gardner to leave the game after five innings. The wrist has bothered Gardner from time to time since he was hit by a Clayton Kershaw pitch on June 27 in Los Angeles, and he said he expects to have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on Monday....Andy Pettitte joined the Yankees, but his mind was somewhere else: the Eastern League playoffs. In a precursor to his start next Sunday in Baltimore against the Orioles, Pettitte will have a final tuneup Tuesday for Class AA Trenton, which was awaiting its opponent in the finals. Before Altoona defeated Harrisburg to advance, Pettitte was rooting for Harrisburg, which is closer to New York. “I was looking at maps,” Pettitte said....With Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre’s season ending Saturday in the International League semifinals, the utility player Kevin Russo and the first baseman Juan Miranda were recalled to join the Yankees on Sunday.'"

"'10-09-12,'0','Interviews and a review of law enforcement documents show that in recent cases, Microsoft lawyers made statements describing the company as a victim and arguing that criminal charges should be pursued.The lawyers rebuffed pleas by accused journalists and advocacy groups, including Baikal Wave, to refrain from working with the authorities. Baikal Wave, in fact, said it had purchased and installed legal Microsoft software specifically to deny the authorities an excuse to raid them. The group later asked Microsoft for help in fending off the police. “Microsoft did not want to help us, which would have been the right thing to do,” said Marina Rikhvanova, a Baikal Environmental Wave co-chairwoman and one of Russia’s best-known environmentalists. “They said these issues had to be handled by the security services.”Microsoft executives in and at the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., asserted that they did not initiate the inquiries and that they took part in them only because they were required to do so under Russian law.After presented its reporting to senior Microsoft officials, the company responded that it planned to tighten its oversight of its legal affairs in Russia. Human rights organizations in Russia have been pressing Microsoft to do so for months. The Moscow Helsinki Group sent a letter to Microsoft this year saying that the company was complicit in “the persecution of civil society activists.”Microsoft, like many American technology giants doing business in authoritarian countries, is often faced with ethical choices over government directives to help suppress dissent. In , Microsoft has complied with censorship rules in operating its Web search service, preventing Chinese users from easily accessing banned information. Its archrival stopped following censorship regulations there, and scaled back its operations inside China’s Internet firewall.In Russia, leaders of advocacy groups and newspapers subjected to antipiracy raids said Microsoft was cooperating with the authorities because the company feared jeopardizing its business in the country. They said Microsoft needed to issue a categorical public statement disavowing these tactics and pledging to never cooperate in such cases.Microsoft has not done that, but has promised to review its policies in Russia.“We take the concerns that have been raised very seriously,” Kevin Kutz, director of public affairs for Microsoft, said in a statement. Mr. Kutz said the company would ensure that its lawyers had “more clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities.”“We have to protect our products from piracy, but we also have a commitment to respect fundamental human rights,” he said. “Microsoft antipiracy efforts are designed to honor both objectives, but we are open to feedback on what we can do to improve in that regard.”Microsoft emphasized that it encouraged law enforcement agencies worldwide to investigate producers and suppliers of illegal software rather than consumers. Even so, it has not publicly criticized raids against small Russian advocacy groups.With pirated software prevalent in this country, it is not surprising that some of these groups might have some on their computers. Yet the issue, then, is why the police choose to focus on these particular targets — and whether they falsify evidence to make the charges more serious.Microsoft also says it has a program in Russia to provide free and low-cost software to newspapers and advocacy groups so that they are in compliance with the law.But the review of these cases indicates that the security services often seize computers whether or not they contain illegal software. The police immediately filed reports saying they had discovered such programs, before even examining the computers in detail. The police claims have in numerous instances been successfully discredited by defendants when the cases go before judges.Given the suspicions that these investigations are politically motivated, the police and prosecutors have turned to Microsoft to lend weight to their cases. In southwestern Russia, the Interior Ministry declared in an official document that its investigation of a human rights advocate for software piracy was begun “based on an application” from a lawyer for Microsoft.In another city, Samara, the police seized computers from two opposition newspapers, with the support of a different Microsoft lawyer. “Without the participation of Microsoft, these criminal cases against human rights defenders and journalists would simply not be able to occur,” said the editor of the newspapers, Sergey Kurt-Adzhiyev.The plainclothes officers who descended upon the Baikal Wave headquarters said they were from the division that investigated commercial crime. But the environmentalists said they noticed at least one officer from the antiextremism department, which tracks opposition activists and had often conducted surveillance on the group.The officers said they had received a complaint from a man named Dmitri Latyshev, who claimed that he had been in the headquarters and spotted unlicensed Microsoft software on the computers. The police produced a handwritten complaint from Mr. Latyshev, dated Jan. 27. The raid occurred the next day.People at Baikal Wave said they had never seen or heard of Mr. Latyshev. Located in Irkutsk recently, Mr. Latyshev said by phone that he had filed the complaint but would not say why.Baikal Wave’s leaders said they had known that the authorities used such raids to pressure advocacy groups, so they had made certain that all their software was legal.But they quickly realized how difficult it would be to defend themselves.They said they told the officers that they were mistaken, pulling out receipts and original Microsoft packaging to prove that the software was not pirated. The police did not appear to take that into consideration. A supervising officer issued a report on the spot saying that illegal software had been uncovered.Before the raid, the environmentalists said their computers were affixed with Microsoft’s “Certificate of Authenticity” stickers that attested to the software’s legality. But as the computers were being hauled away, they noticed something odd: the stickers were gone.In all, 12 computers were confiscated. The group’s Web site was disabled, its finances left in disarray, its plans disclosed to the authorities.The police also obtained personnel information from the computers. In the following weeks, officers tracked down some of the group’s supporters and interrogated them.“The police had one goal, which was to prevent us from working,” said Galina Kulebyakina, a co-chairwoman of Baikal Wave. “They removed our computers because we actively took a position against the paper factory and forcefully voiced it.”“They can do pretty much what they want, with impunity,” she said.The paper factory is located on Lake Baikal, the world’s oldest and deepest lake, which is home to hundreds of species that exist nowhere else, including a freshwater seal. Over the years, the factory has spewed mercury, chlorine, heavy metals and other pollutants into the water.Baikal Wave rejoiced when the factory closed in 2008, having succumbed to sizable losses, as well as pressure from environmentalists. But after the financial crisis hit, the Kremlin worried about unrest from unemployment. In January, Mr. Putin reopened the factory, which has employed as many as 2,000 people, saying that it no longer polluted the lake.Baikal Wave, which was founded in Irkutsk, one of Russia’s largest cities, as the Soviet Union was collapsing, began planning a protest. That was when the officers showed up.In a statement, the Irkutsk police said the raid was proper. “The inspection of Baikal Environmental Wave was intended to protect intellectual property and had no connection whatsoever with the activities of the advocacy organization,” the statement said.It said a examination of the computers in February showed that several contained illegal software that would have cost more than $3,300. Baikal Wave said the examination was fraudulent.Prosecutors say they are now weighing whether to press charges against Baikal Wave or its leaders. It is possible, though unlikely, that they could face jail time if convicted.Neither Microsoft’s Moscow office nor its local lawyer contacted Baikal Wave to hear its side. The lawyer did provide testimony to the police about the value of the software that Baikal Wave was accused of illegally obtaining.Baikal Wave sent copies of its software receipts and other documentation to Microsoft’s Moscow office to show that it had purchased the software legally. The group said it believed that the authorities would be under pressure to drop the case if Microsoft would confirm the documents’ authenticity.Microsoft declined to do so. In a letter to Baikal Wave, the company said it would forward the materials only to the authorities in Irkutsk, which already had copies of them.“A determination of the actual circumstances of this case and the question of whether a violation of the law took place is the duty of the court,” Microsoft said.The company also told Baikal Wave that it was willing to have its specialists assist the police in Irkutsk in evaluating the computers.In response to written questions, Alexander Strakh, Microsoft’s chief antipiracy lawyer in Moscow, said that in all these cases, Microsoft assisted the authorities only as called for under Russian law.Mr. Strakh was asked whether Microsoft believed that these raids were a tool to suppress the opposition. “We have no direct knowledge of decisions by authorities to use investigations in that manner,” he said.Microsoft has hired numerous private lawyers across Russia who represent the company in piracy cases. Several of the lawyers have cropped up in these politically sensitive inquiries.This year, prosecutors in the southwestern city of Krasnodar brought a piracy case against an immigrant rights activist named Anastasia Denisova. She said in an interview that she was surprised at the aggressive posture of Microsoft’s local lawyer.In an official document, the Interior Ministry said the case against Ms. Denisova was begun “based on an application” from the lawyer. (Microsoft’s Moscow office said that statement was not correct.)Ms. Denisova said the lawyer overestimated the value of the allegedly pirated software. As a result, the accusations were more serious.“The Microsoft lawyer was very active, coming to the court all the time, even though he was not summoned,” she said. “He also claimed that he was going to sue me, despite the fact that Microsoft had publicly stated that it would not do so against an advocacy group.”In May, after Ms. Denisova had spent several months under the threat of a prison sentence, the charges were dropped. Prosecutors acknowledged that the investigation had been mishandled.Samara, in Russia’s industrial heartland, has been a focal point for these raids. In May 2007, when Mr. Putin was holding a summit meeting there with European leaders, the police sought to prevent protests by seizing computers from several organizations, including Golos, an election monitoring and human rights group, and the local edition of Novaya Gazeta, the country’s most influential opposition newspaper.Last year, they took computers from another newspaper, Samarskaya Gazeta. According to case records, the police conducted that search based upon a complaint from a man who admitted that he had never been in the newspaper’s offices or seen its computers.Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev, the editor of both newspapers, said Microsoft’s lawyer in the case regularly appeared at court hearings to back prosecutors and the police. He said the lawyer testified that seized computers contained pirated software even though it was later shown that the computers had never been examined.“Microsoft says publicly that they have no claims in these cases, but then their lawyers come into the court and say whatever the police want them to say,” Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev said.The Damage Is DoneProsecutors eventually dropped or suspended the charges against Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev after he was able to discredit them. But he said the damage was done. He said the newspapers lost computers and data, and he spent an enormous amount of time ensnared in legal proceedings. The local edition of Novaya Gazeta had to close.Mr. Kurt-Adzhiyev said he now realized that the authorities were not so much interested in convictions as in harassing opponents. Even if the inquiries are abandoned, they are debilitating when they require months to defend.Microsoft’s Moscow office said its lawyers had conducted themselves properly in the cases in Krasnodar and Samara.In Irkutsk, Baikal Environmental Wave has also struggled to recover from the raid. It located some old computers and was still able to hold protests against the paper factory.The seized computers were not returned by the police until July, five months after they were removed. Their hard drives had been inspected by police experts in February. The environmentalists do not know whether all their data remain, and they are sure that files were copied.Ms. Rikhvanova, one of the group’s co-founders, who has been fighting to defend Lake Baikal since the 1960s, was unable to use her computer. When she got it back, she discovered that it had been disabled by a virus.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Some schools, like Blacow Elementary in Fremont and San Antonio Elementary in San Jose, reported 100 percent of their kindergartners were up-to-date.Of the 88,763 children in the nine Bay Area counties who started kindergarten in fall 2009, some 5,427 entered conditionally, while 1,731 had a personal-belief exemption. Statewide, a tiny fraction of kindergartners received permanent exemptions for medical reasons. Public-school students in the Bay Area were more likely to be up-to-date on all their shots than their private-school peers.As the new school year begins, California is in the midst of its worst whooping cough epidemic in five decades, with Bay Area counties accounting for almost 30 percent of reported cases.Marin and Sonoma Counties have reported the highest rates of whooping cough in the Bay Area this year. They also have the highest local rates of personal-belief exemption.Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of such exemptions statewide has crept up from 0.5 percent to 2 percent, said Ken August, a spokesman for the California Department of Public Health. In Sonoma County, 5 percent of kindergartners took that exemption when they entered school last fall.At Sebastopol Independent Charter School, all 88 percent of kindergartners who were not up-to-date on their vaccinations last fall had personal-belief exemptions. Susan Olson, the executive director, emphasized that the parents of many of her students sought those exemptions because they had decided to forgo a few shots, not all of them.“Many of our families are partially vaccinated and have chosen to skip a few of them, thereby making it look like no one vaccinates at our school,” Ms. Olson said. She cited vaccines for hepatitis B and chickenpox as two of the shots that many parents decide to delay or skip.Schools may also allow a student who is not fully immunized or lacks documentation to start school as a “conditional entrant,” but state guidelines narrowly define the circumstances when such admission is allowed. For example, homeless children may be given such a grace period.Some local schools have interpreted this loophole more liberally.At Anna Yates Elementary in Emeryville, 71 percent of kindergartners started school last fall as conditional entrants. Today, those students are in first grade, and the district’s new school nurse is only now straightening out their immunization records from last year.“There are a lot of kids who have had their immunizations, but we haven’t gotten the record from the provider,” said Joan Edelstein, the first nurse the Emeryville district has had in years. “Now, I’m getting the documentation.”Schools are obligated to follow up promptly with those children who are admitted conditionally, and even keep those students out of school if their parents fail to comply with the requirements. But enforcement can be lax.Each spring, the California Department of Public Health selects 3 percent of elementary schools in each county for local health officials to audit. Some schools are more vigilant than others in ensuring that students have really gotten the mandated shots.“If they are so short-staffed that they have other priorities, this may fall between the cracks,” said Dr. Bob Benjamin, deputy health officer for the Alameda County Public Health Department.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Before Clijsters, 27, became the queen of the Open with 21 consecutive victories at the tournament, her claim to the crown was roundly questioned. Until she won the first of her three titles at Flushing Meadows, in 2005, the rap on Clijsters was that she lacked the temperament to win a major. People interpreted her inherent niceness as a lack of the champion’s hunger or killer instinct.This year it was the 26-year-old Zvonareva who found herself on the couch of the armchair psychoanalysts, with her temperament a continuing topic of conversation. The rub on her was that she was too emotional, as evidenced by her tear-filled meltdowns during a loss in the women’s doubles final at Wimbledon and in a fourth-round defeat to Flavia Pennetta at last year’s Open.Zvonareva, the seventh seed, showed no signs of cracking even when the strings on a handful of her rackets snapped in her semifinal against the top seed, Caroline Wozniacki, who lost to Clijsters in last year’s final. Zvonareva conducted herself as if she were eager to erase the memory of her match against Pennetta, in which she squandered six match points in the second set, flung her racket, pulled at the tape supporting her knees and failed to win a game in the third.The first cracks in Zvonareva’s composure on Saturday appeared 19 minutes into the first set, when Clijsters earned her first break point, in the sixth game. She won the point when a backhand by Zvonareva sailed out.That side would be Zvonareva’s thorn all night. Twelve of her 17 forced errors and 9 of her 24 unforced errors came on her backhand. Zvonareva lost the first set when she netted a backhand after digging herself a 0-40 hole.It was the first set she had dropped in the tournament. On the changeover, Zvonareva remained on the court and shooed a ball girl out of the way so she could hit a backhand over the net.Neither her backhand nor her disposition improved in the second set. In the first game, Zvonareva slid into a half-splits position to retrieve a shot deep to her backhand side. When she could not reach the ball, she smashed her racket onto the court three times until it was as frayed as her nerves seemed to be.“When I cracked my racket, I was like, ‘Come on,’ ” Zvonareva said. “The ball is just two steps away. I was able to get this ball in previous matches, and right now I’m just like so slow, cannot move.” She added: “You just let the emotions out. Maybe it will help.”Clijsters had reeled off seven consecutive games until Zvonareva held to pull to 3-1. Despite engaging Clijsters in a few stirring rallies — one of which lasted 27 strokes — Zvonareva could not match the precision of Clijsters, who had 17 winners to Zvonareva’s 6.“Kim just played tremendously well today,” Zvonareva said on the court as she fought back tears. “She deserved to win.”The brevity of the match — 59 minutes — made it the shortest women’s final at the Open since at least 1980, the first year the matches were timed. Zvonareva took a small measure of comfort in knowing that Clijsters lost her first four major finals before breaking through at the 2005 Open. Clijsters said she told Zvonareva afterward: “Just keep it going. It will happen.”A grateful Zvonareva said, “She’s a great champion but also a great person.” She added, “Maybe because she said that, maybe I’m not so disappointed right now.”The scene of Clijsters holding aloft the trophy did not impress Jada Lynch, Clijsters’s two-and-a-half-year-old daughter, who warily backed away when Clijsters tried to let her touch the trophy and later was overhead telling photographers, “No photos.”The first time Clijsters played in an Open final was in 2003, when the tournament was missing the game’s top two women, Serena and Venus Williams, because of injuries. Clijsters said that her straight-sets loss that year to her fellow Belgian, Justine Henin, was a blur, and that she has learned to better control her emotions.Serena Williams, the current No. 1, was absent again this year after foot surgery. Her absence was supposed to open the draw, but in the end Clijsters became the first woman to successfully defend her Open title since Venus Williams in 2001.Clijsters is so unassuming that it requires little imagination to picture her pushing her daughter in a grocery cart at the Pathmark in Wall, N.J., where she and her husband spend part of the year.And yet, Clijsters clearly feeds off the bright lights and the crowd’s electricity at Ashe.“What I like the most is that I see well,” she said. She added: “I can just really focus on the ball a lot better.”At night matches, Clijsters said, “there’s a different vibe.” She added: “They’re special. The crowd gets into it.”But like many of the people in attendance, Jada grew restless toward the end of the second set. To keep her occupied, family members gave her wristwatches to play with. All too soon, Zvonareva’s time was up.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','MOSCOW — Even as Microsoft comes under criticism for taking part in software piracy cases against advocacy groups and opposition newspapers in Russia, it is also facing separate accusations that some private lawyers representing the company are involved in corruption schemes.An international anticorruption group, Transparency International, and a major Russian human rights groups, Memorial, contend that some private lawyers retained by Microsoft in Russia were helping corrupt law-enforcement officials to extort money from the targets of piracy inquiries.Transparency International and Memorial said they had received reports of dozens of cases, from business owners throughout Russia who said they had been victims. In these schemes, the two groups say, corrupt officials seize computers, claim that they have found pirated Microsoft software and, in alliance with lawyers for Microsoft, demand bribes.“We ask you to approach the issue of selecting representatives in Russia more carefully,” the two groups said in a letter to Microsoft.Asked by The New York Times about the accusations, Microsoft said it believed that people who had no legal authority to represent Microsoft were fraudulently using the company’s name to extort money.It said that to combat such practices, it would for the first time publish a list on its Russian Web site of its lawyers around the country.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','MOSCOW — In response to inquiries from The New York Times about Microsoft’s role in antipiracy inquiries in Russia, Kevin Kutz, director of public affairs at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., issued the following statement:We take the concerns that have been raised very seriously. When we grant powers-of-attorney to outside counsel to aid our antipiracy efforts, we vet candidates carefully, we bind them contractually to strict standards and protocols, we train them and we monitor their activities. They are accountable to us, and if their actions do not comport with professional ethics, anticorruption laws, or Microsoft policies, we terminate our relationship with them. Moreover, as we did with Baikal Environmental Wave, we will act to ensure due process is followed in antipiracy cases that involve Microsoft products.We have to protect our products from piracy, but we also have a commitment to respect fundamental human rights. Microsoft antipiracy efforts are designed to honor both objectives, but we are open to feedback on what we can do to improve in that regard. We have been in discussions with human rights advocacy groups on steps we can take in Russia, and based on their suggestions we are adding the following to our efforts:¶ Increase monitoring and training of the local counsel who have powers of attorney for our antipiracy program, with more clearly defined responsibilities and accountabilities.¶ To prevent individuals or organizations from fraudulently claiming to represent Microsoft, publish on our Russia Web site the names and certifications of authorized representatives.¶ Increase awareness of Microsoft’s Infodonor program among NGOs in Russia, particularly outside the capital cities. This past March we held an NGO Roundtable with Russian NGOs to describe the Infodonor program — which makes software available to NGOs with no charge by Microsoft — and to explain our antipiracy policies. While some human rights organizations have already benefited, there are many more like the Youth Human Rights Movement who have expressed interest in participating. We will reach out to Y.H.R.M. and any other group interested in Infodonor and we will continue our engagement with human rights NGOs and others to gather feedback on ways to improve our antipiracy program.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Beltran hit a home run Friday night, his third of the season, in an 8-4 loss to the Phillies. But he also injured his left knee in the first inning in a race to first base with Philadelphia’s Ryan Howard.On Saturday, Mets Manager Jerry Manuel called Beltran’s latest problem “a little tendinitis.” He said it was “nothing substantial, but something that could keep him from playing every day.”Manuel and Beltran each suggested that Beltran had put pressure on his left knee to compensate for the other side.“It started bothering me when I started playing rehab games,” Beltran said. “But I’m not worried about it.”Beltran did not return from his most recent operation until July 15. His regular service in center field, despite his diminished fielding range, has seemed like an audition.He could appeal to an A.L. team that needs a veteran switch-hitter and is willing to pay part of his salary as the Mets try to reduce their payroll. But other problems surround Beltran.One came last week, when the Mets were in Washington and Beltran was one of three Mets who chose not to visit a hospital for wounded military veterans. The others were second baseman Luis Castillo, who said seeing such injuries made him uncomfortable, and pitcher Oliver Perez, who declined to give a reason.Although the hospital visit was not required, Pelfrey wrote the word “mandatory” on a notice posted in the clubhouse before the event. That earned him praise from Jeff Wilpon, the chief operating officer of the Mets, who said on Friday that Pelfrey was “becoming a great man.”Pelfrey, who has reached a career high in victories, might need to inherit the role of staff ace if Santana cannot open next season. Pelfrey said he had not heard Wilpon’s words but appreciated them.“I can see where he was coming from,” Pelfrey said. “Each year, you get a little more mature. You start to develop into the person you’re going to be. I feel I’m a lot more in control of myself on the field and off the field.”Beltran’s situation is not even the team’s most bothersome uncertainty as it heads into what could be an off-season of major change. Santana, the ace left-hander, said Friday that he would need season-ending surgery on his shoulder to correct a tear of the anterior capsule.The Mets may seek to shed other expensive and underperforming players like Castillo and Perez, and the team is disputing its contract with relief pitcher Francisco Rodriguez, who is out after surgery on his right thumb.Other subjects of speculation involve the job security of Manuel and General Manager Omar Minaya.Beltran’s surgery last winter irked the Mets’ management and ownership. Since returning, Beltran has played with a brace on his right knee.Regarding last winter’s surgery, Beltran said he was pleased. “The doctor did a great job,” Beltran said. “I haven’t felt anything. No pain. I just need to continue to get strong.”Beltran’s batting average is .235, 48 points below his career mark of .283 before the season.Since his return this summer, Beltran’s range has been notably deficient on balls hit to center, which is larger in Citi Field than in most stadiums.When asked on Saturday what percentage of his speed has returned so far, Beltran declined to give a numerical answer. “I feel good, man,” he said. “I don’t know what percentage.”Mike Pelfrey worked seven and one-third innings and gave up two runs and six hits. Ike Davis had four hits and drove in three runs; Jose Reyes hit a solo home run off Kyle Kendrick (9-9).'"
"'10-09-12,'0','CHICAGO — In this, a city now crawling with would-be candidates for mayor and what appear to be early signs of old divisions — racial, ethnic, geographic — that roiled City Hall in the past, at least one person seems unconcerned about the threat of a new era of political divisiveness.That person, Mayor Richard M. Daley, who was first elected in an earlier period of just such turmoil, describes a changed city, where blacks and Hispanics have now long held powerful positions and where the City Council’s racial battles of the 1980s (known here as Council Wars) no longer feel particularly relevant.“This is 2011,” Mr. Daley said in an interview in his fifth-floor office on Friday evening, looking ahead to Chicago’s February election — an ordinarily monotonous event that was transformed into a free-for-all last week when Mr. Daley announced that he would not seek a seventh term. “People have to get on with their lives. People want jobs. They don’t care who it is — they want jobs. And that’s all they’re talking about.”When he was first elected in 1989, Mr. Daley arrived with support from white voters but skepticism from minorities and so-called Lakefront liberals, who had witnessed years of Council battles after the election of the city’s first black mayor, Harold Washington.In the end, Mr. Daley managed to create unlikely coalitions and a City Council that mainly did whatever he wanted — ingredients that now seem utterly uncertain in a city that has been so dominated by the singular force of Mr. Daley for so long.“You cannot be a mayor thinking that those who voted for you — that I can only serve those,” Mr. Daley said, recalling his early years in office. “I had to work to convince the African-American community that I had the same goals of what they want to have in life — education, economic opportunity.”Many people have described Mr. Daley, 68, as calmer since he announced his decision on Tuesday, but in the interview he seemed every bit his usual self — blunt, certain and hardly given to flowery, sentimental reflections. He will soon become the city’s longest-serving mayor, overtaking the other Mayor Daley, his father, for that title.Asked what his father, who died in office in 1976, might have thought of his choice to step aside, Mr. Daley said his father would not have weighed in at all, having told him years earlier to make his own decisions on politics. Asked whether he regretted any actions during his 21 years in office, Mr. Daley said he never looked back, only ahead. And asked whether he could picture a Chicago with someone not named Daley at the helm, Mr. Daley said he most certainly could.“I have a lot of confidence in myself and confidence in the belief that I can be replaced,” the mayor said. “Everybody’s replaceable in life.”Mr. Daley said he would make no endorsement of possible replacements, a long list of aldermen, congressmen and others, including Rahm Emanuel, President Obama’s chief of staff, who also once worked for Mr. Daley’s campaign. “I don’t think you can anoint anybody,” he said. “I think it’s something that I have a lot of confidence in the people.”Mr. Daley added that when he ran against Mr. Washington and lost, he endorsed Mr. Washington the next day. “People didn’t like that I endorsed him,” he said, “but he had won fair and square.”Though his decision not to run again shocked many Chicagoans, Mr. Daley said that he had made up his mind two months ago — and made it up “easily” — to leave what he considers “the best job anyone can have.”It was simply time, he said, mocking speculation that recent setbacks might really explain the decision: his wife Maggie’s cancer, the city’s failed bid for the 2016 Olympics, a deficit of more than $650 million in the city budget, complaints over his deal to privatize the city’s parking meters, or approval ratings that sank to 37 percent earlier this summer, according to The Chicago Tribune.“I had good polls, bad polls all my life,” Mr. Daley saidMr. Daley expressed pride at his efforts to overhaul public schools and to replace large public housing projects with mixed-income developments. He said he had more to do before he left for an undetermined future in May. Among other things, he said he might call for a long-term look at whether to reverse the flow of the Chicago River, which was reversed more than a century ago in what was then a remarkable engineering feat so that waste could be carried away from Lake Michigan.By Friday night, Mr. Daley was headed to a public hearing on the city’s budget, which he expected would draw plenty of complaint. “People appreciate the love that I have for the city,” Mr. Daley said. “That doesn’t mean that they agree with you all the time.”'"

"'10-09-12,'0','FREDERICK FERMOR-HESKETH, THE SECOND BARON HESKETH, belonged to a family that had collected books since the 19th century. He was obsessed with having the very best, The Guardian reports, and willing to pay for it. Now, 55 years after his death, some of his collection will be sold. There is a Shakespeare’s First Folio, a volume of 36 plays published in 1623; a cache of letters from Elizabeth I to the jailer of Mary, Queen of Scots; and a John James Audubon’s “Birds of America,” valued at $6.2 million to $9.2 million. The oversize book, with 435 hand-colored prints, was first bought by an early paleobotanist, Henry Witham. Of that transaction, Audubon, who died in 1851, wrote: “I determined in an instant that this gentleman was a gentleman indeed. ... We all talked much, for I believe the good wine of Mr. Witham had a most direct effect.”'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Seattle lost a beloved example of midcentury modern architecture, a curvy-roofed building that most recently housed a Denny’s restaurant, to the wrecking ball in 2008; it is still waiting for the condominiums and shops that were to open.Other cities, including San Diego and San Francisco, have so many empty lots that officials have discussed filling them with temporary tree farms, parks or public art.But perhaps none of those stalled projects have stirred as much angst as the one here, known as One Franklin. For nearly a century, Filene’s Basement was as renowned a monument as Fenway Park and Faneuil Hall — a plaque out front commemorated Filene’s as the “Hub of the Universe.” Long before outlet malls, it promised the thrill of the hunt and left generations of Bostonians with stories of tugs of war fought, treasures found and friendships forged in its drab aisles.“Everyone would dig through those bins, and you never knew what beautiful things you’d come away with,” said Anne Peckham, a devotee whose relationship with Filene’s was like Holly Golightly’s with Tiffany’s. “If you had a tough day, there was nothing that would brighten it more than going down to the Basement.”Tempers erupted here last month when one of the project’s developers, Vornado Realty Trust, based in New York, won approval to build a skyscraper there that will rival the Empire State Building in height. Mayor Thomas M. Menino threatened to revoke building permits for the Boston site if construction did not resume this month. “It shows arrogance on their part,” he said. “They could care less about Boston, and that bothers me to no end.”A similar situation played out in New York in the 1990s, when Vornado let the former Alexander’s department store on Lexington Avenue sit vacant and blighted for years. Mr. Menino invoked Alexander’s in an angry letter to Vornado executives, accusing them of “a consistent policy of indifference.”Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Vornado, declined to comment, as did Marcy Syms, whose company, the Syms Corporation, now owns Filene’s Basement.In a letter to the city last month, Sandeep Mathrani, an executive vice president of Vornado, wrote that it was still seeking “a suitable solution for the site that can be financed and meet the city’s goals for the area.” But the letter, which was also signed by John B. Hynes III, a co-developer, offered no timeline.There are now 27 other Filene’s Basement stores in nine states and Washington, including one in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. But none hold the cachet of the original 1909 downtown store. Susan Edbril, a psychologist whose grandmother worked at Filene’s for almost 40 years, said the demolition did not seem so bad when a new version of the store was expected within a few years. “People didn’t have a chance to say goodbye or to grieve,” Dr. Edbril said, “because they thought it was going to be there again.”Dr. Edbril and Michael Bavaro, a filmmaker, recently finished a documentary called “Voices from the Basement” about the store and its devotees, including former Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the actress Estelle Parsons and Representative Barney Frank. Mr. Frank described the store as Boston’s great equalizer, drawing rich and poor alike with its famous automatic markdown system.The film was supposed to include footage of the new store, Dr. Edbril said, but she eventually gave up.She is still besieged by people eager to share their Filene’s Basement stories. “Everyone in this city has one,” Dr. Edbril said. “If you think about that and what was lost, it’s psychologically huge.”In Providence, David O’Brien’s art shop, Picture This, looks out on the neglected facade of the razed Providence National Bank building, which is supported by rusting steel beams that block the sidewalk and part of the street.“It’s a hazard at this point,” he said. “I would just as soon take that lot and turn it into a park, a parking lot — anything — until they have the money to build again.”Mr. Menino, who has a history of highly public battles with developers, rejected an offer by the developers to move ahead with a scaled-down project that would include some stores, including a Filene’s, and a parking garage.“That’s a moneymaker for them, but what’s it do for the city?” he said.He said he was among those who missed roaming the aisles of Filene’s, where aunts took him on Sundays as a child and where he snagged piles of ties and suits over the years. Like him, Mrs. Peckham recalled how Bostonians used to love ducking out of work for an hour or two to comb the racks.“When people were overcome with solving their problems,” she said, “I used to say, ‘Is there any harm in just leaving the office and going to look at beautiful things?’ It was a lot cheaper and a lot more fun than having a psychiatrist.”'"
"'10-09-12,'0','The era of labor-management stability is disintegrating just as owners are falling out with one another. Some clubs, including Jerry Jones’s Cowboys and Daniel Snyder’s Redskins, bring in more than $100 million more per season than other teams. They want to end revenue sharing and salary caps, maximize profits from their television markets and stadiums, and make their teams into football’s equivalent of the Yankees or the Red Sox.Without the substantial revenue sharing and salary caps now in place, the league may start to mirror Major League Baseball. Deep-pocketed teams will monopolize postseason play, salary disparities between the players will grow and a dozen teams will start each season with little hope of reaching the playoffs.The N.F.L. is turning its back on exactly what brought it success: a win-win outcome to labor negotiations and a one-for-all ethos among the owners. For decades after the league’s inception in 1920, it struggled. The Steelers’ Rooney once said: “The pro game wasn’t even a hop, skip and a jump from semipro ball. Maybe just a hop.”The league almost folded when several franchises collapsed during the Depression, but a core of owners stuck together. They adopted measures to ensure that the weakest teams would prosper so that the league could succeed.In 1936, the owners equalized the distribution of players through a collegiate draft, allowing the team with the worst record to pick first, and the best team last. “People come to see a competition,” said Mara, who knew that a draft would bolster other clubs at his Giants’ expense, but that one-sided games were bad for business.Owners then stabilized the finances of smaller-market teams. In 1947, when clubs depended on their game-day revenue, the league awarded visiting teams 40 percent of the gate, protecting weaker teams at home and helping them on the road. It also gave teams that finished poorly easier schedules for the next season.Though the owners have held the whip hand ever since they recognized the union in 1957, they have gradually conceded more to the players. By the 1994 season, the owners and the union agreed to a salary cap calculated as a percentage of designated revenue (about 60 percent last season). Each team could spend up to a designated amount on salaries each season based on the size of that pool, but not below a smaller figure. For 2009, the final capped season played under the expiring agreement, the ceiling was $128 million per team, the floor $112 million.The N.F.L. also harnessed television wisely. In 1961, teams agreed to divide television revenue equally and began selling league rights as a package. Green Bay, with a tiny television market, took in as much as the Bears in Chicago. When merchandising and corporate sponsorships began pumping money into sports, the N.F.L. also split that income equally. By contrast, the bulk of baseball’s television revenue is locally derived, and team revenues are disparate.Long-term sustainability has paid off for the N.F.L. It has grown to 32 teams with 1,696 players from 13 teams with 494 players in 1960. Every team made Forbes.com’s recent list of the 50 most valuable sporting franchises in the world, with valuations ranging from $725 million to $1.8 billion. Not bad considering that the Giants franchise originally cost $500. But growth has tested the capacity of the owners and the players to trust one another.In past seasons, the owners went to the racetrack, to dinner and to Mass together. Hardly a day went by when Rooney and Bell did not speak on the telephone. Now small armies of lawyers and accountants mediate discussions. Contention is replacing camaraderie; new owners are eager to break with legacy families and the past.Gaps have widened between the owners and the players, too. In 1977, the Steelers’ Dan Rooney broke a contract impasse after taking the union leader Ed Garvey to dinner. “It was the first time we’d ever broken bread together,” Garvey said. They soon settled that dispute; Rooney’s friendship with a later union leader, Gene Upshaw, prevented work stoppages and cemented the salary cap.But in its 10th decade, the N.F.L. seems to have forgotten those lessons. It outlasted the Depression, wars and rival leagues by building an enterprise based on collective interest over self-interest. If owners and players forget what made them successful, they will surely lose that success.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','But those long-held values came crashing down in the fallout of Knight’s firing on Sept. 10, 2000.From lawsuits to instability to the university’s biggest recruiting scandal in nearly half a century, Indiana wound up in the headlines for all the wrong reasons: player suspensions, academic woes and allegations of drug use within the program. The Hoosiers missed the N.C.A.A. tournament four times and endured three losing seasons in a decade for only the second time since World War II ended.“It tore apart the department and the university,” said Jerry Yeagley, a former Hoosiers soccer coach who won six national titles and befriended Knight. “Basically there was no middle ground; you were on one side or the other.”The other side contended that Indiana had put up with too many of Knight’s embarrassing antics.The list included things like throwing a chair, berating an N.C.A.A. tournament volunteer, appearing to kick his son during a game, intimidating other university employees, and putting his hands on a player’s throat at practice. The last outburst prompted Myles Brand, then the university president, to put Knight on a “zero tolerance” policy in May 2000.Knight did not make it through the off-season. Less than four months later, the student Kent Harvey was buying football tickets when he yelled, “Hey, Knight, what’s up?” That is when Knight grabbed him by the arm, Harvey said, and lectured him. Knight argued it did not happen that way, but three days later he was out.“We all grew up wanting to play for Coach Knight, and this was something that was taking someone’s dream away after we had all worked so hard to get there,” said Dane Fife, who played on Knight’s last Indiana team and stuck around for the Hoosiers’ one glorious post-Knight moment — the run to the 2002 N.C.A.A. title game. “My disagreement with it was that I think they should have either made a clean break 5 or 10 years earlier, or found a way to make it work.”Time has done little to heal the wounds.Knight and his son, Pat, now the Texas Tech coach, declined interview requests for this article. Mike Davis, Knight’s immediate successor at Indiana, would not talk either. The former university trustee Steve Ferguson, once Knight’s personal lawyer, said he had not changed his opinion about the decision. And Peg Brand, Brand’s widow, continues to support his decision.“If I look to see what has been accomplished in the last 10 years with Bob Knight, I don’t think there is any comparison,” she said, referring to what her husband did as the N.C.A.A. president before his death on Sept. 16, 2009. “I don’t even see the point.”With Knight, the Hoosiers went 661-240 in 29 seasons and spent years boasting that every player who stayed for four seasons left with a Big Ten crown.Without him, Indiana is 177-144 with six N.C.A.A. tourney appearances in 10 years and one Big Ten championship.The bigger hit has come in recruiting. The continual coaching changes combined with the rise of two other Indiana programs — archrival Purdue and Butler, last year’s national runner-up — has the third-year coach Tom Crean playing catch-up.“Indiana obviously went down from a national perspective from the way it was when Knight was there,” the national recruiting analyst Bob Gibbons said. “The heart and soul of their program has always been in-state kids staying home, growing up and wanting to play for the Hoosiers and Bob Knight, and all that left. It’s taken some time, but I think the new coaching staff is slowly, but surely, getting the program back.”The former Purdue coach Gene Keady, who relished the rivalry with Knight and the Hoosiers, was not so sure.“I hope they get it back because Indiana-Purdue is always one of the biggest rivalries in the nation, and they need that,” said Keady, who spent last season working on the Big Ten Network. “But I don’t know if they’re getting there. That’s a good question, but I just don’t know.”Crean and Glass have spent countless hours trying to revive the good old days, but they have spent some of their time trying to mend fences, too.Since taking over as Hoosiers coach in April 2008, Crean has been bringing back players, including Knight loyalists, to celebrate the program’s rich history. Some, like Fife, now the head coach at Indiana-Purdue Fort Wayne, said that was one way to reunify Hoosiers Nation.“The biggest disappointment to me has been the lack of player involvement,” Fife said. “And I’m as guilty as anybody of not going back and making those players understand the importance of Indiana basketball.”Glass went directly to Knight. Last year, they spent nearly five hours at a lunch meeting, and the two have since exchanged notes.Glass also urged Hall of Fame voters to elect Knight last year, and Indiana’s new practice facility contains several exhibits showcasing Knight’s greatest achievements at Indiana, including college basketball’s last unbeaten team (1976).Glass is not the only one who wants Knight to be involved with the program.“I have a ton of respect for Bob Knight,” Crean said. “But when you get here and learn exactly how powerful this program is, because people have such a real passion for this program, it’s really amazing and that’s because of Bob Knight.”'"
"'10-09-12,'0','That a former community organizer and insurgent presidential candidate from a rocky middle-class background could be branded an out-of-touch elitist is not entirely the fault of his critics. Obama has perhaps never recovered from handing his administration’s plum economic jobs to Robert Rubin protégés with dirty hands from the bubble — , a deregulation advocate from the Clinton administration, and , an indulgent regulator at the . Their presence has helped Obama’s more unscrupulous adversaries get away with the lie that his White House, not President Bush’s, created TARP. Indeed, such is the Obama administration’s identification with the tarnished Wall Street culture that even Michael Bloomberg mistakenly identified Geithner, a longtime public servant who never worked at an bank, as a alumnus at a public event in New York last month.The White House’s not-on-C-Span deal-making with the health care industry behemoths only cemented the administration’s corporatist image, as did Obama’s meandering path to what still looks like a loophole-ridden compromise on . This is why even many Democrats have become lukewarm in their conviction that their president “understands the problems of people like you.”For Obama to make Americans believe he does understand their problems and close the enthusiasm gap, he cannot merely make changes of campaign style. Sporadic photo ops in shirtsleeves or factory settings persuade no one; a few terrific speeches can’t always ride to the rescue. Nor would there be much point in firing Summers and Geithner — a political nonstarter anyway, now that it’s been opportunistically proposed by the G.O.P. leader (his one good idea). Certainly Obama can add powerful new hands who might actually fight to protect ordinary Americans from the sharks; the star consumer advocate, , should have been front and center, even in a Senate confirmation battle, long ago. But in the short term between now and Election Day, Obama may have the most to gain by sharpening his attack on those “powerful interests” who liken him to a dog. A top dog bites back (with a smile).In a second forceful speech last week, delivered outside , Obama titillated the political press by calling out Boehner by name eight times. But though Boehner is a nice soft target — he belittled the economic meltdown as an “ant” and has staked his political capital on extending cuts for America’s wealthiest 3 percent — he’s merely a front-man. Obama must also call out the powerful interests who are pulling the G.O.P.’s strings (and filling its coffers), whether on Wall Street or in Big Oil or any other sector where special interests are aligned against reform in the public interest.If Obama can speak lucidly about a subject as thorny as race, he can surely do a far more specific job of telling the story of how we got to this economic impasse. He must join the many who are talking about why the top 1 percent of American earners now take home nearly a quarter of Americans’ total income — perhaps the single most revealing indicator of how three decades of greed and free-market absolutism have eviscerated America’s fundamental ideals of fairness. It can’t all be reduced to the shorthand of “ .”Obama might be so rude as to point out how these top earners are whining all the way to the bank even as the G.O.P. opposes extending more benefits to the unemployed and new tax cuts to small business. In June, the Business Roundtable chairman and chief executive gave a speech so rank with self-victimization — he claimed that government was “reaching into virtually every sector of economic life” — that the normally polite business columnist Steven Pearlstein reviled him as “a corporate hack” peddling “much-discredited country-club nonsense.”Seidenberg was soon topped by a multibillionaire Republican contributor, , who likened Obama’s modest financial regulatory package to “when invaded in 1939.” Among the clients of Schwarzman’s private equity company, Blackstone, is Goodyear, which signed on in 2004 to get advice on “optimal business configuration” and announced it was shipping more jobs to the following year. That narrative, one of countless like it, might have come in handy last week when Obama was speaking in , just 30 miles from Goodyear’s headquarters.As many have noted, the obvious political model for Obama this year is , who at his legendary 1936 Madison Square Garden rally declared that he welcomed the “hatred” of his enemies in the realms of “business and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.” As the historian David Kennedy writes in his definitive book on the period, “Freedom from Fear,” Roosevelt “had little to lose by alienating the right,” including those in the corporate elite, with such invective; they already detested him as vehemently as the Business Roundtable crowd does Obama.Though F.D.R. was predictably accused of “class warfare,” his antibusiness “radicalism,” was, in Kennedy’s words, “a carefully staged political performance, an attack not on the capitalist system itself but on a few high-profile capitalists.” Roosevelt was trying to co-opt the populist rage of his economically despondent era, some of it uncannily -esque in its hysteria, before it threatened that system, let alone his presidency. Only the crazy right confused F.D.R. with communists for taking on capitalism’s greediest players, and since our crazy right has portrayed Obama as a communist, socialist and Nazi for months, he’s already paid that political price without gaining any of the benefits of bringing on this fight in earnest.F.D.R. presided over a landslide in 1936. The best the Democrats can hope for in 2010 is smaller-than-expected losses. To achieve even that, Obama will have to give an F.D.R.-size performance — which he can do credibly and forcibly only if he really means it. So far, his administration’s seeming coziness with some of the same powerful interests now vilifying him has left middle-class voters, including Democrats suffering that enthusiasm gap, confused as to which side he is on. If ever there was a time for him to clear up the ambiguity, this is it.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','How much pandering does a politician have to do to win the gun lobby’s political blessing? Apparently there is never enough.Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, must have felt politically secure a year ago when he delivered a $61 million desert shooting range to his home state, Nevada, with earmarked federal money. “A true champion of the Second Amendment back in Washington, D.C.,” enthused Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association. Mr. Reid, brandishing his boyhood .22 rifle, chimed in, “This weapon is my friend.”Now the N.R.A. has announced its non-endorsement of the senator’s re-election bid, citing as the reason his support of the confirmation of Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court — suspicious newcomers, in the gun lobby’s cramped view.The rebuff to Senator Reid, who drew a safe B rating from the N.R.A. six years ago and a $4,000 N.R.A contribution earlier this year, involves a level of gun politics more craven than usual. When word circulated that the N.R.A. was considering a positive endorsement of the senator for his many favors, zealous members rebelled. They far preferred Mr. Reid’s Republican challenger, Sharron Angle, the Tea Party insurgent who apparently won their loyalty, talking darkly of frustrated voters weighing “Second Amendment remedies” to unresponsive government. When her call to “take Harry Reid out” broke the titillation meter, Ms. Angle said she only meant, of course, to take him out politically. Such is the lethal nonsense of gun politics.The N.R.A. stresses it is not endorsing Ms. Angle. But its cooling to Senator Reid is apparent to all. Over-the-top gun enthusiasts now await fresh red meat from Ms. Angle (whose handlers are trying to pull her away from the edge for the general election). Meanwhile, gunshot deaths register in the tens of thousands every year.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','“The likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unexpectedly high,” the utility said in proposing $5 million be spent to replace 7,481 feet of pipe in 2013.It was not clear that the section of pipe mentioned was the one that ruptured, and PG&E officials could not be reached for comment. Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group in San Francisco, said the pipeline was at least in the vicinity of the explosion. “It’s the same pipeline,” she said.Nearly 600 residents of the neighborhood, many looking spent and exhausted, packed St. Robert’s Church here where they submitted written questions that reflected their concerns about what had happened and how the company had responded to the threat. Officials with the utility said they had not figured out what caused the blast or been able to confirm reports of a history of gas smells.“We have been hearing about these allegations since the event occurred, and we are committed to find out exactly what happened,” said Geisha Williams, senior vice president of energy delivery for PG&E, at times speaking over hecklers.“We don’t know what made that pipeline rupture,” she said.Still, in comparison to police and local officials, who drew a standing ovation, the utility representatives faced an increasingly hostile crowd. Residents asked about the prospects for reimbursement for losses, for transmission maps to learn if gas lines ran under their houses and they asked when they could go home.Earlier in the day, the San Mateo County coroner identified two of the dead found on Friday as Jacqueline Greig, 44, of San Bruno, and her 13-year-old daughter, Janessa. Ms. Greig was a longtime employee of the California Public Utilities Commission.In a March 1 presentation to investors, the utility also acknowledged a history of problems with its leak program. According to a presentation disclosed in the course of rate-making proceedings, PG&E stated that an internal 2007 investigation found deficiencies in a North Coast gas leak survey.The utility said that the area was resurveyed and is now in compliance. The presentation also noted that a “significant number” of surveyors had not been adequately trained to detect leaks using optical devices and that PG&E suspended its North Coast leak surveys to retrain its workers. One region that the utility said had problems with leak surveys was the San Francisco Peninsula, the area that surrounds San Bruno.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','IT has been almost four years since the Flying Pig on Lexington moved from the Mount Kisco train station into the space last occupied by the sophisticated Café Antico. With the new restaurant came the rustic spirit of the farm, with a somewhat predictable décor involving a large number of pig images and figurines. But the heart of a restaurant is in the kitchen. This one employs freshly harvested and organically cultivated vegetables, as well as products from livestock raised humanely at Cabbage Hill Farm, which is the restaurant’s owner and its major supplier. A few other similarly committed farms also supply the restaurant.The farm’s mission is a worthy one, and its successful completion is up to the kitchen, which for the most part treats its local products with the respect they deserve. Even more exciting is that, finally, over the past two years, a comfortable, modern style has been evolving here. For one, the restaurant has scrapped the traditional three-course dinner routine, although the current menu misleads on this point, listing dishes substantial enough to be entrees as starters. For another, a pizza oven has been installed, canceling any remaining notion of formality.About a dozen thin-crusted personal-size pizzas have been added to the dinner menu. Judging from our sampling of juicy fennel sausage, mozzarella and fresh basil, any of the other combinations would be as pleasing. The size is enough for an entree for one or as a shared appetizer.Among the hefty starters were some of the most engaging dishes here. Spaghetti squash, usually sauced with pesto or garlic and oil came with pomodoro — the excellent sweet tomato sauce enriched with butter. In a culinary feat, a large egg from an Araucana hen was poached, lightly breaded and fried, leaving the yolk still soft. This “fried crispy egg” came served over roasted asparagus, sprinkled with tiny bits of diced chorizo, an ingenious concoction.Simpler but just as satisfying were skillet-roasted Prince Edward Island mussels in a savory broth; a salad of sweet, ripe stone fruit, so refreshing on a hot day; and a salad of hydroponic lettuces mingled with walnuts, goat cheese and orange. The lamb burgers were also delicious, though messy with dripping oil: wear washable clothing.'"

"'10-09-12,'0','But I figured that, after three years as a highly visible blogger, writer, Twitter user (she has 86,000 followers) and speaker on college campuses, Ms. McCain had learned to control how she comes across.She scooched over to make room at the table, drawing her legs up under her onto the banquette. My Oklahoma accent almost came back, unbidden.The emotional, direct personality she projects in her book (“I’m a nonstop extrovert, a people person who loves mingling and gabbing and getting out in the world”) immediately emerged in conversation.She said she was thrilled to be living near her family again. Her brother Jimmy was back home in Phoenix after his second tour in Iraq (the two of them had vowed to get tattoos that said “Live Free or Die” once he was out, but “my mom wants both of us to stop”).The previous weekend, she’d helped her little sister Bridget pack for her freshman year at Arizona State University in Tempe. “I told her, ‘Do not put anything on Facebook you wouldn’t want pasted on every gossip blog everywhere.’ ”When we discussed her book, she was just as voluble. “It was really cathartic,” she said. “Some parts were hard, like when I wrote the election night chapter. It’s not something I wanted to relive, but I felt like it was important.”Back in New York, Ms. McCain’s friend Ramin Setoodeh, who worked with her when she was an intern at Newsweek in 2006-7, told me, “The way she sounds in the book is how she sounds in real life, and how she sounds as my friend. It’s her.”The tone that works so well in person and in “Dirty Sexy Politics” misfired for Ms. McCain in 2007, in her early days as a writer, when she was 22 and had just graduated from Columbia University.On her own initiative and with her own money, she created the blog McCainBlogette to chronicle her father’s presidential run, hoping to widen his appeal among the digital generation.At a stylishly retro Scottsdale hotel called the Valley Ho, on the day of her blog’s debut, Ms. McCain received withering reaction online. Commenters on the blog Wonkette (which mocked McCainBlogette) compared her to a Bada Bing Club girl from “The Sopranos.” Ms. McCain later described that experience as “baptism by acid.”“I was so honest and beautifully naïve to many things,” she told me. “I just thought I was doing a fun thing, and that everyone would want to get in on it.” By the time Ms. McCain turned 24 in October 2008, she was blogging from semi-exile. (Her father’s campaign manager, Steve Schmidt, “banished” her and her entourage from the main campaign five weeks before its close for being “too controversial.”) “I felt 100 years older,” she wrote. Two years on, it looks like she has recovered her youth.Her goal for the book, she said, is to “inspire people who feel disconnected from the political process,” particularly people her own age. “I’m friends with people that probably would describe themselves as socialists and people that are much more conservative than I am,” she said. “I can always find a middle ground.”Criticizing the partisan bickering she sees on Fox News and MSNBC, she remarked that, although she and her friends sometimes disagree, “I can’t remember where there was ever a situation where we were screaming at each other.”Believing that the incivility of current discourse has led many young people to tune out politics, she said, she wants her book to make the political process newly appetizing and relatable.“I know what kind of books I read on vacation and it is not necessarily ‘Diplomacy’ by Henry Kissinger,” she said. “No disrespect to that book, I have read that book. But not on spring break.”Her own book would make as gripping a read for vacationers on South Padre Island as it would for students at midterms or for politicos on the eve of midterm elections.But “Dirty Sexy Politics” is no young-adult memoir; it’s a strongly-worded political platform from which Ms. McCain attacks today’s moribund, inflexible Republican Party (“all the old dudes,” is one way she puts it) and clamors for change.Throughout the book, she lays out her vision of a moderate, inclusive Republican Party that could win over young people like herself who have come of age with interactive social media and care about small government, defense, the environment and gay rights.It infuriates her when rigid Republicans accuse her of being a Republican In Name Only, a RINO. “I cannot stand the word RINO, because I think it’s an easy way to belittle someone who’s flexible with the kind of world we live in,” she said.“I’m pro-life, but I’m pro birth control. I am also pro being realistic about the kind of world we live in.” She supports marriage equality for gay Americans, she added, because, “I have friends who are gay, and I’d like to go to their weddings.”This January she subjected herself to a Republican “purity test” in an article in The Daily Beast. She gave herself 8 out of 10 points, docking herself a point for her gay-marriage views, and a half-point each for her views on environmental cap-and-trade policy (“I believe in climate change”) and immigration amnesty (“I grew up in a border state. I think immigration is an essential part of American history and American culture. And amnesty comes with a lot of gray areas”).Nevertheless, her progressive views have angered traditionalists within the Republican Party. In March 2009, she wrote a column in The Daily Beast that accused Ann Coulter, the conservative American political commentator and writer, of perpetuating “negative stereotypes about Republicans,” and called her “offensive, radical, insulting and confusing.” “I object to people who use politics as entertainment,” she told me. The column provoked Laura Ingraham, the conservative commentator and radio show host, to deride Ms. McCain on her show as “plus-sized.”In response, Ms. McCain lambasted Ms. Ingraham on the talk show “The View.” “I want to have a political discussion about the ideological future of the Republican Party, and the answer is, ‘She’s fat, she shouldn’t have an opinion?’ ”“What kind of message are we sending young women?” she asked. “It’s terrible!”Last week, Edward Felsenthal, executive editor of The Daily Beast, who hired Ms. McCain as a writer in 2009, recalled that appearance. “It was kind of a ‘you go, girl’ moment, and she works that very well,” he said. “She knows who she is, she has fun with who she is, and she doesn’t worry about who she isn’t. She’s game.”Sherri Shepherd, a host of “The View” who has become friends with Ms. McCain, said, “Meghan is a role model for young girls are who are trying to figure out who they are.”But in Arizona, Ms. McCain admitted that she finds attacks on her looks hard to take. “It’s very harsh,” she said. “I’m of the belief that you should never say anything bad about a woman’s appearance, ever. It’s nothing I would ever do.”Her conviction that her gender makes her vulnerable to misogynist criticism has discouraged her from becoming a candidate, though she shares her father’s instinct for leadership. (Her mother, Cindy, calls her “John McCain in a dress.”)“We’re both very strong-willed and ambitious, and I think we have a similar sense of humor,” Meghan told me. “I think we both live our lives kind of fearlessly and without apologizing.”But when it comes to electability, she’s a realist. “We still have a glass ceiling. It has not been shattered and until we have a woman president it won’t be shattered. I think everyone saw the way Hillary was treated and Sarah was treated, and it’s awful,” she continued, referring to Ms. Clinton and Ms. Palin. “There’s still blatant sexism everywhere.”“I’m a 25-year-old woman with tattoos,” Ms. McCain said, waving her left hand to show the black cross on her wrist, “I just live my life very openly. I don’t think in this climate that I could get elected, either. I like to go to Vegas and I like to play blackjack with my friends. Can you do that if you’re a candidate? No. I rest my case.”She still resents Ms. Ingraham’s remark but added, “I should send her a fruit basket. It’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to my career. I don’t care if she disagrees with me.”In “Dirty Sexy Politics,” Ms. McCain brings similar bluntness to her recollection of a day when she was snubbed by another prominent woman — Laura Bush.It was in March 2008, two days after Mr. McCain had won four presidential primaries, clinching the Republican nomination. Mrs. Bush had invited Meghan and her mother to the White House for lunch.Meghan dressed to the hilt, in an elegant black Diane von Furstenberg dress, a capelet and Tory Burch peep-toe heels, her hair swept up in plaits.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Ms. McCain had struggled to appear decorous, knowing that as a candidate’s daughter, her “entire job” was “standing, waving and wearing the right clothes, like a princess doll.”In memorable images, she stands sandwiched between her parents, playing backup to her crisp, St. John-suited mother and her grinning, square-shouldered father.This sort of self-muffling warred with her instincts. It was, she writes, “essentially the exact opposite of who I am.” But she thought a White House visit called for glamour. “In my mind, even at nighttime at the White House, people would be wearing giant silk robes and golden slippers. Anything else would spoil the mood,” she writes.But when Mrs. Bush, in a sweater and slacks, greeted her and her mother, she told them there’d been a misunderstanding. The invitation only applied to Mrs. McCain. Meghan was sent to the White House mess. “I was given a doggie bag of enchiladas,” Ms. McCain writes.“Want to talk about feeling stupid and unwanted? Try carrying a take-out bag as you leave the White House in sparkly glitter heels and your hair braided in three huge cornrows.”“I hope Laura and Jenna Bush won’t be angry with me for dishing like this,” she writes. “But I use Taylor Swift as a model: If you don’t want her to write a song about you, don’t give her a reason.” Zing! But at Blanco, Ms. McCain excused the Bush diss: “I think that it was a long eight years for them,” she said. “They’re not ill-intentioned.”After lunch, when we convoyed to the Valley Ho and sat around a Jetsons-style bar table over fizzy drinks, she confided that she was in the “very, very baby stages of some television stuff, just development.” She quickly added, “I would never do a reality show, ever.”Could a “Meghan McCain Show” be a reasonable future move? “It’s easy to imagine that she could pull it off,” Mr. Felsenthal said. Ms. Shepherd had a still stronger reaction, “I absolutely see Meghan in television. When she comes on and talks she puts the ideologies in practical terms, and she makes it so you understand.” She added, “Meghan will never have to go on ‘Dancing with the Stars.’ ”Ms. Shepherd was alluding to another female figure in the Republican political scene: Sarah Palin’s daughter Bristol, who is to appear on “Dancing with the Stars” this fall.Ms. McCain’s revelation of her conflicted feelings about Sarah Palin and her family in “Dirty Sexy Politics” has drawn more news media attention than any of the book’s other juicy secrets.There was the crazy sex among overworked “drones and journalists” blinded by “campaign goggles;” thefts of Mitt Romney signs by misbehaving McCainBlogettes; and even a Xanax mishap that left Ms. McCain “knocked out like a corpse” on a campaign plane (she gives a “special shout-out” to Cynthia McFadden of ABC, “for not putting it on ‘Nightline’ ”).But on Aug. 31, when “Dirty Sexy Politics” was released, Mr. Stephanopoulos asked Ms. McCain so many questions on “Good Morning America” about the Palins that she interrupted him to say, “For the record, my book is not just about Sarah and Bristol Palin.”When she appeared that night on the “O’Reilly Factor,” Bill O’Reilly plied her with still more Sarah Palin questions. Was she a “diva?” Ms. McCain shook her head. “I didn’t see her as a diva. I saw her as a woman who knew what she wanted.”In the book, Ms. McCain calls Ms. Palin “the most beautiful politician I had ever seen,” but remembers thinking, “I don’t know anything about this woman and neither does the rest of the country.” Soon, she nicknamed her the Time Bomb. “I was waiting for her to explode.”On election night, weeks after that explosion had occurred (after Ms. Palin’s disastrous interview on the “CBS Evening News” with Katie Couric), and soon after her father had made his concession speech at the Arizona Biltmore, Ms. McCain was “shocked” to see Ms. Palin waving to the cameras.“I saw something that I hadn’t really wanted to see before: Losing wasn’t an end for her. It was a beginning.”For Ms. McCain, the political is inextricable from the personal. And whether she would like to see it this way or not, her father’s presidential loss also marked a new beginning for her. Since her book’s release last week, she has appeared on “The View,” “The Rachel Maddow Show,” “Fox & Friends” and “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.”“It was liberating to be able to tell my side of the story,” she told me in Scottsdale. But the new story she’s narrating is her own; she’s the front-runner in a race whose goal is still unknown, but whose progress is visible.As she left the Valley Ho, driving off to see her mother, she hugged me goodbye: the reflex of a woman who can’t separate inclusiveness from effusiveness, and maybe doesn’t need to.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','In the interview Mr. Followill said the song was “the way that I want to talk to my children.” But, he added, its first words — “The open road, the path of greatness, is at your fingers/Go be the one that keeps on fighting, go be the stranger” — speak “definitely to myself.” Kings of Leon’s first album, “Youth and Young Manhood” in 2003, had a scrappy energy that drew comparisons to the Strokes, the Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground and the Allman Brothers. The band drew early praise from U2 and Pearl Jam, both of which also booked them to open tours. They “took us under their wings and showed us what it was like to play in an arena,” Mr. Followill said. “Because they saw we had potential to one day break through.”Album by album Kings of Leon’s music grew more intricate and cleanly detailed. And as the band took to the arena circuit, it soaked up the sounds and pacing of its tour mates, learning to let songs ring in large spaces. The music, though still limber, slowed down from the garage-punk rush of the first album.Caleb Followill began to carve out longer melody lines for his voice, while the instruments found room to breathe and reverberate, meshing across greater distances. And the lust, sleaze and recklessness of the band’s early lyrics were joined, though not replaced, by romance and reflections on sin and tenacity.The band was evolving toward pop. When Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam heard “Only by the Night,” he said, “You’re about to ride a big wave,” Caleb Followill told Spin magazine.“We definitely don’t sound as raw as we did early on,” Mr. Followill said from Los Angeles. “But that’s just because it’s hard to teach yourself to be a bad guitar player again. A lot of that raw energy came from — we were playing as good as we could, and now our good is a little better than that.”The band tried to shake itself out of its routine for the new album. It had recorded before in Los Angeles and Tennessee; “Come Around Sundown” was made in a Midtown Manhattan studio. Various songs drew on ideas from all four previous albums. “The fears that we did have were people just knowing us for our last record,” Mr. Followill said. “We tried to show them at least moments of everything we’ve done along the way.”One constant is that Kings of Leon play together, live in the studio. Then they patch up mistakes and add parts, but the core of the music is the sound of the four Followills in one place. That choice, Caleb Followill said, appeals subliminally to multiple generations of listeners.“Even if you can’t tell it when you’re listening to one of our songs, it’s been recorded probably the way your parents used to listen to music,” he said. “I think there’s just that little something that they can’t put their finger on, but that’s one of the things that they like about it.”Early on, Mr. Followill declared that the album had “no pop.” That didn’t last. “Mary,” a fervent love song, has a 1950s doo-wop warmth amid frenetically strummed guitars, and other songs have choruses destined for sing-alongs. Despite its city origins, the album also has a homesick streak of country; “Back Down South” even uses a fiddle.“At times I was a little fearful, I’ll be honest,” Mr. Followill said. “I would go home at night, and I would think, ‘This music that we’re making, is anyone going to be interested in it?’ And I was scared at times because I would feel like it sounded kind of big, and I didn’t want it to have the big epic sound that people would expect from us. And the thing is, we were not at all trying to do that.”The band tried to cut down on reverb, to dry out its sound. But that didn’t last. “Something about the way that all of us come together, and the music that we’ve made here, at least in the last couple of years, it doesn’t matter what we try to do,” he said. “At the end of the day it has a bigger, richer quality to it than stuff that we used to do. And I think for us to not write the songs that were on our minds and in our hearts, I think it would be a fraud. We don’t want to go in there and do something that isn’t real and something that doesn’t really move us.”Mr. Followill sings, “Everything I cherish is slowly dying or it’s gone” in “Pyro,” a new song.“I might have been a little dramatic with that line,” he said. “But sometimes I do reminisce about the days when we were on a bus. We’d play a gig, and then we’d go outside and drink in the parking lot with all our fans and just hang out. You feel different when you’re in a big cold arena, and you walk offstage and fly to the next gig.”Then again, he added, “once the people start to appreciate what it is that you’re doing, it should be the best thing in the world.” Eventually “I had a long look in the mirror and thought, ‘What are you scared of?’ ” he said. “When we first started making music, if you would have told me that we would have had a record that sold as many as that did, I would have been, ‘Absolutely, that’s what we’re here making music for.’ Now, when we’re playing concerts, I enjoy myself. Even if it’s just people singing ‘Use Somebody’ or “Sex on Fire,’ I’m very appreciative of the fact that they’re there.”'"

"'10-09-12,'0','Tell me Sam Tanenhaus, in his review of Jonathan Franzen’s “Freedom” (Aug. 29), did not write, “Franzen cracked open the opaque shell of postmodernism, tweezed out its tangled circuitry and inserted in its place the warm, beating heart of an authentic humanism.” Do we need to be told that “Franzen assuredly knows that F. Scott Fitzgerald grew up” in St. Paul? (But did you know that Fitzgerald is buried in a dismal little cemetery in Rockville, Md.?)We might do well to remember what Fitzgerald’s buddy, Hemingway, said was essential for a writer (or critic or reader): the bull detector.Think what Hemingway’s detector would have registered for this pearl from the review, referring to one of Franzen’s previous novels: “ ‘The Corrections’ towered out of the rubble, at once a monument to a world destroyed and a beacon lighting the way for a new kind of novel that might break the suffocating grip of postmodernism.”It’s times like this I’m thankful to live in New Hampshire, where the air is clean.Where is Woody Allen when you need him?'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Roger Lowenstein does a terrible disservice to investors by comparing the paltry 2.58 percent real yield on bonds with the 8.5 percent earnings yield on stocks. This is like comparing apples to oranges and implies that stocks are cheap and can achieve far better returns than bonds.First of all, the actual real dividend yields on the S.&P. 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are virtually the same as the yield on the bond he uses in his example. Second, the price-to-earnings ratio on the S.&P. 500 is currently around 15.8, far higher than the theoretical — and not yet achieved — future P/E of 12 that Lowenstein expects.Third, and more important, Lowenstein neglects to mention that current equity P/E’s appear relatively low because most companies have slashed their work forces, cut back on research and development and are hoarding cash because of tax, regulatory and general economic uncertainties. So these supposedly low price-to-earnings ratios have not been generated from a position of strength in the marketplace; rather they have resulted from a fear of the future and a battening down of the hatches. In short, stocks are not cheap, no matter how Lowenstein or Wall Street want to spin it.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','GAINING entry to Rome’s archaeological sites is never a sure thing. Long affected by collapses, paltry budgets and red tape, historic sites must often limit access, even to places that have been recently restored at great expense. But this fall, many sites are revealing themselves anew, extending their hours and opening up areas that had been shuttered to the public.The initiative includes some of Rome’s most iconic archaeological sites, including the Colosseum. The monument will be open on Saturday nights until midnight through Oct. 2. During the five hours beyond the normal closing, archaeologists will lead groups of up to 40 in tours that stop at Gladiatores, a dazzling exhibition of ancient iron and bronze armor and weaponry, and culminate in a visit to the restored arena level, a wooden platform rarely open to visitors that looks down beneath the Colosseum floor.“We have been working hard to open more areas of the Colosseum, to allow new views of the building and to distribute visitors throughout the structure,” said Dr. Rossella Rea, the Colosseum’s director.In the fall, a limited area of the substructure beneath the floor, as well as the third-story parapet, will be open to visitors during normal hours until the weather cools, Dr. Rea said.The substructure — or hypogeum — was a staging area akin to the back stage of a theater, with a few distinctions. It was a dark and dangerous, yet extraordinarily well organized place, where wild beasts, animals, gladiators and condemned criminals waited to be brought onstage via trap doors, ramps or elevators powered by men.Dr. Rea credited the new openness to Dr. Roberto Cecchi, who became archaeological commissioner for Rome and Ostia last year. Unlike his predecessors, Dr. Cecchi is an architect, not a career politician, and has devoted decades to preserving and promoting the city’s cultural patrimony. His impact can be felt elsewhere in Rome. Nearby, in the Roman Forum, the recently restored Temple of Romulus (a misnamed structure that may have been the Temple of Jupiter Stator) will be open Saturday mornings through Oct. 23. This fourth-century pagan monument, which is rarely open, was transformed into a church centuries after it was built, and its walls contain medieval frescoes and decorative elements.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','Not so long ago, before Swedes and vampires ruled the best-seller list, readers snapped up thrillers with plots so gaudy their authors risked confinement hearings. “The Da Vinci Code,” “The Rule of Four” and their imitators sold millions of copies. Why? Maybe for the simple reason that we’re all conspiracists at heart, seeking hidden explanations for the puzzle of the world around us.A new entry in the sweepstakes, “The Thousand,” opens strongly with a sequence of crosscut scenes. A slick defense attorney saves a famous composer from a murder conviction, then kills him. Just before the composer’s death, a mysterious device is attached to his daughter’s brain. The implant will give her impressive powers of perception, enabling her to read lips from across a room and count cards in a poker game with total recall.Equally promising are the signs Kevin Guilfoile displays that he’s a smooth and strong stylist. Early on, a man is described as having “a slim body fitted for thousand-dollar slacks.” Later we’re told that the blood leaking from a stab wound “felt thick and burned cool, like Bengay on an aching muscle.” Yet “The Thousand” doesn’t live up to its potential, in part because Guilfoile reveals his biggest secret far too soon. The novel’s title refers to modern-day followers of the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who have split into two sects in a murderous fight over his 2,500-year-old secrets. These super-geeks can crash planes just by using calculators. (Imagine what evils we’d be spared if they had managed to get dates in high school.)What Guilfoile fails to understand is that thriller readers want the ultimate villains to be uncorked as late in the game as possible. By showing his hand too early, he leaves himself without a mystery to dangle. Apparently trying to compensate, he starts writing from more and more points of view, but in doing so he diverts the focus from Nada, the composer’s daughter and his most interesting creation. While she’s tailing an “outsider” artist at the behest of a retired tycoon, her ex-lover is running from the police for three murders he didn’t commit, even as a detective is investigating two murders separated by a decade and as the two Pythagorean sects are busy battling away. Sound needlessly complicated? It is.Guilfoile eventually wraps all these strands together, but by then readers may no longer care. Which is too bad, because along the way he touches on some interesting themes: the ease with which civil society can devolve into chaos; the ways our imperfect minds perceive reality; the risk that science, failing to save us, may finally destroy us.Before that day arrives, Guilfoile may put together a first-rate thriller. He certainly has the dark vision and the writing chops. And he doesn’t necessarily need the crutch of a grand conspiracy. There are hints in “The Thousand” that his true talent might lie in a gritty courtroom thriller in the style of Scott Turow. But whatever Guilfoile writes next, he would be wise to keep an ace or two up his sleeve. In thrillers, if not in life, we hope to be kept guessing until the end.'"
"'10-09-12,'0','So why bother? That’s a question a federal oversight body and members of Congress are asking, especially since the T.S.A. plans to spend billions to buy the devices and hire more screeners to operate them — using the $5 to $10 security fee included in the price of any airline ticket (fees that the government wants to raise).“This is all done to keep the traveling public safe,” said Nicholas Kimball, a T.S.A. spokesman. Maybe so, but there are still questions about how effective these machines are at achieving that goal.What Can Screeners See?What these images reveal is also unclear. Mr. Kimball said that the T.S.A. uses filters to blur the images, and the agency has posted samples of the kinds of images screeners see and a video of the screening process on its Web site, tsa.gov. But critics say these samples aren’t detailed enough for travelers to judge how explicit they are, especially if a screener zooms in on a specific area.Another concern is whether the images can be saved or transmitted. The T.S.A. first said this wasn’t possible, then later admitted the machines can save photos, but that this feature had been disabled. This kind of backtracking has added to the agency’s credibility problem.How Safe Are They?The main concerns are how much radiation the scanners give off (the manufacturers say the amount is very low), whether the scanners might malfunction and emit more radiation than they are supposed to, and what the health effects may be for travelers. Since there is no precedent for routinely screening so many people with X-rays — other than in prisons — there are a lot of unknowns.Another issue is that the devices haven’t been thoroughly tested. The T.S.A. claims that the machines have been evaluated by the ’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Commerce Department’s National Institute for Standards and Technology and the Applied Physics Laboratory. But when I called these organizations to ask about their evaluations, I learned that they basically tested only one thing — whether the amount of radiation emitted meets guidelines established by the American National Standards Institute, a membership organization of companies and government agencies.But guess who was on the committee that developed the guidelines for the X-ray scanners? Representatives from the companies that make the machines and the , among others. In other words, the machines passed a test developed, in part, by the companies that manufacture them and the government agency that wants to use them.That’s one reason Peter Rez, a physics professor at , has been pushing for more data to be shared so that academics can do their own analysis.“The scary thing to me is not what happens in normal operations, but what happens if the machine fails,” Professor Rez said. “Mechanical things break down, frequently.”Other medical experts are worried that the government has not adequately evaluated the health risks of such extensive X-ray screening, particularly for children, pregnant women, patients and people who are sensitive to radiation. One concern is that the data the government is relying on underestimates the amount of radiation absorbed by the skin, potentially raising the risk of .“It’s premature to put a whole population through this thing, not without much more due diligence and much more independent testing,” said John Sedat, a biochemistry professor at the , who, along with several colleagues, sent a letter to the Obama administration calling for independent evaluations of the X-ray scanners.So far, the T.S.A. and government regulators have disputed their concerns. “If there is any risk, it’s very, very small,” said Daniel Kassiday, an F.D.A. radiation official who was co-chairman of the committee that created the standard for the machines.Mr. Kassiday said an individual could receive up to 1,000 screenings a year before reaching recommended annual limits for this type of radiation exposure, but added that more tests are being conducted and that once the T.S.A. has redacted the relevant reports, more information will be released.Can You Opt Out?Mr. Kimball said passengers can choose not to go through the scanner and opt for the metal detector and a pat down instead, information that is also on the T.S.A.’s Web site. But the message travelers are getting at the airport isn’t that clear.“It definitely didn’t feel optional at all,” said Drew Hjelm, an Army veteran who recently encountered the X-ray machine at O’Hare Airport in . After asking to go through the metal detector, being turned down and even speaking with a supervisor, he was given other choices.“The officer said, either you go through the body scanner or you leave the airport or we’re going to call the police and they’re going to come and arrest you,” Mr. Hjelm said. “After I went through the body scanner, they still patted my pants down.”Since other passengers have said they weren’t given a choice, or were subjected to an aggressive pat down if they declined to be X-rayed, the Electronic Privacy Information Center has created an online form for travelers to report problems.The advocacy group has also filed a motion in court to suspend the body scanner program, saying that it violates the Fourth Amendment (and other statutes) by imposing search procedures that are more intrusive than the courts have allowed for routine screening.“We’re not denying that threats exist,” said Marc Rotenberg, the privacy center’s executive director, referring to concerns about terrorism. “The question is, are the solutions proposed effective and are they legal?”'"

"'10-09-13,'1','Two years after collapsed under the weight of -backed bets that went horribly wrong, ’ pay practices have improved but fall short of what is needed to discourage bankers from once again taking unjustifiable risks.Bonuses on Wall Street rebounded sharply in 2009 and are in line for their second annual increase this year following the big decline in 2008, when bankers blew up the financial system. Bonuses at big European banks like also increased last year. promised hundreds of its bankers a big extra cash bonus this month after trimming bonuses last year to avoid a British bonus .Amid all this activity, regulators risk falling behind the curve. Last year, the Financial Stability Board created by the leading economies agreed on new standards intended to discourage the kind of excessive risk-taking that ravaged the financial system.But national regulators around the world are taking vastly different approaches to implementing the standards. The and other banking watchdogs must remain ready to tighten the rules to stop banks from moving their most risk-hungry bankers and operations to the least-regulated locales.Banks have made some progress in aligning their risks and rewards. A survey of top banks by the Institute of International Finance, a bank lobby group, found that guaranteed bonuses — paid regardless of bankers’ performance — accounted for only 5 percent of the bonus pool in 2009, down by half from 2008. Multiyear guarantees have almost disappeared. Moreover, almost 40 percent of bonuses last year were deferred over a number of years, up from less than 30 percent in 2008.But this is still short of the Financial Stability Board’s call to defer 40 percent to 60 percent of bonuses for most bankers, and more than 60 percent for top executives. Moreover, many banks haven’t developed systems demanded by the new rules to align their bonuses with the risks of their operations over the long term. Almost half do not disclose to shareholders and the public the methods used to determine the bonus pool.'"
"'10-09-13,'1','Tonya Antonucci, the commissioner of Women’s Professional Soccer, will step down at the end of this season so that the team owners can play a larger role in growing the two-year-old league.Antonucci was the driving force behind the league, which began play during the recession and amid skepticism about the potential for a women’s soccer league after the collapse of the Women’s United Soccer Association in 2001. The league will announce her departure Monday.The league was a modest success last season, drawing crowds of about 4,600 fans a game. Major sponsors like Puma were signed and some games have been featured on Fox Soccer Channel. New teams were added in Atlanta and Philadelphia this season.Despite attracting more sponsors, W.P.S. has seen its attendance slump more than 10 percent this year as the World Cup in June and July and the lack of a novelty factor kept fans away.The league, which has its headquarters in San Francisco, laid off about half its employees and cut its national marketing budget. Two of its most prominent franchises, in Los Angeles and St. Louis, have folded, and the owners of the remaining seven teams are still losing millions of dollars.“We realized after St. Louis we needed to get in the room and make sure we can build this to last,” said T. Fitz Johnson, the owner of the Atlanta Beat and the chairman of the league’s board. “We don’t want another St. Louis.”'"
"'10-09-13,'1','“I thought it was really about the onset of a kind of life where the corporate people are trying to tell you how to live, what to do, how to behave,” Mr. McCarthy told The Bangor Daily News in Maine in 1997.Over the decades Mr. McCarthy came to embrace the cult immortality he achieved with “Body Snatchers,” but he cheerily played hundreds of other roles in feature films and on television (including multiple appearances on series from “Studio One” in the 1950s to “The District” in 2000) and continued his stage career. He toured the United States as Harry S. Truman in the one-man show “Give ’Em Hell, Harry” for two decades.Kevin McCarthy was born on Feb. 15, 1914, in Seattle, the son of Roy Winfield McCarthy and the former Therese Preston. Both parents died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and their four children were sent to live with relatives in Minneapolis. After five years of near-Dickensian mistreatment, described in Ms. McCarthy’s memoirs, the youngsters moved in with their maternal grandfather.After graduating from high school in Wisconsin, Mr. McCarthy studied at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, with an eye toward a diplomatic career. He changed his mind, however, and transferred to the University of Minnesota, where he became interested in acting.After moving to New York he made his Broadway debut in 1938 in “Abe Lincoln in Illinois.” His career was interrupted by World War II, in which he served as a military police officer. After his discharge he became an early member of the Actors Studio, New York’s bastion of Method acting.Despite his film and television success Mr. McCarthy never abandoned the stage. The 18 Broadway productions in which he appeared included Moss Hart’s “Winged Victory” (in which he was billed as Sgt. Kevin McCarthy), the political drama “Advise and Consent,” Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” and Kurt Vonnegut’s irreverent “Happy Birthday, Wanda June.”Mr. McCarthy matured quickly into roles as judges, generals, politicians and other men of power — sometimes not very nice ones. On “Flamingo Road,” the soapy 1980s television series, he was a greedy small-town Florida millionaire. On the screen, in “The Best Man” (1964), he was a presidential candidate’s henchman, specializing in dirty tricks, and he played a similarly ignoble political type in “The Distinguished Gentleman” (1992). In “Innerspace” (1987) he was a devious industrial spy, in “Buffalo Bill and the Indians” (1976), a grabby publicist.And although he did relatively little science fiction after “Body Snatchers,” he did star in the horror comedy “Piranha” (1978) as a mad scientist breeding killer fish. He also made a cameo appearance in the 1978 remake of “Body Snatchers,” playing a man who throws himself at the car driven by Donald Sutherland (the remake’s star), shouting, “Help! They’re coming! Listen to me!” and sounding much like his character in the original film.His bad guys weren’t always all bad. He was a roguish poker player in “A Big Hand for the Little Lady” (1966) and Marilyn Monroe’s attractive but distant ex-husband in “The Misfits” (1961).Mr. McCarthy continued acting well into his 90s. His last screen appearances were in 2009 in “Wesley,” (2008), an 18th-century costume drama, and the short film “I Do.”He married the actress Augusta Dabney in 1941, and they had three children. They divorced in 1961. (Ms. Dabney died in 2008.) In 1979 he married Kate Crane, a lawyer, and they had two children. Ms. Crane survives him, as do three daughters, Lillah, of Los Angeles; Mary Dabney McCarthy, of Cape Cod; and Tess McCarthy, of New York City; two sons, James Kevin McCarthy of San Diego and Patrick McCarthy of Portland, Ore.; a stepdaughter, Kara Lichtman of Boston; a brother, Preston; and three grandchildren. Mr. McCarthy’s sister died in 1989.Interviewers rarely asked him about subjects beyond “Invasion of the Body Snatchers.” (He loved to tell the story about leaving Ms. Wynter a nostalgic trans-Atlantic telephone message: “Becky, it’s Miles. Wake up!”) But in 1991 he told a critic for The San Diego Union-Tribune about his feeling that purposeful employment was a remedy for many ills. “I try to get as much work as I possibly can,” Mr. McCarthy, then 77, said. “I love to work. I love to be in things.”'"
"'10-09-13,'1','Just as broadband-ready smartphones could hardly be imagined in 1938, when the F.C.C. first approved the use of unlicensed radio waves, or even in 1985, when it issued the rules that led to Wi-Fi, the eventual consumer products that will use the new airwaves are all but unknown.“I’m absolutely confident that there will be a huge range of applications that we cannot yet predict,” said Dan Reed, corporate vice president for technology policy and strategy at Microsoft, which, alongside Google and Dell, has pushed hard for the F.C.C. to approve the new rules.Anyone who has wandered through a hotel conference center waving a laptop and hoping for a signal knows that wireless broadband connections have their limitations.The expanded access to airwaves offers a solution. The unused bands of spectrum were generated by the conversion of television signals from analog to digital. Because digital transmission uses a smaller slice of spectrum, more “white space” was freed up around each broadcast signal. It is those white spaces that the F.C.C. is now seeking to put to use.The new airwaves are particularly attractive because television signals are low-frequency waves, meaning they can travel farther, go more easily through walls, trees and other obstructions, and provide more reliable connections.As with any developing technology, uncertainties remain. Urban areas, which have the most demand for the new airwaves, have less of them available because more local television stations are using available bands. Also, by making the airwaves available free, the F.C.C. is bypassing the possibility of using them to generate revenue, either through auctions or user fees.The F.C.C. is virtually certain to approve the new rules at its Sept. 23 meeting, because it already has approved a similar set of rules, in November 2008. Those rules have never been in effect, however, because both supporters and opponents of the concept objected to some of the details.Supporters challenged the F.C.C.’s decision to require new devices to include a feature that conducts an electronic search for airwaves that are not occupied, as well as to rely on a database of unused airwaves in choosing a frequency on which to transmit its signal. That belt-and-suspenders approach would have made devices more expensive because of the complicated engineering required.The use of the white spaces was more generally opposed by a coalition of industries that included broadcasters, who feared that the new signals would interfere with their transmissions, and theater owners, sports arenas and churches, which make extensive use of wireless microphones that they, too, feared would be subject to interference.Exactly how the F.C.C. has addressed those objections will not be known until the new rules are released at the Sept. 23 meeting. But people in the telecommunications industry who keep close tabs on the agency say they expect that the searching requirement will be abandoned, and that wireless microphones will be given certain transmission priorities.Wireless networks that use the white-space signals are already being tested in several locations. Microsoft uses the signals in a wireless network that stretches over its corporate campus in Redmond, Wash.The city of Wilmington, N.C., and the surrounding New Hanover County has a trial network used by several government entities. The transportation department connects wirelessly to remote cameras that help it monitor traffic congestion. The parks department similarly monitors remote wetland areas and uses the signals to transmit environmental data that is required by federal regulators — saving the cost of sending an employee to scattered locations.Some new devices undoubtedly will serve health care applications, allowing hospitals to move equipment easily without rewiring or allowing them to monitor patients in remote settings. And so-called smart grids — systems that allow a power company to track consumption and generation more closely or to control appliances from a central location — are also likely.Blair Levin, a fellow at the Aspen Institute and a former F.C.C. official, said that although there was no guarantee that the new airwaves would produce the technological gold rush that some supporters have expected, “anything that is put to use that is now lying fallow is good for the economy.”The fact that new applications can use unlicensed airwaves is important as an economic development tool, said Rebecca Arbogast, a managing director and telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Few companies have the billions of dollars required to buy spectrum that is periodically auctioned off by the F.C.C., she said, but unlicensed spectrum can attract cash-poor, start-up companies.The deployment of television-band white spaces represents a rarely used model for the F.C.C., which historically has operated under more of a command-and-control model, in which it tells licensees what they can use their spectrum for.“The last time we did this, no one knew what would happen,” Mr. Genachowski said. But the result — wireless computer networking and other consumer applications — has transformed the economy.While issues of interference and other conflicts inevitably will arise and will be have to be addressed by the commission, he said, “we are confident that the benefits of moving forward are so significant that we should act now.”'"
"'10-09-13,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan — The NATO military command in Afghanistan has quietly issued new guidelines on contracting aimed at pushing commanders to take a tougher approach to how they spend billions of dollars. It is part of an effort to reduce corruption and decrease the funds that indirectly flow to the insurgency.The American-led military operation here now spends about $14 billion a year on contracting work, according to military officials.The new guidelines, issued last week by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top military leader here, make clear that he wants his subordinates to use their purchasing power as a tool in the fight against the insurgency and that so far, that has not happened.The provisions in the new guidelines suggest that on many occasions NATO contracts have ended up exacerbating Afghanistan’s problems by empowering warlords and entrenched power brokers, and undercutting the trust of average Afghans, who see dollars being spent but never reap the benefits.The guidelines, in a two-page unclassified memo, also raised the possibility that some contractors now on the NATO payroll could be purged or barred from further work. But no specific contractors were singled out in the memo, and it was unclear how the new guidelines could be enforced.“The scale of our contracting in Afghanistan represents both an opportunity and a danger,” General Petraeus wrote. “With proper oversight contracting can spur economic growth and development. If, however, we spend large quantities of international contracting funds quickly and with insufficient oversight it can fuel corruption, finance insurgent operations, strengthen criminal patronage networks and undermine our efforts in Afghanistan.”President Hamid Karzai has often criticized the contracting process for failing to employ enough Afghans and depriving many of the benefits of foreign spending because so much of the money is siphoned off by unscrupulous, over-priced contractors and subcontractors — or by foreign contractors who do not share much of the largess with Afghans.NATO forces spend money on a vast array of goods and services in addition to projects specifically designed to benefit Afghans, like bridges, roads and schools. NATO troops also buy guard services from Afghan security companies, lease land, and contract for water supply and building construction.Afghans in several provinces have complained that local warlords seize land from them and then lease it to local NATO forces. People feel wronged when NATO forces hire a company that is staffed entirely by workers from another country or even from another province.The contracting overhaul started under Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, General Petraeus’s predecessor, as it became apparent that the military’s approach often sent tens of millions of dollars to companies that favored one tribe, or that lined the pockets of corrupt local leaders or that delivered services like security by paying off gunmen for illegal armed groups — effectively providing financial aid to the insurgency that elsewhere the soldiers were fighting.In other cases the military paid contractors who did a poor job on everything from building a bridge or a school to delivering military supplies. That undermined average Afghans’ faith in NATO and in their own government, which is allied with the international forces, and turned people toward the insurgency.The guidelines from General Petraeus suggested that sloppiness was pervasive, since it exhorted commanders to “establish systems and standard databases for vetting vendors and contractors to ensure that contracting does not empower the wrong people or allow the diversion of funds.”General Petraeus also urged commanders to look at contracting through a wider lens, seeking to find new companies with the goal of breaking “monopolies and helping to weaken patronage networks.”Finally, he put companies involved in illegitimate activity on notice that they ran a risk of losing the contract if they failed to perform, funneled money to insurgents or behaved in a corrupt way. When there are “linkages between contactors and criminal networks we must take action such as suspension and debarment of the individuals or the company, contract termination, or not renewing a contract option.”Anthony Cordesman, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in a recent report that better oversight in the contracting process needs to be part of any overall drive by the United States in combating corruption in Afghanistan.“Much of the level of corruption that threatens any real hope of victory in Afghanistan can be reduced and eliminated if the U.S., its allies, and other donors tightly control the influx of outside money, limit its flow to honest and capable Afghans at every level of government, and provide the transparency to allow Afghans to see how honestly and effectively the money is used,” he wrote.'"
"'10-09-13,'1','Policymakers face a difficult choice: to continue the tax cuts in a bid to appease constituents and perhaps spur economic growth, or let the rates expire as a way to raise revenue and help reduce the deficit. Mr. Obama insists the nation can no longer afford tax breaks for the wealthy, while Republicans say any tax increase is a grave mistake.If Democrats prevail, it would be a major policy victory, allowing Mr. Obama to boast that he had fulfilled yet another signature campaign promise. The White House moved quickly to portray Mr. Boehner as caving in to pressure, including direct criticism by the president in a speech in the Republican leader’s home state, Ohio, last week.But the victory could come at a political cost. Mr. Boehner’s move seemed to deprive Democrats of the argument that Republicans would hurt the middle class to help the rich. And he positioned his party to share credit for continuing the lower rates for most Americans, and still blame Democrats for raising taxes in a weak economy.Mr. Boehner said that he still strongly favored continuing the lower tax rates for all income levels and that the Democrats would hamper economic recovery by not doing so. His comments raise pressure on Congressional Democrats, who are divided internally. Roughly a dozen House Democrats and at least four Senate Democrats have expressed support for temporarily extending all of the cuts.It was not clear that Mr. Boehner’s statements signaled a unified shift among Republicans, particularly in the Senate, where they control enough votes to block any tax-cut legislation. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, did not issue any statement, but a spokesman said Senate Republicans expected to exert more influence over the debate than their House counterparts.Many Senate Republicans have said that letting the Bush cuts expire for high earners amounts to raising taxes on small-business owners, some of whom fall into those rates because they report their business earnings as personal income.Both White House officials and Congressional Democratic leaders expressed doubt that Mr. Boehner would follow through and said they would continue to press him on the issue.Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, issued a statement welcoming Mr. Boehner’s comments but adding, “Time will tell if his actions will be anything but continued support for the failed policies that got us into this mess.” In a statement, a spokesman for Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said, “John Boehner is still championing tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires that will add $700 billion to the deficit.”The tax-cut debate is just one agenda item in what is expected to be a frenzied fall Congressional session — a scant four weeks, if the schedule holds firm — that is likely to feature more political jousting than legislating, given that lawmakers are already in full campaign battle posture.The one essential piece of business is a temporary spending resolution to finance the federal government until after the election. And even before the debate on tax cuts gets under way, Democrats are poised to score a quick victory in the Senate this week, where George V. Voinovich, a retiring Ohio Republican, has pledged to back a small-business measure that Republican leaders blocked before the August recess.The bill would provide tax breaks and also create a new $30 billion program within the Treasury that would channel government-backed loans through community banks.Mr. Obama has urged Congress to pass the bill to help the sputtering economy, and Democrats would happily pair it with an extension of tax relief for the middle class as evidence of their efforts to fight a recession for which they blame the Republicans and former President George W. Bush.Mr. Boehner’s willingness, however reluctant, to support a Democratic bill gives him an aura of flexibility after two years of working fiercely to block Mr. Obama’s agenda. It comes at a time when Republicans are optimistic about their chances of winning control of the House and eager to present themselves to voters as prepared to govern.In recent days, Mr. Boehner has called for extending all of the Bush tax cuts for two years, which would cost more than $500 billion, and for freezing nonsecurity discretionary spending at 2008 levels, which some analysts say would require cuts of more than $100 billion.But this month, Republicans s will unveil a more concrete legislative blueprint that, they say, will include blocking any money to enact the health care law, scaling back tougher regulation of Wall Street and forcing the White House to slash the budget.A muted debate over the Bush tax cuts could give Republicans more time to focus attention on the temporary spending resolution, which is the most crucial piece of business before Congress this fall. It could also provide an opportunity for Republicans to criticize Democrats on the deficit.In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Boehner challenged Democrats to pass the annual spending bills before the election to demonstrate their commitment to reducing federal spending.Democrats have no time or inclination to do so, given the compressed schedule and the imperatives of an election in which they face the prospect of steep losses.“Even though we have a limited amount of time, we look to be passing a bill a week,” said Representative John B. Larson of Connecticut, the chairman of the Democratic caucus.Any push by Democratic leaders to notch a few more achievements will also inevitably be hampered by internal discord. In a bid to hold their seats, some Democrats have already begun distancing themselves from Mr. Obama and Speaker Pelosi.A number of rank-and-file Democrats, for instance, have said they will not support Mr. Obama’s call for $50 billion in infrastructure projects and other spending as a new round of economic stimulus.And at least four Democrats — Senators Evan Bayh of Indiana, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Jim Webb of Virginia — as well as Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut independent aligned with the Democrats, have expressed concern that any tax increases would hinder economic growth.Mr. Boehner suggested he was content to let those Democrats fight their party leadership and the White House.“I think raising taxes in a very weak economy is a really, really bad idea,” Mr. Boehner said, adding, “I think there is a growing chorus on Capitol Hill to extend all of these tax rates.”'"

"'10-09-14,'0','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The family of Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis spent halftime inside their suite at New Meadowlands Stadium on Monday night. They ate cookies and picked at finger foods and refilled their drinks. All the while, Revis’s lengthy contract holdout seemed like a distant memory, even if it ended about a week ago.In the first half of the Jets’ 10-9 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Revis had reopened his famous island, as the Jets’ defense swarmed its way to three turnovers in two quarters that somehow led to only 6 points. Revis even threw a bone-crushing block on Antonio Cromartie’s interception return.His family sat on leather couches and watched from the field, or on flat-screen televisions. Sean Gilbert, Revis’s uncle and a longtime N.F.L. defensive lineman, said his nephew had performed as expected.“We never prepared for him not to play,” Gilbert said. “It would be different if you couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. We could.”Throughout the 36-day holdout, Gilbert was often portrayed as the mastermind behind the family’s hardened stance. Gilbert himself once held out the entire 1997 season, before he left Washington and signed with Carolina.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','Logan claimed, however, that the federation increased its budget to $20 million from $15 million this year.“I disagree that I didn’t generate the revenues,” Logan said in a telephone interview. “In the eyes of some, it wasn’t enough. Others are entitled to their opinions. I hold my head high for what we accomplished so far.”Project 30 proposed changes to the federation’s high performance program. USA Track and Field submits a high-performance plan every two years to the United States Olympic Committee. That plan determines the level of financing the U.S.O.C. provides for the federation as it prepares for the world championships and the Olympic Games.Athletes praised Logan’s affable personality but expressed concern about poor communication and a lack of progress in some developmental programs. “There was a lot of confusion,” said Lauryn Williams, a silver medalist in the 100 meters at the 2004 Olympics and member of the 2008 Beijing Olympic sprint team. “I was uncertain about what was being accomplished.”Logan said he thought he had developed good relationships with the athletes and said the structure of the sport made communication difficult.“I’m dealing with a universe of 800 independent contractors that I have to deal with one on one,” he said. “Some have agents and some don’t. They’re traveling all the time. I can understand why people would think there’s a difficulty.”Jon Drummond presents athletes’ concerns to the USA Track and Field board of directors as the chairman of the Athletes Advisory Committee. At the United States outdoor championships in July, he told the board the athletes thought they were not given adequate time to express their opinions about proposed plans. Athletes also expressed concern about money they thought they were owed for competing and training expenses as part of a deal to hold the United States Olympic trials in Eugene, Ore., for the 2008 and 2012 Games.“I appreciate Doug’s attempts,” Drummond said. “He’s a very good person, he’s very stylish, and he brought some pizazz and flair to our sport and we wish him well. But in his job, you need to be knowledgeable about track and field. Doug came in during his interview for the job and said he did not know a lot about the sport.”Logan, a former commissioner of Major League Soccer, said making unpopular decisions “just goes with the turf.” and he defended his handling of the money from Olympic trials, saying that when he took the job in July 2008, the federation was underwriting athletes retreats at about $100,000 each to places like South Beach in Florida and Cancún, Mexico.“I thought those funds were being squandered,” he said. “We would do better to fund true athlete development. Yes, I’ll admit, as far as I was concerned, throwing $100,000 parties was a closed book.”'"
"'10-09-14,'0','For two years running, thousands of indignant New Yorkers have gathered at public hearings to loudly protest higher fares for the city’s buses and subways, and for two years running, the higher fares have gone through.This week brings a third go-round, as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority prepares for a set of fare increases, including a $104 monthly MetroCard, to take effect Jan. 1. But based on the tepid turnout at the Cooper Union on Monday, the city’s straphangers appear to have finally accepted the inevitable.Gone were the bustling, standing-room-only protests that marked the hearings held earlier this year, when the authority was preparing its most severe service cuts in a generation. Instead of lines that snaked around the block, about 150 people quietly strolled into a sparsely populated auditorium, where the empty seats outnumbered the audience.The event in Manhattan is traditionally the loudest, angriest, and best attended in the authority’s hearing process. And while chants of “Fire the M.T.A.!” occasionally found momentum, and the authority’s chairman, Jay H. Walder, received his share of invective, the hearing struck some attendees as surprisingly subdued.“I think people have just given up,” said Trudy L. Mason, a former executive at the transportation authority and a member of the New York City Transit Riders Council. “They’re saying, ‘What’s the use? Why bother?’ ”The riders’ council, a longstanding advocacy group, has decided to oppose the fare increases for the first time, Ms. Mason said, a change from previous years where the group decided that higher fares were necessary. This year, she said, the combination of service cuts with higher fares was too much to take. “You don’t take away with one hand, and say ‘give me more’ with the other hand,” she said.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','A clerical error appears to have allowed for Mr. Withers’s identity to be divulged: In most cases in the reports, references to Mr. Withers and his informer number, ME 338-R, have been blacked out. But in several locations, the F.B.I. appears to have forgotten to hide them. The F.B.I. said Monday that it was not clear what had caused the lapse in privacy and was looking into the incident.Civil rights leaders have responded to the revelation with a mixture of dismay, sadness and disbelief. “If this is true, then Ernie abused our friendship,” said the Rev. James M. Lawson Jr., a retired minister who organized civil rights rallies throughout the South in the 1960s.Others were more forgiving. “It’s not surprising,” said Andrew Young, a civil rights organizer who later became mayor of Atlanta. “We knew that everything we did was bugged, although we didn’t suspect Withers individually.”Many details of Mr. Withers’s relationship with the F.B.I. remain unknown. The bureau keeps files on all informers, but has declined repeated requests to release Mr. Withers’s, which would presumably explain how much he was paid by the F.B.I., how he was recruited and how long he served as an informer.At the time of his death, Mr. Withers had the largest catalog of any individual photographer covering the civil rights movement in the South, said Tony Decaneas, the owner of the Panopticon Gallery in Boston, the exclusive agent for Mr. Withers. His photographs have been collected in four books, and his family was planning to open a museum, named after him.His work shows remarkable intimacy with and access to top civil rights leaders. Friends used to say he had a knack for being in the right place at the right time. But while he was growing close to top civil rights leaders, Mr. Withers was also meeting regularly with the F.B.I. agents, disclosing details about plans for marches and political beliefs of the leaders, even personal information like the leaders’ car tag numbers.David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who has written biographies of Dr. King, said many civil rights workers gave confidential interviews to the F.B.I. and C.I.A., and were automatically classified as “informants.” The difference, Mr. Garrow said, is the evidence that Mr. Withers was being paid.Although Mr. Withers’s motivation is not known, Mr. Garrow said informers were rarely motivated by the financial compensation, which “wasn’t enough money to live on.” But Marc Perrusquia, who wrote the article for The Commercial Appeal, noted that Mr. Withers had eight children and might have struggled to support them.The children of Mr. Withers did not respond to requests for comment. But one daughter, Rosalind Withers, told local news organizations that she did not find the report conclusive.“This is the first time I’ve heard of this in my life,” Ms. Withers told The Commercial Appeal. “My father’s not here to defend himself. That is a very, very strong, strong accusation.”'"
"'10-09-14,'0','But like the Jets, who co-built the new stadium, the Giants opted to sell personal seat licenses that give fans the right to buy season tickets. Some fans decided that the extra cost was not worth the trouble and gave up their season-ticket plans. And it is now clear that neither team, in the face of that obstacle, was successful in selling all of its seats by the time this season began.The announced paid attendance on Sunday of 77,245 represents 93.6 percent of the stadium’s published capacity of 82,500 seats. But the actual number of fans in the stadium was higher than 77,245 because some people received free tickets, which are not counted toward total paid attendance.On Sunday, the free tickets were given to players’ families and staff and were also used for community-relations purposes, according to Pat Hanlon, a Giants spokesman. N.F.L. teams can use 17,000 tickets for complimentary purposes over their 10 preseason and regular-season home games. They can divide up that allotment in any way they choose.As for the club seats, Hanlon said the Giants had sold 8,800 of them for this season, leaving 1,200 still available. The Giants charge from $7,500 to $20,000 for personal seat licenses for those seats as well as per-game ticket prices ranging from $250 to $700, Hanlon said.Teams that fail to sell out regular-season games risk having them blacked out on television in their cities. But club seats are not counted, which explains why the unsold club seats for the Giants and Jets did not create a blackout on Sunday or Monday night.There are also seats for fans with disabilities, many on the concourse level at the top of the lower bowl. When those seats are not reserved for the season, the team can install regular seats and resell them game by game. However, it takes time to make that conversion and sell those tickets, and the Giants had not completed that process by Sunday.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','Samuel Goldwyn Films got burned when it tried to tap the Hispanic market in 2001 with films like “Tortilla Soup.” At the time, Meyer Gottlieb, Samuel Goldwyn’s president, told The Los Angeles Times, “When it comes to filmed entertainment, they don’t view themselves as Latinos. They want to see it because everybody else wants to see it.”But Mr. Azcárraga and Jon Feltheimer, chief executive of Lions Gate Entertainment, say they are confident they can succeed, citing figures showing that 37 million Hispanic moviegoers bought 300 million tickets in 2009, a per-moviegoer rate of more than eight tickets a year, the highest of any ethnic group.Analysts say that, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, Latinos are the fastest-growing segment of the moviegoing audience and tend to buy more DVDs. At the same time, Latinos have started to drive results for broad releases; “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” from 20th Century Fox, and “Fast & Furious” from Universal blossomed into hits in large part because of support from Latino moviegoers, the studios said. At the art house, “Pan’s Labyrinth,” directed by Mexico-born Guillermo del Toro, has shown the potential for a crossover audience. That film, made for about $19 million, generated more than $83 million at the global box office.Lionsgate has also been quietly experimenting with Spanish-language releases, finding moderate success with tiny films like “La Mujer de Mi Hermano” (“My Brother’s Wife”), which sold about $5 million in tickets in 2006.“We have been interested in this market for a long time, but now we really think we can turn it into a business,” Mr. Feltheimer said.The difference this time, the executives involved say, is experience. Lionsgate has a successful track record in marketing movies to niche audiences. Televisa’s strength is in production. And Pantelion has a potential ace up its sleeve: AMC Entertainment, North America’s second-largest movie theater chain behind Regal Entertainment. AMC’s chief executive, Gerardo Lopez, has agreed in advance to dedicate at least one screen in 50 of its theaters to Pantelion films. The theaters are in neighborhoods where more than a third of the population is Hispanic. Another chain, Cinemark, said it was in discussions with Pantelion to provide the fledgling production company with marketing support.“Gee, if we can give them more culturally relevant product we may just get them to come to the movies a little bit more,” said Mr. Lopez.He said that was something he thought about not as a chief executive but as an average moviegoer. “It’s difficult to go to the movies and find Latinos in roles that are normal,” he said. “Instead, it’s the bad guy in the neighborhood, the guy with the tattoos. Rarely do you see a Latino portrayed as a businessman, for crying out loud.”James M. McNamara, the former chief executive of Telemundo, will be Pantelion’s chairman and Paul Presburger, a longtime Lionsgate international executive, will be chief executive. Mr. Presburger said part of Pantelion’s strategy involved forging partnerships with consumer brands that were courting the same demographic. “We are deep in those conversations,” he said.Mr. McNamara says he is hopeful that Pantelion will get a robust welcome from screenwriters and actors. “I think there is a lot of pent-up demand for this on behalf of the industry’s creative community,” he said.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','The American String Quartet is celebrating its 35th anniversary this season, and the Manhattan School of Music, where it has been in residence for 26 of those years, is giving a party in the form of a three-concert retrospective, with two performances at the school and one at Merkin Concert Hall.At the first installment, at the Manhattan School on Sunday afternoon, works by Haydn and Ravel framed a piece the group had commissioned from George Tsontakis in the late 1980s, and the concert was so beautifully played and so rich in interpretive nuance that a listener who had not been especially impressed with this quartet in the past left the hall feeling that the two remaining concerts should not be missed.The first pleasant surprise was the dark burnished tone the group applied to the opening of Haydn’s Quartet in G (Op. 77, No. 1), a courtly work in which a touch of velvet is not amiss, at least in the first two movements, but which also demands an ability to pivot quickly between elegance and forcefulness. In the Adagio, the players — Peter Winograd and Laurie Carney, violinists; Daniel Avshalomov, violist; and Wolfram Koessel, cellist — used vibrato sparingly, yet their sound could not have been more sumptuous. And they gave energetic but carefully shaped accounts of the Menuetto and the Presto finale.Mr. Tsontakis’s Quartet No. 4, “Beneath Thy Tenderness of Heart,” was composed in 1988 for this ensemble, which recorded it (with Mr. Tsontakis’s Quartet No. 3, for New World) in 1991. It is a magical piece, and much of its power comes from something borrowed: a Russian Orthodox chorale, played at the start in a soft-focus, vibrato-free style.The chorale returns infrequently and briefly, but hints of it — or at least, the expectation that it will be heard again — suffuse the score, which wanders light-years from this first, Renaissance-tinged impulse. Involved, insistent dialogues animate the Scherzo, and an eerily serene, dolorous postlude, “The Madonna Weeps,” is built around an exquisite first violin line. This is entirely nondogmatic writing: by juxtaposing moves from whatever era or style suits him, including various contemporary “isms,” Mr. Tsontakis has created a gripping, picturesque language that keeps a listener guessing what will come next.The concert ended with a supercharged performance of the Ravel Quartet in F that began with the same ear-catching, deep timbre as the Haydn but expanded kaleidoscopically, in ways that the Ravel (and, for that matter, the Tsontakis) allows and the Haydn does not. In the pizzicato passages in the second movement, and in the vigorous finale, the musicians’ playing was the picture of ensemble unity.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','Now the Invisible Dog Art Space is fulfilling its promise as a neighborhood hub of creativity. On Sunday, as part of Crossing the Line, the annual festival put on by the French Institute Alliance Française, it hosted thousands for Farm City Fair, a Brooklyn “county fair” theme event. Visitors sampled (surprisingly good) salmon pastrami cheesecake and baguette-flavored ice cream and learned about rooftop farms, while a brass band played outside. On Thursday, the black-box theater in the gallery’s basement will host its first production, a new play by a young playwright. Thirty artists fill the second-floor studios; the airy top floor serves as a desirable party space; and a multimedia installation by the artist Richard Garet is to open in the ground-floor gallery later this month. A shady courtyard offers both refuge and a neighborhood compost pile/environmental installation piece. Mr. Zayan is the building curator, deciding who can exhibit and work there. A year into its recession-era life, Invisible Dog is fostering connections and, even wilder, making money.“It’s an amazing story, where you think, ‘Only in New York,’ ” said Lili Chopra, the co-curator of the Crossing the Line festival. She met Mr. Zayan last fall and was charmed by the gallery’s raw space and his do-it-yourself energy. “I just thought it was such a great labor of love,” she said, “and completely in the spirit of what’s happening in Brooklyn now.”Though he’d had a successful career in France, Mr. Zayan had never worked here. But after getting the green light from the building’s owners — they’d hoped to turn the space into condominiums until the recession intervened — he sold off most of his possessions, left his apartment in Paris and moved to Brooklyn in April 2009.“My friends were stupefied when I told them, ‘I’m going to New York to create the Invisible Dog Art Center,’ ” Mr. Zayan said. “I was alone here, without any friends, without any contacts, just this building and nothing else.”Searching for inspiration, he went to the Museum of Modern Art. (“Some people go to the church, I went to the MoMA.”) There he saw a retrospective of the German artist Martin Kippenberger, full of meticulously arranged objects. He returned to the Invisible Dog, scoured the basement, still stacked with belts, jewelry and other bric-a-brac, and opened a flea market.From May to July 2009, he sold that inventory for a dollar or two an item. With $300,000 invested by Mr. DeFalco and his partners, he earned enough to open the space in October of that year, but barely made a dent in the leftover stuff, which is now being harvested as material for the building and its artists. Mr. Zayan pays $25,000 a month in rent, most of it coming from the studios and event space, he said. By his count, 32,000 visitors have passed through in the last year.“It’s a real ecosystem,” Mr. Zayan, 44, said in an interview last week at Café Pedlar, up the street from his gallery. “Everything works together.”Ian Trask, a 27-year-old artist making the transition from a career in science, first came to Invisible Dog in November for a Recession Art show. At Mr. Zayan’s invitation, he spent three months scavenging in the basement. He turned coils of canvas belts into a three-dimensional painting, which now hangs over the building’s freight elevator. Another piece, a 162-foot cardboard worm, is stored downstairs.“Lucien’s been very kind to me,” said Mr. Trask, now Invisible Dog’s first artist-in-residence. “A lot of my collectors are friends of his. He’d bring people to the basement and say, ‘So-and-so wants to buy something.’ ”Gabriel Jones, a photographer who shot the cover art for Arcade Fire’s newest album and was one of Invisible Dog’s earliest tenants, said it was different from other studio spaces. “There’s always a party, show or an exhibition,” he said. “It’s a living space.”Mr. Zayan’s landlords, too, are happy with the role the building plays in the neighborhood, where it can serve as an anchor for their other projects. “We’re having a blast,” Mr. DeFalco said at the Farm City event, which was so popular it opened an hour early and closed late. “I took a chance with Lucien, but he’s done everything that he said he would.”Mr. Zayan, who has a charming accent and a neat salt-and-pepper beard and who favors spotless Adidas and pristine white shirts, says that — except for the ability to smoke indoors — he does not miss Paris. Save for an art student intern, he does everything at Invisible Dog himself.“It’s a lot of work, but it’s not too much work,” he said. He lives next door; for fun he gives haircuts in the courtyard — as many as five a day, upon request, though he likes curly styles best. He hopes to make Invisible Dog a hangout, “open six days a week, from 10 in the morning to midnight, with always something happening,” he said. And though his friends counseled him against the name, calling it stupid, he’s glad it stuck: “It’s the history, and history is never stupid.”When he’s low on cash, he sells off a hundred invisible-dog leashes at $20 apiece; boxes of them still sit in the basement, a testament to the tenacity of far-fetched ideas. “That’s my treasure,” he said.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','“This rebalancing is encouraging, especially as the weaker external environment in the second part of the year is set to have a dampening effect on E.U. export growth,” the report said.It noted, however, that financial markets were still fragile, having recovered only partly from the tensions experienced in the spring, when investors fled certain European bonds, fearing defaults.Over all, the new assessment appeared to help bolster European markets. The Euro Stoxx 50 index rose 0.89 percent and the FTSE 100 in London added 1.16 percent on Monday. The euro advanced to $1.2867. Yields on benchmark euro zone government bonds pushed higher — including those of Germany — suggesting that investors retained fears about sovereign risk.The commission stressed that the pace of growth would moderate during the second half, reflecting the softening of the global economy and the fading of the temporary factors that helped start the recovery. It forecast a 0.5 percent expansion in the European Union and euro area in the third quarter, and 0.4 percent for the third quarter followed by 0.3 percent in the fourth.“The European economy is clearly on a path of recovery,” said Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner. “The rebound of domestic demand bodes well for the job market.”Financial stability and fiscal consolidation are the priorities for the future, he said.The commission presented a picture of still benign inflation, forecasting a 1.8 percent rate this year for the European Union and 1.4 percent in the euro area. Those forecasts were little changed from May.Just as the outlook in Europe appears to be improving, the global picture is worrying some analysts and policy makers.Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said Monday that while growth in emerging markets was strong, it remained subdued in the developed countries.At a news conference in Basel, Switzerland, he repeated that he did not expect the advanced economies to slip back into recession, and also that he did not see a significant risk of deflation.Separately, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday that its July index of composite leading indicators pointed to “clearer signs of a moderation in the pace of expansion to last month’s assessment.”The index is a collation of economic indicators that provides early signals of turning points in business cycles in advanced economies. It fell by 0.1 percentage point in July from June, when it also fell. During the three months before June, the index had risen.In Britain, Canada, China, France, Italy and India, there are stronger signals of a slower pace of growth in coming months, while there are also stronger signals that the expansion may lose momentum in Japan, the United States and Brazil, it said.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','Atkins-style low-carbohydrate diets help people lose weight, but people who simply replace the bread and pasta with calories from animal protein and animal fat may face an increased risk of early death from cancer and heart disease, a new study reports.The study found that the death rate among people who adhered most closely to a low-carb regimen was 12 percent higher over about two decades than with those who consumed diets higher in carbohydrates.But death rates varied, depending on the sources of protein and fat used to displace carbohydrates. Low-carb eaters who drew more protein and fat from vegetable sources like beans and nuts were 20 percent less likely to die over the period than people who ate a high-carbohydrate diet.But low-carb dieters who got most of their protein and fat from animal sources like red and processed meats were 14 percent more likely to die of heart disease and 28 percent more likely to die of cancer, the analysis found.The study, published Sept. 7 in Annals of Internal Medicine, analyzed data from more than 85,000 healthy women aged 34 to 59 who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, and almost 45,000 men aged 40 to 75 who took part in the Health Professionals’ Follow-Up Study. Participants filled out questionnaires every four years.“If people want to follow a low-carb diet, this provides some guidance,” said the paper’s lead author, Teresa T. Fung, an associate professor of nutrition at Simmons College in Boston. “They should probably eat less meats.”'"
"'10-09-14,'0','An international human rights group urged India last week to ban a “degrading and unscientific” test commonly performed on rape victims to see if they have previous sexual experience.In the test, a doctor inserts fingers into the victim during the forensic examination to test for “vaginal laxity” and is expected to deliver a medical opinion as to whether she appears to be “habituated to sexual intercourse.” The group, Human Rights Watch, argued that the test constituted a second assault on a traumatized woman.The test is required by courts in some Indian states — including those of Delhi and Mumbai, the national and financial capitals — and, according to local reports, is in the forensic examination still endorsed by the Indian Medical Association.In most democracies, whether or not a woman has ever had sex before is considered irrelevant in deciding whether she consented to the act under consideration. In 2003, India’s Supreme Court ruled that victims could not be cross-examined on their general moral character, Human Rights Watch said. But it has not ensured that its decision is enforced, and references to those who allege rape as “dissolute” or “of doubtful character” still appear in court rulings.World Health Organization guidelines calls for victims of sexual violence to get health care at the same time as the forensic examination and from the same person, and for minimally invasive examinations.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','“We want to be clear that we unequivocally abhor any attempt to leverage intellectual property rights to stifle political advocacy or pursue improper personal gain,” Mr. Smith said in a post on the company’s blog. “We are moving swiftly to seek to remove any incentive or ability to engage in such behavior.”Advocates and journalists who have been targets of such raids said they were pleased that Microsoft was announcing reforms, though some added that they remained suspicious of its intentions. The piracy cases have stirred resentment toward Microsoft in the nonprofit sector in Russia.In his statement, Mr. Smith appeared to acknowledge that Microsoft needed to address the damage to its image. He said the company would set up a program to offer legal aid to nonprofit groups and media outlets in Russia that are caught up in software inquiries. He also said the company had retained an international law firm to investigate its operations in the country.With the new, blanket licenses in place, any Microsoft programs on the computers of advocacy groups would carry Microsoft’s seal of approval, making it much harder for the authorities to charge those groups with stealing the company’s software, company executives said.The licensing plan is intended to last until 2012 but could be extended, Mr. Smith said. The policy could have repercussions beyond Russia because the company indicated that it would apply to other countries as well, though it did not immediately detail which ones.Microsoft will also step up its efforts to ensure that nonprofit groups and media outlets in Russia have access to a company program that provides Microsoft software at little or no cost. (Mr. Smith said that in the past year alone, the company had donated software with a market value of more than $390 million to over 42,000 nonprofit groups around the world.)The article in The Times described the case of an environmental group in Siberia, Baikal Environmental Wave, which was raided by the police in January just as it was planning protests against a decision by Prime Minister to reopen a paper factory that had long polluted Lake Baikal.Plainclothes officers took 12 computers from Baikal Wave and immediately charged the group with piracy, even though its leaders said they had only licensed Microsoft software. After the raid, the group reached out to Microsoft’s office, seeking help in defending itself.Baikal Wave asked Microsoft to confirm that its software was legal, but the company would not, angering the environmentalists. And Microsoft’s local lawyer in Siberia offered testimony to the police in the case on the value of the software that was said to have been stolen.Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges against Baikal Wave.On Monday night, Jennie Sutton, who helped found Baikal Wave two decades ago, said in a telephone interview from Irkutsk that the shift in Microsoft policy might significantly undercut the allegations in the group’s case and any future ones. “This is a victory,” Ms. Sutton said. “If Microsoft is against the police, then it will really look as if the cases that they are bringing are not fair and correct. And they won’t have this as an excuse to try and close us down.”Dmitri Makarov, an organizer at the Youth Human Rights Movement, said that for months, he had been calling on Microsoft to acknowledge that the private lawyers whom it had retained across Russia had formed unseemly ties to the police.He said he hoped that under the company’s new policy, the lawyers would never again harass the opposition. “This is what we have been asking for all along,” he said.'"
"'10-09-14,'0','TIANJIN, China (Reuters) — Stabilizing house prices is an essential task for every level of government in China, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said on Monday, underlining how worries about a red-hot property market have become a central focus of policy makers.Runaway property prices are not only a threat to China’s economy, but could imperil social stability if left unchecked, Mr. Wen told a meeting of the World Economic Forum in the northern port city of Tianjin.“It is the key responsibility of all levels of governments to stabilize housing prices and to guarantee availability of housing,” he said.China has been trying to tamp down property prices, which have soared in the last year and threaten to swell into a bubble that analysts warn could derail the world’s fastest-growing major economy.Mr. Wen expressed confidence about the broader health of the Chinese economy and repeatedly called attention to the country’s role in promoting global recovery from the international financial crisis in the last two years.'"

"'10-09-15,'1','The blind self-belief of financiers can’t be abolished. Neither can the industry’s cycles. But two years after the disastrous failure of Lehman Brothers, regulatory shifts have the potential to reduce the impact of a repeat. The challenge for politicians and watchdogs is not to go soft.That’s what happened before. A munificent Federal Reserve helped stoke a leverage bubble that masqueraded as “the Great Moderation.” Meanwhile, financial regulators of all stripes dozed off, encouraged by lawmakers too cozy with Big Finance.Then there was the costly bust. The pendulum’s swing from greed to fear has produced useful results. One is an effort to create powers for the orderly closure of a firm like Lehman. Tougher capital standards make sense. And new rules and greater scrutiny for the over-the-counter derivatives market, one source of the interconnectedness that made Lehman’s failure so painful over and above its size, were overdue.Yet supervisors didn’t use their already existent powers energetically enough to crimp the activities of institutions later deemed too big to fail. For all the talk of building capital buffers in good times, today’s response to the financial crisis — not to mention what little penitence there is on the part of banks — looks pro-cyclical.Only the next Lehman will show whether lessons have been learned. Restructured bank pay mechanisms could make excessive risk slightly less rewarding, but bankers won’t stop their boundless quest for riches. If Son of Lehman has more capital and a better match between its assets and liabilities, failure will be less likely. And the intended financial euthanasia option should keep repercussions from spreading as far.'"
"'10-09-15,'1','Ronald W. Walters, who organized one of the nation’s first lunch-counter sit-ins to protest segregation as a young man and went on to become a leading scholar of the politics of race, died Friday in Bethesda, Md. He was 72 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.The cause was cancer, his wife, Patricia Turner Walters, said.Dr. Walters was 20 and president of the local youth chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. when he and a cousin, Carol Parks, organized a sit-in at the Dockum Drug Store in downtown Wichita, Kan. That was in July 1958, two years before students in Greensboro, N.C., staged the sit-ins that are often credited with starting the movement in many Southern cities.Every morning for three weeks, the protesters in Wichita returned to the drugstore, sitting silently until closing time, despite constant taunting. Finally the owner relented and agreed to serve black customers, saying he was losing too much money as a result of the sit-in. That protest received scant national attention, and it was only in 2006 that Dr. Walters received an N.A.A.C.P. award for his role in organizing it.By then he had made a significant mark on the civil rights movement — as a teacher, an author, a television commentator and an adviser to activists and politicians.“He was an indispensable part of the brain trust of the movement,” Vernon E. Jordan, the civil rights leader and lawyer, said on Monday. “He was there for all of us, at the other end of the phone, if we needed his thinking, his synthesis of racial issues, political issues, economic issues. And he was always at the ready to get on the train to help the cause.”'"

"'10-09-15,'1','Microsoft made the right decision to stop helping Russian authorities use claims of software piracy to harass and silence dissenters. On Monday, it announced that it is barring its lawyers from taking part in such cases and will provide a blanket software license to advocacy groups and news media outlets in Russia, undercutting the Kremlin’s tactic.Still, Microsoft’s willingness to lend itself to politically motivated investigations — it changed course only after an article by Clifford Levy in The Times on Sunday — suggests a shocking failure of corporate responsibility. The Times said lawyers for Microsoft bolstered state police in politically tinged cases across Russia. They made statements suggesting the company was a victim and called for criminal charges. After police seized a dozen computers from a Siberian environmental group, the group said all its software was legally licensed and asked Microsoft to confirm this. Microsoft would not. The police used information from the computers to track down and interrogate some of the group’s supporters.Before changing policy on Monday, Microsoft executives said the company was required under Russian law to take part in such inquiries.Unfortunately, Microsoft is not the only American company that has failed to stand up for the rights of its customers in undemocratic countries.In China, all search engines have helped the state control access to the Internet. In 2004, Yahoo helped Beijing’s state police uncover the Internet identities of two Chinese journalists, who were then sentenced to 10 years in prison for disseminating pro-democracy writings online. Skype’s Chinese partner, Tom Online, scanned text messages for politically sensitive words and stored them alongside user information on servers that could be accessed easily by the Chinese government.The one company that has stood up to China is Google. In March, after five years of complicity with Beijing’s censors, it began redirecting searches to its unfiltered engine in Hong Kong. By contrast, Microsoft’s founder and chairman, Bill Gates, defended the company’s continued collaboration with China’s censors. “You’ve got to decide: Do you want to obey the laws of the countries you’re in, or not?” he said during Beijing’s fight with Google. “If not, you may not end up doing business there.”'"

"'10-09-15,'1','Ben Jealous, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, urged Gov. Haley Barbour on Tuesday to pardon two black women who are serving life in prison for their role in an armed robbery that netted $11. The women, Jamie and Gladys Scott, lured two men down a road in 1993 in central Mississippi, where three teenagers struck them in the head with a shotgun and took their wallets, according to court documents. The Scotts were convicted of robbery with the use of a deadly weapon; the three teenagers made plea deals and served several months behind bars. “We’re looking for the governor to be a humane person in the situation,” Mr. Jealous said. “It is a hideous event in the history of Mississippi.” Dan Turner, a spokesman for the governor, said that a meeting was scheduled for Wednesday, but that a decision would come after the parole board made a recommendation. Momentum for the pardon has been building online amid reports that Jamie Scott, 38, is gravely ill with kidney failure. A prisons spokeswoman described her condition as “medically stable.”'"
"'10-09-15,'1','PHOENIX (AP) — A judge on Tuesday allowed contested Green Party candidates to remain on the November ballot in Arizona, denying a request that they be kicked off because Republicans allegedly recruited them.The judge, Dean Fink of Maricopa County Superior Court, found that a former Republican lawmaker, Steve May, recruited several of the 11 disputed candidates to try to take votes away from Democrats.“The court has no hesitation in finding that each of these candidates was recruited in bad faith with a purpose to confuse the voting public,” Judge Fink wrote.But he also found that the candidates got on the ballot legally and appeared to have a legitimate desire to run.Judge Fink ruled that he would have removed one candidate, Christopher Campbell, from the ballot if Mr. Campbell had not already withdrawn. Mr. Campbell admitted in a recorded phone call that his motive was to take votes away from Democrats; the judge found that Mr. Campbell was recruited by the daughter of a Republican lawmaker, Jim Weiers.'"

"'10-09-15,'1','Can a play be interesting and forgettable at the same time? Apparently it can, because “Roadkill Confidential,” a new work by Sheila Callaghan, is intriguing to watch, yet it leaves no impression.The play is about a somewhat unhinged artist named Trevor (Rebecca Henderson) who is trying to recapture her early notoriety by creating an artwork made out of roadkill she collects near her home in upstate New York. Trouble is, some of this roadkill carries a lethal virus.That gets the attention of an equally unhinged F.B.I. agent (Danny Mastrogiorgio). A strange sort of pursuit ensues, with Trevor’s husband (Greg McFadden), stepson (Alex Anfanger) and ditzy neighbor (Polly Lee) all drawn in. And animals keep getting hit on the roadside.The interesting thing about the production, staged at the 3LD Art and Technology Center by Clubbed Thumb and directed by Kip Fagan, is how it incorporates video projections — the stage is ringed with television monitors — and live camera work. Such devices are becoming common on New York stages and often seem more distracting than enhancing, but here they meld fairly effortlessly into the overall tale.The forgettable thing is, well, everything else. Ms. Callaghan has said that the catalyst for the play was the real-life case of Steven J. Kurtz, a college professor who briefly became the subject of a terrorism investigation after obtaining biological materials for an art exhibition. And while her darkly comic works (“That Pretty Pretty; or, The Rape Play”) have been something of a hot commodity in New York in recent years, she serves up a stylistic mishmash here: it’s a sick sitcom, it’s a thriller, it’s a parody, it’s a commentary on the art world, it’s a — this one’s borrowed from the script’s title page — “noirish meditation on brutality.” The piece has some witty moments but no insightful ones, and it’s delivered by characters who are sterile at best, caricatures at worst. No emotional investment necessary.'"
"'10-09-15,'1','“This is a bill that would cut taxes and help provide loans to millions of small-business owners, who create most of the new jobs in this country,” he said, adding, “Small businesses across the country have been waiting for Washington to act on this bill for far too long.”With another round of primary elections under way, Congressional Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday continued to clash over the expiring Bush-era tax cuts.And the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, announced that he wanted to attach a major piece of immigration legislation — called the Dream Act — to the annual Pentagon authorization bill, which he hopes to bring to the Senate floor next week.The Dream Act would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who arrived in the United States before age 16, resided in the country for five years, earned a high school diploma or an equivalency degree and then completed two years of college or military service.The military bill is already more contentious than usual because it contains a provision allowing the repeal of the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy regarding gay personnel in the services.Mr. Reid’s decision only raised the political stakes. (His own re-election campaign in Nevada, for instance, could hinge partly on the turnout of Hispanic-American voters.)Mr. Reid, at a news conference, noted that Congress had been unable to move forward with comprehensive immigration legislation but said that the Dream Act was an important step.“Kids who grew up as Americans should be able to get their green cards after they go to college or serve in the military,” he said.The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Democrats were loading up the annual Pentagon measure with too many unrelated issues.“It’s going to have a number of extraneous measures in it that have nothing to do with defense, which is making it needlessly controversial,” Mr. McConnell said.Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, has already said he will try to block the legislation over the effort to repeal “don’t ask, don’t tell.”Meanwhile, as part of the debate over the small-business measure, efforts to repeal or roll back a new tax-reporting requirement for the nation’s businesses failed Tuesday when neither party managed to muster the 60 votes needed to advance its approach to the issue.Small businesses led efforts to repeal the information-reporting requirement, a little-noticed provision of the new health care law that they said would impose a huge new burden of paperwork and administrative work.But the efforts to reduce paperwork facing many small businesses fell victim to lingering disagreements about whether to make any changes to the health care legislation enacted in March after bitter partisan debate.To improve compliance, the new health care law requires businesses to file tax forms known as 1099s identifying anyone to whom they pay $600 or more for goods or merchandise in a year.Businesses will also have to send copies of the form to their vendors, suppliers and contractors. The forms are already widely used to report various kinds of payments of taxable income other than wages, like interest income or dividends. But the health care law requires filing the forms in many more instances than they were typically used before.The premise of the requirement was that businesses would be more likely to pay taxes on their income if they knew that the income was already being reported to the Internal Revenue Service by their business partners.Congressional tax experts said the reporting requirement would induce businesses to pay more of the tax they owe, generating $17 billion of additional revenue in the next 10 years. The money would help pay for coverage of the uninsured.Mr. Reid, who praised Mr. Voinovich and Mr. LeMieux for their support in advancing the measure to aid small businesses, said the bill was “the most significant thing we have done since the stimulus bill was passed to create jobs.”In an interview, Mr. LeMieux said the measure was badly needed.“It’s going to pass,” Mr. LeMieux said moments after the procedural vote. “It’s the right thing to do. It’s going to be very good for my state. We have got almost two million small businesses. They are struggling. I visited businesses over August, and they can’t get financing.”'"

"'10-09-15,'1','Pelé, a three-time winner of the World Cup and the most complete player in history, still considers this picture a defining moment in his life.“Bobby Moore was my friend as well as the greatest defender I ever played against,” Pelé said after Moore’s death. “The world has lost one of its greatest football players and an honorable gentleman.”Last week, the world lost the third man for whom this photograph meant so much.John Varley, the photographer, died in his home county, Yorkshire, in northern England. Varley, who was 76, was a news photographer with a sensitive eye for moments beyond the news.His paper, The Daily Mirror of London, sent him to wars and to natural disasters. And he delivered. In the days when there were no digital cameras, no automatic focus, he had what other photographers described as an instinct for being where things might develop, and a patience to wait for the crucial momentThe Moore-Pelé embrace was such a moment. Look again at the image. Cast your mind back to 1970, when foreign players in the English league — or any league — were rare.There was at the time a suspicion of black players, ludicrous when one considers that Pelé had been a world star since 1958. It centered on the belief that nonwhites lacked stamina and physical toughness.This photograph helped break down that prejudice. The blond, blue-eyed Moore and the most wonderful player of his time, Pelé, each stripped to the waist, simply transcended that nonsense.To take the picture, Varley had taken a sabbatical from his day job.His contract included a break every four years, and Varley used that to go to each World Cup from 1966 to 1982.I knew him in the latter years of those assignments, a traveling companion of quiet, droll humor, and, like a lot of photographers of his time, a self-effacing man.There was no rich living to be made 40 years ago for a specialist sports photographer. Varley’s work shone through the image of a policeman, waist deep in water, carrying a baby to safety during flooding in an English valley.He took memorable shots of children suffering in the Biafra war — a civil war in Nigeria — as well as a symbolic photograph of a church cross tangled up in rusty barbed wire in the tough Ardoyne district in Belfast during the Troubles of Northern Ireland.And, again in sports, he looked behind the scenes after a British boxing bout when he snapped a harrowing image of the defeated heavyweight Richard Dunn, his head on the floor of the bathroom shower.On hearing of Varley’s death, I contacted an American photographer in California. “I have that picture of Pelé and Moore,” he said. “Always admired it, never knew who took it.”Typical. The man behind the camera is so often anonymous, even in his own trade. But where would we be in this section of the newspaper without men like John Varley?'"
"'10-09-15,'1','It is a football axiom that defenses are usually ahead of offenses early in the season because offenses rely so much on finely honed timing between quarterbacks and receivers to be effective. But that alone does not explain why scoring dropped this season compared with recent years, especially because there were no significant rule changes.Brian Billick, the former Ravens coach who analyzes games for Fox, said he thought scheduling might be a factor. As the N.F.L. pushes division games to later in the season to avoid teams clinching playoff spots and resting players in the final few weeks, he says Week 1 scoring may go down because unfamiliarity with opponents leads to more mistakes. Seven games were contested between division rivals this year, the same number as last year.Billick acknowledged his concern about Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez’s progress (10 of 21 for 74 yards), but he said fans should not put much stock in any statistics after one week.“I can’t imagine scoring is really going to go down,” he said. “There are too many good quarterbacks. Last year, 10 quarterbacks threw for 4,000 yards.”PORTIS WEIGHS IN ON REPORTER Redskins running back Clinton Portis apologized soon after saying in a radio interview that both sides have wandering eyes when female reporters enter N.F.L. locker rooms. Portis was addressing the league’s investigation of the Jets’ treatment of Inés Sainz, a reporter for TV Azteca, a Mexican network.

"'10-09-15,'1','Two economic indicators — business inventories and retail sales — both topped forecasts in government reports released Tuesday.In one report, business inventories in July posted their largest increase in two years, as sales rebounded strongly, the Commerce Department saidInventories rose 1 percent to $1.38 trillion, the highest level since May 2009, after increasing by a revised 0.5 percent in June. July’s percentage increase was the largest since July 2008. Markets had expected July inventories to rise 0.5 percent from a previously reported 0.3 percent increase in June.Inventories are a crucial component of changes in the gross domestic product over the business cycle. Investments in inventories were a chief factor to growth during the early part of the recovery from the worst downturn since the Great Depression.The increase from the rebuilding of merchandise stock is, however, fading and a small contribution from inventories contributed to a sharp slowdown in growth in the second quarter. But the trend in July, if sustained, could see inventories making a significant contribution to G.D.P. growth in the third quarter.In July, business sales increased 0.7 percent, the largest gain since March, to $1.09 trillion in July after declining 0.5 percent in June.'"

"'10-09-15,'1','The result spared the nation yet another change in leadership as it grapples with a soaring yen, which has contributed lately to its now two-decade-long economic decline, and a simmering diplomatic standoff over a Chinese boat seized near disputed islands in the East China Sea, among other problems. If Mr. Ozawa had won, he would have been the seventh prime minister in four years.The outcome also promises to calm Tokyo’s recently rocky relationship with Washington, its longtime ally and protector. After the victory, Mr. Kan repeated his promise to honor a May agreement to relocate a Marine air base on Okinawa, which Mr. Ozawa had pledged to renegotiate because of intense opposition on the island.Political experts called the contest a battle of political style rather than policy substance. Mr. Ozawa, a skilled strategist who engineered the Democrats’ historic election victory last year, vowed to be a stronger and more assertive prime minister, echoing the public perception that Mr. Kan had failed to show decisive leadership.For his part, Mr. Kan hammered away at Mr. Ozawa’s image as an old-school, back-room operator, saying that it was time for Japan to create a cleaner and more open political system, completing the political revolution the Democrats began last year, when they ended more than half a century of virtual one-party rule by their predecessors, the Liberal Democrats.“Mr. Kan will be an experiment in what is a new style of politics for Japan,” said Norihiko Narita, a political science professor and president of Surugadai University near Tokyo. “He will be very sensitive to public opinion polls and tailor his policies to please the public.”Mr. Narita and other analysts said Tuesday’s defeat might also bring at least a partial withdrawal from the political scene for Mr. Ozawa, 68, who has dominated Japan’s opposition movement for nearly two decades, but who called this election his final mission.Speaking with tears in his eyes, Mr. Kan, a plain-spoken former civic activist, pledged to focus his administration on the task of fixing the ailing Japanese economy by ending deflation and creating new jobs. Yet, at a time when the stricken global economy appears to be slipping yet again, Mr. Kan’s job-creation programs and other growth policies for Japan’s $5 trillion economy have been criticized as too little, too late.In the end, political experts said, Mr. Kan prevailed because of the deep unpopularity of Mr. Ozawa, who faced criticism by Japan’s major newspapers over investigations by prosecutors into his political financing. However, Mr. Ozawa won support among younger members of his party, as well as among Japan’s netizens, by appealing to the hunger here for strong leadership to guide the nation out of its long morass.In particular, Mr. Ozawa, 68, had vowed to assert more political control over Japan’s powerful central ministries, long this nation’s de facto rulers, whom many Japanese now blame for its current woes. During the two-week campaign, he criticized Mr. Kan for being under the thumb of elite Finance Ministry bureaucrats, who have traditionally supported higher taxes and lower deficits.Japanese news outlets have said that one of the biggest challenges Mr. Kan may face after Tuesday’s vote could be keeping his party together, especially if Mr. Ozawa and allies decide to break away. However, most political experts dismissed that notion, saying that the lure of power would keep the inexperienced party together.'"

He said it was the company’s decision to stop research. The agency has started a formal investigation.The developments came after People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals released a video of conditions at the laboratory.The company’s phone number at the lab in Corapeake, near the Virginia line, was disconnected Wednesday.

"'10-09-16,'1','FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — The N.F.L. on Tuesday sent a memo to the public-relations directors of each of its teams reiterating its equal access and conduct policies toward the news media after a female television reporter was reportedly the object of catcalls at a Jets practice last weekend.The letter was prompted by reports of the Jets’ treatment of the reporter, Ines Sainz of TV Azteca, on Saturday and by the comments of Redskins running back Clinton Portis on Tuesday. Portis said in his weekly appearance on a radio show that if women were in the locker room, “I think men are going to tend to turn and look and want to say something to that woman.” He later apologized in a statement released by the Redskins.The memo highlighted sections of the media relations handbook, including one that reads: “Women are a common part of the sports media ... Please remember what women reporters are professionals and should be treated as such.”Reporters were allowed in the Jets’ locker room Wednesday for the first time since some players and coaches were said to act inappropriately toward Sainz.On Wednesday, several players loudly “shushed” one another until they were told to stop by members of the team’s public-relations staff.The locker room was emptier than normal, perhaps a result of the N.F.L. investigation. The league interviewed players and coaches, including Coach Rex Ryan, at team headquarters on Tuesday.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','PENSACOLA, Fla. — Anyone listening to Rush Limbaugh’s radio show Tuesday could be forgiven for thinking that Judge Roger Vinson has the federal government dead in his sights.Mr. Limbaugh spent some time profiling Judge Vinson, a senior judge on the Federal District Court in Pensacola, who had just announced he would allow a legal challenge to the new health care law to advance to a full hearing. The conservative radio host informed his listeners that the judge was an avid hunter and amateur taxidermist who once killed three brown bears and mounted their heads over his courtroom door to “instill the fear of God into the accused.”“This,” Mr. Limbaugh said, “would not be good news” for liberal supporters of the health law.But, in fact, Judge Vinson has never shot anything other than a water moccasin (last Saturday, at his weekend cabin), is not a taxidermist and, as president of the American Camellia Society, is far more familiar with Camellia reticulata than with Ursus arctos.Apparently, Mr. Limbaugh had fallen prey to an Internet hoax.On Sunday night, and again Monday morning, someone identified only as “Pensacolian” edited Judge Vinson’s Wikipedia entry to include the invented material. The prankster footnoted the entry to a supposed story in The Pensacola News Journal. The article — like its stated publication date of June 31, 2003 — does not exist. The same person who posted the information removed it on Tuesday afternoon, Wikipedia logs show.As calls flooded in about Mr. Limbaugh’s depiction, Judge Vinson, 70, took it all in stride. “I’ve never killed a bear,” he said Wednesday, “and I’m not Davy Crockett.”His wife, Ellen, was less amused. “It offended me,” she said, “because I don’t think you should be able to broadcast something nationally if you can’t verify it.”'"
"'10-09-16,'1','He thought it might belong to a resident of the building and tried to find the owner, said one official, quoting from a police report that recounts Mr. Puentes’s visit to the 19th Precinct station house. But he had no success and safeguarded the artwork in his locker.Some days later, he went on a three-week vacation, and a short time after he returned, he learned of news accounts of the missing Corot painting, the official said.“I feel very bad; I have no comments,” Mr. Puentes said after work on Wednesday. “As far as I’m concerned, I did what the law required.”Mr. Puentes’s account could lend some credence to the story told by the middleman, James Carl Haggerty, who, according to the lawsuit, said he had had too much to drink and lost the artwork after he had shown it to a potential buyer at the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street on July 28.Mr. Puentes’s daughter, Felipina Castillo, 47, said her father was questioned by detectives for about seven hours after he took the painting to the station house. While he was there, his wife called his cellphone.“He tells her he’s being investigated by the police,” Ms. Castillo said. “He just mentioned something about a picture.”She said that when Mr. Puentes returned from vacation in Florida, he spoke to a friend about the painting, and the friend told him about the media coverage of the missing Corot.“He had no clue what he had in his hands,” Ms. Castillo said. “He’s very sad now. He’s a little worried.”Investigators believe that Mr. Puentes, who has worked at 995 Fifth Avenue for 30 years, is telling the truth, several of the officials said. His building is on the corner of East 81st Street, about five blocks from the hotel where the painting was last seen with Mr. Haggerty.Mr. Haggerty was captured on video surveillance footage leaving the hotel with the painting, which is a shade larger than 9 inches by 12 inches, about 12:50 a.m. on July 29, the lawsuit said. But video recordings of the lobby of his apartment building showed he did not have it when he arrived home about 2:30 a.m., according to the lawsuit, which was brought by Kristyn Trudgeon, who has identified herself as a co-owner of the painting.Much remains unclear about the events surrounding the disappearance of the painting, as well as the filing of Ms. Trudgeon’s lawsuit — and its withdrawal — and the criminal investigation that grew out of the news articles generated by the litigation.Ms. Trudgeon said she was not convinced that Mr. Haggerty was blameless.“He left the painting on the side of the road?” she said Wednesday. “Haggerty’s been lying through his teeth.”The other co-owner of the painting, Thomas A. Doyle, was arrested last Thursday on federal wire fraud conspiracy charges, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case by James P. Wynne, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who pursues art theft and related crimes.The complaint accuses Mr. Doyle of trying to defraud an investor in the painting and lying about its value, according to a news release announcing the charges, which were brought by the office of the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara.Ms. Trudgeon said she told Mr. Doyle, who is in federal custody, that the painting had been recovered.“He said, ‘That’s the best news I’ve heard all day,’ ” she said.She said she met Mr. Doyle in March and was unaware of his past until a few months ago. She described him in an earlier interview as “trying to make the straight and narrow.”“I’m glad the painting is found,” she said on Wednesday. “I’m glad it’s not in the Dumpster.”'"
"'10-09-16,'1','WISIL, Somalia — The wind howls here, lifting off the desert, roaring into town, gathering force as it squeezes between the metal shacks along Wisil’s main drag and blasts into people’s faces.Spectral figures tramp by, their faces wrapped in checkered scarves to keep the sand out of their eyes and prevent it from burning the backs of their throats. Lashed by the wind, donkeys bow their heads.Against this tableau appears Mohamed Gelle. He is hard to miss. His eyes are pried open with little white straws wedged between his cheek and his eyebrow because, he says, he never wants to sleep. Wisil’s children laugh mercilessly at him as he hunches under a tree and wolfs down a melon, mumbling to himself as the juice dribbles off his chin into the tangle of rags that make up his clothes.“That man,” said a passer-by, with a sad shake of the head, “used to be the richest man in town. He had five taxis in Mogadishu.”Not far away, trudging along in oversize flip-flops, is Mahamoud Ahmed Dini, who unlike Mr. Gelle moves unnoticed, looking completely normal — until you see the left side of his head. His left ear has been sheared off, leaving a spongy stump and a sand-encrusted hole.“It was a 37-millimeter shell. A zook !” Mr. Dini says, almost proudly. “1991.”One man loses his ear, another seems to have lost his mind. A single mother with five children says goodbye to her home during a barrage of mortar rounds in Mogadishu, the capital, and arrives here broke, embarking on a life of squatter-hood.Though Wisil is just another windswept town in central Somalia, barely a tiny dot on the most detailed maps, it seems to embody something bigger, something true for the entire nation: an enduring sense of loss.Somalia has been missing a functioning central government for nearly 20 years, a record in modern times. The government imploded in 1991 and nobody — not the warlords, clan elders, religious sheiks or United Nations-backed technocrats — has been able to rebuild it.The problems that stem from this are scattered far and wide. The lawlessness, the lack of resources, the isolation and the desperation extend outward in various degrees of intensity from the bullet-scarred streets of Mogadishu to remote, impoverished, uneventful villages like Wisil, which are essentially left on their own to deal with the wreckage of a never-ending war.With cloudy eyes and trembling lips, Mahamoud Nur Ali, the oldest man in Wisil, remembers when the Italians invaded Hobyo, a nearby coastal town (and now a pirate den) in 1925. He was 8 and his traditional world of camels and deserts, blood feuds and swords, was about to change.But he says he does not begrudge the Italian colonizers. “Actually,” he said, sitting on a thin reed mat in a house made from flattened oil drums, “those were the best days we had. At that time, there was some law and order.”Today, what law and order there is left in places like Wisil comes from the intricate clan system. Somalia may be one of the most homogenous countries on the planet, with nearly 100 percent of its people speaking the same language, adhering to the same religion (Sunni Islam) and belonging to the same ethnic group.But this nation is split into a dizzying number of clans, sub-clans, sub-sub-clans and so on, and just about everyone in Wisil hails from the same sub-sub-clan, the Sa’ad. After the government collapsed, many men here fought fiercely for the Sa’ad’s leader, Mohamed Farah Aideed, a notorious warlord. Mr. Aideed humiliated American troops in 1993 in the Black Hawk Down battle but was killed a few years later, leaving Wisil’s people without a champion.The village today has a few thousand residents, no running water, no electricity, no TVs. Its sandy main street is littered with camel vertebrae, red-and-white Sportsman cigarette packs and donkey dung. A portrait of isolation, Wisil is eight hours’ drive from the nearest town with electricity, down a road so bumpy that travelers get calluses on their hands from holding on so tightly as they are jostled over it.The young men here say that if there was a government, maybe there would be better roads. And wells. And schools. And hospitals. Many children here have dime-size scars on their foreheads, the mark of traditional medicine, typically a burning stick touched to a child’s face in the hope of ridding the young body of malaria and other diseases.“What do we do for fun?” said Bashir Ahmed, a young farmer, sitting with friends outside a bare shop. “We sit here on the stoop and watch the road. That’s our fun.”Wisil’s people are herders and farmers, scraping a living from the thorny landscape. At this time of year, the sun beats down and the wind picks up, stirring so much dust that the bottoms of the clouds turn pink, the color of the desert.That same wind froths up the seas. Wisil is not far from the Somali coast, and many Somali pirates pass through here, especially during the de facto pirate summer vacation because of the rough ocean.The other day, a pirate convoy thundered through town, the tires of the four-by-four trucks churning up a mini-sandstorm as the trucks flew past.“We don’t get anything from them,” scowled Mr. Dini, the man with the missing ear. “They use their money to drink wine and sleep with prostitutes.”Several pirates in Wisil admitted as much. One pirate named Mohamed, who claimed that he made $250,000 in 2009 for hijacking the Faina, a Ukrainian freighter packed with arms, said he spent all his money on cars, qat (a leaf Somalis chew for a high) and women. “If I knew how to save like a normal person,” he joked, “do you think I’d still be doing this?”A small, clan-based local government, the Galmudug State administration, is trying to establish a foothold in this area, and clan leaders want money from the United Nations to help create fisheries, livestock projects and other jobs to give young men an alternative to piracy.But the basic human needs here are staggering. On the outskirts of Wisil stand dozens of deserted gumdrop-shaped hovels made from scraps of plastic. These used to be homes of displaced people fleeing Mogadishu’s fighting.“Where did they go? I’m not sure,” said Abdi Aziz Hassan, a volunteer policeman. “Maybe they left because of the wind.”'"
"'10-09-16,'1','Nearly 20 years later, the Davis Cup is still a main event in France, but not globally. Djokovic is the only one of the Open semifinalists who is playing this week, although there are 6 others in the top 20 involved at all levels.Federer, who has made a habit of swooping in to save Switzerland in the relegation round, has declined to do even that much this year now that the Davis Cup — at the top players’ request — has been moved to the week after the Open.Instead, Federer will rest and let his countryman Stanislas Wawrinka carry the load in Kazakhstan against a team that is far from harmless.Nadal skipped the quarterfinal against France that Spain lost the week after Wimbledon in July and reaped the rewards by looking fresher than usual in New York. Nadal is deeply attached to the Davis Cup. As a 14-year-old, he carried the flag for Spain during the opening ceremony before it won the Cup in 2000 for the first time. He made his first major impact as a player in the Davis Cup, too, beating Andy Roddick in Seville in the 2004 final that Spain won.He has been part of two other victorious campaigns for Spain, but he is calling for a new model and even floating the idea of the Davis Cup downshifting to best-of-three from best-of-five to preserve the players.“I think the Davis Cup needs changes in general,” he said in an interview Tuesday. “I can’t tell you exactly what, but it needs something so that the competition works better and the great players will play it more often. It would benefit everyone.”When a tennis patriot like Nadal or Roddick, who also skipped the Davis Cup this year, is complaining, it is time to listen harder. In light of the top players’ unusual interest in governance at the moment, it is likely that Nadal, Federer and others in the star chamber will attempt to put further pressure on the organizers of the 110-year-old event to adjust its annual format.Jim Courier, the former world No. 1 and Davis Cup player from the United States, wants change, too, which is particularly relevant considering that Courier is considered one of the leading candidates to replace Patrick McEnroe as United States captain this year.“I’m certainly interested; you know how much Davis Cup has meant to me over the years,” he said. “Here’s the reality: as you look back on your time on the pro circuit as a pro player, you think about the Slams, you think about the Davis Cup and then you think about everything else in a pile. They are in different categories, and that speaks to the power of what Davis Cup can be. And what a shame Federer does not have those memories. He’s never tried to win the Davis Cup as a top player.”Courier, whose competition for captain will include the former player Todd Martin, said he preferred a two-week event at a single site, either annual or biennial.Francesco Ricci Bitti, president of the International Tennis Federation, which owns the Cup, has said repeatedly that he is open to proposals but wants to preserve the annual home-and-away character of the event and also the revenue stream it provides to develop tennis worldwide.Courier, a member of one of the greatest American tennis generations, won the Cup twice: in 1992 in Fort Worth against Switzerland, and in 1995 in Moscow against the Russians.Courier pushed to become captain in 2000, and when McEnroe was chosen, he was politely asked by United States Tennis Association officials to wait his turn. McEnroe ended up staying 10 years, making him the longest-serving captain in United States Davis Cup history.But McEnroe’s tenure is not quite over. He is in Bogotá, Colombia, preparing for his final event: a relegation-round match on clay that is no slam dunk considering that the Colombians Santiago Giraldo and Alejandro Falla are both in the top 70 and much more accustomed to Bogotá’s high altitude of more than 8,530 feet than their American rivals, Sam Querrey, John Isner, Mardy Fish and the 18-year-old Ryan Harrison.McEnroe was concerned enough that he took the risk of leaving the doubles specialists Bob and Mike Bryan out of his four-man team so that he had a backup singles player available.If the Americans fall short of breath and victories, Courier, or someone else, will be in charge of a second-division team next year.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','If Congress restores the 2009 plan and its tax rates, most people concerned about estate taxes will be able to sigh with relief. But “there’s a very good chance that Congress will not act until next spring,” said Dennis I. Belcher, a lawyer with McGuireWoods in Richmond, Va. The firm closely follows events on Capitol Hill.What can you do now? These steps can help preserve assets for heirs without breaking your bank. If tax rates become more favorable, you will be no worse off.During this period of uncertainty, buy a one- or two-year term policy to cover the tax bill if the exemption amount is only $1 million, said Ann B. Burns, a lawyer with Gray Plant Mooty in Minneapolis. The policy can be canceled if Congress eases your estate tax concerns.Be sure that your beneficiaries, not you, own the policy, or the proceeds will count as part of your estate and could be subject to tax. As owners, your beneficiaries must pay the premiums, but you can give them the money to do that using annual gifts. If you already own a policy, sell it to the trust or to family members for its fair market value, said Ms. Burns.A trust used for this purpose should give beneficiaries (or their parents, if the beneficiaries are minors) what are called Crummey powers: the right for a limited time, usually 30 or 60 days, to withdraw the yearly gift from the trust. Otherwise, for arcane legal reasons, the money you put into the trust will not count toward the annual exclusion.A widow or widower who remarries gains the estate tax advantage available to all married couples: you can leave an unlimited amount to your spouse — provided she or he is an American citizen — with no estate tax applied. The assets must be left outright or in a certain type of trust. In the process, though, the remarrying widow or widower would lose the late spouse’s Social Security benefits, said Joshua S. Rubenstein, a lawyer with Katten Muchin Rosenman in New York.This strategy affects only the assets your deceased spouse left to you; assets left to other beneficiaries are unaffected.To each use your exemption, you must consider how to shelter assets from tax when the second of you dies. Typically this is done by putting a certain sum, up to the tax-free amount, into a family trust when the first spouse passes away. And to do this, you need assets of your own.Look over your assets to see whether any property can be transferred from one spouse to the other or from joint ownership into single ownership by one of you. Note that if you shift assets to a spouse who is not an American citizen, you may have to pay gift tax.If you lend money to family members — say, to buy a house or a car or to start a business — you create a win-win situation. You must charge a minimum rate of interest set each month by the Treasury, called the applicable federal rate, to avoid potential gift tax and income tax consequences. For September, the rate for loans lasting more than nine years and requiring monthly payments is an attractive 3.6 percent. That is less than family members would have to pay for a bank loan, assuming they could get one in today’s tight credit market, but more than you could earn from C.D.’s or money market accounts.Section 529 education savings plans are primarily a tool for financing education — your own or a family member’s. Earnings in the account are exempt from federal tax, provided the money is withdrawn to pay for tuition or certain expenses for college or graduate school.Another attraction of these accounts is that you can tap the money yourself if you need it, making 529 accounts a good way to hedge your bets. To have this option, you must name yourself as the owner, said Susan T. Bart, a lawyer with Sidley Austin in Chicago. (So don’t name an adult child as owner of the account benefiting a grandchild, for example.) And keep in mind that if the funds are not used for education, any earnings that are withdrawn are subject to income tax and a 10 percent penalty.The law permits lump-sum deposits, using the annual exclusion, of as much as $65,000 a person at once ($130,000 for married couples), provided you file a gift tax return that treats the gift as if it had been spread over five years. If you die before the five years is up, the part of the gift that reflects the number of years still to go will be considered part of your estate.One potential pitfall this year is that right now there is no generation-skipping transfer tax and no exemption from that tax, either (though, like the estate tax, they spring back next year). In this environment, many estate planners agree it is risky to put money into trusts that will benefit grandchildren, because that could cause all the trust assets, including appreciation, to be taxed when they are withdrawn.Some lawyers think that the same principle applies to custodial accounts under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act and to 529 plans. So the most cautious approach is to wait until Jan. 1 to finance plans for grandchildren or great-grandchildren, Ms. Bart said.With a grantor retained annuity trust, known as a GRAT, you put appreciating assets into an irrevocable trust and retain the right to receive an annual income stream for the term of the trust. This annuity is based on the Section 7520 rate set each month by the Internal Revenue Service. If you survive the trust term — a condition for this technique to work — any appreciation above the set rate can go to family members or to trusts for their benefit. Under current law, it is possible to create a GRAT that will result in no taxable gift, or a nominal one.Depressed asset values and an extremely low Section 7520 rate — 2.4 percent for September — make GRATs especially attractive. Some financial advisers also think there is only a limited opportunity to form short-term GRATs, because proposals are pending in Congress to require GRATs have a term of at least 10 years, rather than the current two.Such a change would greatly accentuate what is called the “mortality risk” of a GRAT: if the person setting up the trust died during the trust term, all or part of the trust assets would be included in her estate for tax purposes. You would no longer be able to use short-term GRATs to minimize that risk. Presumably any changes in the law would apply only to GRATs put in place after it is passed.These trusts are not appropriate for people who cannot stomach complexity, and they cost at least $5,000 to $10,000 to set up, Ms. Burns said. They work best for assets where rapid appreciation is expected, she said, for instance, when a company is sold or goes public.Likewise, if you have a portfolio of depressed stocks that you expect to recover, GRATs allow you to give away the upside potential, if you can afford to, Mr. Rubenstein said. If, like many retirees, all you hold is bonds, a GRAT doesn’t offer any benefit.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','Q. I added some songs from a U.S.B. drive to my iTunes library the other day, but when I went to transfer the files to my iPod, iTunes showed an exclamation point next to the song titles and nothing transferred. What’s wrong?A. The iTunes program serves as both a media player and a database for the content you’ve added to it. The program window lists your songs and videos so you can see what you have, but the actual files themselves are stored elsewhere. In the default location, your files are nestled inside subfolders within the iTunes program folder on your hard drive.When you rip tracks from compact discs or buy songs and videos in the iTunes Store, you can add compatible files from other sources to the iTunes database by going to the File menu and choosing the Add to Library command. (In most cases, you can also add files by dragging them onto the iTunes program window.) But adding files to the iTunes library database doesn’t always mean you are adding them to the iTunes folders.When iTunes displays an exclamation mark next to a song title, it means the program can’t find the original file in the location it was in when you added it. If you added tracks from an external U.S.B. drive or from a folder — and then disconnected the drive or moved the folder — iTunes can’t find the file.To prevent this from happening, have iTunes create its own copy of each file you add; it keeps that copy in its folder so that it doesn’t need to find the original. Open the iTunes preference box under the Edit menu in the Windows version or under the iTunes menu on the Mac. In the Preferences box, click on the Advanced tab, turn on the checkbox next to “Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library” and click on the O.K. button.Q. I buy things from Amazon every once in a while, but the site sends me messages at least once a day suggesting other things I should buy there. I don’t want to mark the mail as Junk since I want to keep getting order confirmation messages, but is there a way to weed out the sales pitches?'"
"'10-09-16,'1','As the era of the winds down — two, perhaps three shuttle flights remain — a clash of visions over what should come next has kept the space agency adrift for much of the past year. An authorization bill written by the House Science and Technology Committee to lay out the direction of NASA for the next three years would largely follow the traditional trajectory for . It calls on NASA to build a government-owned rocket — likely the Ares I, which NASA has been working on for five years — for taking astronauts to the space station and then a larger one for missions to the , asteroids and eventually Mars.The competing vision, embodied in ’s 2011 budget proposal for NASA, focuses instead on investing in companies like Boeing that want to develop the space equivalent of airlines. NASA would then just buy seats on those rockets to send its astronauts to the International Space Station.Competition, the thinking goes, would drive down the costs of getting to space, leading to a profitable new American industry and freeing more of NASA’s budget for deep-space missions.Advocates of the free enterprise approach are rallying to block the House version of the NASA authorization bill, which provides only $150 million a year over the next three years for the private-sector space travel initiative, which is known as commercial crew.Bob Werb, chairman of the Space Frontier Foundation, was blunt in his assessment of the House bill. “I think it’s awful,” he said. “It’s leaving NASA with way more pork than program. I see that as a disaster for the agency.” Mr. Werb’s group is urging its supporters to register disapproval with their Congressional representatives.By contrast, the president’s budget proposed $6 billion over five years for the commercial crew program.At Wednesday’s news conference, Boeing officials said that the federal government would have to pay much of the development costs in order for the effort to succeed. “This is an uncertain market,” said John Elbon, program manager for Boeing’s commercial crew effort. “If we had to do this with Boeing only and the risk factors were in there, we wouldn’t be able to close the business case.”The tight constraint, of course, is money.Last year, a panel led by Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of , concluded that the ambitious program started under President to establish a permanent base was “not executable” because of inadequate financing. In fact, the panel could not devise any program that could send astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit and still fit within the $100 billion allocated to the human spaceflight program in the fiscal years of 2010 through 2020. It offered several alternatives that would require an extra $30 billion over the next decade.Mr. request for 2011 sought a modest increase in NASA over all, to $19 billion, but kept the budget projections for the human spaceflight program almost unchanged from the levels that the Augustine panel found inadequate. The panel said that without an increase, the United States should scale back its space ambitions.“With that budget,” Mr. Augustine said in an interview this summer, “I still think there is no really meaningful space exploration program that involves humans.”The administration worked around the budget shortfall by proposing the cancellation of the entire moon program, known as Constellation, including the Ares I rocket and the Orion crew capsule. Instead, NASA would essentially take a five-year hiatus from large-scale development initiatives and instead work on new technologies that could make the task of space exploration easier and cheaper.The House Science and Technology Committee, in its effort to squeeze NASA’s human spaceflight program into the budget box, deleted almost all the money from commercial crew and large-scale technology demonstration projects and applied it to slimmed-down Constellation rockets.Last month, the Senate passed its version of the NASA authorization bill, which is more of a compromise. It provides less for commercial crew in the first three years than the president’s request, but the longer-term plan is to provide the same $6 billion, spread over six years instead of five. It cancels the Ares I rocket and instead directs NASA to begin development of a heavy-lift rocket and indicates that the design should be based on space shuttle technologies, a boon for those contractors.However, some experts like Scott Pace, a former NASA official who now heads the Space Policy Institute at , said the Senate bill might be repeating the mistake of asking NASA to do too much with too little money. The Senate bill provides less money for development of a larger heavy-lift rocket than the House does for completing the Ares I, already well under development.“I respect the need for political compromise,” Dr. Pace said of the Senate bill, but added, “It takes some programmatic risk. It spreads itself out too much.”Staff members of the House science committee have been meeting with their counterparts on the Senate’s Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation seeking a middle ground. House leaders could move forward with the science committee’s bill or substitute the Senate bill or a compromise.If no final NASA authorization emerges, the Senate and House appropriation committees would decide what to include in NASA’s 2011 budget and could end up with something closer to the original Obama proposal.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','That ruling concluded that Airbus received the subsidies, including $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates and several billion dollars in grants, to produce its six best-selling models. It also concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times it did,” without the subsidies.Wednesday’s ruling came in a countersuit by the European Union, which contended that Boeing had received nearly $24 billion in subsidies since the 1980s from research and development contracts for space and military agencies and in tax breaks from three states.That assistance, the Europeans argued, had placed Airbus at a competitive disadvantage in the North American market, the world’s second-largest in terms of passenger traffic after the Asia-Pacific region.American and European officials, who spoke anonymously because the ruling was not released publicly, said the W.T.O. panel found that Boeing had received subsidies through some of the research contracts from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon, as well as through tax incentives linked to its facilities in Washington State, Kansas and Illinois.Still, the Americans said that only $2.6 billion of the research money was found to involve subsidies, compared with the more than $10 billion claimed by the European Union. And the trade panel pegged the value of the subsidies provided by the three states at about $400 million, a far lower total than the Europeans had claimed.European officials said the report did not estimate the value of the subsidies that Boeing gained from its military work. Both sides said the panel reiterated an earlier finding that Boeing had received $2.2 billion in export-related aid under a program that was phased out in 2006.Trade officials said the report was more than 1,000 pages, and it was not immediately clear how the panel had decided which research contracts constituted subsidies.European officials had contended in their suit that Boeing was able to take advantage of its research for NASA and the Pentagon to make technological advances in its commercial jets.As a result, France’s transport minister, Dominique Bussereau, and the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said in a statement that they were “extremely satisfied” by the interim findings.But Boeing released a statement Wednesday night saying that the ruling “amounts to a massive rejection” of the European case and maintained that Europe’s low-interest loans to Airbus, known as launch aid, stand “as the single largest and most flagrant illegal subsidy in the aerospace industry.”Some Congressional aides, however, said the panel found that the federal research subsidies gave Boeing an advantage in its early efforts to develop the first commercial jetliner to be made substantially with lightweight carbon composites.Boeing hopes to ride a wave of orders for the plane it developed, the 787 Dreamliner, to retake the lead from Airbus in overall sales. Airbus scrapped its first design for a rival plane, the A350, and is working on a new version that could hit the market in 2013.The trade dispute is also playing out while Boeing and Airbus compete for a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with new aerial refueling tankers. European officials said they hoped the new ruling would undercut Boeing’s complaints that it was facing a subsidized competitor.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','Éric Bosc, a spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry, representing France as plaintiff, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Paris privatized Société Générale in June 1987, selling shares at 407 French francs, then $63, a share. A year later, after a stock market crash, the shares had fallen to 260 francs.In September 1988, the Parisian financier Georges Pébereau sounded out a number investors, including an adviser to Mr. Soros, about joining him in acquiring shares in the bank. Mr. Soros has said that he never spoke directly to Mr. Pébereau about the investment and did not pursue discussions, judging that Mr. Pébereau was not clear in his objectives.That same month, Mr. Soros’s Quantum Fund spent $50 million to buy 160,000 shares of Société Générale as well as shares in three other companies — Suez, Paribas and the Compagnie Générale d’Électricité — which the French government had privatized and whose stock had also tumbled. His defense team contended that this was part of a broader, documented strategy by Mr. Soros of buying shares in recently privatized French companies.In October 1988, Mr Pébereau’s Marceau Investissement built a 9 percent stake in Société Générale and tried to get the bank to agree to a takeover. The bank refused, and the effort was dropped when Société Générale shares surged in December. Mr. Soros has said that he sold all of his shares by November 1988, after he decided that the companies were becoming too politicized.In 1989, France’s stock market watchdog, then known as the Commission des Opérations de Bourse, told prosecutors that it was not able to conclude that Mr. Soros had committed any offense, as insider trading laws were then too imprecise for a conviction. They have been clarified by successive rule changes.Still, legal proceedings continued and Mr. Soros maintained his innocence.In 2005, the Paris appeals court upheld an initial ruling from 2002 that Mr. Soros had broken insider trading laws by purchasing shares of Société Générale knowing that a group of investors was buying shares in the bank. Because of the years it took to bring the case, prosecutors only sought the minimum fine and did not seek restrictions on Mr. Soros's activities in France. The appeals court also confirmed an earlier order that Mr. Soros should pay back €2.2 million, or $2.9 million at current exchange rates, in gains. The fine was later reduced. In 2006, the Cour de Cassation upheld the conviction but quashed the fine, saying the courts had not distinguished between shares bought in Paris and in London, which fell outside their jurisdiction.Having exhausted his legal avenues in France, Mr. Soros appealed to the European court, arguing that he did not break the rules — having acted independently — that the law was vague and that prosecutors took too long to bring him to trial.His lawyers say that the French government’s response shows a lack of legal rigor and that the legislation in question did not comply with European Union directives on insider trading and show that the evidence was tainted.The Paris verdict is the only legal stain on Mr. Soros’s decades in the investment business, and he has been eager to have the ruling overturned. Over the past decade, he has ceased being actively involved in investing and he now focuses on philanthropic activities.The human rights court was established in 1959. It does not rule on the verdicts of the cases before it, but it establishes whether the civil and political rights of individual or state applications, as set out in the European Convention on Human Rights, have been violated.The court did not accept Mr. Soros’s argument that the case should be heard under Article 6 — the right to a fair and speedy trial — or Article 14, which prohibits discrimination.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','Lawmakers in ’s lower house on Wednesday passed President ’s pension overhaul, which includes an increase of the minimum age to 62 from 60, after several days of political cross-fire that ended with a raucous overnight debate.As protesters converged across the River Seine from the National Assembly building, the lawmakers voted 329-233 to approve the bill, clearing a first important legislative hurdle. The upper chamber, the Senate, will begin its debate on Oct. 1.The vote itself had never been in doubt, given Mr. Sarkozy’s comfortable majority in both houses, and the retirement age increase had been approved as a separate measure on Friday. But with the president’s approval rating at record lows and his government under pressure on several fronts, the pension overhaul has taken on symbolic significance for both Mr. Sarkozy and France’s feisty labor unions.Mr. Sarkozy has staked his credibility as a reformer on the pension overhaul, announcing before the summer that this would be his last major measure ahead of the next presidential election in the spring of 2012.He refused to budge on his plan to raise the retirement age — at 62, already a political compromise — after a national strike last week in which more than a million people took to the streets in the biggest show of popular discontent in years. But he offered concessions for people performing grueling jobs or who started work at a young age.“This is one of the most important reforms of this and presidency,” said Jean-François Copé, leader of Mr. Sarkozy’s center-right party in the National Assembly. “It’s about preserving the pension system for our children.”'"
"'10-09-16,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Industrial production rose modestly in August and the manufacturing sector grew for the 12th time in 13 months, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.The Federal Reserve said that output at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities edged up 0.2 percent last month. It rose 0.6 percent in July.Production at factories, the largest single element of industrial production, slowed to 0.2 percent after growing 0.7 percent in July. Much of the softness came from a decline in auto production, which spiked in July. Excluding autos, manufacturing rose 0.5 percent.Production rose for basic consumer goods, like food, clothing and paper, by more than 1 percent. Factories produced 0.7 percent more business equipment in August.Manufacturing has helped drive economic expansion over the last year. Companies built up their stockpiles in the first half of the year after slashing them during the recession. But factory output has slowed in recent months. Businesses are no longer rebuilding their inventories. At the same time, demand for goods remains weak because consumers are saving more and spending with caution.“Consumers have failed to take up the baton,” said Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.'"
"'10-09-16,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — For weeks, North Korea watchers have been eagerly awaiting what would be the biggest political gathering there in decades: an announced meeting of the reclusive state’s ruling Workers’ Party in “early” September to select the party’s top leadership.The first half of the month passed on Wednesday without any sign that the meeting had taken place, intensifying speculation that something was amiss.The meeting would not be routine. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, would be bringing together party delegates in the capital, Pyongyang, for the first time in 30 years. That has generated conjecture that he might use the event to help his third son, Kim Jong-un, make his debut as the country’s future leader.“There are good reasons to suspect that something in Pyongyang went wrong again, and the longer the delay is, the greater the scale of these unknown problems is likely to be,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. “Even if the conference will open among the usual pomp later this week, the inability or unwillingness to convene it as initially scheduled still should not be ignored.”Several analysts cited recent severe floods as a possible factor.Good Friends, a Buddhist relief agency that says it has informants inside North Korea, said in a newsletter on Wednesday that the party meeting had been postponed because flood-damaged roads and communication lines prevented the government from gathering enough delegates.'"

"'10-09-17,'1','Bruce Bueno de Mesquita has been dubbed “the next Nostradamus,” after the 16th-century French apothecary whom some have credited with the ability to predict coming world events.“You’ve developed computer models that allow us to view the future with a greater predictive rate of success than the C.I.A.,” Jon Stewart said last September when Mr. Bueno de Mesquita appeared as a guest on “The Daily Show” to promote his book, “The Predictioneer’s Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and Shape the Future.”But Mr. Bueno de Mesquita, a political science professor at New York University and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, did not foresee one thing: the inadvisability of spending $2.75 million on a 1913 Edwardian house in San Francisco in early 2007 and then spending $400,000 more renovating it.He and his wife needed to move back to New York, so since March Mr. Bueno de Mesquita has been trying to sell their home in the Richmond district amid one of the worst housing crises the state has seen.He has lowered the price four times (from $3.15 million to $2.6 million), but to no avail.Clement Street, San Francisco’s informal Chinatown, is a few blocks away. Kevin Ho, the real estate agent trying to sell the house, realized that its street number, 104, translates into “You Will Die” in Chinese numerology. After paying a $270 fee to City Hall, Mr. Ho won the right to rechristen the house a less-ominous 102.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','Try this equation: The hottest spring and summer in New York City’s history plus the highest consumption of electricity on record equals refunds for Consolidated Edison’s customers.That is, in fact, how the state’s complex system of regulating power prices works. Regulators essentially tell Con Ed how much business it can do, and when it does more, as it did this spring and summer, the company has to refund some of the money it collected.According to the State Public Service Commission, the utility is refunding more than $80 million it received from customers since April. The refunds are coming to all Con Ed customers in two installments, reducing customers’ August and September bills.A Con Ed spokesman said the typical residential customer, defined as someone who used 300 kilowatt-hours in July, would see a refund of $1.31 in August and $4.18 in September. This would reduce that customer’s bills to $73.61 for August and $79.55 for September, the spokesman said.Together, those refunds would repay the excess revenue Con Ed collected from April through July. A refund of excess revenue collected in August is likely to be included in October bills, the spokesman said.The process producing the refunds — a revenue decoupling mechanism — is favored by environmentalists and regulators as a conservation tool because it reduces a utility’s incentive to encourage consumption. But the more energy Con Ed customers consumed during the unusually hot spring and summer, the bigger their refunds will be. The mechanism, which has been in place for only a couple of years, “was put into place to ensure the balance between the cost to provide electricity and the actual amount of revenue collected is maintained,” said Garry Brown, the commission chairman.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','Washington has long seemed like the federal government’s illegitimate child, denied statehood and degrees of autonomy. Congress’s neglect extends to the city’s H.I.V. epidemic, a situation made agonizingly clear in Susan Koch’s quietly unblinking documentary, “The Other City.” The title derives from Washington’s split personality: as the illustrious home of politicians and monuments, and as a metropolis with the highest H.I.V. infection rate in the country.Journalists (Frank Rich of The New York Times, Colbert I. King of The Washington Post); advocates (the writer Larry Kramer); and politicians (Adrian M. Fenty, the mayor of Washington; Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat) offer viewpoints, and the film rolls out disturbing statistics, the most alarming being the city’s increase in reported H.I.V.-AIDS cases from 2006 to 2007: 22 percent.But the most effective voices belong to those with H.I.V., all evincing a visceral sense of mission. J’Mia Edwards is a mother of three struggling to obtain subsidized housing; Ron Daniels is a former drug addict working for a needle-exchange program; José Ramirez is a gay Latino infected at 17, now dedicated to promoting AIDS awareness among teenagers.The film’s most vivid presence is seen but barely able to speak: Jimmy, a gay man in his 30s dying at Joseph’s House, an AIDS hospice. Anyone who has kept a deathbed vigil will relate to his suffering and his family’s, and perhaps arrive at a sense of just how universal this epidemic truly is.Opens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles and Washington.Directed by Susan Koch; written by José Antonio Vargas; director of photography, Neil Barrett; edited by Jeff Werner; music by Charlie Barnett, songs by John Legend; produced by Sheila C. Johnson; released by Cabin Films. In Manhattan at the Chelsea Cinemas, 260 West 23rd Street. Running time: 1 hour 30 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','The Census Bureau’s latest report on poverty and health insurance coverage is bleak. With millions of Americans out of work, it could hardly be otherwise.The record number of people last year without health insurance — 50.7 million, up from 46.3 million in 2008 — provides stark evidence of why the country desperately needs the health care reforms enacted in March. It is also another reminder of why government safety-net programs, despite all of the recent demagoguery, are so essential in times of trouble.The report details the recession’s huge human toll. The number of people living in poverty last year climbed to almost 43.6 million, up from 39.8 million in 2008. The percentage of people living in poverty also climbed — to 14.3 percent, the highest rate since 1994. Poverty was defined as pretax cash income below about $22,000 for a family of four.Federal assistance kept the damage from being even worse. Expanded unemployment benefits helped keep three million families above the poverty line. Food stamps and tax credits helped ease the pain for millions.The driving force for the huge jump in the number of uninsured was a 6.5 million drop in private health care coverage as employers laid off workers or eliminated health benefits. The percentage of people covered by employment-based health insurance dropped to 55.8 percent in 2009 from 58.5 percent the previous year. That is the lowest level of employer coverage since 1987.Again government programs picked up some of the slack. Medicaid, in particular, performed yeoman work, covering many of the laid-off workers with low incomes. That put a further strain on state budgets.The new health reform law will ease these problems. It will greatly expand Medicaid for the poor (mostly at the federal government’s expense) and will provide subsidies to middle-income people to help buy policies on new insurance exchanges. Most of these changes start in 2014, but some measures, such as tax credits to help small businesses cover their employees, will help people retain coverage right now.'"

"'10-09-17,'1','The trade case started in 2005, when the United States complained to the World Trade Organization that European countries had given Airbus more than $20 billion in questionable aid, including $15 billion in low-interest loans to develop its jetliners.Boeing’s supporters cheered last June when a W.T.O. panel finally ruled that Airbus had used the loans, known as launch aid, to steal sales from Boeing. The panel concluded that it “would not have been possible for Airbus to have launched all these models, as originally designed and at the times that it did,” without the subsidies.But European officials countersued, and in a twist, the trade organization issued a preliminary ruling on Wednesday that found that Boeing had received at least $5 billion in federal research contracts and other subsidies that violated trade rules.Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr. , said Thursday he was “heartened” by the decisions. “There was nothing like direct launch aid that was found in their case found in ours, so the proportionality remains pretty significantly different,” he said.But while Mr. Aboulafia agreed with Boeing’s view that the European aid seemed more brazen, he said that the American company would still have a tough time making that case politically.Analysts said Boeing had hoped to use the trade case to block Airbus’s expansion. Both Mr. Aboulafia and Scott Hamilton, who runs the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash., said that Boeing was trying to slow Airbus’s drive to develop a plane to compete with its best-selling new 787 Dreamliner, the first commercial jetliner made substantially from lightweight carbon composites.And Boeing’s supporters have cited the ruling against Airbus in urging the Pentagon to keep it from using subsidies to underbid Boeing for a $35 billion contract for aerial refueling tankers.The W.T.O has no enforcement mechanism, and its findings will have to be settled through talks between United States and European officials.But in the meantime, Airbus has been moving forward with plans to raise several billion dollars in loans from European countries to develop its own plane with fuel-efficient composites, the A350 XWB.“I think there’s a belief by some in the U.S. that there’s the slightest hope in disrupting funding for the A350 XWB,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “And that’s just very unlikely.”The W.T.O. has ruled that the European aid loans would be legal if they were made on commercial terms, and it is not yet clear how the European countries would set the interest rates.But Mr. Hamilton said that with private capital markets constrained by the worldwide economic pressures, “their governments would still be a source of funding that they might not have in the capital markets,” even if the Europeans tied the loans to market rates.European trade officials contend that military research contracts helped Boeing get a head start on the composites. They say that it would be hypocritical to penalize Airbus in the tanker bidding since Boeing also had subsidies.If anything, the stakes seem higher now than in 2005. Problems with suppliers have delayed Boeing’s first Dreamliner by nearly three years, reducing its sales advantage over the A350 XWB.Efforts to resolve the trade dispute could also be complicated by other subsidized competitors.Dreamliner deliveries should start in 2011. Airbus hopes to introduce its plane in 2013. It has also been slowed by cost overruns on new, larger passenger and military models.As Brazil and Canada took over the regional jet markets roughly a decade ago, the W.T.O. ruled that each had improperly subsidized their exports. Now, Bombardier of Canada is building a midsize jetliner. Longer-term threats to Airbus and Boeing are also coming from China and Russia.“If you think this trade dispute is tough, what do you do with an emerging aerospace power that gets all its working capital from the government?” Mr. Aboulafia asked.'"

"'10-09-17,'1','Frank Hugelmeyer, president and chief executive of the Outdoor Industry Association, a trade group, said it was no longer a secret among retailers that New York was “an active city,” especially as the bad economy had many Americans “looking to recreate closer to home.”He said nonprofit groups like Sustainable South Bronx had transformed urban areas into parks, and the city itself, particularly during the Bloomberg administration, had contributed by opening bike lanes and other open spaces. “There’s an incredible infrastructure that’s been built,” Mr. Hugelmeyer said.Will Manzer, chief executive of Eastern Mountain Sports, said he had seen increasing demand from New Yorkers in recent years.“It’s probably one of our top, most vibrant markets,” Mr. Manzer said. “It’s amazing the kind of outdoor business we actually do in Manhattan. We do a lot of gear business, where a lot of people might think we do a lot of apparel.”Sales of bicycles and related equipment in particular, he said, had grown significantly.“Mayor Bloomberg’s my hero — he’s beat a lot of the other leaders of urban areas in bike paths,” Mr. Manzer said. “The economy’s kind of built that trend as a reality. It’s a cheap form of transportation.”Businesses catering to the New Yorkers’ sports whims, including rock-climbing gyms and Chelsea Piers, also helped create demand, as did the needs of traveling New Yorkers, he said, jetting off to helicopter-ski in Argentina or rock-climb in Australia.REI’s 39,000-square-foot space will occupy three stories of the Puck Building at 295 Lafayette Street, in what had been an event space. Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail leasing, marketing and sales division at Prudential Douglas Elliman in New York, which did not work on REI’s lease, said the location was a good one.“SoHo is it,” Ms. Consolo wrote by e-mail. “This customer is much more likely to pack up the kids for a weekend of skiing, or hiking or camping outside the city, than in certain other areas. They also are more likely to use bicycles to get around, so the emphasis on services and repair will quickly endear REI to the community.”In addition to selling equipment, REI will offer trips and educational programs as it does at its other retail stores. REI Outdoor School will run instructional programs outside of the store, like rock climbing in a local park or bicycle riding lessons for adults.Mountaineers or explorers will visit the store to give lectures, and REI Adventures will offer longer trips, like a three-day kayaking outing on the Hudson. It will also offer bike repair, both a quick drop-in service and a full-service bike shop.REI’s arrival is likely to set off fierce competition for the outdoor dollar.Although some sports retailers have stronger New York roots — Modell’s Sporting Goods opened in 1889 on Cortlandt Street, and Paragon Sports has been around since 1908 — Mr. Manzer said he considered Eastern Mountain Sports “New York’s outdoor outfitter.” The retailer, based in Peterborough, N.H., has been in the city since 1983.Mr. Manzer said he received an e-mail Wednesday night from Ms. Jewell telling him about REI’s SoHo plans.“She’s kind of a newcomer from the West,” he said, “so she’ll kind of have to Yankee up, if you will, but she’s good people.”'"
"'10-09-17,'1','Migration within the 27 nations of the European Union has become a combustible issue during the economic downturn. The union’s latest expansion, which brought in the relatively poor nations of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007, has renewed concern that the poor, traveling far from home in search of work, will become a burden on wealthier countries. The migration of the Roma is also raising questions about the obligations of Romania and Bulgaria to fulfill promises they made when they joined the union. Romania, for instance, mapped out a strategy for helping the Roma, but financed little of it. Mr. Sarkozy has demanded that the Romanian government do more to aid the Roma at home.Much of Western Europe has reacted with hostility to itinerant Roma, who often have little education or practical skills. Some Roma have found marginal jobs collecting scrap iron or painting houses. But others have signed up for welfare or drifted into begging and petty thievery, living in unsightly camp sites.In recent weeks, Mr. Sarkozy has tried to revive his support on the political right by deporting thousands of them, offering 300 euros, about $392, to those who go home voluntarily, and bulldozing their encampments.The European Commission has threatened legal action against Paris over the deportation, calling it disgraceful and illegal.The dispute peaked at lunch Thursday between Mr. Sarkozy and José Manuel Barroso, the president of the commission, the European Union’s executive body.“There was a big argument — I could also say a scandal — between the president of the European Commission and the French president,” said the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borisov, according to the Bulgarian daily Dnevnik.Mr. Sarkozy denied a major rift, and remained unswayed. “We will continue to dismantle the illegal camps, whoever is there,” he said at a news conference. “Europe cannot close its eyes to illegal camps.”Expulsions seem unlikely to offer a long-term solution. Many of the deported Roma are already planning their return.Privately, some Romanian officials snicker over the French action. “They are just giving the Roma a paid vacation,” one official said.Still, advocates for the Roma hope that the latest conflict will force the European Union to get serious about helping the Roma, who are openly reviled in most Eastern and Central European countries where they have lived in large numbers for centuries, most often under appalling conditions.“There is nothing to focus the minds of policy makers like an army of poor people heading your way,” said Bernard Rorke, the director of Roma Initiatives for the nonprofit Open Society Foundation.There is little reliable data on the Roma population. Originally from India, the Roma were virtual slaves until the 19th century, working for aristocrats and in monasteries.When democracy took hold, they were freed. But they were landless, uneducated and dark-skinned, and they had few prospects.Human rights activists say that Roma women are often sent to separate maternity wards. Their children, when they attend school, are frequently steered into classes for the mentally handicapped.In Romania, one census counted 500,000 Roma. But some advocates say the number is closer to two million.Those who make it out of abject poverty rarely admit their ancestry — a factor that makes it harder for Roma to combat the discrimination they face, advocates say.In the years that Romania was negotiating to get into the European Union, it promised programs to help the Roma integrate into Romanian society.But government officials concede that few materialized. “I think you will see the current administration do better,” said Ilie Dinca, the director of the Romanian National Agency for Roma.Budget cutbacks have hurt the few successful efforts that exist. Hundreds of mediators hired to help the Roma get their children into school and receive health benefits have been fired recently.“What you see here these days is terrible conditions,” said Nicolae Stoica, who runs Roma Access, an advocacy group. “They have no hope of getting jobs. If they get 20 euros a month from collecting scrap metal, that’s a lot. How can we tell them not to go to France and beg on the streets?”Flortina Ghita, 21, said her family once lived in a building in the center of Constanta, Romania’s second largest city. But city officials evicted them, saying the buildings had structural damage. The family now lives in shacks made of carpets, scraps of corrugated tin and plastic sheeting set up not far from railroad tracks. The only source of water is a train station more than a mile away.Mrs. Ghita said her family had been told to fill out forms to get housing, but no one can read. Her son, Sorim, 5, is not in school, she said, because she cannot afford the clothing, notebooks and class fees.Still, the Ghita family was savvy enough about Europe. Mrs. Ghita had paperwork showing that her mother had been to Belgium for medical care. “Her sister lives there and she helped us,” Mrs. Ghita said.Experts say the Roma population has been battered by a combination of factors. Crafts that once sustained them, such as making brass pots and shoeing horses, are now obsolete. Recent European regulations standardizing the sale of livestock pushed them out of one of their few remaining businesses because they could not handle the required paperwork.Some aspects of Gypsy culture have not helped matters, experts say. It is a clannish, strongly patriarchal society where youngsters are pushed into early marriage and education has not been much valued.Not all Roma are poor, however. In the village of Barbulesti, about 40 miles northeast of Bucharest, there are signs of success. The village is a bright cluster of mustard- and ketchup-colored houses, with gaudy turrets and ornate gutters, many still under construction.The village has a Roma mayor, Ion Cutitaru, 59, the only one in the country, he says. He estimates that a third of the village’s 7,000 residents have moved to Western Europe. They look for work there, he says, but beg when they can find nothing else.“They make do,” he said, “and then they come back and build their houses.”Twenty-eight Roma residents from Barbulesti were recently expelled from France. Among them was Ionel Costache, 30, who said he would return to France in a week or two.“My son, who had eye problems, he got a 7,000-euro operation there that he would never have gotten here. And when you don’t have work, you can still eat with their social assistance,” he said. “France is a much better place than Romania.”'"
"'10-09-17,'1','Others hoping for a comeback include Gabe Nechamkin, a former trader for George Soros, and John W. Meriwether, whose Long-Term Capital Management failed spectacularly in 1998. Mr. Nechamkin is on his second fund, Mr. Meriwether his third.Not everyone will get a second or third chance. Hedge funds, whose outsize returns — and paydays — defined an era of Wall Street riches, are in the midst of a painful shakeout.Over the last two and a half years, investors have withdrawn nearly $320 billion from these private investment pools, leaving the industry’s combined assets at $1.5 trillion, according to data from BarclayHedge.Small funds have been hit hardest. Since their number worldwide peaked at 12,000 in 2007, it has fallen to about 8,400, according to research from the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles.The industry as a whole struggled in 2008 and 2009, and this year is not looking much better. For the year through the end of August, the average hedge fund was down 1.4 percent, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. Investors are increasingly asking themselves whether they would be better off putting their money in a low-cost index fund. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is up 0.5 percent.Given that showing, nearly half of the hedge funds included in the Hedge Fund Research Index have been running below the levels they need to attain to earn their rich performance fees for the last three years. (Hedge funds typically charge a management fee of 1 to 2 percent and take a 20 percent cut of profits provided they pass performance milestones known as high water marks.)“It’s a pretty crowded field with very high fees,” said Todd Buchholz, a former managing director at Tiger Management, the hedge fund firm run by Julian H. Robertson Jr.“I don’t see that this is the death or the last gasp of hedge funds, but there is certainly a shaking out going on here,” said Mr. Buchholz, who now oversees a real estate hedge fund called Two Oceans. Some managers are closing underperforming or money-losing funds and trying to persuade their old investors, plus some new ones, to provide new capital.These funds face two challenges, however. Many have to agree to make up past losses before earning a performance fee from their previous investors — if those investors return at all.Most also have to indicate to investors that they have learned their lessons and that the investment strategies of their new funds — at least on the surface — will address past problems.Jeffrey Gendell’s firm, Tontine Capital Partners, averaged returns of 38 percent from 1997 to 2007. Tontine Capital oversaw $7 billion before it closed two funds that had lost more than two-thirds of their value in 2008; a few months later, in 2009, Mr. Gendell opened a new hedge fund.The new fund, Mr. Gendell said in a letter to investors, would invest only in easy-to-trade securities and would not use leverage, or borrowed money, to improve its returns. Mr. Gendell vowed he would not collect performance fees until investors had recouped their previous losses. A spokesman said Mr. Gendell declined to comment.It is unclear whether Mr. Nechamkin and Mr. Meriwether, neither of whom returned a call, are using new and improved strategies or offering to make legacy investors whole before collecting new performance fees.The looming question for these and other managers is whether investors are willing to forgive and forget.Hedge fund managers and their employees are reluctant to discuss their attempted comebacks. One individual who worked at a fund that closed and is now trying to raise money for a new fund said many in the industry were trying to play up their past success, rather than their recent losses.“It creates a weird dynamic,” this person said, who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize the new fund. “You want to be part of the good, but not part of the bad.”For Mr. Pallotta, whose Raptor funds had more than $12 billion in assets at their height, there were a lot of good years.Mr. Pallotta — who recently built a 27,000-square-foot home in one of Boston’s wealthiest enclaves — posted average annual returns of 19.2 percent in the 15 years he worked for the billionaire Paul Tudor Jones and five years before that at Essex Investment Management.Raptor was spun out of Tudor Investments in late 2008, after the fund lost 20 percent. Turning in a flat performance in the first few months of 2009, Mr. Pallotta shut the fund n that June, telling investors in a letter that he had doubts about “the sustainability of certain aspects of the industry’s structure and short-term focus.”With his new fund, Mr. Pallotta is going back to Square 1, recreating the conditions that he had at the start of his career, said a person with knowledge of the fund, who declined to be named because of continuing efforts to raise capital.Using a small team and focusing on a small number of securities, Mr. Pallotta is not looking to become a megafund for now, this person said. So far, Mr. Pallotta has won back some old investors, as well as new ones. But he will not earn a performance fee on the new fund until previous investors recoup their losses.As Mr. Berry put it: “If he’s passionate about investing and doesn’t mind working with a smaller capital base for a while and wants to prove to investors he’s still got it, then he’ll do fine.”'"
"'10-09-17,'1','“There is a land of opportunity still left in America,” Mr. Perry said. “It’s called Texas.”Mr. White has done his best to undermine Mr. Perry’s claim to having steered the state to prosperity with a tight hand on the fiscal reins. Unemployment here is lower than the national average, but at 8.2 percent the rate is still twice what it was in 2008 and higher than at any point since 1986.The governor also balanced the budget in 2009 with the help of stimulus money from Washington, the same money that Mr. Perry now complains should never have been appropriated, Mr. White has pointed out.Mr. White has also attacked the governor’s character, calling him a “career politician” who oversees “a political machine.” He has pointed out that Mr. Perry has been living in a $10,000-a-month apartment since the governor’s mansion was destroyed by an arsonist in 2008. Mr. White has needled Mr. Perry for the size and cost of his security detail.And Mr. White has also resurrected accusations that the governor has made some of his friends wealthy with state largess over his nine years in office, and has questioned Mr. Perry’s use of public funds to entice large corporations to Texas.Mr. Perry has avoided committing to a debate, saying he will not agree to one until Mr. White releases his tax returns from the 1990s. “Bill White is hiding something on his tax returns,” he said Thursday.Mr. White called the request absurd, pointing out that he has disclosed tax returns for all his years in elected office and his financial disclosure statements from his years as a deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Mr. Perry, he asserts, is dodging a debate to avoid being held accountable for the state’s budget woes, among other things.The debate over the debate ended in a stalemate this week, and it looks unlikely that a debate will ever be held, both sides now say.Whether Mr. White’s punches are landing is hard to gauge, political strategists and pollsters say. Some Republican strategists say the race has tightened only because Mr. White’s campaign, and a Democratic group called Back to Basics, have been advertising since July, often with negative messages, while Mr. Perry put his first television advertisements on the air this week.Though one advertisement was a positive spot boasting of job growth during Mr. Perry’s tenure, three others are attack ads, claiming Mr. White had profited from decisions he made during Hurricane Rita and criticizing his handling of the Houston budget. “Obama and White. Washington-style spending,” says the announcer in one ad. On Thursday, the governor also painted Mr. White as a “liberal trial lawyer” who is soft on gun rights.“Once the Rick Perry machine kicks into gear, they are very, very good and at what they do and they are going to tear Bill White apart,” said Mark Sanders, a Republican strategist from East Texas. “He’s an easy target.”Some political scientists say, however, that Mr. Perry has never enjoyed widespread popularity, and it appears some of the general anti-incumbent sentiment is affecting him. Republicans, after all, control all the statewide offices and the Legislature here.“The Republican campaign narrative nationally is that the people running government are doing a bad job of it,” said Jim Henson, a political scientist and pollster at the University of Texas. “Perry’s message is ideologically consistent with this, but the Republicans here run all the offices.”Democratic strategists, meanwhile, are not yet running to the betting windows to put big money down on a victory. But some are saying the governor appears more vulnerable than had been predicted.“Mr. White is an underdog, but he’s not a far-away underdog,” said Glenn Smith, who managed the campaign of the last Democrat to win in Texas, Ann Richards, in 1990. “This could be a far more competitive World Series than people think.”'"
"'10-09-17,'1','“Every dollar of capital is one less dollar working in the economy,” the roundtable added.The banks would like us to forget that it was undercapitalized financial institutions that got us into this mess. They created a shadow financial system that could make loans with far less capital than even the inadequate amount the regulations then in effect demanded. They hid their risks off their balance sheets even though, when push came to shove, they still were liable for the losses.Now, however, their mantra is that the only way to revive the economy is for regulators to refrain from imposing tough rules.There are competing academic papers now circulating on this issue. The Bank for International Settlements, the central bankers’ central bank and the parent body of the Basel accords, released one study this summer that concluded there would be minor short-term reductions in economic activity stemming from tougher capital rules, but that in the longer run the effect would be minimal. Bankers see worse effects, but, of course, they assume that what happened in 2008 will never happen again.Another paper, by three academics from Stanford and one from the Max Planck Institute for Research on Collective Goods in Bonn, Germany, concluded that the bankers’ arguments ignored the social costs of bailouts. “The bottom line is that leverage is not essential to any of the functions of the bank that create value,” said Anat R. Admati, a Stanford professor and one of the authors. Capital requirements, she added, “should be increased dramatically.”In the Basel deliberations, which led to the decision to punt some issues and to stretch out needed capital increases for many years, the split seems to have been between the really major financial centers — whose regulators have learned a lesson and now want tough regulations — and the others.That split makes sense. In the world we were in a few years ago, we now know, the bankers could take excessive risks and reap the profits until the risks came home to roost. Then governments would take the losses via bailouts needed to avert financial collapse.That worked well for bankers and for those who lent money to the banks, if not for their shareholders. But governments with very large financial systems learned that the costs could be excessive. Ireland now has a bailout bill it may not have the capacity to pay.The proponents of tougher capital standards are said to have been the United States, Britain and Switzerland. Those are also the homes to the largest banks and the countries with the most to lose if another crisis blows up.Other European countries and Japan were much less worried. Germany has a large group of state-owned banks that will need more capital, and it pushed to delay as long as possible. Some other countries, like France, have long supported whatever their banks wanted, whether it was weak capital rules or accounting standards that would let them hide losses.It is now up to the major regulators to forge ahead and impose tough standards. In doing that, they will face the threat of two types of “regulatory arbitrage.” The first comes from bank threats to move their headquarters to another country, something British banks have warned they will do if they are taxed too heavily. The countries need to keep that in mind, but they also need to be willing to stand up to it. Will investors seek a premium interest rate when lending to a bank that obviously fled strong regulation? If so, the potential for such arbitrage is reduced.The second type of arbitrage is what happened in the last cycle. That was the siphoning of financial activity out of the regulated financial system and into the shadow banking system.That may not be as easy to do this time around. The Dodd-Frank financial regulations in the United States and the new Basel requirements both have provisions aimed at reducing the capital advantages of lending through the securitization market. The accounting rules have been — belatedly — changed to make it much harder to hide obligations off bank balance sheets. And for now at least, burned investors show little desire to finance new private securitizations.In the end, though, the ability of the banking system to avoid a new crisis will depend in part on whether regulators are able to keep up with financial innovations — which are often created primarily to avoid capital restraints — and willing to step in even when things seem to be going well and when bankers warn, as they do now, that more regulation will damage the economy.Some such innovations will nonetheless slip by, and credit standards will slip again. There is likely to be a new and different financial crisis well before the new Basel rules are fully phased in.Then the question will be twofold. First, have the new rules left banks with enough capital to withstand the crisis? For some, the answer will be they have not. But it does not make much difference to the national economy, let alone the world economy, if a small bank in Boise goes under. It is what regulatory jargon now calls the Sifis, standing for “systemically important financial institutions” and pronounced something like “sissies,” that really matter.So the second question is, what will happen to the Sifis? The Dodd-Frank law requires the Federal Reserve to come up with stronger regulations for them, and grants it the authority to apply the label to companies other than banks and to then regulate them. How well the Fed does that may determine whether the next crisis proves to be as debilitating as the recent one was.That is why the response this week from the Financial Services Roundtable — an organization whose members include all the American Sifis — was so disheartening. To say that “every dollar of capital is one less dollar working in the economy,” is to ignore the lessons of the recent past.As I thought about it, I recalled an exchange I had in business school nearly three decades ago. A fellow student, having taken classes I had not yet encountered, was spouting what sounded like nonsense to me.Having learned of the tax deductibility of interest payments on borrowed money, and of the fact that return on equity would rise if a company could spread the profits over as small an equity base as possible, he announced that companies should borrow all the money they could. Having a strong balance sheet was, he said, stupid.What, I asked, if they went so far into debt that they went bankrupt?Well, he responded after thinking it over, they should stop just short of borrowing enough to leave them broke.In the real world, it is never easy to know just how much that may be.If your corner dry cleaner borrows too much, the impact on the economy is negligible and there is little reason for the government to try to prevent it.But the collapse of Lehman Brothers two years ago this week showed the systemic impact of allowing a major financial institution to become dangerously overleveraged. Whatever the hesitations of politicians in Paris and Tokyo, regulators in Washington, London and Zurich must act to prevent a recurrence. If that means rules that are tougher than those in other countries, so be it.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','The campaign against California’s greenhouse gas law comes as business groups have invested heavily across the country in trying to defeat members of Congress who voted for a bill that also mandated emission reductions; the bill passed the House but failed in the Senate in the face of strong opposition from lawmakers in industrial states.Traditionally, public support for environmental measures suffers during tough economic times. Here in California, backers of the initiative have seized on that — which is particularly acute in this state, with its 12.3 percent unemployment rate — in search of a victory.“I believe the battle over cap and trade in America is taking place in California on Nov. 2 of this year,” said Dan Logue, a Republican assemblyman from north-central California who wrote the ballot initiative. He added: “What we’re saying is, this is not the time for political correctness. This is a time for putting America back to work; let the experiments happen later.”The law in question, known as A.B. 32, mandates slashing carbon and other greenhouse emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, by forcing power companies and industries to cap their emissions and by slashing carbon in gasoline. Some oil industry leaders said it would force them to invest millions of dollars to comply, and asserted that it would force companies to cut jobs and raise the price of gas at the pumps.Although the vast majority of the money being contributed to fight the law is coming from oil companies, the oil industry is clearly not united in opposition: some major California oil refineries, including , have notably stayed out of the battle so far.The ballot initiative, known as Proposition 23, would suspend the law from going into effect as scheduled in 2012 until state unemployment falls to 5.5 percent or lower for at least four consecutive quarters. That has happened only three times over the last 40 years, state officials said; thus, the proposition could have the practical effect of killing the law.“The company believes that implementing A.B. 32 will cause significant job losses and higher energy costs in California,” said Katie Stavinoha, a spokesman for Flint Hills Resources, the petroleum company in Wichita, Kan., owned by the Koch brothers. “What’s more, the company thinks it sets a bad precedent for other state and federal governments to do the same thing.”That said, the issue hardly breaks cleanly along business lines, reflecting in part the diverse business environment in California, which has always had a strong research and development sector, powered by venture capitalists ready to finance cutting-edge technology. Many business groups have opposed the drive to suspend the greenhouse law, and the list of contributors backing the measure is notable for the absence of venture capitalists.“There is a huge clean energy revolution going on: this is going to happen,” said Thomas F. Steyer, founder of Farallon Capital Management, a hedge fund in , and a co-chairman with Mr. Shultz of the campaign to defeat the proposition. “If we’re not careful, it’s just not going to happen in the .”Mr. Steyer has contributed $2.5 million to the effort to defeat the initiative and said he was prepared to contribute an additional $2.5 million.Mr. Schultz said that since the passage of the law, “a whole industry is developing here, and I might say a lot of jobs are connected with it.”“There’s been a virtual eruption of research and development activities of all kinds on alternate ways to produce and use energy,” he said.In most years, this should not be a worrisome battleground for environmentalists. The greenhouse gas law enjoyed strong support from the public when it passed four years ago, according to polls. The roster of opponents to Proposition 23 includes Gov. , a Republican, who views the law as a defining accomplishment of his career here.Early polling suggests that voters who know about the measure are evenly split.Yet supporters said they were concerned that the proposition could slip through at a time when Democratic spirits are low. More significant is the question of how much more supporters of Prop 23 can raise to finance their campaign. Of the $8.2 million raised so far, $1 million came from the Koch firm, $4 million from the and $1.5 million from the Corporation; both corporations are based in San Antonio.“We have every reason to believe that they are going to put the money in to run a big television campaign in the most expensive media market in the country,” said Annie Notthoff, the California advocacy director for the , an environmental group. “We certainly are expecting to have a fight on our hands.”Supporters of the law, if nervous about the proposition, remain optimistic than they can beat it back at the polls in November, and hope that such an outcome would have the opposite effect nationally that opponents of the bill are seeking. “If the proposition loses, the lesson is going to be there’s no going back,” said Wesley P. Warren, director of programs for the Natural Resources Defense Council.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','The painting first surfaced in 2007 at an exhibition in Paris. While most Arcimboldo’s portraits show heads in profile, this painting is a three-quarter view.In the upper right-hand corner, where bark has peeled away from a branch, the artist signed the painting as he did many others: Arcimboldus F. The F stands for “fecit,” the Latin word for “made this.” Scholars had recorded the signature as “Arcimboldus P,” meaning pinxit, Latin for “painted this,” but when Mr. Brown examined the signature with a magnifying glass this week he disproved their findings.When the exhibition opens at the National Gallery, “Four Seasons in One Head” will be the first work visitors will see. It will be hung next to a group of Leonardo drawings, Mr. Brown said, adding, “It’s the most Leonardesque of all his works.”Prime examples of early Pop Art — works from the 1960s by masters like Warhol and Lichtenstein — are always in demand, no matter the economy. And this fall Sotheby’s is selling two important Pop paintings in its contemporary art sale in New York on Nov. 9. An image of a single Coca-Cola bottle that Warhol painted in 1962 will be featured on the sale catalog’s front cover and a glass of bubbling soda from the same year by Lichtenstein will be on the back. When they’re side by side, it almost looks as if the Coke has been poured into the glass.“The synchronicity is amazing,” Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby’s contemporary art department, said on Tuesday, both canvases occupying a wall in his office. “Pop works like this speak a global language.”In “POPism,” Warhol’s memoir of the ’60s, written with Pat Hackett, the artist describes the documentary filmmaker Emile de Antonio looking at “Coca-Cola [4] [Large Coca-Cola],” at the Factory and calling it remarkable, adding that its image is “our society, it’s who we are, it’s absolutely beautiful and naked.”The painting was bought by the collectors Michael and Elizabeth Rea at a Christie’s auction in 1983 for $143,000. Now Mrs. Rea is selling it (her husband died in 1996), and Sotheby’s expects the work to bring $20 million to $25 million.“Ice Cream Soda” was one of Lichtenstein’s cartoonlike images, this one a blue-and-white canvas of a frothy glass of soda. The New York collector Myron Orlofsky bought the painting from a show at the Leo Castelli Gallery the year it was made. He died, but it has stayed in his family. Sotheby’s expects it to bring $12 million to $18 million.YouTube may be interested in putting videos in museums, what with the initiative it announced with the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and Intel in June. AOL, however, is using art to enhance its identity.“It’s the new normal,” Maureen Sullivan, AOL’s senior vice president for brand marketing, said of the company’s latest round of art projects. “Technology has empowered consumers who expect to be wowed.”AOL’s new advertising campaign features images of personalities like Alec Baldwin, taken by Chuck Close. And its home page has become a rotating gallery of sorts, with artwork appearing behind the corporate logo every time a new visitor goes to the site. Click on it and users can “meet the artist,” as the Web site puts it, directing them to AOL Artists, a page with information about that artist.This initiative began at the end of last year when the company formally split from Time Warner. “That’s when we rebranded,” Ms. Sullivan said. And that’s when the 14 million people who use AOL every day began seeing the artwork. About 892,000 visitors went to that part of its site in August alone. AOL is about to introduce its third collection of artwork. AOL is also awarding 25 artists $25,000 each as part of a grant program, “25 for 25,” that it hopes will support the next generation of creative thinkers. The jury choosing the winners will include Robert Storr, dean of the Yale University School of Art, and Adam D. Weinberg, director of the Whitney Museum of American Art.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','The percentage of Americans struggling below the poverty line in 2009 was the highest it has been in 15 years, the Census Bureau reported Thursday, and interviews with poverty experts and aid groups said the increase appeared to be continuing this year.With the country in its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, four million additional Americans found themselves in poverty in 2009, with the total reaching 44 million, or one in seven residents. Millions more were surviving only because of expanded unemployment insurance and other assistance.And the numbers could have climbed higher: One way embattled Americans have gotten by is sharing homes with siblings, parents or even nonrelatives, sometimes resulting in overused couches and frayed nerves but holding down the rise in the national poverty rate, according to the report.The share of residents in poverty climbed to 14.3 percent in 2009, the highest level recorded since 1994. The rise was steepest for children, with one in five affected, the bureau said.The report provides the most detailed picture yet of the impact of the recession and unemployment on incomes, especially at the bottom of the scale. It also indicated that the temporary increases in aid provided in last year’s stimulus bill eased the burdens on millions of families.For a single adult in 2009, the poverty line was $10,830 in pretax cash income; for a family of four, $22,050.Given the depth of the recession, some economists had expected an even larger jump in the poor.“A lot of people would have been worse off if they didn’t have someone to move in with,” said Timothy M. Smeeding, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin.Dr. Smeeding said that in a typical case, a struggling family, like a mother and children who would be in poverty on their own, stays with more prosperous parents or other relatives.The Census study found an 11.6 percent increase in the number of such multifamily households over the last two years. Included in that number was James Davis, 22, of Chicago, who lost his job as a package handler for Fed Ex in February 2009. As he ran out of money, he and his 2-year-old daughter moved in with his mother about a year ago, avoiding destitution while he searched for work.Danise Sanders, 31, and her three children have been sleeping in the living room of her mother and sister’s one-bedroom apartment in San Pablo, Calif., for the last month, with no end in sight. They doubled up after the bank foreclosed on her landlord, forcing her to move.“It’s getting harder,” said Ms. Sanders, who makes a low income as a mail clerk. “We’re all pitching in for rent and bills.”There are strong signs that the high poverty numbers have continued into 2010 and are probably still rising, some experts said, as the recovery sputters and unemployment remains near 10 percent.“Historically, it takes time for poverty to recover after unemployment starts to go down,” said LaDonna Pavetti, a welfare expert at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group in Washington.Dr. Smeeding said it seemed almost certain that poverty would further rise this year. He noted that the increase in unemployment and poverty had been concentrated among young adults without college educations and their children, and that these people remained at the end of the line in their search for work.One indirect sign of continuing hardship is the rise in food stamp recipients, who now include nearly one in seven adults and an even greater share of the nation’s children. While other factors as well as declining incomes have driven the rise, by mid-2010 the number of recipients had reached 41.3 million, compared with 39 million at the beginning of the year.“We’re seeing more younger people coming in that not only don’t have any food, but nowhere to stay,” said Marla Goodwin, director of Jeremiah’s Food Pantry in East St. Louis, Ill. The pantry was open one day a month when it opened in 2008 but expanded this year to five days a month.And Texas food banks said they distributed 14 percent more food in the second quarter of 2010 than in the same period last year.The Census report showed increases in poverty for whites, blacks and Hispanic Americans, with historic disparities continuing. The poverty rate for non-Hispanic whites was 9.4 percent, for blacks 25.8 percent and for Hispanics 25.3 percent. The rate for Asians was unchanged at 12.5 percent.'"
"'10-09-17,'1','But the reports reflect aggregates of different parts in the economy, so consumer prices could still rise in some contexts.“Just because the total doesn’t show dislocation, it does not mean things are calm under the surface,” Mr. Creatura said. “It is possible to have deflation in housing offsetting inflation in commodities, and that could result in what appears to be benign C.P.I. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt when you get to the checkout in the supermarket.”With the risk of inflation below the Federal Reserve’s implicit goal of 2 percent, some officials had expressed concern that the economy could enter a period of falling wages and prices. Last month, the Federal Reserve, signaling its worries about the risk of deflation, voted to use proceeds from its mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasuries to bolster the economy.Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said with the year-on-year core consumer price index falling, and less subject to the volatility of raw materials prices than the producer index, deflation was still a “big question mark.”“We are in an interesting no man’s land with inflation and deflation,” he said. “We will probably skirt deflation, but just barely.”In another report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said that the current-account trade deficit increased to $123.3 billion in the second quarter, a 12.9 percent increase from the first three months of the year. The current account is the broadest measure of America’s international trade, tracking the flow of goods and services as well as investments.Exports in the quarter totaled $316.1 billion, a 3.4 percent rise from the previous quarter, while imports grew to $485.7 billion in the quarter, up 6.3 percent.Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight, said he had forecast a 1 percent increase for the broader index in the producer price report because of the increase in gasoline prices in August compared with July. “I do not place a lot of significance in that because gasoline prices have come down since then,” he said.But he said it was likely the economy would go through a prolonged period of very low inflation, with depressed use in industry and unemployment.Analysts and economists have been sifting through economic figures that have suggested a sluggish economy, with gross domestic product revised down to an annual growth rate of 1.6 percent, unemployment of 9.6 percent and a weak housing market.In addition to the producer prices, new figures on weekly initial jobless claims, which fell last month to their lowest level since July, were released on Thursday.The Labor Department said Thursday that new claims for jobless benefits fell by 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 450,000. It was the third decline in four weeks, and defied economists’ expectations of an increase to 459,000.The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s survey of regional business conditions was released, suggesting nearly flat manufacturing activity in September.It said for the second consecutive month, companies in the Philadelphia region, which covers Delaware, eastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, reported a decline in new orders and shipments, and although employment levels held steady, companies reported declines in average work hours. The index of current activity was on an upward trend of minus 0.7 in September from minus 7.7 in August.John Lonski, a chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets, said the reports, and concerns over sliding home prices, were likely to capture much of the financial market focus on Thursday.“I think it would be a surprise if the P.P.I. boosted fears of price deflation,” he said. “We are not there quite yet.”'"
"'10-09-17,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea has proposed military talks with South Korea to discuss border disputes, the South Korean Defense Ministry said on Thursday, in another sign that the North is reaching out to its rival after months of acrimony.North Korea on Wednesday proposed working-level military talks to discuss preventing naval clashes along the disputed western sea border, ministry officials said. Another topic the North said it wanted to discuss was leaflets sent across the border by South Korean activists that urged North Koreans to rise up against their leader, Kim Jong-il.Relations between the Koreas have cooled since President Lee Myung-bak took office in Seoul in early 2008. They deteriorated further after a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, sank in March near the disputed border, in what Seoul and Washington say was a North Korean torpedo attack. Forty-six sailors were killed. The North denied the accusation and demonstrated its displeasure by firing artillery in the border waters.In recent weeks, however, the North has made some conciliatory gestures. It freed the crew of a seized South Korean fishing boat and offered to resume reunions of families separated by the Korean War. Officials from the Koreas were scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss the reunions.South Korea has welcomed the moves and responded by offering humanitarian aid for the victims of severe floods in North Korea.'"
"'10-09-18,'0','Soon, in September 1969, Mr. Stoll drove Mr. Bond-Upson and two others in his Volkswagen Fastback to the La Foret conference center in Colorado Springs to attend a convention of about 100 college-age Unitarians.“On the second or third night of the conference,” according to Mr. Bond-Upson, “after dinner, Jim got up to speak. He told us that he’d been doing a lot of hard thinking that summer. Jim told us he could no longer live a lie. He’d been hiding his nature — his true self — from everyone except his closest friends. ‘If the revolution we’re in means anything,’ he said, ‘it means we have the right to be ourselves, without shame or fear.’“Then he told us he was gay, and had always been gay, and it wasn’t a choice, and he wasn’t ashamed anymore and that he wasn’t going to hide it anymore, and from now on he was going to be himself in public. After he concluded, there was a dead silence, then a couple of the young women went up and hugged him, followed by general congratulations. The few who did not approve kept their peace.”Mr. Stoll was not the first openly gay minister. He had been preceded by at least one man, the Rev. Troy Perry, who the previous year had founded the Metropolitan Community Churches in Los Angeles. That denomination, which has straight members but has always specialized in ministry to queer communities, now claims 43,000 members in 22 countries.But Mr. Stoll was a minister of an established denomination — a liberal one, often so diverse as to seem post-Christian, but nonetheless one with Christian roots. As such, he brought gay rights to the heterosexual Christian world. Over the next year, newly emboldened, Mr. Stoll wrote articles about gay rights and delivered guest sermons at several churches.In July 1970, at their general assembly in Seattle, Unitarians passed a resolution condemning discrimination against homosexuals and bisexuals. Other churches soon liberalized, too. In 1972, for example, the United Church of Christ ordained an openly gay man, and today there are openly gay Episcopal priests and Lutheran ministers.Having pioneered an important change in American Christianity, Mr. Stoll never returned to the ministry. In fact, it seems that he could not. According to letters kept at Harvard, sent in 1970 between church members and Unitarian officials, Mr. Stoll had been suspected of drug use and of inappropriate sexual advances toward young people in the Kennewick congregation. The circumstances of his departure made it unlikely he would find another pulpit.Over the next 25 years, Mr. Stoll had a varied career. He worked as a substance abuse counselor, started a hospice on Maui, in Hawaii, and served as secretary of the San Francisco chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.“He died on Dec. 8, 1994,” Mr. Bond-Upson said in his 2005 sermon, “a little short of age 59. He died not of AIDS, but of worn-out heart and lungs. He was never able to lose much weight, nor quit smoking. When it was known he was dying, a stream of friends came to say goodbye.

Colorado’s native lynx died out in the early 1970s because of trapping, poisoning and development. The state Division of Wildlife began reintroducing them in the San Juan Mountains by releasing lynx that were captured in Alaska and Canada. At least 141 have been born in Colorado, including 14 this year. No estimate is available for the state’s total lynx population, partly because these animals live in remote wilderness areas.

"'10-09-18,'0','Is there more than one dog in the race for New York governor?Some New Yorkers have already met Duke, a pit bull belonging to Carl P. Paladino, the Buffalo millionaire and Republican nominee for governor.Technically a British Staffordshire bull terrier, Duke, 5, belonged to Mr. Paladino’s son, who died in a car accident last year. The dog is now a regular on the campaign trail, where his breed (if not his behavior) has made him a mascot for Mr. Paladino’s gruff antagonism to the Albany powers-that-be.On Thursday, when asked if he had a dog of his own, Mr. Paladino’s Democratic opponent, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, said he was, unfortunately, dogless. “I have had many pets in the past,” Mr. Cuomo told reporters. “I have had both dogs and cats in the past. At this point in my life, I am without pet. I’m not happy about it, but I am.”Mr. Cuomo’s aside prompted a trickle of gossip in political circles, where some recalled a dog in the vicinity of the Cuomo household, said to resemble a Chihuahua. Was he denying a connection with a pint-sized pup?Further inquiry with Mr. Cuomo’s campaign revealed that while Mr. Cuomo does not own a dog himself, his three daughters — twins Mariah and Cara, 15, and Michaela, 12 — do have a dog named Angus. It resides, however, in the home of their mother, Kerry Kennedy, Mr. Cuomo’s former wife, who also claims ownership. A request for a photo was declined.“The dog belongs to Kerry Kennedy and their daughters,” Josh Vlasto, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “It is a small brown dog that was adopted from a pound where it was saved from imminent demise. It is of unknown age and unknown origin.”'"

The Shabab, a Somali insurgent group linked to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Human Rights Watch said Al-Amin Kimathi of the Kenyan Muslim Human Rights Forum and the lawyer Mbugua Mureithi had been in police custody since Wednesday, when they were arrested at the airport.

"'10-09-18,'0','Even among the 750,000 businesses that would be subjected to the higher rates in 2011, many are sole proprietors — a classification so amorphous it can include everyone from corporate executives who earn income on rental property to entertainers, hedge fund managers and investment bankers. Because 80 percent of America’s 32 million businesses are sole proprietorships, 90 percent of the tax cut would be derived from businesses without employees.Trade groups lobbying to extend the tax break for wealthy Americans argue that when hobbyists and home-based enterprises are removed from the equation, the total number of businesses affected is closer to 8 percent. Those companies are responsible for nearly half of all business revenue generated in the country, and according to the conservative American Enterprise Institute, would be less likely to invest or hire if subjected to higher rates.But much of the research over the last two decades has found that increases in top tax rates can lead to an increase in the formation of small businesses, as wealthy individuals apparently begin start-ups to avail themselves of the more generous tax breaks offered to businesses.“Higher taxes may lead individuals to seek self-employment because the opportunities for tax evasion and avoidance are greater,” according to a report released this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, which surveyed more than 20 studies on the effects of taxes on hiring.The intensity of the debate is a testament to the place that small businesses hold in the culture as a symbol of American ingenuity. That reverence has grown stronger in recent decades, as the decline of large manufacturers has made the economy rely on start-ups and small businesses to create jobs and entire growth industries.But the way the I.R.S. classifies small businesses is vastly different from the public perception of the neighborhood dry cleaner or the small tool-and-die shop. A report released by the Joint Tax Committee in July found that many of the tax returns categorized as small businesses were actually filed by wealthy taxpayers who earned business income through limited partnerships or S corporations to allow their firms to avoid paying corporate taxes.The study found that in 2005, 19,000 of those small businesses had revenue of more than $50 million.Democrats say they are trying to aim tax relief at the small businesses that most need it. On Thursday, they won Senate approval of a bill to offer $12 billion in tax breaks intended to encourage small-business investment and to create a $30 billion fund to encourage community banks to lend to modest-size companies. The measure is expected to pass the House and be signed into law by President Obama.With an eye on the deficit, Mr. Obama has said that the country cannot afford the $700 billion it would cost to extend the tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans over the next decade. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she supports Mr. Obama’s proposal, but it is unclear whether she has enough support in her caucus for the measure.“The tax cuts at the high end have not produced any jobs; it only increased the deficit,” Ms. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said Thursday. “We’re still paying the price that they have contributed to the deficit all along.”But Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, warned that eliminating the tax cuts on top individuals would quash many businesses just as they started to grow.“If you own a 100-worker metal fabrication plant, and your taxes go up 17 to 24 percent, you’ll likely stop hiring or lay off workers to compensate,” he said. “Small businesses create 70 percent of new jobs, so it’s disastrous for job creation to raise taxes on small businesses.”Ben Thompson, a business owner in Zanesville, Ohio, said his company would be forced to make modest cuts in capital spending if the tax breaks expired, but would not change its hiring decisions.Mr. Thompson and his brother Tim own Primary Aim L.L.C., which operates 29 Wendy’s fast-food restaurants in Ohio and West Virginia and employs 1,000 people. Although the company averages $42 million in revenue a year, Mr. Thompson said, he draws a salary of less than $250,000 and files as a limited liability company because the rates are lower than the corporate business tax. The company also pays him in dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate, but he declined to specify how much.“We’re in the restaurant business, so you have to have enough people to serve your customers,” Mr. Thompson said. “We wouldn’t have as much for capital, upgrades like paving the parking lots, new technology like cash registers, remodeling.”Bill Rys, tax counsel for the National Federation of Independent Business, said a survey of his organization found that the businesses most likely to be subject to the tax increase were those employing 20 to 250 workers.“Those are the businesses that employ a quarter of the work force and the ones that are most likely to be hiring,” Mr. Rys said. “A tax increase means that’s less money that those businesses have to spend on growing their business and more money that they’re sending to Washington.“'"

"'10-09-18,'0','“It is much more complicated, it is much more intrusive, it goes more directly into the business models of banks,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, an economic research organization in Brussels. “It’s not by chance that it hasn’t been regulated so far.”The committee has agreed on the aim of the new rules — that banks should have enough cash or easily marketable assets on hand to survive for 30 days if their usual sources of financing evaporate. But the panel still must resolve major issues, in particular, how much information banks will be required to disclose to investors and the public about how they raise money, and many technical questions about how to apply the new standards.The rule writers must refine the standards in time for the Group of 20 economic powers to consider them when it meets in November. The banking industry is particularly alarmed about the implications of the new liquidity rules, which have a direct effect on their cost of raising money and therefore their profit margins.“The new requirements will lock up huge amounts of liquidity in the banking sector, which will result in unnecessarily high levels of unproductive liquidity,” the European Banking Federation said this year in a letter to the Basel Committee. “The proposals will have a substantial impact on the banks’ capacity to lend.” The federation said, however, that it favored liquidity rules in principle.In its announcement last weekend, the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision, which oversees the Basel Committee, mentioned the so-called liquidity coverage ratio only briefly and gave few specifics. But the committee has outlined the rules and plans to stick by them despite objections from the banking industry, said people involved in formulating the rules, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.On Sunday, the central bankers and regulators said that new liquidity rules would take effect in 2015 and that the committee would spend the intervening time evaluating what the effect of the requirements would be. Additional rules, intended to ensure that banks have reliable sources of long-term financing, would not take effect until 2018.While the issue may strike nonbankers as technical or esoteric, it was critical in the days after Lehman’s collapse.Institutions like Hypo Real Estate, based in Munich, operated by borrowing money for relatively short periods on money markets and lending it long term in the form of mortgages or credit to governments.Because short-term interest rates are almost always lower than longer-term rates, the banks could keep the difference, or spread, between them. But when Hypo Real Estate was frozen out of money markets, it could not refinance its long-term obligations and would have collapsed without emergency help from the German government.In an indication of what the liquidity issue means for taxpayers, last week the German government, which now owns Hypo Real Estate, increased the loan guarantees it provides by 40 billion euros, or about $52 billion, to a total of 142 billion euros.Hypo Real Estate was an extreme example, but hundreds of other banks also faced liquidity squeezes, and the European Central Bank continues to prop them up by lending them hundreds of billions of euros at 1 percent interest.Preventing crises is not as easy as simply prohibiting banks from borrowing short and lending long, which is known as maturity transformation.“Maturity transformation is what the bank business is about,” said Jörg Rocholl, a professor at the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin.By requiring banks to have enough assets to survive 30 days, regulators aim to prevent institutions from taking the practice of maturity transformation too far. But banks objected that the definition of liquid assets was too narrow. In response, the Basel Committee revised the proposal to allow banks to include more highly rated corporate bonds as well as government bonds. Industry representatives remain dissatisfied.What should qualify as liquid assets also is being debated. Banks argue that riskier instruments like corporate debt should be included with traditionally safe assets like government bonds.And how much information banks should be required to make public about their liquidity positions is under discussion. Mr. Véron of Bruegel argues that banks should be required to disclose enough information to allow investors to decide for themselves whether an institution is taking on too much risk.But banking groups, supported by analysts like Mr. Rocholl, say that such information could be easily misinterpreted or abused. A bank suffering from a temporary, manageable problem could become the target of short-sellers and be driven into insolvency.Mr. Rocholl argued that regulators, but not necessarily the public at large, should have access to detailed information on banks’ liquidity.“I’m strongly in favor of transparency,” Mr. Rocholl said. “The question is to whom. There might be situations where transparency would really hurt if others would exploit that weakness.”'"
"'10-09-18,'0','An appeals court on Friday dismissed a case against Royal Dutch Shell in which the company was accused of helping Nigerian authorities violently suppress protests against oil exploration in the 1990s.A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that until the Supreme Court deemed otherwise, corporations could not be held liable in United States courts for violations of international human rights law.The dissenting judge, Pierre N.

"'10-09-18,'0','A FEW DAYS earlier, Mr. Pacquiao was getting ready to attend a plenary session in Congress in Manila, the capital, having flown back from the United States the night before. Since taking office, he has given a couple of well-received speeches, including one on human trafficking, and has become a visible presence on the committee to carry out the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which is led by Imelda Marcos, the former first lady and a newly minted congresswoman.“So far, so good,” Mr. Pacquiao said in an interview in his office in Congress. With “time management,” he said he would be able to train for his next fight, in November, and fulfill his legislative duties.Boxing and politics, he said, had been his twin dreams growing up.“I want to help people, especially in my province,” he said. “There are a lot of poor people. When I’m old, I want my name, Manny Pacquiao, to be known not only as a good boxer but a good public servant.”He may have become one of the world’s wealthiest athletes — Forbes magazine said he earned $40 million in 2009 — and he may now socialize with Hollywood celebrities, but in the Philippines, his pledge to help the poor resonates because of his now familiar personal history.He grew up in General Santos City, in a neighborhood that even today is a warren of narrow, dirt roads and ramshackle houses — though now adorned, incongruously, by two mansions belonging to Mr. Pacquiao’s mother and brother. Amateur boxing rings are fixtures of festivals in the countryside, a legacy of the United States’ colonial history in the Philippines. So, like many American boxers, Mr. Pacquiao sought his way out of his old neighborhood through boxing. At 14 years old, he ran away from home, stowing away aboard a ship bound for Manila, where he turned pro a couple of years later.In the assembly hall, most congressmen sat waiting for the plenary to start. But Mr. Pacquiao moved relentlessly, bantering with colleagues, posing for photos, scanning, in the split seconds he found himself alone, the entire room.“He can easily become a senator,” said Antonio Tinio, 40, another new congressman, explaining that Senate seats were nationwide offices favoring popular candidates like Mr. Pacquiao. But becoming president or even provincial governor requires the kind of political machine established by dynasties, he added.Mr. Pacquiao, though, has proven himself a fast learner. He ran for the first time in 2007, naïvely believing that his popularity alone would win him a congressional seat in General Santos City.“This time, I started forming my machinery two years before the election,” Mr. Pacquiao said.Choosing to run in Sarangani, his wife’s home province, Mr. Pacquiao wooed local power brokers, showering them and their districts with money.Reynaldo Constantino, 51, the mayor of one of Sarangani’s seven municipalities, said that since 2007 he has received more than $1.6 million from Mr. Pacquiao to deploy on projects in his district. Whenever the mayor himself needed money for his “image-building,” he turned to Mr. Pacquiao.“Money in the Philippines is the No. 1 factor in winning elections,” Mr. Constantino, who is known as Bong, said. “Even though he is very popular, he would not have won without his money.”Like many of Mr. Pacquiao’s constituents, Mr. Constantino said he hoped that the new congressman would now use his personal wealth to develop all of Sarangani, a province dominated by fishing and agriculture. “All of Sarangani will develop now because of Manny and because of Manny’s money,” he said.MR. PACQUIAO’S black Hummer was finally spotted barreling down the one road from General Santos City, west of here. If there was any doubt that the Hummer was his, the absence of any license plates — a privilege often granted to the powerful here in Mindanao — confirmed it.Dark clouds had been moving toward Alabel from the other direction and, as if on cue, rain began falling as Mr. Pacquiao took the microphone, nearly two hours late.Speaking in Visayan, the region’s main language, he said he had been working hard to attract investors to Sarangani. He pledged to build a new hospital here and start other projects to improve people’s lives.“I will not be an embarrassment to you,” he said.Later, inside the mayor’s office, Mr. Pacquiao sat at a large desk behind a lechon, a roast suckling pig. People drifted in and out of the office to pick from a buffet. The governor, Miguel Rene Dominguez — the 33-year-old scion of two of the southern Philippines’ oldest and richest families — sat to his left.The congressman and the governor spoke easily with each other. A conversation about Mr. Pacquiao’s knockout of Ricky Hatton, a British boxer, led to an exchange on the histories of England and Scotland. They talked of the importance of promoting a provincial tourist spot. The governor asked him what he was doing in Manila. Mr. Pacquiao talked about serving on the Millennium Development Goals committee.Mr. Pacquiao said that he would dedicate all his discretionary pork-barrel budget to Sarangani. Each congressman receives almost $1.6 million a year for pet projects at home, but much of the amount is typically funneled into private accounts.“I don’t need it anyway,” he said.Mr. Pacquiao, who was picking at the lechon and chewing on lanzones, a tropical fruit, abruptly stopped eating when the governor stood up and Mr. Pacquiao spotted a switchblade knife in the governor’s right pants pocket. Plucking it out before the governor had noticed, Mr. Pacquiao repeatedly folded and unfolded the switchblade, testing its sharpness with his index finger.“This is dangerous for children,” he said.Taking back the knife, the governor showed him how to whip it out of his pocket so that the blade unfolded in a single motion.“Even if my opponent has this,” Mr. Pacquiao said, “I can beat him as long as he’s physically close to me.”The governor gave him the switchblade to keep.“You can thrust it into somebody,” the governor told the new congressman, “and just leave it in there.”'"
"'10-09-18,'0','The charts also show the performance of 49 economies around the world. Included are all countries for which data is available and whose lowest quarter was at least 2 percent below the earlier peak level.Many of the countries that had the worst time of it are former members of the Soviet bloc. The economies of the three Baltic states — Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia — all shrank by at least 18 percent. The only other economy to perform that poorly was Ukraine, also a former Soviet republic. Former Soviet bloc countries have also lagged in recovering from the downturn.In other parts of Europe, the performance was generally better. But some countries — notably Iceland and Ireland — were severely damaged in part because major financial institutions collapsed.It may be surprising that Greece’s national output declined less than Germany’s. But Greece’s economy is still shrinking, while Germany has recovered much of its losses. But the figures are only as good as the national statistics office compiling them, and Greece’s reputation on that score is not good.All figures are measured in local currency, adjusted for inflation.Until the recent recession, the deepest fall for the American economy since World War II was a 3.7 percent drop during the brief but steep downturn in 1958.In the 1970s recession brought on by soaring oil prices, the economy took seven quarters to grow back to where it was before the recession, longer than any other postwar downturn. The figure now is 10 quarters and counting.When the recent financial crisis was at its height, few countries escaped downturns. World trade volumes collapsed, devastating exporters in Asia and Latin America. But most of those countries quickly recovered; their economies are now larger than before the crisis hit.China does not report exact quarterly figures, making it impossible to know how bad the situation became, but Hong Kong and Taiwan, which do provide numbers, were hurt. Taiwan and Turkey are the only countries that have completely recovered from a double-digit fall in G.D.P.Some countries managed to escape a downturn or, at worst, had only a small and brief decline. Argentina, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Tunisia, Israel and Jordan are in that group. Poland’s economy, unlike those of its Eastern European neighbors, has regained more than it lost in its shallow downturn.Developed countries with robust natural resources sectors also fared well. Australia performed better than any other major industrialized economy; its G.D.P. fell less than 1 percent even at the worst of the crisis. Canada did experience a recession, but it has recovered nearly all of what was lost.'"
"'10-09-18,'0','Just over one-third of Americans work for small businesses with fewer than 100 employees. If you’re one of those workers, you know that very few small companies offer comprehensive health insurance — or for that matter, any health insurance at all. Even when they do, premiums can be prohibitively expensive, because small businesses can’t negotiate the discounts given to large group plans.To help close that gap, the government this year is offering a tax credit to companies with fewer than 25 full-time workers and average wages of less than $50,000 a year. To qualify, employers must pay at least 50 percent of their employees’ health care premiums.Small businesses with 10 full-time employees or fewer earning an average of $25,000 or less are eligible for the largest credit, 35 percent of their health insurance premium costs. Companies with larger numbers of employees earning more receive smaller credits on a sliding scale.Not every small shop will qualify for the credits, but a recent study by two advocacy groups, Small Business Majority and Families USA, estimated that 84 percent of small businesses were eligible. (This includes firms that currently offer some type of coverage.)One health care foundation, the Commonwealth Fund, said in a recent report on small business and the new health law that up to 16.6 million workers were employed by eligible companies.“The tax credit and other provisions in the health care law are designed to repair the weaknesses in the health care system and bring small employers on a level playing field with large companies,” said Sara R. Collins, vice president for affordable health insurance at the Commonwealth Fund.If you own a small business, it might pay to familiarize yourself with the new provisions in the health care law. They may convince you that you can afford to offer health insurance or keep your existing policy in place.If you’re an employee at a small company, you could learn the details yourself and make sure your employer is ready to take advantage of the coming changes. Entrepreneurs are busy and not always plugged into these kinds of administrative changes. Your input may mean the difference between getting insurance or going without.CREDIT QUALIFICATIONS A simple worksheet on the I.R.S. Web site (bit.ly/9uXsqM) helps to show whether your firm has the proper number of employees and average salaries to qualify for the new tax credits. The site also has clear explanations of how the credits work.There is no application process; the business owner simply files one additional form with the company tax return. Start pulling together the figures now, though. The tax credit begins in the 2010 tax year, so the payoff will come as soon as next January, said John Arensmeyer, chief executive of Small Business Majority.The tax credit is set to expire in 2016, on the assumption that by then most small businesses will have made the transition to the insurance exchanges, where policies will be more affordable and premium costs will be the same for all participants.DROPPED COVERAGE Effective Sept. 23, insurance companies will no longer be permitted to deny coverage to people simply because they have gotten sick.In the past, some insurers tried to find errors in a customer’s application, then used them as an excuse to deny payment for a large claim. Employees of small businesses were particularly vulnerable.The new law makes this practice illegal.PREVENTIVE CARE Starting in September, all new health care plans must pay for preventive care, including physicals and other wellness programs. This extra care may mean extra costs for small-business owners.Fortunately, the government has set aside $200 million in grant money over five years to help small employers provide programs like smoking cessation, nutrition, physical fitness and stress management.“Wellness programs are easy for large companies like Safeway or I.B.M., but a small firm doesn’t have the bandwidth to absorb the administrative costs,” said Mr. Arensmeyer. Companies with fewer than 100 employees may apply for grants, which are administered by the federal Department of Health and Human Services.AFFORDABLE OPTIONS Small businesses will have even greater tax benefits once the new state health insurance exchanges are up and running in 2014. The maximum tax credit will increase to 50 percent at that time — but companies must buy insurance through the exchanges to be eligible.What’s more, insurance companies will not be able to charge more in premiums based on sex, age or health status. In the past, small companies with older or ill workers were hit with huge premium increases in their company plans, said Ms. Collins of the Commonwealth Fund.That’s what happened to Ms. Burton. Three employees, including Ms. Burton, have entered their 60s in the last few years. They are charged higher premiums than other employees because of their age. As a result, health insurance costs for the company, already on the rise, have skyrocketed.One of the older employees ended up relocating.“We were really skating on thin ice,” said Ms. Burton. “If she hadn’t left, I’m not sure we would have made it through last year.”The new law should help prevent large premium increases. Plus, small companies that have had trouble finding or deciding on an affordable plan should find the job easier with the streamlined exchange options.“Currently small businesses pay 18 percent more for the same coverage that large businesses have,” Mr. Arensmeyer said. The new law, he believes, will go a long way toward closing that gap.'"
"'10-09-18,'0','“This certainly has the potential to be a significant case,” said Gabriel Feldman, a law professor at Tulane and director of the university’s sports law program. “It’s rare for an agent to successfully sue another agent for client-poaching, or tampering, or tortious interference, or whatever you want to call it.”The ruling by the arbitrator, George Nicolau, was issued July 24 but remained confidential until a copy was obtained recently by The New York Times. In the decision, Nicolau concludes that Miller entered into an agreement with Douby while Douby was still under contract with Glass, in violation of state law. Both Glass and Miller are based in New Jersey.“I respect the arbitration process but disagree with the result,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “I stand by my position. I’ve acted in good conscience and will continue to represent my clients with pride and give them every ounce of energy I have.”Glass declined to discuss the case, other than to say, “Filing and proceeding with this says it all.”The case is being reviewed by the players union, which received a copy of the ruling on Thursday. Although union regulations do not specifically address client tampering, they include a general prohibition on “unlawful conduct and/or conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation.”The union said Thursday that it would reserve comment until it reviewed the ruling.Client poaching in the N.B.A. is considered commonplace. The union receives complaints almost daily but does not have the resources to investigate accusations. It is largely up to the agents to police themselves through legal action.In that regard, the most noteworthy case also involved Miller, albeit under much different circumstances.In 2002, a jury ordered Miller to pay $4.6 million to a former employer, Eric Fleisher, for taking 16 clients when he left Fleisher’s firm. The players included Kevin Garnett, who had one of the richest contracts in the league, and Chauncey Billups. The case was later settled for an undisclosed sum while on appeal. Nicolau cited that case in his arbitration ruling, using it to question Miller’s credibility.Because Miller and Glass offered conflicting accounts, the arbitration case hinged largely on whose story Nicolau found more believable. “Credibility is critical,” he wrote.Jack Ringel, Douby’s coach at Grady High School in Brooklyn, was also found liable, because he brokered the relationship between Douby and Miller. Ringel did not return a call seeking comment.The case began in October 2007, when Glass sued Miller and Ringel, alleging tortious interference. Miller and Ringel later filed counterclaims against Glass. The parties agreed last January to send the case to binding arbitration.A star scoring guard at Rutgers, Douby entered the 2006 draft as a junior and was taken 19th over all by the Sacramento Kings. Glass, who is based in Red Bank, N.J., negotiated Douby’s first contract, a four-year deal worth up to $6.5 million under the rookie scale. Glass’s commission was about $104,000, which he would earn regardless of how long Douby remained his client.As it turned out, their relationship was unusually brief.On April 26, 2007 — eight days after completing his first season with the Kings — Douby served Glass with a termination notice, via fax. On May 14, Douby signed with Miller, who is based in Tenafly, N.J.At a glance, the events seem unremarkable. Under the union’s rules, a player may fire his agent for any reason, at any time, provided he gives the agent 15 days’ notice.But Glass was immediately suspicious. Douby’s letter, although received on April 26, was dated April 22. And it was faxed from a U.P.S. store in Tenafly, about a third of a mile from Miller’s office. Miller had pursued Douby as a client in 2006.In his deposition, Douby said that the U.P.S. store in Tenafly “came up” on his car’s global-positioning system. He was driving in Manhattan at the time.Telephone records amplified Glass’s concerns, showing calls between Miller and Ringel as early as March 20. Douby has described Ringel as “like my other father.”There was also a call from one of Miller’s employees to Douby on April 26 — nine minutes before Douby called Glass to inform him of his intentions to terminate the relationship. Douby said that he did not speak with Miller until after the 26th.Finally, the phone records showed that Miller was in Marlboro, N.J. — where Ringel lives — on April 24, but not on May 14, the date that Miller claims to have signed the contract with Douby at Ringel’s home. This suggested, Nicolau concludes, that the player-agent agreement “was improperly entered into” on April 24, two days before Douby fired Glass.“I am fully persuaded,” Nicolau writes, “that Glass has established the tortious interference he alleged.”Although Glass was paid his full commission, Nicolau awarded the $40,000 in damages based on estimated fees that Glass would have earned for managing Douby’s money in the final two years of his contract.Miller and Ringel contended that Douby made the decision to fire Glass on his own. Douby testified that he was dissatisfied with Glass’s representation. Glass said there had been no indication of that until the day he was fired.Ultimately, Nicolau found Glass’s version of events more believable than the explanations given by Douby, Miller and Ringel, which he found inconsistent.Nicolau dismissed a counterclaim by Miller, who accused Glass of stealing one of his clients, Taquan Dean, who is playing in Europe. Although Dean left Miller for Glass, Nicolau concluded there was no evidence that Glass had interfered with their relationship. He also dismissed a counterclaim by Ringel, who claimed that Glass had agreed to pay him 25 percent of his commission on Douby’s contract.Meanwhile, Douby’s career has been a disappointment. He was waived by the Kings in February 2009 and finished the season with the Toronto Raptors. He played last season in Turkey but is unsigned for the coming season. He has changed agents three more times and is now represented by Happy Walters.'"
"'10-09-18,'0','TOKYO — Fresh from surviving a leadership challenge, Prime Minister Naoto Kan shuffled his cabinet on Friday, seeking a new start as he faces the uphill task of regaining public confidence in his party’s ability to end Japan’s long stagnation.While the new cabinet contained a few fresh faces, it offered a relatively staid lineup of party veterans that appeared aimed at conveying a greater sense of political maturity and competence than was demonstrated by the often erratic administration of Mr. Kan’s unpopular predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama.Getting the most attention was the new foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, a hawkish young foreign policy expert who has favored amending Japan’s pacifist Constitution and keeping close ties with the United States.Mr. Maehara, 48, will face the thorny task of fulfilling Japan’s pledge to relocate an American Marine air base on Okinawa, while also facing a diplomatic argument with China over disputed islands in the East China Sea.Mr. Kan, whose governing Democratic Party took power in a historic election last year, won a hard-fought party leadership election this week against the party’s power broker, Ichiro Ozawa. On Friday, Mr. Kan vowed to reunify the party and restore it to its original goals of changing the way Japan is governed and tackling the nation’s growing fiscal and economic problems.“This year has in many ways been a year of trial and error,” said Mr. Kan, 63, a former civic activist who took office three months ago. “From now on, I want everyone to call us a cabinet that can carry out its word.”'"
"'10-09-18,'0','The data sets the stage for Federal Reserve policy makers, who are meeting on Tuesday against the backdrop of an economy with stable and extremely low inflation, suggestions of deflation, sluggish growth and struggling job and housing markets.Officials from the Federal Open Market Committee last met on Aug. 10, when, with short-term interest rates close to zero, they voted to use proceeds from the Fed’s mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities, a measure that signaled growing concern about the slowing recovery and the risk of deflation.Such meetings have been preceded by weeks of speculation about what action Fed officials might take, and how or if they would adjust their language on the economy in the announcements after the meeting. The C.P.I. numbers fueled speculation among economists and in financial markets about the potential for further Fed action.Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company, said his firm already expected the Federal Reserve to start a second round of quantitative easing “toward the end of this year or beginning of next, and a flat reading on core inflation only increases those odds.” Quantitative easing refers to a monetary policy aimed at increasing the excess reserves of banks, and thus encouraging more lending.“They could buy additional assets in an effort to drive down interest rates and spur more economic activity than they are seeing,” he said.Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank, said he expected the Fed to maintain the status quo. “I suspect that if they see greater signs of weakness later this year they could institute something a bit more forceful in terms of quantitative easing,” he said.The bond market rallied Friday, while the broader stock market was mostly flat. The markets also absorbed a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary September reading on consumer sentiment that came in at 66.6, down from 68.9 in August.Paul D. Ballew, a former senior economist with the Federal Reserve, said he expected policy makers to have discussions on several fronts, including the pace of the recovery and the direction of fiscal policy pertaining to taxes and spending levels. He also expects them to continue their “communications strategy” to convey the message that the central bank is ready to continue to provide support.Mr. Ballew, who is now a senior vice president with Nationwide, called it the “ ‘keep the spirits up’ approach.”“The question for the Fed at that juncture is, are we seeing signs of the recovery picking up the pace a bit?” he added.Last month, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, described inflation as being “slightly below” the desirable level, but said deflation was “not a significant risk.” He said the Fed would “strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward direction.”James F. O’Sullivan, the chief economist of MF Global Ltd., noted that since Mr. Bernanke spoke, some of the crucial macroeconomic numbers, like retail sales and weekly jobless claims, have not deteriorated to the extent that would prompt a move by the Fed.“It seems highly unlikely they are going to initiate a new round of asset purchases,” Mr. O’Sullivan said.“The message from Fed officials in the last couple of weeks is that it is clearly on the table,” he said. “But there is not enough agreement on it yet to start up the program and they want to wait out the data to see what happens.”But the sluggish economy has been challenging as the Fed works to meet its mandate of securing price stability while promoting employment. Fed officials have signaled that they would take measures to address any continued weakening in the job market and other areas.'"

"'10-09-19,'0','“I think there will be a debate about whether we’re looking for a candidate who articulates the issues within the community or one who can appeal to the community and beyond.”Black elected officials and grass-roots organizers tried repeatedly in the 1990s to rally behind a single mayoral candidate in municipal elections, but Mr. Daley triumphed each time, in part by capturing an increasing share of the vote in black wards. In 2007, he beat two long-shot black challengers by winning a majority in 49 of the city’s 50 wards.Mr. Daley was helped over the years by a declining voter turnout. About 934,000 people voted in the first round of mayoral balloting in 1989, compared with 457,000 in 2007.By then, even some of Mr. Daley’s longtime critics had become supporters. Among them was Representative Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, who in 1999 was the last consensus black candidate to challenge Mr. Daley. He lost 69 percent to 27 percent.Mr. Rush said it was now time for blacks to come together to ensure that their issues were addressed. “We want to learn from our mistakes of the past,” he said.Black business leaders have been circulating names, and on Friday 111 ministers voted for their preferred candidates. Finishing first was State Senator James T. Meeks, followed by Representatives Danny K Davis and Jesse Jackson Jr. and the former United States Senator Carol Moseley Braun. And the City Council’s black caucus is putting together a questionnaire to circulate among potential contenders, said Alderman Howard Brookins Jr. (22nd Ward).“We would like to see an African-American as mayor,” Mr. Brookins said. “We certainly want someone who is going to pay attention to issues in the African-American community.”Others expressed doubt that blacks would arrive at a consensus candidate.“We are divided,” said Bamani Obadele, who directs a youth violence-prevention program in the Roseland area. “The black clergy is divided. The black activists are divided. Absolutely no one has been groomed for such a time like this.”A common complaint that many blacks had about Mr. Daley is that while he lavished his love and attention on downtown and surrounding gentrified areas, he treated the largely black South and West Sides like unwanted stepchildren.They point out that predominately black neighborhoods suffer from poor-performing schools, shuttered buildings and empty lots, high crime, and a lack of economic development, including grocery stores, restaurants and places to work.But the city is strapped for cash and has a looming budget deficit of more than $650 million. Hermene Hartman, publisher of N’Digo, a weekly newspaper that caters to the black middle and upper class, said: “The city is in serious trouble. We’re on the brink.”What the city needs most, Ms. Hartman said, is “a business person, a Mayor Bloomberg type” — referring to the mayor of New York City.State Senator Kwame Raoul, who represents the same district that Barack Obama once did, said that what appeared to be a division among blacks was actually a sign of a robust democratic process.“I think this whole notion of even asking the question, ‘Who is the black leader?’ is off the mark,” Mr. Raoul said. “You don’t ever hear the question, ‘Who is the white leader?’“The notion that there’s no standout — I don’t necessarily think that’s a negative thing.”Two black mayoral hopefuls, State Senator Rickey R. Hendon of the West Side, and William Walls, a former aide to Mr. Washington, have announced their candidacies. State Senator James T. Meeks, a South Side pastor of one of the largest churches in Illinois, is gathering the signatures needed to get on the ballotThe list of aspirants is “as long as the Dan Ryan Expressway,” observed Mr. Obadele, the youth violence program director.Mr. Walls said he would not withdraw from the mayoral race, regardless of whether the black political establishment came up with a preferred candidate other than him. Mr. Walls ran for mayor in 2007, finishing third with about 9 percent of the vote. He said he had been circulating nominating petitions since Aug. 24.“For a small group of select people to believe they have the authority to anoint someone to be the candidate is ridiculous,” Mr. Walls said.Mr. Davis’s name frequently comes up as a mayoral candidate, but he has not said what his intentions are. “It may take a long time before the stage is actually set,” he said.Mr. Davis added that the only way for a candidate to win and then to govern was by following in the footsteps of Mayor Washington, Alderman Toni Preckwinkle (4th Ward), President Obama and other black politicians who built winning coalitions across racial and ethnic lines.“The race card will not work the same way that it did before,” he said.Black voters have long shown a willingness to support white candidates far more often than whites have voted for blacks. And a number of black elected officials and neighborhood advocates said they were not limiting themselves to supporting black mayoral candidates.Richard Barnett, who was one of Mr. Washington’s key organizers and a critic of Mr. Daley, said he had yet to see a black mayoral contender who could raise enough money fast enough to be viable.“But I don’t need a black candidate,” Mr. Barnett said. “I just want a good mayor, someone who can deliver us from what we’ve been dealt all these years.”'"
"'10-09-19,'0','“Justice isn’t subject to a mathematical formula,” said Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County.The intent behind the cost estimates, he said, is transparent: to pressure judges, in the face of big bills, into sending fewer people to prison.“There is no average case,” Mr. McCulloch said. “Every case is an individual case, and every victim has the right to have each case viewed individually, and every defendant has that right.”Supporters, however, say judges would never focus exclusively on the cost of a sentence or turn their responsibilities of judgment into a numerical equation.“This is one of a thousand things we look at — about the tip of a dog’s tail, it’s such a small thing,” said Judge Gary Oxenhandler, presiding judge in the 13th Judicial Circuit Court and a member of the sentencing commission. “But it is almost foolish not to look at it. We live in a what’s-it-going-to-cost? society now.”The shift here comes at a dire time for criminal justice budgets around the country, as states try to navigate conflicting, politically charged demands: to keep people safe and also cut costs. Michigan has closed prisons. Arizona considered putting its prison system under private control. California has searched for ways to shrink its incarcerated population.Legal scholars predict that policies similar to the one in Missouri — which, unlike some other measures, might encourage cutting costs before inmates are already in prison — may soon emerge elsewhere.Months ago, members of the Missouri Sentencing Advisory Commission, a group of lawyers, judges and others established by state lawmakers years ago, voted to begin providing judges with cost information on individual cases.Judge Michael A. Wolff of the State Supreme Court, chairman of the sentencing commission, said judges had been asking for such data. By last month, Judge Wolff said, the computer algorithm was up and running, and the commission made note of it to the legal community in its August newsletter, “Smart Sentencing.”The concept is simple: fill in an offender’s conviction code, criminal history and other background, and the program spits out a range of recommended sentences, new statistical information about the likelihood that Missouri criminals with similar profiles (and the sentences they received) might commit more crimes, and the various options’ price tags.Judge Wolff said that some judges might never look at the price tags (though they are available to anyone, and some defense lawyers have begun mentioning them) and that judges ultimately did whatever they wished (within statutory limits) on sentences. Missouri’s sentencing commission makes recommendations only. And as Judge Wolff sees it, sentencing costs would never be a consideration in the most violent cases, just in circumstances where prison is not the only obvious answer.“This is just more information,” Judge Wolff said.Fewer than half the states have sentencing commissions like Missouri’s. In many cases, the commissions grew out of concerns, starting in the late 1970s, about racial and geographic disparities in sentences.Now, however, the groups find themselves also weighing fiscal issues, like everyone else. Consider the theme of a meeting of the national association of sentencing commissions in August: “Sound Sentencing Policy: Balancing Justice and Dollars.”Leaders of several commissions in other states said they had yet to consider a plan like Missouri’s. Some voiced concern about the ramifications, the methodology — even the price tag of calculating sentencing price tags.Lots of states measure the costs of imprisonment and of new criminal laws, but on a generic scale. Many states, for instance, calculate the average cost of housing a prisoner, but that is rarely mentioned with down-to-the-dollar figures for a specific person as a judge picks a sentence.To some, the concept sounds crass, and carries the prospect of unwanted consequences. Might a decision between life in prison and a death sentence be decided some day by price comparison? (Absolutely not, Missouri officials say, and besides, the computer model does not attempt to compute the cost of capital punishment.) Could the costs of various sentences become so widely known as to affect the decisions of jurors?Numerous legal experts on sentencing issues said Missouri’s new policy made sense. Economic considerations play roles in all sorts of legal decisions, Rachel E. Barkow, a law professor at New York University, said, so why not let judges understand the cost of their choices?Douglas A. Berman, a law professor at The Ohio State University, said: “One of the flaws in the operation of our criminal justice system is not only the failure to be attentive to cost but an arrogance that somehow you can never put a price on justice. Long missing has been a sober realization that even if we get significant benefits from incarceration, that comes at a significant cost.”Others, like Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of Utah, argue that Missouri’s plan counts certain costs but fails to measure others — the societal price, for instance, if someone not incarcerated commits another crime.“No one can put a price tag on being a victim,” said Scott Burns, executive director of the National District Attorneys Association.Still, money worries loom. This year, in an annual address, even the chief justice of Missouri’s Supreme Court, William Ray Price Jr., warned that the system would be threatened if budget cuts persisted.“Perhaps the biggest waste of resources in all of state government is the over-incarceration of nonviolent offenders and our mishandling of drug and alcohol offenders,” he said.Mr. McCulloch, the prosecutor, said the state’s prisons were filled with anything but harmless people. “You show me the college kid with a perfect record and a dime bag of weed who has been sent to prison, and I’ll get him out,” he said. “Find me him.”When Missouri lawmakers meet next year, Mr. McCulloch says that he expects he and others may push to abolish the sentencing commission.'"

"'10-09-19,'0','Exporters, concentrated along the southern coast, wield enormous clout in Beijing and benefit from an undervalued currency, said Minxin Pei, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. So do state-owned enterprises, which have excess capacity and need to be able to sell goods cheaply abroad. China’s importers are unhappy with the undervalued renminbi — as are officials at the central bank — but both groups are relatively weak.In the United States, there must be someone against a stronger Chinese currency, right?Large multinational corporations, and Wall Street, are comfortable with a weak renminbi. Many of the biggest American conglomerates make goods in China (or sell them in the United States) and benefit from the undervalued currency. Financial services companies find deal-making easier with a strong dollar and want to help invest the capital sloshing around China.But aren’t the forces on the other side just as strong?A high dollar places tremendous competitive pressure on American agricultural producers and domestic manufacturers, and thereby hampers job creation.So, it’s not surprising that Midwest politicians and labor unions have been among China’s fiercest critics. High unemployment has also prompted the White House and most Congressional Democrats (and a substantial number of Republicans) to side with the critics.How have previous problems with a strong dollar been handled?In the late 1960s, rising federal spending during the Vietnam War and the Great Society pushed inflation upward. The United States had a trade deficit for the first time in the postwar era. Manufacturers were furious. President Richard M. Nixon responded by taking the country off the gold standard in 1971, which caused the dollar to fall by about 20 percent.From 1981 to 1985, the dollar soared again, as the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates to combat inflation and the Reagan administration borrowed to finance big budget deficits. In September 1985, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III met Japanese and German officials at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. Faced with threats of protectionist action by Congress, the two countries agreed on a plan to devalue the dollar.So, could such an agreement happen again?A rapid devaluation of the dollar is unlikely anytime soon. No country, even an ally, wants to see its currency suddenly rise in value (and its exports become more expensive) amid a fragile global recovery. The international monetary system has also gotten more complex, with the creation of the euro and the rise of large emerging economies like Brazil, India and Russia.Though China allowed its currency to rise by more than 20 percent against the dollar from 2005 to 2008, the financial crisis (which led investors to flock to the dollar) led to a return to old ways. In June, Beijing promised greater exchange-rate flexibility, but since then the renminbi has risen by only about 1 percent. Too little, too late, Mr. Geithner testified last week.Ultimately, says Jeffry A. Frieden, a Harvard political scientist, exchange rates reflect broader macroeconomic forces. For the dollar to get back in sync, Americans must save and invest more and consume and borrow less, and the Chinese, Germans and Japanese have to recognize that excessive reliance on exports is not to their long-run advantage.“It’s conceivable that the Chinese might conclude it’s in their own self-interest to let the currency rise,” Professor Frieden said, “but it’s not going to come from browbeating and it’s not even going to come from well-meaning attempts at cooperation.”'"

Not long into one of their first conversations, they began talking about skiing. Mr. Rafuse had been a ski instructor for many years at Sugarloaf in Maine. That jogged Ms. Mitchell’s memory, and she mentioned that her mother had bought her a pair of used skis in high school that were still in her parents’ barn.The skis were engraved with a familiar name: Bill Rafuse.“It just seemed too bizarre, like a sign from above,” Ms. Mitchell said.The couple continued their long-distance relationship until January 2009, when Mr. Rafuse moved back to Vassalboro to help Ms. Mitchell run her farm.“At that point, I knew that this was the woman I had wanted to marry,” he said. “I loved everything about her: her smarts, her ability to laugh and have fun and to get serious when things got tough, everything.”In August 2009, two days before the second annual farm party (“The Farm’s All Warm, Just Come Party”), Mr. Rafuse proposed during evening horse chores.“I wasn’t surprised that he asked, it was just the timing of it,” Ms. Mitchell said. “We had only fed half the horses.” VINCENT M.

"'10-09-19,'0','He did not. Dossey smashed into the side of Roger Maynor of Bay Shore, N.Y., and his crumpled car was towed to the off-track pit area. Dossey, a tightly built, tightly wound 47-year-old whose internal thermostat seems set on simmer, marched into his racecar trailer and grabbed a dry-erase board. A dozen or so crew members in matching uniforms stayed quiet and out of the way.“A Gift From New York. Thanks,” Dossey scribbled. He propped the message atop his car’s carcass.Maynor was still inside his mangled machine when the tow truck dropped it next to Dossey’s. The right rear panel was obliterated and the hood was shaped like a pup tent.“Of all the people, it had to be him,” said Maynor, a 52-year-old bear of a man with a round, gentle face. His red coveralls were split in the seat, and the knees were worn almost through.He stepped into his brightly lighted trailer, a garage on wheels. On the wall was a picture of his father, Ernie Maynor. Father and son were racing side by side at Islip (N.Y.) Speedway in 1982 when they split around a car in the crossover.Ernie Maynor, known as The Wrench, clipped the car, lost control, hit the wall and was killed. Roger Maynor, a mechanic like his father, went on to become the most accomplished driver at Long Island’s Riverhead Raceway, a regional master of the figure eight.“My father wasn’t a quitter, and he would have been disappointed if I quit,” Maynor said. “My mother wasn’t crazy about it. Even when I told her I was coming here, she started crying. She gets nervous.”Fate is left to the whims of reflexes, fear and physics. A figure-eight race is a series of wince-inducing near misses interrupted by jarring collisions.Even the tow trucks, ambulances and pace cars that frequently take to the track to restore order sometimes seem at risk of a broadside.In the past 12 years, at least three drivers (not including one racing in a school bus) have died in figure-eight crashes in the United States. But there is no governing body for the sport, and it is difficult to surmise how the fatality rate compares with other events. Danger is mitigated somewhat by lower speeds than other forms of racing, yet insurance for tracks that feature the event is typically higher than for those that do not.“It’s definitely one of the most dangerous types of motor sports there is,” said Craig Clarke, whose Florida-based company, Track Rescue, oversees safety for racetracks and movie stunts. “You’re crossing the course with itself, and the potential for direct driver impact is imminent.”According to Tim Frost, the publisher of the National Speedway Directory, about 60 of the estimated 1,000 oval racetracks in the country — three-quarters of which are not paved — run figure-eight races each year.Nowhere are they treated with such reverence and panache as at the Indianapolis Speedrome, a small track across town from the far larger, more famous Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The Speedrome opened in 1941 and began holding figure-eight races a few years later on its fifth-of-a-mile oval.Since 1977, it has held the world championship, a three-hour race of attrition. The car that completes the most laps wins. This year, the winner received $20,035 — a huge sum in small-track racing. Most race at their local tracks for $1,000 or less.“For figure-eight racers, this is our Daytona 500, Indy 500, everything else, rolled into one,” said Gordon Brown, a longtime driver and car owner from Florida.Most cars in the race were custom built around a high-powered engine (650 horsepower or more), a nimble chassis (center balanced for turns in both directions) and a sturdy roll cage (inspected, along with other required safety features, by Dennis Love, the chief steward for the Speedrome and the Indy Racing League.)Maynor brought his trusty No. 28 (his father drove No. 82), a hefty, old-style stock car with 3,250 pounds of mass around a 550-horsepower engine.Still, during qualifications the day before the race, Maynor muscled his car through most competitors. But the drive shaft was damaged along the way. Maynor had another in the trailer, but did not have welding equipment powerful enough to make trustworthy repairs.Dossey came to the rescue. He offered the overnight use of his nearby garage and equipment, and Maynor and his five-man crew rebuilt the guts of the car through the wee hours. By morning, Maynor was at the track wearing a weary smile. He was effusive in his gratitude and reminded his crew to buy beer to repay Dossey.As darkness fell on a Saturday night, 32 cars, lined in pairs, filled one half of the figure eight to start the race. By the second lap, cars crisscrossed through the intersection.Once safely through, it takes less than 10 seconds to reach the intersection again. The action is relentless.“It’s like you’re in a swarm of bees,” the driver Jimmy Kirby said.Halfway around each loop, drivers look over their shoulder across the track to gauge which cars they will meet in the crossover. It is a high-speed game of chicken. Drivers have “a millionth of a second,” Basham said, to decide whether to go in front or behind the other car, and trust that the other driver is thinking the same way.There are clues. Drivers establish reputations for timidity or temerity. Nose up means the car is accelerating; nose down means the driver is hesitating.Cars sometimes arrive in packs and seem to magically alternate like shuffling cards. Sometimes, a driver sees no opening and stops, creating a chain reaction of swerves and slammed brakes.“Sometimes, you tense all up — Woo! I don’t know how I did that,” said Ben Tunny, the 2009 winner. “You don’t know really how it’s going to work when you get there, but somehow, it does.”Not always. After a series of mechanical problems from two early-race bumps, Maynor was running steady toward a respectable midpack showing.Dossey, whose pink No. 20 and fearless driving stand out amid the swirling confusion, was looking to win again. He pitted for fuel and tires with 25 minutes left. He returned in third place, slipped into second and headed toward first.Steam blew from Dossey’s ruptured radiator. The collision spun Maynor 360 degrees, but he kept going. His race ended minutes later in a six-car pileup.On pit road, Maynor saw the handwritten sign on Dossey’s car. The difference between finishing first (as R. J. Norton of Indianapolis did, with 397 laps) and finishing seventh (as Dossey did, with 357), was $19,006. Dossey said Maynor’s hesitation through the crossover cost him.“Roger couldn’t make up his mind,” Dossey said, still seething, “so I made it up for him.”Several fans thanked Maynor for coming and told him not to worry about the accident. Dossey hit you, they pointed out, not the other way around. It happens.“I feel terrible,” said Maynor, who was 21st, with 171 laps. “The guy helped us. Out of all the people — if it wasn’t for him, we wouldn’t be here.”Long after midnight, Maynor stood in his trailer, waiting for his check for $1,015 — or $14 less than Dossey earned. He would like to come back to the world championship, he said, but in a lighter, quicker car. Maybe he could find one to overhaul for next year.In the meantime, No. 28 needed a lot of repairs, and home was 14 hours away. Maynor said he planned to race the next weekend back home on Long Island. The photograph of his smiling father hung over his shoulder.'"
"'10-09-19,'0','“My husband is a violinist, and I’m a pianist; we love music and theater, and the college didn’t really have a place to encompass those wonderful things,” said Mrs. Lackland, 76, a 1954 graduate of the college. She said she was looking forward to performances by the Chamber Orchestra Kremlin on Oct. 24 and the New Jersey Ballet Company on Oct. 30 at the Sitnik. “We wanted to give back, and as music and theater lovers, this was our opportunity to do something we really wanted to do.”David Lackland, 78, co-founded the Lackland Self Storage company in Piscataway in 1977; he is currently the owner of Lackland Associates, a real estate company, in Warren.Although the Lacklands will not specify how much money they donated to the college to build the center, campus officials said it would not have gotten off the ground, let alone become the two-story, glass-encased center for the arts it is today, without their generosity.“We always had a strategic plan in place for an arts center, but in 2003, before the rumors started about this actually taking shape, that strategic plan was 15 years down the road,” said Mr. Wallnau, 57, of Hoboken. “When the Lacklands came along, that changed. They were very specific about what they wanted to do here.”In addition to the two theaters, the dance studio and the TV station, the Lackland Center is home to a 400-seat dining hall, where students in flip-flops and pajama bottoms can already be seen, orange juice in hand; a 55-seat cafe; classrooms for communications students; a boardroom; offices; and a studio for WNTI-FM (91.9), the listener-supported radio station, which is attached to the TV station by a spiral staircase.The radio station’s relocation to the new building was of special significance to Mrs. Lackland, who took a Centenary radio course in the 1950s.“That radio course is what gave me the confidence to go into New York City and apply for a job at CBS, which I got,” she said. Later, she worked as an assistant to a radio producer at NBC. “I had a really wonderful career,” she said. “And I know I would never have had the confidence to go and find a job like that if it wasn’t for Centenary. It opened my whole world.”Who exactly allowed her to pursue her dream is still something of a mystery. Mrs. Lackland grew up in Plainfield; when she was 11, her father was killed by a hit-and-run driver. She said her mother brought up the family “on very little money.” She did not expect to go to college, but was encouraged by a high school music teacher, she said, to apply for a scholarship at Centenary. She got the scholarship, but by the end of her freshman year, she was short $500 to enroll as a sophomore.“That would be like $5,000 today — it was more than I could imagine,” Mrs. Lackland said. “I was ready to leave school, but then I was called in by the dean and told an anonymous donor had given the money, and that I would be able to finish.”Mrs. Lackland never learned the donor’s identity. “Whoever that person was, he inspired us to give back,” she said.Their inspiration seems to be contagious.“I loved the old space, but it isn’t this,” said Allen Lewis Rickman, 50, of Manhattan, who plays Baxter on HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” and is a frequent cast member in Centenary Stage Company’s productions. The company plans to have five productions this year, up from three last year, as a result of the new theater spaces.Mr. Lewis, the college’s broadcast manager, who is from Port Murray, could not agree more with Mr. Rickman. “I’m coming from a TV station that was in the basement of a dorm” at Centenary, he said. “Once I get students in here, our TV program is going to explode. I can’t wait.”'"
"'10-09-19,'0','Thom Filicia, the interior designer of “Queer Eye” fame, continues to stage home décor interventions as the host of “Tacky House” and “Dress My Nest” on the Style Network. Mr. Filicia, 41, who also has a home furnishings line, lives in SoHo with his companion, Greg Calejo, a publicist, and two dogs, Paco and Foxy. Every other weekend, they head upstate to Skaneateles, where Mr. Filicia is renovating a 1907 lake house.NEWS FIRST Sadly, I probably get up earlier than I really want to — around 9, or maybe 9:30. First thing I do is turn on the news, NY1 or CNN, and I’ve got this DeLonghi coffeemaker that I really love, so I’ll fire that up and make coffee for Greg and I. And then I sit around awhile in my T-shirt and boxer shorts drinking coffee and waking up.NO PAJAMAS, NO COOKING I’m not a pajamas person; I don’t own any pajamas. I don’t cook in the morning. We tend to have these giant dinner parties at home on Saturday nights, so Sunday is a no-cooking day.WALKS DOGS, PART 1 Once I’m awake, I’ll throw on some sunglasses and go walk Paco and Foxy. We usually go over to the Hudson River where it’s all been renovated. We walk along the edge of the West Village, SoHo and TriBeCa, and then we go home and the dogs get a treat and I read the real estate and style sections of the paper. If we’re up at the lake house, I’ll take the dogs in the boat and go across the lake to pick up the newspapers. We’re definitely more homebody-ish on Sundays. It’s kind of our day to chill out with the dogs. It’s like we’re all together, either at home, the park, the boat or the car.GYM OPTIONAL I work out twice during the week and once on the weekends, typically on Sunday. Just a short workout, 20 minutes, and I run two and a half miles. But if it was a late night on Saturday, the gym may get edited out!BRUNCH MANDATORY When we’re in the city, I pack a polo shirt and shorts in my gym bag, and after working out, I’ll head over to Soho House for brunch with friends. When the weather is good, it’s really relaxing to be up on the roof by the pool. My standard brunch order is classic eggs Benedict with hollandaise on the side and a bloody mary. I definitely love a good bloody mary on a Sunday afternoon. If we’re upstate, we go to the Skaneateles Country Club for brunch, and then we’ll go waterskiing on the lake.'"
"'10-09-19,'0','LEW ALTFEST knows how clients will react when he tells them they shouldn’t refinance their mortgages.“Their faces move from smiley to glum,” because they thought that by refinancing, they would be “outfoxing someone,” said Mr. Altfest, the principal adviser at Altfest Personal Wealth Management in Manhattan. Cutting your mortgage rate seems like finding cash in the street.“But if you have rational reasons,” he said, “they thank you.”With mortgage rates at historical lows, almost all the loans being written these days are refinancings — 80.5 percent of applications in the week ended Sept. 10, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.But not everyone should refinance a mortgage, Mr. Altfest and other experts point out. “It depends on what you have, it depends on your time frame, and obviously it depends on what you can save and whether you can qualify,” said Timothy G. Parker, the president of Hudson Capital Management in Ridgewood, N.J.As with most financial matters, this decision involves a bit of math. At the very least, homeowners will need to determine their closing costs and monthly savings. Divide closing costs by savings; that tells you how many months it will take to break even. If you plan to stay put that long, a refinance might work. People with high loan balances may find the numbers favor refinancing, but those who don’t owe much may determine that closing costs overshadow savings.'"

"'10-09-19,'0','IN a trailer for “The Social Network” — the new movie about the tumultuous origins of the social networking site Facebook — a cursor makes its way across the modern digital landscape, full of “friends” who may or may not be friends, and strangers smiling in intimate ways. It promises a story that is as sexy and clickable as a seconds-old status update, one about the most modern of subjects in a frantically wired world. Then again, the film — written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher — deals in archetypes and conflicts as old as the Bible.Even while they trade on its currency, as headlines about Facebook’s astounding growth and problematic privacy issues keep coming, the makers of “The Social Network” prefer to dwell on its timelessness.“We’re not fad hopping,” said Mr. Fincher, sitting in a conference room on the Sony lot late last month. “There’s an ironic story behind this thing that’s about friendship and the need to connect. The fact that it was Facebook brought an interesting context for this simple drama of acrimony.”Scott Rudin, one of the producers of the film, said that in spite of its thoroughly modern tag line — “You don’t get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies” — “The Social Network” is built on themes that would not be out of place in ancient Rome. “It’s very classic,” Mr. Rudin said. “The men want to kill each other, the women are cruel, and only the fittest survive.”“The Social Network,” which opens the New York Film Festival on Friday and reaches theaters the following week, describes how Facebook, then “thefacebook,” created an alternative social hierarchy, first at Harvard in 2004, then in the world at large. It is a throw-down among Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker, all founding fathers of a site that allows people to connect seamlessly with old friends and new. Once Facebook takes off, a scrum for credit and lucre begins that ricochets from dorm rooms to depositions to impossibly fabulous parties.Like the enterprise it chronicles, the movie came together in a big, bad hurry. A proposal for Ben Mezrich’s book, “The Accidental Billionaires,” circulated in early 2009. Mr. Rudin’s scouts saw it, and when they called Sony, found out that Dana Brunetti and Mike De Luca already owned the rights. Rather than fight, they agreed to collaborate. Mr. Sorkin read four pages into the book proposal and immediately called his agent, and was finished with a script before the book even came out. Mr. Fincher, who was looking for a film, was sent a draft by Sony and Mr. Rudin, and agreed to direct as long as “they didn’t wait for eight rounds of development and nine drafts,” he said. “We needed to make it now.” (The book proposal was sold in June 2008, and the movie began shooting in October 2009.)Plenty of young actors lined up to work on a film directed by Mr. Fincher (“Seven,” “Fight Club,” “Zodiac,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button”) and written by Aaron Sorkin (the creator of “The West Wing” for television, and film scripts including “Charlie Wilson’s War,” “Malice” and “A Few Good Men”). Jesse Eisenberg (“Adventureland”) was cast as Zuckerberg, the film’s protagonist; Andrew Garfield (about to be the next Spider-Man) plays Zuckerberg’s spurned wingman, Eduardo Saverin; and Justin Timberlake, big-deal music star, took on the role of Parker, the Internet impresario-genius-huckster.While the cast clearly went all in for a movie that has all the makings of a prestige project, the movie clearly belongs to Mr. Fincher and Mr. Sorkin.At first look it seems like a shotgun marriage: Mr. Fincher, an auteur director who creates worlds so expressive that words often seem beside the point, directs “Social Network” from a script by Mr. Sorkin, as much playwright as film writer, whose dialogue seems to emanate from an Uzi and require very little visual context.But the collaboration is clear from the very first scene. As the film opens, Mark Zuckerberg is having an argument in a loud bar with his about-to-be-ex girlfriend and muse in absentia (played by Rooney Mara, who has been cast as Lisbeth Salander in the Hollywood remake of “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.”) Socially inept, he misses a growing number of signals that she finds his relentless ambition revolting. Ms. Mara’s character waits for an opening and then, with a few well-chosen words, reduces him to tongue-tied misery.It is classic Sorkin, eight pages of dialogue with two smart humans locked in verbal combat. So what’s the Fincher part? They shot the scene 99 times. And every bystander, clink of the glass and stain on the bar napkin is just so. “Glibly speaking, David Fincher is a perfectionist,” Mr. Eisenberg said. “You hear about people who work tirelessly, meticulously to get what they are after, but David is the real thing.”Mr. Sorkin acknowledged the odd couple nature of the pairing. “This is not intuitively the perfect marriage of director and material,” Mr. Sorkin said over a dinner at the Sunset Towers here. “What David is most known for is that he’s peerless as a visual director, and I write people talking in rooms. David absolutely welcomed all the language and managed to make it visually beautiful and really emotional.”The latest of Mr. Fincher’s moody kingdoms is set at Harvard. Using a variety of stand-in locations, Mr. Fincher carefully draws the university as a coliseum as much as a campus. Language, social status, study clubs are fully weaponized even as Mr. Zuckerberg introduces a new element — technology — as the ultimate equalizer. “I think the fact that it was Harvard is by no means irrelevant,” Mr. Sorkin said. “The genesis of the idea was exclusivity, of an outsider wanting to belong.”Mr. Rudin added, “This is a story about a hacker who morphs into a C.E.O., and I think that David has a deep understanding and instinct about who those kinds of insurgents are.”'"

"'10-09-20,'1','“I tapped into something that a lot of people happened to care about,” said Fisher, who was spurred to begin the site last October after a friend e-mailed him the first court filings in the case. “If this was the owners of the Twins getting divorced, nobody would care. But it’s Frank and Jamie McCourt who have thrust themselves into the spotlight, and this is one of the things that could happen. It’s one of those stories that could only happen in L.A.”So, too, is Fisher’s.Fisher moved to Los Angeles with his mother when his parents divorced shortly after he was born, and he grew up in and around San Pedro, a working-class suburb at the edge of the Port of Los Angeles. His affection for the Dodgers began early, when his uncle Mike Eberhard would take him to Dodgers games and hoist him on his shoulders so he would not be required to buy him a ticket.But instead of being enamored of Dodgers stars like Mike Piazza and Eric Karros, Fisher was most interested in peeling back the layers of the franchise, poring himself into nontraditional statistics and questioning the wisdom of how the Dodgers’ roster was constructed.“It was things that, at 9 years old, most kids don’t have a clue about,” Eberhard said. “We’d go to Dodger games, and he’d talk about who was in the minor leagues, who was underrated, who was overrated.”That sort of analysis, methodical and dispassionate, is the defining characteristic of Dodger Divorce, in which Fisher thoroughly examines any news related to the divorce — be it court filings or whether the team will sign its top draft pick. Fisher said that on a busy day, he would surpass 10,000 hits on the site, whose spartan design can be described as early caveman. Fisher has more than 1,000 Twitter followers, a number that has doubled since the beginning of the trial, in which he gives play-by-play updates.“Many of my readers would like it if I was angrier,” said Fisher, who majored in English with a minor in finance at the University of Kansas. “Very little about this has shocked or surprised me. I’ve been into the business of baseball for a long time, and between that and my experience in finance and bankruptcy, this is just how the world works. I think it’s very unfortunate that my favorite sports team has to go through this public spectacle, but it doesn’t make me less of a fan. I can separate rooting for the team from what it does.”Is he typical of Dodgers fans?Fisher said his one pinch-me moment of the last year came at the opening of the trial, when the court’s public-information officer called his name as he took roll of the credentialed news media.“After that, a few writers came up and told me how much they enjoyed my site,” Fisher said. “I kind of thought, Well, this is real.”Fisher has found it invaluable to be at the trial, working the corridors with reporters, getting in a question here and there with the small army of lawyers and advisers the McCourts have brought to the case. But he does not consider himself a journalist.The cost of rearranging his work schedule at a Minneapolis law firm, receiving approval (at least for now) for missing class, and flying to Los Angeles and staying at a downtown hotel is not a hardship; it is an investment.Fisher says he expects to have his law degree by next spring, and then it will be time to begin his career path. He interned at a commercial bank as an undergraduate and has worked at a law firm while at Minnesota, where he is studying business law — troubled assets, fittingly enough. These days, that is not an uncommon path to the front office of a baseball team.As he sat on a park bench on a warm, sunny Sunday afternoon, looking out over the Pacific Ocean not far from where he grew up, Fisher said he knew this was an important time in his life.“This is a pretty highly leveraged month for me,” Fisher said. “Employers like people with a story, and I have a better story now than I did a year ago and I see the difference. I’ve had some success walking through every door that’s been opened. I don’t see any value in closing doors right now. Whatever is out there, I don’t know, but I’m listening.”Fisher arrived back in Los Angeles on Saturday night on a one-way ticket. He will stay here all week and probably next, watching and listening intently in a downtown courtroom, waiting for signs of what the future holds for the Dodgers. And himself, too.'"
"'10-09-20,'1','“A 100 percent ideological purity test — I don’t live in that utopian world; it’s not reflective of the real world,” she added. “I hope that’s not the approach.”Ms. Snowe, in an interview, expressed surprise at the decision by Delaware Republicans. “He has just been the highest caliber, an outstanding public servant for the people of Delaware and the country,” she said.In 2008, Maine defied the national wave that lifted Democrats to big majorities in the House and Senate and re-elected Ms. Collins even as Republican incumbents fell in more conservative states like Alaska and North Carolina. At the time, she emphasized her independence and her willingness to work across the aisle and compromise, dispatching her opponent with ease.In the spring, Ms. Collins said that she hoped what appeared to be the virtually certain arrival of Mr. Castle from Delaware, on the heels of the election of Scott P. Brown in Massachusetts in January, would make the Senate a less lonely place for moderates and that Northeastern Republicans seemed to be “leading our party back out of the wilderness.”Ms. Collins, who provided a key vote in support of President Obama’s economic stimulus plan and backed the Wall Street regulatory overhaul, said Mr. Castle’s defeat had come as a shock. She attributed the rise of the conservatives to a backlash against Obama administration policies.“It is stunning that he could be defeated in a primary, and it is very troubling to me,” Ms. Collins said in the recent interview. “I believe it is a reaction of the overreaching of the Obama administration and people’s fear and worry about the economy.”But some Maine Republicans now say Ms. Snowe should be replaced with a more conservative candidate when she is up for re-election in 2012.And while other Republicans with moderate credentials, including Representative Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois, still have a good chance of winning in November, none would arrive in the Senate with the moderate stamp and stature of Mr. Castle, who has served in the House for 18 years, and is both well-known and respected in both parties.Though the number of moderates may be small, with the partisan margins certain to be much tighter in the Senate next year no matter which party is in control, centrists will still be able to wield influence given the importance of every individual vote.Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who is retiring after this year, said that he, too, believed the primary voters were driven largely by frustration over federal spending and the economy.Mr. Gregg said that Republicans should focus on fiscal responsibility, which unites their party. “If we go on some tangent that has nothing to do with spending and debt,” he said, “that will be overplaying our hand.”While the two Maine senators are usually viewed as the Republicans most likely to cross the aisle, others have been known to break from the party’s generally conservative stance, including Senators Robert F. Bennett of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom were ousted by challengers from the right.Given the rising influence of the Tea Party, the votes of all Republicans are likely to be scrutinized and come under Tea Party fire if lawmakers stray.If Republican leaders in Congress are privately bemoaning the Tea Party insurrection that is toppling such established lawmakers, they are being careful not to show it.Virtually the entire Senate Republican leadership attended a fund-raiser on Capitol Hill last Thursday for Sharron Angle, the Tea Party candidate who won the Republican nomination to run against the majority leader, Harry Reid, in Nevada.Still, the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has stressed a “big tent” approach, saying the party welcomes and represents a broad range of views.But Mr. McConnell himself ended up on the losing side of the Senate primary in his home state, when he backed Trey Grayson, the state treasurer, over the Tea Party candidate and eventual winner, Rand Paul.Senate Republicans do not deny that Mr. DeMint has opened a rift. “It is a new and shocking development to have a member of our conference opposing incumbent Republicans,” Ms. Collins said, adding that she doubted voters in her state could be “influenced by the actions of a senator from South Carolina.”'"
"'10-09-20,'1','It is part of a longstanding plan to recast the university’s image, still tarnished by its reputation for racial strife in the 1960s, to signal that it is more tolerant and diverse. Confederate battle flags were discouraged from football games years ago, and “Dixie” is no longer the unofficial fight song.But whether Colonel Reb too should go, and what might replace him, has divided fans.“Over. My. Dead. Body,” said Mack Allen, 36, an alumnus and technology analyst from Memphis, who wore a T-shirt to a recent football game that read, “Colonel Reb — Loved by Many, Hated by Few.”A group of fans called the Colonel Reb Foundation said it had gathered 2,000 signatures on a petition against any new mascot and plans to deliver it to the chancellor, Daniel W. Jones, and newspapers across the state. It also paid for the costume that Mr. West was wearing.“People just want it to be over,” said Ty New, 21, a senior from Olive Branch, Miss., a co-chairman of a student committee to select the new mascot.Like controversies at other colleges involving team names or mascots of American Indians, this started as a dispute about the university’s core values.But it has raised a new question about whether having no mascot at all hurts school spirit and the football team. In a campus referendum in February, 74 percent of students voted in favor of creating a new mascot rather than remaining mascotless.“We’re the only school in the Southeastern Conference without one,” said Ellison Brown, 21, an African-American junior from Jackson. “These are new times, we need a new image. But we also just need a mascot.”At a home football game against Vanderbilt on Saturday, tens of thousands of red-clad fans tailgated on the campus’s rolling hills, surrounded by oak trees and white-columned academic buildings. (Don’t ask an Ole Miss fan about the score — the home team lost, 28-14.)Margaret Ann Morgan, 19, the other head of the mascot selection committee, argued that students were more willing than older alumni to consider a replacement.“It’s so easy to get caught up in ‘Colonel Reb, Colonel Reb, nobody but Colonel Reb,’ ” she said. “In the long run, a new mascot would be very beneficial for our university.”The question is not really whether Colonel Reb will rise again — no chance, says the chancellor — but whether any other mascot could satisfy fans.“You hear stories about little girls in Mississippi thinking he’s their grandfather,” said Brian Ferguson 27, an alumnus who founded the Colonel Reb Foundation. “He’s a member of our family.”If ending the tradition is hard, fans say, starting a new one is harder. Perhaps the greatest enthusiasm for any proposal has been for an idea that began as a joke: making a “Star Wars” character named Admiral Ackbar the mascot. After drawing support from thousands on Facebook, the Ackbar campaign fizzled. In an ESPN commercial about the mascot selection, a horrified Ole Miss cheerleader refers to him as “the catfish-lookin’ creature.”In July, the student mascot committee unveiled five other possible replacements: a bear, a lion, a horse, a land shark (a reference to the team’s tenacious defensive line) and Hotty and Toddy (derived from the name of the school cheer). The response was overwhelmingly negative, with fans and the news media ridiculing the options as either too generic or too absurd.Mr. Jones, the chancellor, said he expected any new mascot would take time to catch on. In 2003, a previous chancellor tried to replace Colonel Reb with two different mascots, named Bruiser Rebel and Rowdy Rebel, and both were rejected by students.“It’s a long process for people to embrace a new mascot,” Mr. Jones said. “You invest a lot of energy in having people embrace an image and then you undo it. You’ve created your own problem in many ways. But in most universities with new mascots, after a period of time, there is relatively broad acceptance.”Even Mr. New, one of the mascot committee leaders, said he sympathized with people who want Colonel Reb reinstated. In fact, Mr. New is a candidate in a student contest on Tuesday to be named this year’s Colonel Reb, an honorary title that is separate from the mascot.“It’s ironic,” he admitted. “But I like Colonel Reb, too. I think we’re going to have to like Colonel Reb and just embrace the new mascot, too.”'"
"'10-09-20,'1','The New York Collegium, a period-instrument band that sometimes performed with a chorus, acknowledged in a news release signed by two of its directors on Saturday what had become apparent over several seasons: that it would no longer function as an independent entity. The Collegium, whose Web site still lists the English early-music specialist Andrew Parrott as its music director, gave its first concert in early 1999 and performed series through the 2006-7 season. The name has since surfaced almost solely in connection with an annual workshop, the Clarion-Collegium Week, instituted in 2008 and shared with the Clarion Music Society. That society, founded in 1957 by the period-instrument pioneer Newell Jenkins, who died in 1996, has been revivified under Steven Fox, its artistic director since 2005. The Collegium “will dissolve and continue its legacy under the umbrella” of the Clarion society, the release said. The directors, evidently speaking for the full board, pointed to the Collegium’s successes, but added, “We nevertheless believe that the current economic environment will not support the sustainability of an independent Collegium.” Clarion, they said, has made clear its intention to add several Collegium directors to its board, to continue the Clarion-Collegium Week and to “maintain a relationship” with Mr. Parrott.'"
"'10-09-20,'1','“The Town,” Ben Affleck’s robbery thriller, walked away with a stronger-than-expected $23.8 million in ticket sales over the weekend, enough to make it an easy No. 1 at the North American box office. Mr. Affleck (above, in the film with Rebecca Hall) directed, acted in and was a writer of “The Town,” which Warner Brothers backed with an aggressive marketing campaign. (An Oscar push is next.) “Easy A,” a teenage comedy from Sony Pictures Entertainment, was second, with about $18 million in sales, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles box-office statistics. “Devil,” a horror entry produced by M. Night Shyamalan and distributed by Universal Pictures, finished third, with $12.6 million. Sony’s “Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D” plummeted to fourth place in its second weekend, selling about $10 million in tickets for a new domestic total of about $44 million. Rounding out the Top 5 was “Alpha and Omega,” an animated movie that Lionsgate has marketed to very young children, with about $9 million in sales.'"
"'10-09-20,'1','“The Event,” which begins Monday on NBC, is in some part a series about a young couple just starting out, but to describe it that way would be like calling “24” a drama about an unusual number of traffic hassles occurring during a single day. As the series unfolds, Sean (Jason Ritter), a rumpled but well-meaning romantic, and Leila (Sarah Roemer), an earthy blonde, are about to become engaged, except that — and here I quote from NBC press materials with verbiage I could not surpass — “their futures are on a collision course in a global conspiracy that could ultimately change the fate of mankind.” Couples counseling is unlikely to provide solace.Suffice it to say that the unexplained “event” whose presumably labyrinthine mystery propels the story along is not a wedding at the Hilton. A thriller that leaves no device of the genre underdeployed, “The Event” zigzags between the personal and the political, and back and forth across the calendar among cruise ships, military drones, planes and automobiles. It travels to a house in Atlanta, a prison in Alaska, a beach on St. Lucia, and Coral Gables, Fla., where the Cuban-American president, played by Blair Underwood with a kind of no-nonsense humanism, maintains his nautically suggestive retreat. You accumulate frequent-flier miles just by watching.“The Event” is an intensely aggressive effort to fill the void left by “24” and “Lost,” which both ended earlier this year. Eight minutes and 18 seconds into the initial hour we hear someone say, “Who I am doesn’t matter.” And by the time that hour is completed, we have been made privy to a litany of familiar declamations, all spoken by people whose tension levels suggest an ontological incompatibility with downtime. The pacing is as frenetic as the talk, and the threat of numerology looms. There is something very wrong with Flight 514 and something Kafka-esque about Cabin 5314, where Sean and Leila are spending a shipboard holiday that seems vaguely headed toward the territory of Roman Polanski’s “Bitter Moon.”Unlike “Rubicon” — a relatively new series on AMC whose dark cinematography and protracted silences are steeped in the tradition of the paranoia films of the 1970s — “The Event” is bright and showy and too in thrall to its own hysteria to feel unsettling. It doesn’t quiet down enough to disturb, and as a result its claims to relevance seem merely perfunctory.“The Event” checks off efforts at topicality. We are given something short of full-clearance access to a secretive and vague facsimile of Guantánamo somewhere in Alaska, where the government has behaved ungraciously toward a population of illegal detainees. The new president wants to set things right, but it seems he will succeed as easily as the cast of “Jersey Shore” could locate Osama bin Laden with a GPS unit. This feels certain even before a creepy presidential aide delivers the final confirmation: “The C.I.A. has overseen this program for many years,” he tells the commander in chief. “I can assure you everything is under control.”Of course absolutely nothing is under control, and just as family provided no coverage in “24” — where wives stabbed husbands, and fathers tortured sons and so on — we find it under siege here. In another era it was possible to produce a thriller of this kind and forgo images of children in peril, but today our anxieties are so unevenly divided between potential threats to domestic life and broader distrust of institutions that it seems almost a prerequisite for bad things to happen in living rooms. On this count, “The Event” brings it on.Created by Nick Wauters; Evan Katz, Steve Stark and Jeffrey Reiner, executive producers; Mr. Wauters, Jim Wong, Dan Dworkin, Jay Beattie, David Goodman and David Schulner, co-executive producers; Jim Chory, producer (pilot); Steve Sassen, producer (series); Lisa Zwerling (consulting producer).

"'10-09-20,'1','Back in the Stone Age — when cellphones were novelties, newspapers still defined the Internet in each article and the CD-ROM was the big new thing in computing technology — there was a cultural moment when it was thought that interactive technology could reshape the process of learning.That concept was called edutainment, and it failed because it usually tried to trick children into some kind of knowledge acquisition by tarting up things that should be in textbooks with flashing lights and explosions. It quickly became clear that having basic arithmetic problems floating from the top of a screen in pretty colors was not going to make kids learn math any faster. The Carmen Sandiego series (Where in the World, and so forth) was a rare exception, because its sphere of knowledge, geography, was ideal for an adventure-game format.So edutainment became a banished word in the game industry as it was realized that games are not best used as the equivalent of electronic flash cards. But a well-designed game, electronic or traditional, can be good for the brain in other ways. Pattern recognition, problem solving, setting strategic priorities, spatial awareness and the integration of logic and imagination are all faculties that can be exercised in the cause of pure fun.And few games make exercising the brain as delightfully engaging as the Professor Layton series for the Nintendo DS handheld. The latest installment, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future, was released recently in North America by Nintendo and is the most absorbing, fully realized title in the franchise yet. With more than 165 mostly ingenious interactive puzzles and brain-teasers wrapped within a heartwarming tale, Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is the sort of game I would want to play with my children (if I had any).Nintendo DS is largely a children’s system. Think your kid is precocious? Replace her version of Pokémon with a Professor Layton game and see how much fun you two can have together.Since making its debut in Japan in 2007, the Professor Layton games have become a hit for good reason. Professor Layton is based on a series of puzzle books that are best sellers in Japan — “Head Gymnastics,” written by Akira Tago, a professor emeritus at Chiba University. Akihiro Hino, chief executive of Level-5, the games’ Japanese developer, was a fan of the books and knew how to translate them into a winning game.'"
"'10-09-20,'1','An insomniac’s fantasy of a dream lover hovering over your bed night after night; a prayer for true love that is answered by the sudden appearance of the perfect mate; a mystical moment of romantic déjà vu: those are experiences described in “Dancing on the Ceiling,” “Blue Moon” and “Where or When,” three of the most famous songs by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart. To hear Karen Akers sing them in her revelatory Rodgers and Hart show, “Dancing on the Ceiling” at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, is almost like listening to them for the first time.Ms. Akers, accompanied by Don Rebic on piano and Dick Sarpola on bass, doesn’t take a phrase of Hart’s lyrics for granted. Her wistful, witty, carefully considered interpretations are tender deconstructions that turn “moon, June, spoon” conventions into private thoughts.Singing “Blue Moon” on Wednesday evening, Ms. Akers turned her face skyward, and wearing a slightly crazy smile, issued a prayer to the heavens (“You knew just what I was there for”). The moon responded by delivering “the only one my arms will ever hold” — the spirit made flesh. Mr. Rebic’s delicately jaunty pianism, with its echoes of Satie, consistently held back, leaving her room to explore.The show, directed by Eric Michael Gillett, is more than a scrupulous reconsideration of a classic songwriting canon. Acting the songs from deep inside, her expression continually changing, Ms. Akers added a subtle element of humor. She tacitly acknowledged that it may be insane to believe in all that romantic stuff, especially nowadays. But underneath the hard-shelled cynicism of the hook-up age, she implied, the same currents of longing and loneliness still run deep. The biographical element was cursory, leaving the songs to suggest the story of Hart’s unhappy, alcoholic life.The show is roughly divided into two sections. The first concentrates on songs of willful naïveté in which dreams come true and happily-ever-after is right at hand. Gradually the idealism dissipates, and descriptions about the ups and downs of actual relationships take over. On Wednesday, Ms. Akers invested “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,” “I Wish I Were in Love Again” and “It Never Entered My Mind” with their full measure of disillusion, without sounding bitter or melodramatic.In her upbeat readings, the hard emotional lessons of domesticity — “the pulled-out fur of cat and cur” — were valuable training sessions for the next go-round. In Ms. Akers’s shows a certain demureness always obtains. In her first-person-singular version of “The Lady Is a Tramp,” she hesitated a split second before applying to herself the word “tramp” — lightly.'"
"'10-09-20,'1','Though the letters made no specific reference to suicide, and the group has no history of violence, the apocalyptic talk incited fears of the worst in a part of the country that has seen cult suicides in the past.In 1997, 39 members of a group called Heaven’s Gate killed themselves by ingesting barbiturates and liquor in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., just outside San Diego.The 24-hour search this weekend — with helicopters, horses and police officers on foot — covered a large swath around Antelope Valley, including the Vazquez Rocks area, where the group had previously gone for late-night prayer retreats. All of the women were immigrants from El Salvador, and the children ranged from 3 to 18 years old.The search, involving deputies from five offices, ended when the police found the group after a local resident saw a news report on TV and called the sheriff’s station to say that she had seen the women at Jackie Robinson Park in Palmdale.Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said the group was sitting on blankets praying. The group had moved around to pray at several different sites, he said.“It looks like it was an elongated prayer session,” Mr. Whitmore said. “The initial worry was that perhaps they were going to do harm to themselves, but they were just here sitting on blankets, and everyone was fine. They had no idea about the search that had been going on.”A sheriff’s deputy on a routine patrol had also come across the group early Saturday morning, before they had been reported missing. “They said they were praying to stop violence in schools and for people to abstain from sexual activity until marriage,” Mr. Whitmore said.The police took Ms. Chicas, the presumed leader of the group, back to the sheriff’s station for questions. Mr. Whitmore said that as of Sunday afternoon, they had not pressed any charges.The police also said they were still questioning leaders of the group to sort out inconsistencies in their accounts, and declined to comment on the meaning of the handwritten notes or the other belongings left behind.Former neighbors of Ms. Chicas said they were surprised that she might have become the leader of a cult. She had been a member of Iglesia De Cristo Miel, a Christian congregation in Palmdale, before suddenly leaving the church two years ago.Ricardo Giron, who used to live next door to Ms. Chicas, described her as a religious woman and a devoted mother. He said she had not been educated past the fifth grade.“She was a good mother, and always had her children with her,” Mr. Giron said. “I do not believe she would harm them.”'"

"'10-09-21,'1','“The report will clearly demonstrate how market conditions and events prior to the flash crash led to the extreme price moves,” he said.When pressed, he added, notably, that he had found no evidence of a deliberate attempt by anybody to disrupt markets.The implications of the report are not merely academic. Ordinary investors, shaken by the brief stock plunge and the lack of an official explanation, have withdrawn money from stock mutual funds every week since the crash. Market analysts say investors want to be reassured about the integrity of the nation’s markets so they can be confident that a nose dive will not happen again.The Berman report will not be the final word on the matter. Its findings will be used by a group of advisers to the S.E.C. and the commodity futures commission, which will make policy recommendations.Still, some analysts question whether the report can deliver a simple answer that will satisfy everyone eager for reassurance.“What everybody would love to hear from the S.E.C. is XYZ trader blew up the market and made a gazillion dollars and is now in jail,” said Larry Tabb, chief executive of the Tabb Group, a specialist on the markets. “The answer, I think, is much more complicated and nuanced and has to do with a lot of different things. I am not sure that everybody outside the industry is going to have the patience to understand that.”Mr. Berman acknowledges that his team’s explanation will involve a number of things happening at once. It may strike many people as painfully complex, but that is an undeniable result of the byzantine nature of today’s disparate electronic markets and the many players who take part in them.The report’s conclusions will involve “market participants doing very different things and for very, very different reasons,” he said.Central to all of this is the fact that stock trading is no longer centralized but instead takes place on dozens of exchanges, all with varying policies and procedures. For example, the New York Stock Exchange has circuit breakers that prevent stocks from rising or falling so quickly that they disrupt the broader market.Trading was slowed on several listings on that exchange on May 6, while other markets kept trading lower. That lack of coordination created confusion during the flash crash. Since then, the S.E.C. has extended circuit breakers for individual stocks across all markets.In investigating the crash, Mr. Berman says he finds himself in a position similar to his physics work 20 years ago, when he was collecting huge amounts of data and comparing the competing views of many laboratories on a question dividing particle physics — whether the neutrino, one of the least known and most common elementary particles, actually had mass.Today he finds himself in familiar territory, sifting through huge amounts of messy and disjointed data, and at the same time reading blogs and e-mails from a wide range of observers, each with a theory about what happened on May 6.Despite his formal training as a physicist, Mr. Berman is no stranger to stock markets. After academia, he spent 16 years on Wall Street, first devising algorithmic trading strategies for hedge funds, then working for RiskMetrics Group, where he created software and dispensed risk-management advice to asset managers, banks and hedge funds.Having worked with hedge funds and high-frequency traders, Mr. Berman came to his current job a year ago with practical market knowledge and a familiarity with the world of stock trading. Several prominent market players say they found Mr. Berman’s rare combination of experiences refreshing — and reassuring.“He had a sense that actions in markets provoke reactions and they are done for reasons, benign or not benign,” said Frank Hatheway, chief economist at Nasdaq, one of the exchanges that provided data for the inquiry.Even though Mr. Berman’s Wall Street background was paramount, S.E.C. officials said his measured communication skills were also important. They have helped him in the complex task of coordinating the commission’s cross-divisional flash crash investigation team and presenting a clear narrative about what happened.“He can analyze the data in a way that tells a story,” said Robert W. Cook, Mr. Berman’s boss and the director of the S.E.C.’s trading and markets division.The investigation has had two prongs. One strategy has been to collect all kinds of market data from May 6 and analyze it for patterns.“They must be completely awash with data on their spreadsheets, a trove of data,” said Lawrence Leibowitz, chief operating officer of NYSE Euronext, another exchange that provided information for the investigation. “We sent them over raw data with analysis on top of it.”The second line of investigation has involved “many dozens” of interviews with people involved in the markets on May 6, including market makers, the exchanges, high-frequency traders, banks and fund managers, to ask what they did on May 6 and why.More than one interviewee was surprised to find Mr. Berman and 10 more S.E.C. officials on one conference call to discuss the crash — their number was a sign of how badly the commission, after a few difficult years, wants to get this investigation right.“Many market participants told us, ‘We’re not quite sure what happened over all, but this is what my firm saw and the actions we took,’ ” Mr. Berman said. “It was like ‘C.S.I.’ We wanted to interview everyone around.”Mr. Berman said the level of detail gleaned from his investigation will help provide the explanation for what occurred on May 6, even if it may not deliver the simple answer that many people would like.“This level of fact proved to be very, very telling,” he said. “We started to build up a complete picture.”'"
"'10-09-21,'1','The announcement also implies that any contraction that might lie ahead would be a separate and distinct recession, and one that the Obama administration could not claim to have inherited. While economists generally say such a double-dip recession seems unlikely, new monthly estimates of gross domestic product, released by two committee members, show that output shrank in May and June, the most recent months for which data are available. Output and other factors would have to shrink for a longer period of time before another contraction might be declared.Even without a full-blown double dip in the economy, the recovery thus far has been so anemic that the job picture seems likely to stagnate, and perhaps even get worse, in the near future.Many forecasters estimate that output needs to grow over the long run by about 2.5 percent to keep the unemployment rate, now at 9.6 percent, constant. The economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.6 percent in the second quarter of this year, and private forecasts indicate growth will not be much better in the third quarter. (The Business Cycle Dating Committee itself does not engage in forecasting.)“The amount of unemployment we’ve already got and the slowness of recovery lead to predictions that we could have 9-plus percent unemployment even through the next presidential election,” said Robert J. Gordon, an economics professor at Northwestern University and a committee member.“What’s really unique about this recession is the amount of unemployment in combination with the slowness of the recovery,” he said. “That’s just not happened before. We had a sharp recession followed by a sharp recovery in the 1980s. And in ’91 and ’01 we had slow recoveries, but those recessions were shallow recessions, so the slowness didn’t matter much.”All three of these most recent recoveries have been known as jobless recoveries, as employment growth has significantly lagged output growth. In this recovery, the job market bottomed six months after economic output bottomed. That is still not nearly as much of a lag as experienced after the 2001 recession, when it took the job market 19 months to turn around after output improved.This new pattern of jobless recoveries has led to some complaints that employment should play a more prominent role in dating business cycles and to criticism that a jobless recovery is not truly a recovery at all. Business Cycle Dating Committee members have been reluctant to change their criteria too drastically, though, because they want to maintain consistency in the official chronology of contractions and expansions.While all three recent recoveries have been weak for employment, the job market has to cover the most ground from the latest recession.From December 2007 to June 2009, the American economy lost more than 5 percent of its nonfarm payroll jobs, the largest decline since World War II. And through December 2009, the month that employment hit bottom, the nation had lost more than 6 percent of its jobs.The unemployment rate, which comes from a different survey, peaked last October at 10.1 percent. The postwar high was in 1982, at 10.8 percent. But the composition of the work force was very different in the 1980s — it was younger, and younger people tend to have higher unemployment rates — and so if adjusted for age, unemployment this time around actually looks much worse.The broadest measure of unemployment, including people who are reluctantly working part time when they wish to be working full time and those who have given up looking for work altogether, also was at its highest level since World War II.There is some debate, though, about whether this recession was the worst in terms of output.Adjusted for inflation, output contracted more than in any other postwar period, according to Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economics professor and committee chairman.But some economists say that a better measure would be the gap between where output is and where it could have been if growth had been uninterrupted.“It’s definitely not as deep as 1981-82 when measured relative to the economy’s potential growth rate,” Mr. Gordon said.Besides employment, nearly every indicator that the committee considers simultaneously reached a low point in June 2009, which made that month a relatively easy selection as the official turning point, Mr. Gordon said. The committee previously met in April but had decided that the data were inconclusive.In its statement on Monday affirming the recession’s end, the bureau took care to note that the recession, by definition, meant only the period until the economy reached its low point — not a return to its previous vigor.“In declaring the recession over, we’re not at all saying the unemployment rate, or anything else, has returned to normal,” said James H. Stock, an economics professor at Harvard and a member of the business cycle committee.“We clearly still have a long ways to go.”'"
"'10-09-21,'1','International credit rating agencies on Monday gave their top grade to Europe’s sovereign bailout fund, but the move failed to halt the strain on the ailing government bonds of Ireland and Portugal.The European Financial Stability Facility, as the fund is known, was rated AAA by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings.The ratings are preliminary because no member state has yet called on the facility for help, and it has thus issued no debt.“The central scenario for me and euro zone finance ministers is that we don’t need to become operational,” Klaus Regling, the stability fund’s chief executive, told Reuters on Monday. He said there was no point in the fund’s issuing bonds unless and until it was called upon to help a member state.The facility, announced May 9, is essentially the sum of the commitments of euro zone governments to finance a bailout. It works out to 440 billion euros, or $575 billion, with Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, responsible for the largest contribution, at about 123 billion euros.'"
"'10-09-21,'1','Both formulas require the same seven pieces of information: age, sex, total cholesterol, “good” HDL cholesterol, smoking status, systolic blood pressure and whether one takes drugs for hypertension.The simplified system was developed so doctors and patients would not need a computer to calculate heart attack risk. Each risk factor corresponds to a number of points; the more points you have, the higher your risk of a heart attack.Now that computers and hand-held electronic devices are all but universal, however, the original, more complicated formula is accessible to nearly everyone. Yet the simplified tool remains in broad use because it has been programmed into many Web sites and computer applications. And because most of these programs do not tell the user which method is being employed, it is impossible to tell the difference.Among the sites that use the simplified tool are those of the American Heart Association, the Mayo Clinic and many drug companies.The medical-software company Epocrates even uses it in specialized applications created for physicians for use on mobile devices to aid treatment decisions. (A spokeswoman said Epocrates used the points formula because physicians were more familiar with it).The new study, published last month in The Journal of General Internal Medicine, suggests that the simplified system paints with too broad a brush.Consider a hypothetical 45-year-old male smoker with total cholesterol of 179 and HDL of 38: he starts with 3 points for his age, adds 5 for smoking and 5 more for the cholesterol readings, for a total of 13 points — and a 12 percent chance of having a heart attack by age 55.But under the original Framingham formula, his chance is actually just 7 percent, the study found. The discrepancy is significant, because cholesterol-lowering medicine is apt to be prescribed once a patient reaches a 10 percent risk.The number of Americans potentially affected is in the millions. Ten percent of adults are shifted into higher-risk groups by the simplified system; at the same time, the system underestimates the risk for 5 percent of adults, who might benefit from more aggressive therapy. Women are disproportionately represented among the low-risk patients who are shifted into a higher-risk category.“Even if it’s just a 5 percent difference of undertreatment versus overtreatment — why use a less accurate method?” said Dr. Kevin Fiscella, a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester. “Especially when it’s quite easy to use a more accurate method with electronic devices.” Dr. Fiscella is a co-author of an editorial in the same journal about the study.The risk calculator on americanheart.org, the heart association’s Web site, carries the logo of the Pharmaceutical Roundtable, a drug industry group, with a note that says, “The Pharmaceutical Roundtable is a proud sponsor of this risk calculator.”In a telephone interview, Dr. Fiscella said he suspected the drug industry of promoting the less accurate method to expand the market share of patients who are eligible for cholesterol-lowering statin drugs.“Let’s face it, the number of people is very high, in the millions, and from a pharmaceutical marketing perspective it does make a difference,” he said. “We have no data on whether they did their own internal analyses to determine which tool had a bigger impact on their market share or not, but it’s certainly conceivable. That’s the real world.”A spokeswoman for the heart association said that it received funds from the Pharmaceutical Roundtable for the development of the risk assessment tool, but that “after the funding was committed, the PRT had no input whatsoever on the content.”Dr. Daniel Levy, the director of the Framingham Heart Study at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, disputed the significance of the new paper, noting that the simplified formula produced results similar to the original one. “As you move from a point score to a continuous risk function, you’re moving to a more accurate assessment tool,” he said in an interview. “There’s no surprise there.“It seems like much ado about nothing,” he added. “The two approaches were concordant 86 percent of the time.”Experts note that the formulas are aimed at patients at intermediate risk of heart attack, and that people at very high risk — those with diabetes or a previous heart attack, for example — would not need a risk calculator to qualify for aggressive management.Asked why the pen-and-paper formula had been embedded into computers, Dr. Levy said that people who do not own computers might use it in a public library and want to make a paper printout of the guidelines.But Dr. Jesse Polansky of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, one of five authors of the study, called the simplified system “an antique.”“At the end of the day, patients and practitioners need to have the most accurate risk assessment available to them,” he said, “or we’re at greater risk for clinical misadventures.”'"
"'10-09-21,'1','Mr. Alekseyev said he was preparing to board a flight to Geneva on Sept. 15 when security officials told him his baggage needed further inspection. He was taken to a room and held for more than two hours, he said, before four men in civilian clothes arrived.“You can take him,” an airport security official said, according to Mr. Alekseyev. When he asked where they were taking him, he said, one of the men answered, “You’ll see.”Officials at the airport told Russian news agencies that Mr. Alekseyev had been detained for refusing to abide by security procedures. He denied that.He said he was able to make a few quick phone calls to Russian news agencies before the four men whisked him out of the airport and drove him to a police station in Kashira, a town about 80 miles from Moscow.Once there, he said, the men “exerted constant psychological pressure,” demanding that he drop his lawsuits with the European Court.The men also confiscated his cellphone and sent a series of bizarre text messages to Russian news agencies, including one that said Mr. Alekseyev had dropped his claims against the Moscow government and had fled to Belarus to seek political asylum. By that point, the story began to be picked up by major Russian and foreign news agencies.Later, he said, he was moved to a police department in Tula, about 115 miles from Moscow, where he was held until Friday, when he was driven to the outskirts of town and told to “get out.”“They let me go, as I understand, because of the noise that was raised over my detainment,” Mr. Alekseyev said.Back in Moscow, Mr. Alekseyev said he still had little idea exactly who was behind his detention. The men never identified themselves, and Moscow’s tight-lipped police force has issued no statements on the matter.Mr. Alekseyev said he and several other people planned to go ahead with a rally scheduled for Tuesday outside city hall to protest, among other things, Mr. Luzhkov’s use of the word “fags” to describe gay rights advocates.The authorities, unsurprisingly, have not granted them permission to do so.'"
"'10-09-21,'1','Stocks extended their September rally into a fourth week Monday as investors hoped for more moves by the Federal Reserve to prop up the economy.Buying accelerated after the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the market measure most often used by professional traders, broke through the high end of its recent range. Technical analysts see that as a bullish sign for the market.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 146 points to its highest close since May. Buyers were also encouraged by an announcement from a group of economists declaring that the most recent recession ended in June 2009.The Fed meets Tuesday to discuss interest rates, and investors are hoping for a sign that the central bank might make more moves to keep rates low. There is a growing expectation that the Fed’s rate-setting committee could revive programs to buy Treasuries and mortgage bonds in an effort to stimulate the economy. At the least, it might hint at future plans.“The Fed will hint at it, put it on the table, but not do anything,” said Brian Gendreau, a market strategist at Financial Network Investment.'"

"'10-09-22,'0','It would be presumptuous, General Manager Brian Cashman was saying, for the Yankees to begin conferring about their playoff roster. Until they qualify, every sentence ends with a question mark. “Everything you see as we move forward obviously is going to the discussion bin,” Cashman said.Into that bin on Tuesday night went six and a third innings from Phil Hughes, who is practically certain to pitch in the postseason — assuming the Yankees, you know, make it — and one from Javier Vazquez, who is battling for a hypothetical spot on the hypothetical roster. The Yankees’ 8-3 victory against Tampa Bay drew them closer to converting expectations into reality and increased their lead over the Rays in the American League East to two and a half games. Any combination of three Yankees victories and Boston losses will clinch a berth.If — when — that happens, the conversations will begin, and Cashman, Manager Joe Girardi and his coaches will assess the viability of every player and determine whether he fits. After 28 starts, the Yankees surely have a sense of Hughes, who, had he at all needed to, improved his standing by holding the Rays to three runs, striking out six and minimizing the impact of his five walks. His curveball was not sharp, but his cutter and changeup were, and those pitches will be valuable in October. The Yankees say that Hughes’s mounting innings count — 169 1/3 — will have no bearing on his postseason role, although they still may tinker with his remaining schedule to ease his workload.“As much as I can build some momentum and throw the ball well, whatever my role is I’m just hoping to be effective when the time comes,” said Hughes, who figures to join C. C. Sabathia, Andy Pettitte and A. J. Burnett in the rotation.Left out of that rotation will be Vazquez, who was an anchor as recently as late July. Now he might not even pitch for the Yankees beyond next weekend. When he comes to the ballpark these days, he never knows if he will pitch. Relievers know that life well. They endure it every day.Since moving to the bullpen after his Sept. 10 start in Texas — his second trip to the bullpen in three weeks — Vazquez had gone unused until replacing Hughes with one on and one out in the seventh. And since last Wednesday, when Vazquez became a bullpen option, the Yankees entered Tuesday having had 15 relief appearances among six pitchers. Five of those pitchers — Mariano Rivera, Joba Chamberlain, Dave Robertson, Kerry Wood and Boone Logan — are practically guaranteed spots on the playoff roster. The sixth is Chad Gaudin, who pitched twice in that stretch.'"
"'10-09-22,'0','Education is not the only area in which China is making inroads in Central and Eastern Europe. From the Baltic states to the Balkans, Chinese companies, flush with money, are buying real estate and competing for public infrastructure contracts, especially as Poland and Ukraine work at breakneck speed to jointly play host to the 2012 European soccer championship.They are also investing in the manufacturing of products like electronics and chemicals to gain a foothold inside Europe’s expansive single market.In Poland last year, a Chinese consortium won the contract to build two sections of a highway from Lodz to Warsaw. It was not a huge deal, but it was the first time that a non-Polish or non-European company received a contract that will be partly financed by the European Union.“Some Polish companies were not happy,” said Henryka Bochniarz, president of the Polish Confederation of Private Employers. “They said the Chinese were subsidized by the Chinese government. But frankly, as long as they meet the procurement rules, you can’t exclude them.”Ms. Bochniarz added that the Chinese companies also hired Polish workers and engineers. Indeed, Chinese companies are becoming increasingly active in Poland, where the work force is well educated and still relatively inexpensive compared with those in Western European countries.Trade flows have also changed. “China used to mainly export textiles, shoes and tea to Poland,” said Tomasz Ostaszewicz, director of the bilateral economic cooperation department at the Polish Economy Ministry. “Now China is our main supplier of electronic goods.”As recently as 2007, Chinese investment in Poland, and across Eastern Europe as well, was insignificant.“Chinese investments in Poland amounted to 70 million euros in 2007,” or about $92 million at current exchange rates, Mr. Ostaszewicz said. “The envisaged amount of Chinese investment for 2010 could amount to 500 million euros.” That, he added, would create 3,230 jobs.The investments, which usually take the form of joint ventures, are spread across manufacturing sectors, from electronics and machinery to packaging, plastics and paper production.In Hungary, the Wanhua Industrial Group recently acquired a strategic stake in BorsodChem, a leading polyurethane producer in Central and Eastern Europe.Wanhua, which is based in the northeastern city Yantai, between Beijing and Shanghai, is the largest producer in the Asia-Pacific region of isocyanates, a polyurethane raw material used by the construction and automobile industry as well as for making household appliances and footwear.The company sells to the United States and Middle Eastern markets, and was looking for a presence in Europe, said Howard Ding, deputy general manager of Wanhua.“BorsodChem gives us a manufacturing base in Europe,” he said. “It means better access to the European market and better means to serve our customers.”BorsodChem’s headquarters is in Kazincbarcika, a town in northeastern Hungary that was built in 1949 as a local center for the fertilizer and chemical production sector. It was privatized in 1991, sold shares to the public five years later and was bought in 2006 by two private equity funds, Permira and Vienna Capital Partners, which began to restructure the company.They then started looking for investors to help pay for the construction of a plant and to provide much needed capital for a company that is highly leveraged. It has loans totaling close to 1 billion euros.In June, Wanhua provided 140 million euros to complete the construction of an isocyanate plant. In exchange, Wanhua received a 38 percent stake in First Chemical, the holding company for BorsodChem, and an option to buy the remaining shares within the next 24 months.Wolfgang Büchele, the chief executive of BorsodChem, said that without Wanhua, the company would have found it difficult to grow. “We become a member of a group with a global view compared to BorsodChem, which is a regional player,” Mr. Büchele said.Chinese companies and the Chinese authorities are shopping around in other countries in the region. Last year, China signed a memorandum of understanding to lend $1 billion to Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe. China’s central bank agreed last year to a three-year currency swap of $2.3 billion to Belarus.Ma Changlin, economic and trade counselor at the Chinese embassy in Warsaw, said China “is interested in using the region as a springboard to the rest of the European Union.”Countries like Hungary, eager for the business even before the global financial crisis sent the economy into a tailspin, have gone to great lengths to make them feel welcome.The bilingual school is close to the Asia Center, a huge new shopping mall and business park catering to the needs of the growing Chinese community, which local officials estimate at several thousand people.Strabag, the giant European construction company, invested 200 million euros in the complex, which covers 1.35 million square feet. It opened in 2003 and now has more than 500 showrooms representing a dozen Asian countries.A walk though the sparkling clean building reveals a variety of products on display, including textiles, electronics, jewelry, furniture, crafts and accessories. Nearby is a Trade Promotion Center to advance contacts between Western and Asian companies.In Poland, by contrast, government and business are less engaged in reaching out to Chinese investors, Mr. Ma said. “There is no strategic vision for investment,” he said in a recent speech to the Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency. He cited a lack of knowledge on both sides, as well as cultural differences and, on top of everything, the language barrier.That is something the Hungarians are trying to overcome. At the Hungarian-Chinese school, Eszter Felfoldi, 9, said she had already decided what she wanted to do when she finished her studies.“I want to be an interpreter,” she said. “When I am taken to a Chinese restaurant, I already can ask for some of the dishes in Chinese.”'"

"'10-09-22,'0','Investigations by Israel and the Palestinians into violations of human rights during the Gaza conflict of 2008 and 2009 were inadequate in several respects, an expert committee led by the United Nations Human Rights Council said Tuesday. The committee’s conclusion could lead to calls for the suspected violations to be referred to the International Criminal Court in The Hague. More than 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict after Israel started a military operation in Gaza in what it said was an attempt to halt rocket fire by the governing Islamist group, Hamas, on nearby Israeli towns. The committee said each side’s investigation into allegations of war crimes, human rights violations and possibly crimes against humanity remains “incomplete” or falls “significantly short of meeting international standards.”'"
"'10-09-22,'0','The path ahead for the litigation in all three cases is long, difficult to predict and risky, legal experts say. The ultimate question is whether a majority of justices on the United States Supreme Court will agree with the district court judges’ interpretation of the court’s own rulings in cases like Lawrence v. Texas, a case that struck down a state sodomy law.That decision marked a turning point in federal litigation on gay and lesbian legal issues, said Daniel R. Pinello, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice of the City University of New York. Before Lawrence, the federal courts had seemed largely inhospitable to gay rights cases, he said.“The most strategic approach was to look at state action, not federal action, because a United States Supreme Court and federal judiciary dominated by Republican appointees did not provide a very favorable risk analysis for litigation,” Professor Pinello said.In the 6-to-3 majority opinion in Lawrence, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote of due process rights associated with “autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression and certain intimate conduct.”While Justice Kennedy argued that the decision did “not involve whether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter,” Justice Antonin Scalia angrily predicted in dissent that the majority opinion would, in fact, justify homosexual marriage.Early interpretations of that decision have been tentative — the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit said Lawrence could not even be interpreted to overturn an Alabama ban on sex toys.Since then, judges have shown themselves more willing to interpret Justice Kennedy’s opinion in Lawrence as recognizing rights regarding personal relationships. Judge Vaughn Walker, the federal district judge in San Francisco who overturned Proposition 8, the California ban on same-sex marriage, quoted Justice Scalia’s dissent in his decision.To Richard Epstein, a libertarian legal scholar at New York University, the logic of the Kennedy opinion in Lawrence inexorably leads to a grant of rights against discrimination.“There’s just no way, once you start down that road, that you’re going to get off of it,” he said. “If you can’t criminalize it, you can’t discriminate against it.”While saying that he is “no seer,” he predicted that if the three cases made their way to the Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy would ultimately write majority opinions that upheld the three recent district court opinions.He added, however, that in his view as a self-described “Constitutional fuddy-duddy,” the argument for finding legal rights based on sexual orientation is not as compelling as racial rights under the equal protection clause.“Politically, I am in sympathy with them,” he said. “Constitutionally, I’m not.”The district court judges are reflecting an increasingly obvious shift in public opinion, said Andrew Koppelman, a professor of law at Northwestern University. “The gay rights movement has been a spectacularly successful movement for cultural change,” he said. “A few decades ago these people were cultural pariahs. It was taken for granted that gay people are mentally ill, contaminated and unclean. Now the cultural valence has flipped — it is that view of gay people which is itself stigmatized.”As life-tenured appointees, judges can look beyond politics to posterity, Professor Koppelman said. “Right now it seems like a good bet that if you are friendly to gay rights claims,” he said, “future generations will honor you for that.”President Obama has had an effect as well, said Jennifer Pizer, director of the national marriage project of the Western regional office of Lamba Legal, a public interest legal group for gay issues.Activists have criticized the president for the Justice Department’s defense of the federal laws being challenged, but he has also urged the repeal of laws that discriminate against gay men and lesbians.“Having the president repeatedly say these rules discriminate and cause harm — so the discussion shifts to choice of processes for removing them rather than justifying them — seems to have changed the discussion,” she said.On that, Ms. Pizer and Tony Perkins, the head of the Family Research Council, agree, though he deplores the trend. “I think he’s creating an environment in which the courts feel comfortable pushing the envelope with these decisions,” Mr. Perkins said.He argued that the change in the courts is little more than judicial activism. “As much as the courts would like to contend that they are not political, it’s simply not true,” he said.Douglas NeJaime, an associate professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, applauded the recent interpretations of Lawrence, but said the legal tactic involves “tremendous risk” as the cases rise to the Supreme Court.“Eventually, the court is going to have to clarify what the court said in Lawrence,” Mr. NeJaime added. “And it might not be what these judges are saying.”Professor Epstein warned that victory for gay rights advocates carried risk as well.“I feel if you waited five years, the whole thing would go away” as public opinion continues to shift, he said. “It would be terrible if this were like the abortion cases, and for the next 40 years you were fighting a rear-guard action.”'"
"'10-09-22,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — President Obama on Tuesday awarded the Medal of Honor to an Air Force chief master sergeant who died saving three fellow airmen in Laos on a secret mission that was kept under wraps for more than 40 years.“Today your nation finally acknowledges and fully honors your father’s bravery,” Mr. Obama told the three sons of the airman, Chief Master Sgt. Richard L. Etchberger, at a White House ceremony.“Even though it’s been 42 years, it’s never too late to do the right thing,” Mr. Obama said.One of the sons said afterward that his father would have been humbled to receive the nation’s highest military honor. “He would be here just saying, ‘I was doing my job up there,’ ” Richard Etchberger told reporters.A native of Hamburg, Pa., Chief Master Sergeant Etchberger was an electronics expert without formal combat training in March 1968 when he single-handedly kept the North Vietnamese enemy at bay while helping evacuate wounded comrades from their radar station on a remote Laotian mountain after coming under attack.The next morning, Chief Master Sergeant Etchberger managed to get three wounded comrades into rescue slings and on their way to safety. But he was fatally wounded after enemy ground fire struck the helicopter trying to lift him to safety. Richard Etchberger, the son, said the family was told only that his father had died in a helicopter crash.'"
"'10-09-22,'0','The Justice Department on Tuesday joined a whistle-blower lawsuit against Pfizer and its subsidiary Wyeth Pharmaceuticals that accuses Wyeth of illegal off-label marketing of Rapamune, a drug used to prevent rejection of kidney transplants.Reuben A. Guttman, lawyer for two former Wyeth employees, predicted that the government action could result in recovery of hundreds of millions of dollars in inappropriate billings to public health programs. Nineteen states, including New York, and the District of Columbia also joined the filing.“It’s always good to have the government on your side,” Mr. Guttman said.Ray Kerins, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company had previously disclosed that it was cooperating with a government review of Wyeth’s promotional practices involving Rapamune. Pfizer also disclosed in February that there was a criminal investigation into the marketing.In a statement, the company said the whistle-blower suit was filed in 2005, four years before Pfizer bought Wyeth for $68 billion. Pfizer could be in violation of a corporate integrity agreement it signed a year ago in a separate case if it was involved in further illegal sales.In that case, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion, including a $1.3 billion criminal fine, the largest in United States history, to settle investigations into illegal marketing of the painkillers Bextra and Lyrica, the schizophrenia drug Geodon and the antibiotic Zyvox.'"
"'10-09-22,'0','Insurers can begin marketing to beneficiaries on Oct. 1 for Medicare coverage that starts Jan. 1.Medicare officials said they had held down premiums and co-payments by negotiating with insurers, which sponsor the Medicare Advantage plans.The law, signed by Mr. Obama in March, gave officials new power to negotiate and to reject bids, as they did in a few cases.“We negotiated more aggressively than in the past,” said Jonathan D. Blum, deputy administrator of the Medicare agency. “As a result, some plans changed their bids to produce more value for beneficiaries.”“On average,” Mr. Blum said, “Medicare Advantage premiums will be 1 percent lower in 2011 than today. Medicare Advantage plans project that enrollment will increase by 5 percent in 2011.”About 11.3 million of the 46 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private Medicare Advantage plans, which offer comprehensive care in return for monthly premiums. While premiums for a particular plan in a particular county may increase next year, beneficiaries may be able to find other plans offering a better deal.In the yearlong fight over health care, Mr. Obama said the government was overpaying Medicare Advantage plans.John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is now a consultant with clients in the insurance industry, said: “Today’s announcement shows that there is a new sheriff in town. Medicare officials were very specific and very forceful. Insurers succumbed to the government’s demands and stayed in the Medicare market because they have become much more dependent on Medicare business.”Payment rates for Medicare Advantage plans will generally be frozen next year at 2010 levels, with rates subject to tighter constraints in subsequent years. The cuts are expected to save $136 billion over 10 years.Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said the negotiations showed that insurers “remain committed to the Medicare Advantage program.”While reviewing bids, Medicare officials said, they identified 300 private plans for further scrutiny.“These plans unfairly proposed to increase out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries while increasing their own profit margins,” Dr. Berwick reported. “We said, ‘No, you have to do better.’ ”Medicare officials secured changes in most of the 300 plans. “After negotiations,” Mr. Blum said, “plans improved their benefits by $13 per member per month, or 5 percent, on average.”Ultimately, seven Medicare plans offered by three insurance companies decided not to change their bids, and “we denied those bids,” Mr. Blum said.Premiums in the commercial insurance market continue rising at a brisk pace, as illustrated by the largest plans in California.Ioannis A. Kazanis, a spokesman for the California Insurance Department, said that starting Oct. 1, commercial premiums would rise an average of 19 percent for individual policies sold by Aetna and by Blue Shield of California, 16 percent for Health Net policies and 14 percent for those sold by Anthem Blue Cross, a unit of WellPoint.In justifying rate increases sought in Connecticut, Anthem said that one provision of the new law, forbidding insurers to impose lifetime limits on coverage of “essential health benefits,” could cause premiums for some policies to rise as much as 22.9 percent.Ms. Sebelius said the impact on premiums, from all the new requirements, should be only 1 percent or 2 percent.'"
"'10-09-22,'0','GRANOLA is one of those foods that is assumed to be inherently good for you, so logic suggests that granola bars are, too. Sadly, that is not necessarily the case: if you’ve ever looked at the label on a granola bar, you know it can contain anything from corn syrup and corn flour to chocolate chips and added coloring. Nothing that will make you sick (at least not immediately), but not exactly health food.Enter the homemade granola bar, a combination of granola, almonds, apricots and crisp brown rice that, like granola itself, is wide open to interpretation as long as you keep the ratio of glue (the almond butter and honey mixture) to granola and mix-ins about the same.The “secret” is the mixture of almond butter (or any nut butter you like; peanut works well, and walnut is beautiful, too) and honey (again, maple syrup will work, as will agave nectar). You toss the granola and other add-ins with this mixture, then simply press it all into a prepared baking dish. “Prepared” in this case means oiling the dish, then lining it with plastic wrap; this allows you to lift the granola bars out of the pan once they’re set.Let the mixture set in the refrigerator for an hour; it will firm up and become easy to cut into whatever shape you like. These bars are more chewy than crunchy, and have way more flavor than store-bought versions. And less is more — without the ingredients you don’t need, they’re definitely a step or two closer to healthy.'"

"'10-09-23,'0','Ten years ago, leaders of rich and poor countries pledged to build a better world by 2015. Among their vital goals: halving extreme poverty and hunger from 1990 levels, reducing by two-thirds the child-mortality rate and slashing maternal mortality by three-quarters and achieving universal primary education.As they gathered at the this week, world leaders had to admit that their progress “falls far short of what is needed” to meet those targets by the deadline. The global set many countries back. But rich nations — including the — have not contributed the money needed to make this a reality.The best way we can see of turning this around is for wealthy nations to make a generous and concrete pledge of aid for the next five years — and then deliver. The 0.7 percent of endorsed by world leaders in 2002 is a good place to start. Unfortunately, the United States and many others, including , and , fall far short of that.It was disappointing that made no hard commitment to increase development aid when he addressed the United Nations conference on Wednesday. The legalistic claims by some of his aides that the United States never really signed on to hard aid targets sends precisely the wrong message. If Washington isn’t willing to fully ante up, there is little hope others will.Still there was a lot in Mr. Obama’s speech that made good sense to us. He made a compelling case for why foreign aid is an essential component of an effective national security strategy. And he outlined a promising new policy to bring coherence to the often incoherent American foreign aid and development system.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','LOS ANGELES — The state controller, John Chiang, released the first of three audits of the City of Bell on Wednesday after several state and local investigations and the indictment of eight current or former city officials on dozens of felony counts.The report found that internal “checks and balances” to ensure legal approval of the payroll and the management of bond funds were “virtually nonexistent,” according to a news release. City officials, the audit concluded, made a habit of “illegally raising taxes” and “entering into questionable contracts and land purchases.”Echoing accusations by Los Angeles district attorney’s investigators, the audit found that Robert Rizzo, Bell’s former chief administrator, “had total control and discretion over how city funds were spent,” and oversaw the most egregious misappropriations of funds in a city where working-class families often rely on city and state services.Mismanagement of funds from a 2003 bond measure has cost Bell taxpayers about $1.7 million in interest, according to the audit. More than $23.5 million of the possible $70 million in the bonds “sat unused” in a noninterest-bearing account as of Aug. 31.Though employment agreements for Mr. Rizzo’s position and for the positions of other top city officials required regular performance evaluations, state auditors said they found none. In the last year alone, the city spent over $5.8 million to compensate six top administrators, the city council and Mayor Oscar Hernandez.Tens of millions of dollars more were funneled to noncompetitive bids by companies owned by city employees, the unapproved purchase of a former mayor’s property for no city use and dubious business license taxes and property tax assessments, among other “questionable expenses,” according to the controller’s office.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','Mr. Choephel (pronounced cheu-FELL) was born in Tibet in 1966, but two years later he was taken from the country by his mother as she fled the Cultural Revolution. He grew up in a refugee settlement in southern India, attended Middlebury College in Vermont on a Fulbright scholarship, then returned to Tibet in 1995 to shoot the documentary.Two months into his trip, as he drove to visit his father, whom he had not seen since leaving Tibet, Mr. Choephel was stopped at a checkpoint by Chinese intelligence agents, he said. They arrested him and confiscated his camera, notes and videotape. He was convicted of spying, without a trial, and sentenced to 18 years in prison.He continued his research behind bars, transcribing songs sung by fellow prisoners on cigarette wrappers, which he bound into a makeshift notebook. After guards discovered his archive and destroyed it, he said, he started memorizing the songs.Mr. Choephel also experienced a sort of conversion. Before his detention, his engagement with the movement for an independent Tibet had been largely intellectual. But his imprisonment made the cause more personal. “I had joined the struggle,” he says in the documentary.The campaign for his freedom gained momentum, and in January 2002, he was released. The Chinese authorities called it a medical parole, but Mr. Choephel said he was not suffering from any major illness and believed that the government had succumbed to international pressure.He fondly remembered New York from visits as a college student and felt comfortable among its thriving immigrant communities. “That gives me strength because all the immigrants come here with a big goal,” he said.There are about 5,000 to 6,000 Tibetans in New York and New Jersey, said officials at the Tibetan Community of New York and New Jersey, which provides social services and cultural classes. While the population is scattered across the city, its institutional heart is in a building on East 32nd Street in Manhattan that contains the offices of the cultural group and the Dalai Lama’s representative to the Americas.At first, Mr. Choephel was reluctant to fold his own story into the film, he said, in part because he thought his ordeal paled next to those of others he had met in prison. “I always felt my story was too small,” he said.The film, which he finished in 2009, won a special jury prize at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. Mr. Choephel recently held a private screening in New York for the Dalai Lama’s representative, Lobsang Nyandak. “It has a really strong political message portraying the true picture of the stark reality in Tibet today,” Mr. Nyandak said.The film is scheduled to play for a week at the Cinema Village Theater before being shown across the country. Mr. Choephel hopes it will teach more people about Tibet’s struggles, though he is not expecting it to make much of a difference for Tibetans.“We have been telling our stories for over 50 years — the same story over and over and over,” he said with a sigh. “ ‘The Chinese did this to me, did that to me.’ ”“How are we going to solve this?” he asked. “Sharing my experience and being a voice for my friends in Tibet. Will it help? I think it will. But will it solve the problem? No.”'"
"'10-09-23,'0','MOSCOW — Russia interprets the latest round of United Nations sanctions against Iran as prohibiting all exports of major weapons systems to that country, President Dmitri A. Medvedev announced Wednesday, ending some Russian equivocation on whether an advanced air defense system would fall under the ban.The decree bans exports to Iran of any “battle tanks, armored vehicles, large-caliber artillery systems, military airplanes and helicopters, military ships, rockets or rocket systems as defined in the U.N. register of conventional weapons, and air defense rockets of the S-300 system,” and it bans the sale of spare parts for Russian military hardware to Iran.The announcement, posted on Mr. Medvedev’s Web site as world leaders gathered in New York for the United Nations General Assembly meeting, signaled a deeper commitment by Russia to the Security Council’s fourth round of sanctions against Iran, passed in June. The sanctions did not specifically include the contentious S-300 missiles, and there was confusion over whether Russia would still go ahead with its contract to sell them to Iran.The missiles would have been the backbone of a mobile, long-range air defense system that could thwart any military strike on a nuclear site in Iran.Although Iran denies that it is using its civilian nuclear program to mask efforts to build a bomb, many Western countries are dubious, and Israel has made no secret of its willingness to consider a military strike to halt Iran’s progress.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','CBS knew that when it ordered a sitcom with a vulgar word in the title, it would get attention. The network also knew there would be some hand-wringing about the coarseness of popular culture.Here’s what the network did not know: that the title would trip up some digital video recorders.It turns out that the search tools on some DVRs cannot find the new show, “$#*! My Dad Says,” because the symbols cannot be read. (Maybe some DVR developers could not foresee a world where TV shows would have a dollar sign in the titles.) Before the show’s premiere on Thursday, CBS released a viewers’ guide of sorts on Wednesday to help people program their DVRs accordingly.The case illustrates how some TV networks have embraced the DVR, though tepidly. Despite the commercial-skipping abilities of the recording devices, highly rated shows become even more so when DVR playback is included in the Nielsen ratings that help determine prices for advertising time. About 38 percent of households now have DVRs, though the vast majority of programming is still watched in real-time.“Obviously, our first choice is that you always watch everything on CBS live; however, we also consider the DVR our friend,” CBS wrote in its viewers’ guide on Wednesday, which was shared on CBS.com, on Twitter and elsewhere online.CBS recommended that viewers set “$#*! My Dad Says” to record through the program guide rather than the search tool. Most DVR users already record shows through the program guide, said David Poltrack, the chief research officer for CBS, “but we don’t want to make it difficult for any of our consumers.”The sitcom, which was inspired by a 30-year-old’s profane Twitter feed about his father’s blunt observations, stars William Shatner as the father. Mr. Poltrack observed that on some DVR systems, like the one operated by Time Warner Cable in Manhattan, the symbols in the title are actually an advantage, because the show appears at the top of an alphabetical list of programs.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','The study, published Thursday in The , looked at what happened in before and after 1996, when the country began rolling out mammograms for women ages 50 to 69 along with special breast cancer teams to treat all women with breast cancer.The study is not perfect. The ideal study would randomly assign women to have mammograms or not. But, cancer experts said, no one would do such a study today when mammograms are generally agreed to prevent breast cancer deaths. In the study, which is continuing, women were followed for a maximum of 8.9 years. It is possible that benefits may emerge later.Nonetheless, the new study is “very credible,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the .“This is the first time researchers used real populations to compare the effects of treatment and mammography in the modern era of treatment,” Dr. Kramer said. “It shows the relative impacts of screening versus therapy in an era in which therapy has been improving.”Dr. Otis Brawley of the said in a statement that the investigators used “careful methodology.” The society, Dr. Brawley said, “believes that the total body of the science supports the fact that regular mammography is an important part of a woman’s .”Dr. Carol Lee, a radiologist at and chairwoman of the breast imaging commission of the American College of Radiology, said the new study affirmed that mammography saves lives.“Mortality from breast cancer is decreasing, and I have to believe that screening mammography has played a part,” Dr. Lee said.In their study, the investigators analyzed data from all 40,075 Norwegian women who had received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1986 to 2005, a time when treatment was changing markedly.In that period, 4,791 women died. And, starting in 1996, Norway began offering mammograms to women ages 50 to 69 and assigning multidisciplinary treatment teams to all women with breast cancer, similar to the teams at many major medical centers in the . The question was, Did the program of mammograms and optimal new treatment with coordinated teams of surgeons, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists and nurses lower the breast cancer death rate?The investigators found that women 50 to 69 who had mammograms and were treated by the special teams had a 10 percent lower breast cancer death rate than similar women who had had neither.They also found, though, that the death rate fell by 8 percent in women over 70 who had the new treatment teams but had not been invited to have mammograms. And Dr. Kramer said he knew of no evidence that breast cancer was more easily treated in women over 70 than in women ages 50 to 69.That means, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth wrote in an additional analysis in an accompanying editorial, that mammography could have reduced the breast cancer death rate by as little as 2 percent, an amount so small that it is not really different from zero.Two percent is an estimate, Dr. Welch said. But, he said, whatever the effect of mammograms is, “all the signals here are that it is much smaller than we believed.”Dr. Laura Esserman, a professor of surgery and radiology at the in , said it tells her that “if you get the same treatment and the outcome is the same if you find it earlier or later, then you don’t make a difference when you find it early.”And screening has a cost, Dr. Welch said. Screening 2,500 50-year-olds for a decade would identify 1,000 women with at least one suspicious mammogram resulting in follow-up tests. Five hundred would have biopsies. And 5 to 15 of those women would be treated for cancers that, if left alone, would have grown so slowly they would never have been noticed.When the study was planned, the scientists expected that screening would be even more effective than it was in studies from decades ago. After all, mammography had improved and, in Norway, each mammogram was independently read by two radiologists, which should make it less likely that cancers would be missed. The researchers expected mammograms to reduce the breast cancer death rate by a third.“We were surprised,” said Dr. Mette Kalager, the lead author of the paper who is a breast surgeon at University and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health.Marvin Zelen, a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who was a member of the research team said even though the mammography benefit is small, if he were a woman he would get screened.“It all depends on how you approach risk,” Dr. Zelen said. His approach, he says, is “minimax” — he wants to minimize the maximum risk — which, in this case, is dying of a cancer.Dr. Kalager came to the opposite conclusion. She worries about the small chance of benefit in light of the larger chance of finding and treating a cancer that did not need to be treated.“Since I’m a breast cancer surgeon, I know what being treated is like,” she says. The decision to be screened, she says, “is a matter of personal preference. Is it worth it to risk becoming a patient without it being necessary?”Many women may still want mammograms, she says, and that is fine.“I think we have to respect what women want to do.”'"

"'10-09-23,'0','WE may be living in an era of responsible spending and fiscal contrition, but you’d never have known it from the conga line of gray suits at the premiere of “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps” on Monday night.The slicked-back allure of Gordon Gekko, emblem of unbridled excess — at least until credit-default swaps were invented — hasn’t dimmed since Michael Douglas won an Oscar after playing him in Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street” in 1987.Gekko is back in the sequel, but Mr. Douglas, battling throat cancer, made only a brief appearance on the red carpet at the theater. He posed for photos but didn’t speak and skipped the after-party. “He would’ve loved to be here, but he can’t be in crowds,” whispered his publicist, Allen Burry, who came anyway. (What a trouper!)Shia LaBeouf, a co-star, was also a party no-show. But Josh Brolin, who plays a villain with a taste for Richard Prince paintings and million-dollar Italian motorcycles, made it. And Carey Mulligan, Mr. LaBeouf’s love interest (onscreen and then off) held the promotional fort.“It’s not educational, it’s not a documentary,” she said lightly of the film. “It’s a big kind of stomping blockbuster, romance, thriller. It’s a fun movie.”The party at Cipriani 42 hummed with money, and not only because the building was once a grand old bank (teller windows now serve as drink ledges). Starlets were supplanted with corporate types like Thomas M. Joyce, chief executive of the Knight Capital Group, who talked golf and sipped expensive Scotch from a sponsored bar.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','Besides, the app is not yet on BlackBerrys, which renders it much less useful in business settings.If you have CamCard, though, your business card management system should never resemble a black hole. Reviewers on iTunes, Android’s Market and BlackBerry’s App World have lauded the app for its simplicity and versatility, and in my own tests I experienced similar traits.The app outdoes competitors in a couple of respects. First, it can scan cards in 12 languages, while others focus on English or, in the case of WorldCard Mobile, English and Chinese. CamCard also allows editing of the card’s image, which will appeal to those who would prefer not to see a coffee stain each time they view an important card.The basics of the app are straightforward. You open the program, take a photo of the card and give it a moment to absorb the information.CamCard’s developers say its scanning technology is more accurate than that of competitors, and in my informal tests, that was true. I let all three apps take a crack at the most beat-up sample I could find — a five-year-old business card that I’d written on and kept in my wallet for months.CamCard was the only one to render nearly every letter and number correctly. It did not categorize the cellular and fax numbers correctly, as did WorldCard and ScanBizCards. But compared with the other apps, I needed to do many fewer edits of the information it scanned.After the scan, CamCard places the information into a virtual card holder that can be sorted by name. It also includes a search box at the top, a welcome feature that the other apps lacked.The other apps were good, but over all, CamCard felt more refined.And for those who cannot bear the thought of spending $7 on an app, CamCard offers free “lite” versions that scans cards but stores only a few.WorldCard Mobile accurately read and sorted fax and mobile numbers, even when the card’s labels used shorthand, and its text-scanning was fair. But I found the interface slightly confusing. It had no page where I could find all the cards I scanned. Rather, it exported all content to the phone’s contact list.For $4, you can buy WorldCard Contacts, an app that lets you sort the cards in various ways, and quickly open e-mail and text-message windows for each contact. It also lets you visit WorldCard’s Web site, among other things. I used the app to separate contacts I’d made in different industries, and to revisit contacts recently used.The Contacts app was helpful, but when packaged with WorldCard Mobile, the total price is $10.ScanBizCards includes a version of the sorting service in its price. The options were slightly more limited — the categories include name, company and date of the scan — but in another section of the app I could view my contacts according to the group label I had assigned to them.The app also included a Web component, which requires a $1 monthly subscription. When I scanned a card, in addition to recording the information on the phone, the app uploaded the data to a personalized Web address. The app synchronizes any changes you make, either online or inside the app.I might consider paying for the service if I were a business card magnet, since many card scans require a small amount of editing, and editing is much easier on a Web page. Otherwise, I’d pass.One caveat: With all these apps, I had the best results with an iPhone 4, which has a better camera than the 3G versions, and a far better camera than the original 2G iPhone. In fact, when I tested the apps with the 2G iPhone, they did not work. And the older your device, the less accurate the scans.As a category, though, these are very good apps, and they should continue to improve with time — or until the smartphone industry finds a way to make business cards disappear completely.ListPro, a desktop software application that help users manage lists of all kinds, is now available as a free iPhone app. With it, you may create and manage lists, or choose from existing templates. For $20, you can download the desktop version (for Windows only) and sync your lists. ... Android users who work in the emergency response fields can lean on Firehouse Scheduler ($6) to help keep track of their shifts. LeakyNozzle.com has more information on that app. ... BlackBerry users looking to increase their workouts can now download a free coach. The miCoach app from Adidas helps pace you during runs, tracks your workouts and suggests shoe changes. It is available on BlackBerry models 8310, 8900, 9000 and 9700.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','GENEVA — Switzerland, one of the last countries in Western Europe to let its women vote, became one of the few to have a majority of women in its government after an election of two new cabinet ministers by Parliament on Wednesday.Switzerland gave women the right to vote in national elections in 1971 and took an additional 13 years to choose its first female minister. Only six women have held ministerial rank. By last year, however, Switzerland had three women in the elected seven-member cabinet; the vote on Wednesday, by the combined houses of Parliament, added a fourth.The result puts Switzerland alongside Finland, Norway, Spain and Cape Verde as countries identified by the Inter-Parliamentary Union as having a majority of women in government.The importance of the vote is seen by Swiss commentators as more symbolic than practical. An editorial in the weekly Hebdo had noted that any notion of a female majority in the cabinet “used to seem just a while ago as pure science fiction.”“What this vote shows is that gender is no longer a huge issue,” said Georg Lutz, project director at the social science research center at Lausanne University, but the decision is not expected to herald a new direction in the conduct of government. “Policy-wise, it’s not going to change much,” he said. “It’s the same parties in cabinet with the same number of seats.”'"

George W. Casey Jr., the Army chief of staff, ordered the inquiry to determine how Rolling Stone was granted access to a wartime commander and also to assess responsibility for quotations offensive to civilian leaders.Pentagon officials said the Army’s review might also serve a secondary and more parochial purpose. At least two of the more senior Army officers on General McChrystal’s staff were up for promotions or new assignments, and the Army would not want to forward the nominations until they were cleared.Details of the investigations and resulting controversy were described by a dozen Pentagon civilians and military officers who had read the Army review or had been briefed on it; they requested anonymity because the investigation was continuing.Defense Secretary and Adm. , chairman of the , had championed General McChrystal, but both supported Mr. Obama’s decision to accept his resignation. They spoke of the importance of preserving civilian control of the military, and stressed that a commander was responsible for establishing the leadership climate and for actions by subordinates.In what was viewed by military officers as a significant statement from the White House, the president ruled that General McChrystal could retire with his full four-star rank, even though he had not served the standard time in grade to receive those benefits.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','Mr. Baghi was detained shortly after the broadcast and has been held in solitary confinement for long periods, human rights Web sites have reported. He had already spent a total of four and a half years in Iranian prisons beginning in 1998, when he published an exposé of political killings known as the “chain murders.”The opposition Web site reports stated that other charges against Mr. Baghi included “relations with Unicef” — the United Nations Children’s Fund — for the purposes of investigating the fate of minors held in Iranian prisons.“He appears to be an Iranian citizen, but he has tried with all his efforts to bring to fruition the aims of hostile countries,” the justification for his sentence was quoted as saying.Mr. Baghi had already been sentenced last month to one year in prison and a five-year ban on all media activities on separate charges relating to his participation in a group set up by opposition leaders to defend the rights of postelection detainees. He was in court facing other charges relating to the group when he received the sentence for the BBC interview, the report said.On Sunday, Shiva Nazar-Ahari, 26, founder of the Tehran-based Committee of Human Rights Reporters was sentenced to six years in prison after being charged this month with political offenses including “inciting public opinion,” “propaganda against the system” and “moharebeh,” or “waging war against God,” a crime for which the Islamic Republic executed two postelection protesters in January.According to her lawyer, Mohammad Sharif, more than half of Ms. Nazar-Ahari’s six-year sentence is to be served in a remote location in Iran’s southwestern province of Khuzestan, about 280 miles from Tehran. Mr. Sharif said that he would appeal the sentence, which he described as “having no legal basis.”“I cannot imagine that Shiva will be able to endure three and a half years in a prison like that,” Mr. Sharif was quoted as telling the Committee of Human Rights Reporters Web site. Mr. Sharif also said that Ms. Nazar-Ahari would pay a $400 fine in lieu of 76 lashes.Also this week, the family of a well-known Iranian-Canadian blogger who was arrested after he returned to Iran nearly two years ago, said that prosecutors in his case were demanding that he be sentenced to death.According to the BBC’s Persian-language Web site, sources close to the blogger, Hossein Derakhshan, said that the death penalty had been requested in a closed session of court in which he was accused of charges including “cooperating with hostile governments” and insulting Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Mr. Ahmadinejad.'"
"'10-09-23,'0','WASHINGTON — An Iowa egg producer at the center of a nationwide outbreak of salmonella apologized to a Congressional panel on Wednesday and acknowledged that his family operation had become “big quite awhile before we stopped acting like we were small.”“What I mean by that is, we were big before we started adopting sophisticated procedures to be sure we met all of the government requirements,” the egg producer, Austin J. DeCoster, said in testimony before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. He is the founder of an egg empire that has been linked over three decades to outbreaks of salmonella poisoning in many states, some leading to deaths.“We were horrified to learn that our eggs may have made people sick,” Mr. DeCoster, who is known as Jack, said in a shaky voice. “We apologize to everyone who may have been sickened by eating our eggs.”His company, Wright County Egg, based in Iowa, and another company, Hillandale Farms, recalled more than 500 million eggs last month after health officials traced salmonella bacteria that sickened more than 1,500 people to those companies.A subsequent inspection by the Food and Drug Administration found that the barns of the egg producers were infested with flies, maggots and rodents, and had overflowing manure pits. Records unearthed by Congressional investigators showed that tests of Wright County Egg barns had shown the presence of toxic salmonella bacteria for years before the outbreak.Despite such conditions, Peter DeCoster, Austin DeCoster’s son and the chief operating officer of Wright County Egg, told the panel that the most likely source of the contamination was a separate company that supplied ingredients for chicken feed, a contention disputed by federal food officials. He said that some of the filthy conditions documented by the F.D.A. were standard practice in the industry.Documents released by the committee showed that Wright County Egg achieved a “superior” rating and “recognition of achievement” from AIB International, a private inspection company based in Manhattan, Kan., after a June inspection of its processing facility. That came just as the company was causing thousands of illnesses from contaminated eggs.In 2008, AIB gave a “superior” rating to a Peanut Corporation of America plant in Blakely, Ga., that was later found to be riddled with salmonella that caused a nationwide outbreak and the largest food recall in American history. A spokesman for AIB could not be reached.Orland Bethel, the president of Hillandale Farms of Iowa and a longtime associate of the DeCosters, cited his Fifth Amendment rights and declined to testify. But in an Aug. 31 e-mail released by the subcommittee, Mr. Bethel wrote, “Hillandale needs to totally disassociate itself from Jack and it needs to be real. Hillandale has a good business base, but it will all be gone if I don’t move quickly and I will not try to deceive the public.”In another e-mail, Mr. Bethel wrote that his company had been told by Costco and Wal-Mart “that they will not be doing any business if Jack and his people have any involvement in management or ownership.”Duane Mangskau, a Hillandale production manager, told the committee that Hillandale had ended its marketing relationship with Wright County Egg.Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat of Iowa, asked Austin DeCoster, “How is it possible that after all this time we have another DeCoster egg facility involved in a half-billion egg recall?”Pictures taken at the DeCoster facilities of barns bursting with manure, manure flowing under barn doors, and barns with dead rodents, chickens and flies were shown at the hearing. Members of the panel expressed outrage that inspectors found such conditions even though the DeCosters were alerted days before inspectors appeared that the company’s eggs had been contaminated.“DeCoster farms have had warning after warning” for decades, said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat. “Yet they continue to raise chickens in slovenly conditions and to make millions of dollars by selling contaminated eggs.”The hearing was briefly interrupted by two animal welfare advocates who unfurled an anti-egg banner and repeatedly chanted: “All eggs kill!” Police officers escorted them from the room.Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner, told the panel that the F.D.A. needed new powers and money to help prevent further food contamination outbreaks, both of which are provided for in legislation that the House passed last year but that has been languishing in the Senate. “We need this bill to help protect the safety of the food supply,” he said.Democratic members of the panel denounced Senator Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, who has objected to a Democratic plan to bring food safety legislation to a vote.“This is a public health imperative,” said Representative Edward J. Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts. “There must be some exceptions for Republicans in the Senate. They must release this bill so that we can protect millions of families.”But Representative Michael C. Burgess, Republican of Texas, said that Mr. Coburn’s objections had not prevented the bill from being considered by the Senate. Mr. Burgess sought to read a statement from Mr. Coburn at the hearing, but Representative Bart Stupak, the chairman of the panel, cut off his microphone, which led to a sharp exchange between the lawmakers.“I voted with you on the dang bill. I’ve worked with you on the dang bill,” Mr. Burgess said. “It is preposterous that the majority has conducted the hearing this way when he’s not the problem.”And then, referring to Mr. Coburn, Mr. Burgess added, “He may become a problem if the majority leader brings it to the floor,” a remark that elicited laughter from the room.Hours after the hearing, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the Senate majority leader, asked on the Senate floor for the unanimous consent for the body to consider the bill.“There is no excuse to wait any longer,” he said. “Our current food safety system hasn’t been updated in almost a century.” But Mr. Coburn objected. To overcome Mr. Coburn’s objections, Mr. Reid would have to file for cloture, a process that can take a week or more; the Senate has other legislation it must pass before members adjourn to campaign in October.“On a piece of legislation that is this bipartisan, this should be something we can do rather quickly,” said Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for Mr. Reid. “Unfortunately, one senator is saying no.”'"
"'10-09-23,'0','The S.& P. 500 has surged 11 percent from this year’s low on July 2 as concern eased that unemployment and less spending from indebted European nations would stall the global economic recovery. It has gained 1.7 percent so far this year, but is still 6.8 percent below its peak for 2010.Stocks reversed earlier gains after the Federal Housing Finance Agency said home prices dropped 3.3 percent in July from a year earlier, the eighth consecutive decline. Prices fell 0.5 percent from June, more than the projected drop of 0.2 percent based on the median economist estimate in a Bloomberg survey.Treasuries rose for a fourth day. The price of the 10-year note rose 4/32, to 100 18/32. The yield fell to 2.56 percent, from 2.57 percent late Tuesday.“Equity markets are trying to strike the right balance between the willingness of the Fed to do more and its ability to deliver good outcomes,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive at the Pacific Investment Management Company, which runs the world’s biggest bond fund, wrote in an e-mail. “The Fed took a step toward acknowledging a more challenging economic outlook, but stopped short of a full recognition and implementing additional policy actions.”The dollar fell against major currencies. Gold hit another high.Adobe’s tumble, to $26.67, followed a discouraging announcement on Tuesday after the markets closed. The company said that its fourth-quarter revenue would be $950 million to $1 billion, citing slower demand from back-to-school shoppers and Japanese buyers. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had projected sales of $1.03 billion.PMC-Sierra, the chip maker, ended the day at $7.32 after reducing its third-quarter sales forecast, saying it expected $163 million at most. That trails the average analyst estimate of $173.5 million in a Bloomberg survey.Microsoft fell the most in the Dow, losing 2.2 percent, to close at $24.61. It raised its quarterly dividend by 23 percent, to 16 cents a share. The increase was disappointing, said Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst at Cowen & Company, who said the 2.5 percent yield fell short of his expectations of up to 4 percent.Airline stocks fell, led by AMR, the parent company of American Airlines. AMR said its mainline unit revenue would increase 11 percent at most in the third quarter. That trailed an estimate for a gain of 12 percent by Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan Chase and Stifel Nicolaus both widened their 2010 loss estimates for the airline. AMR sank 8.7 percent, to $6.28.Bank of America’s chief United States equity strategist, David Bianco, cut his forecast for the S.& P. 500’s year-end level to 1,250, from 1,300, citing concern that American taxes will rise and hold the economic recovery back.“We believe that Congress will be gridlocked through year-end until the new Congress is seated in January,” Mr. Bianco wrote in a note. “The fear of tax hikes in 2011 is likely to constrain growth. This setback to confidence is likely to prevent the S.& P. 500 from reaching our previous target.”'"
"'10-09-23,'0','Shakira announced one big, simple goal when she headlined Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night.“I am here to please you,” she declared. That’s a pop objective, and some of her methods were well-nigh universal. Others were Shakira’s own.Like many a pop star, Shakira sang about love and romance, about shared desire and solitary longing, about regrets and vengeance. The songs that made her a star in Colombia in the 1990s, singing in Spanish, could be contentious; “Si Te Vas” (""If You Go”) tells a straying lover not to expect that he can return. But she can be affectionate, too, as she was in her worldwide 2001 hit in English, “Whenever, Wherever.“ Onstage, she got singalongs in both languages.She’s a star with a conscience. Between dates on Shakira’s current arena tour was a scheduled address, on Wednesday, to the Clinton Global Initiative — Bill Clinton’s gathering for philanthropists, government figures and do-gooders — about her Barefoot Foundation for education in Colombia. (Her appearance was cancelled because of illness.) At Madison Square Garden, performing barefoot, she greeted the presidents of Chile and Colombia in the audience.Her concert used sounds of the United States’s cultural clout: rock beats and power-chord buildups or, on songs from her 2009 album, “She Wolf” (Sony Music Latin/Epic), the steady thump and electronics of club music. Yet for every song with a U.S. idiom, Shakira also had one with different international twists. That can be traced partly to her heritage — her last name is Mebarak, and she is Colombian from a family of Lebanese, Spanish and Italian descent — but mostly to her open ears.After she segued “Whenever, Wherever"" into the rock stomp of “Unbelievable,” a 1990 hit by the British band EMF, Shakira turned to another rock song: Metallica’s “Nothing Else Matters. ” But she and her band made it sound Andean, with six-beat drumming and the strumming of a ukulele-sized charango. The quick pattering of a Middle Eastern hand drum, the dumbek, transformed other songs, spurring vocal arabesques.The title song of Shakira’s next album, “Sale el Sol” (“The Sun Comes Out”), due Oct. 19 on Sony Music Latin/Epic, is a determinedly optimistic rocker. Other new songs that she performed are collaborations with Caribbean rappers: a sung and rapped merengue, “Loca, ” and a collaboration with the Puerto Rican duo Calle 13, “Gordita,” which had the rapper Residente’s part on video.'"

"'10-09-24,'1','Ngawang Choephel, a Tibetan musicologist who was imprisoned by the Chinese for more than six years, would have had a compelling film had he simply stuck to his own remarkable story. But his documentary, “Tibet in Song,” is doubly powerful because he also weaves in the overall history of Tibet’s struggle, a primer on the Chinese government’s campaign to muzzle Tibetan culture and vignettes from other Tibetans who resisted.Mr. Choephel left Tibet with his mother in the years after the Chinese invasion of 1950, growing up in India, where other refugees implanted in him a love of traditional Tibetan songs. He returned to Tibet in the 1990s to try to capture this musical history on tape, but the Chinese had a head start of several decades.“The first music I heard was Chinese Communist propaganda and Chinese pop songs,” he recalls of his arrival in Lhasa, Tibet’s capital. “It was an unexpected, alien sound and seemed to be following me wherever I went.”He had better luck finding traditional singers in the countryside, but he was only partway into his recording efforts when he was arrested and jailed as a spy in 1995. One of the more touching aspects of this film is his account of his mother’s tireless campaign to have him freed, which finally paid off in 2002. Persistence, it seems, runs in the family.Written, produced, directed and narrated by Ngawang Choephel; director of photography, Hugh Walsh; edited by Tim Bartlett and Laura J. Corwin; music by Mr. Choephel; released by Guge Productions. At the Cinema Village, 22 East 12th Street, Greenwich Village. In English and Tibetan, with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 26 minutes. This film is not rated.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Amin Mokhtar, an employee of the Afghan Film Organization, balked at a funeral scene, in which mourners threw handfuls of earth into the graves, not an Afghan practice, he said.“The director and workers grew up in America and don’t know much about Afghan culture, that is the point,” Mr. Mokhtar said.The director was Sonia Nassery Cole, 45, who fled Afghanistan as a teenager after the Soviet invasion in 1979, and now is based in Los Angeles, where she runs a charity, the Afghanistan World Foundation. Its Web site lists projects including “The Black Tulip” and Ms. Cole’s other directorial credit, “The Breadwinner,” a 2007 documentary short film also set in Afghanistan.The opening here was financed in part by the American Embassy, which provided money for the film crew to travel to the premiere, according to a spokeswoman for the embassy, Caitlin Hayden. The film had advance screenings at the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, and at the embassy, where its strongly anti-Taliban and pro-coalition theme played well.The political message also resonated with most of the Afghans in the audience, who praised the film’s anti-Taliban sentiments, while recoiling at its depiction of social relationships.“This was wrong, this was not good,” said Hamid Mohammed, a tailor. He was shocked at something he said he had never seen in his life, a young man kissing a woman full on the face mask of her head-to-toe, baby blue burqa. (Burqas have a mesh grill over the eyes, but no mouth opening.) He guffawed at the recollection, then apologized for the outburst.The film is likely to end up as Afghanistan’s entry in the foreign language category at the Oscars, according to Latif Ahmadi, head of the Afghan Film Organization, because, “It’s the only film produced in Afghanistan this year.”Ms. Cole has drawn some criticism in artistic and political circles here for her assertion that she took over the lead in the movie only at the last minute, when the Taliban cut the feet off her pick for that role, whom she named as Zarifa Jahon.“I think that’s just propaganda for the film,” Mr. Ahmadi said. Many others in the film industry here said they had never heard of that actress or such an episode.Ms. Cole, interviewed as she left the theater on Thursday after introducing the movie (she did not stay for the showing), said the story was true. She said that the woman she knew as Zarifa had acted in Pakistan but was not well known in Afghanistan. Ms. Cole discovered her in a hotel lobby in Kabul in 2008, she said.Just before production began on “The Black Tulip” in August 2009, the actress disappeared, Ms. Cole said. “Finally, she called me and she said, ‘You’ll never guess what happened. The Taliban chopped my feet off.’ ” Ms. Cole said the Taliban were angry about a Pakistani film the actress had appeared in.Ms. Cole said she did not actually see the actress after the amputations, however, because the woman begged her to leave her alone for her own safety.Not all of the Afghans felt embarrassed by “The Black Tulip.” “It was perfect,” said Idris Ludin, a dentist. “If you have to see one film about Afghanistan, see this.”Asked what other films about Afghanistan he had seen, he thought for a moment and then laughed. “None.”'"
"'10-09-24,'1','LONDON — The world’s largest offshore wind turbine farm, with a capacity to power more than 200,000 homes for a year, opened on Thursday off the coast of southeast England.The wind farm is operated by Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, and has 100 turbines spread over 13.5 square miles. At 377 feet tall each, the turbines are visible from the coast in Kent. The wind farm took more than two years to build and is expected to generate 300 megawatts of electricity.Vattenfall’s turbines mean that power generated from wind can reach five gigawatts in Britain, enough “to power all homes in Scotland,” Chris Huhne, Britain’s energy secretary said in a statement.“We’re in a unique position to become a world leader in this industry,” Mr. Huhne said. “We are an island nation, and I firmly believe we should be harnessing our wind, wave and tidal resources to the maximum.”The British government has said it aims to support the renewable energy industry to achieve its goal to get 15 percent of energy from sources like wind farms by 2020. The efforts have focused mainly on wind power in recent years. Wind accounts for about 4 percent of Britain’s electricity needs.Some industry executives feared that more government investment would be threatened in October, when the coalition government presented its program of spending cuts intended to reduce the budget deficit.Britain has about 260 wind farms operating across the country and off its coasts.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Auto analysts are increasingly projecting that G.M. shares could be priced high enough for the government eventually to get back most or all of its remaining $43 billion investment in the automaker. But everyone agrees that will take years.The offering, which is expected as early as November, will set a benchmark for the stock’s value.In order to recover all of the government’s investment, the Treasury would have to sell its 304 million shares at an average price of $133.78 a share, before any splits, according to Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief Program of the Treasury.Mr. Barofsky cited that figure in a letter last month to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who asked Mr. Barofsky to audit the stock sale.In the letter, Mr. Barofsky pledged to review G.M.’s stock offering after its approval by federal regulators to ensure that it produced “the highest return for the American taxpayers.”The price cited by Mr. Barofsky might not be unrealistic, said David Whiston, an automotive equity analyst with Morningstar in Chicago. Mr. Whiston said on Thursday that a G.M. share could be worth $134, though he believed it would sell for less than that.He said that G.M., after last year’s government-sponsored bankruptcy, had made changes that would help it thrive as demand for new vehicles recovers from today’s levels, which most industry experts consider to be unsustainably low.“It really is a new G.M.,” Mr. Whiston said. “The cynics of this deal, I don’t think they really understand the billions of cost savings that G.M. has made.”Although President Obama has said he wants the government to divest as quickly as practical, the Treasury is expected to sell off its interest over at least two to three years. That would allow it to take advantage of increases in the value of its shares, assuming G.M. operates profitably.“If G.M. continues to improve and the industry continues to improve, they have a shot at getting it all back,” said Michael Ward, an analyst with Soleil Securities.There is considerable interest about the G.M. offering among potential investors, and the sale is likely to do well, Mr. Ward told members of the Society of Automotive Analysts on Thursday in Southfield, Mich.“Wall Street is going to be in love with General Motors,” he said.The size and the price of the stock offering have not yet been decided, the people with knowledge of the preparations said. But the Treasury intends to reserve a large portion of the stock for retail investors.As part of that push, G.M. intends to split the stock so that it is priced about $20 to $25 a share, these people said.The Treasury has also declined to set specific limits on where the stock will be sold and to whom. In a statement last week, the Treasury said it expected the bulk of the stock to be sold in North America.The government would not expressly restrict sales to foreign buyers, these people said, but they added that acquisitions by foreign investors would be limited.In a related matter, G.M. filed an amended version of the registration paperwork for its offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, but it did not reveal details.The filing included a letter to the Treasury in which company executives committed to using “commercially reasonable best efforts” to manufacture at least 1.6 million vehicles in the United States this year and an increased number in each of the next four years.The figures are 90 percent of what G.M. had previously agreed to produce under its loan agreements with the Treasury.The letter also says that AmeriCredit, a subprime financing company that G.M. is buying, plans to sell its private plane in accordance with restrictions placed on companies that received aid from the Treasury’s bailout program.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Through Wednesday, Pena’s .201 average was the lowest in the majors among the 152 players who qualify for the batting title. It is also the lowest in major league history for a player with as many home runs (27) and runs batted in (81) as he has.“This season hasn’t gone the way I intended it to go, or the way I wanted it to go,” Pena said. “Well, I’m trying to embrace the fact that that’s the case. I’m embracing the fact that this is not as good as I want it, personally. But I’m going to go through the fire, and at the end of the day, it should polish me.”Pena continued: “Then you look where we’re at as a team, you look at the entire scheme of it, and you’re like: ‘Wait a second. So the only reason I would feel bad is because I’m thinking of myself, and I may not be getting pats on the back for the great season I’m having?’ If that’s the case, why in the world would I feel bad?”Pena, 32, has the perspective of a former first-round draft choice who was traded twice before his first 65 games in the majors. Four years later, in 2006, he was let go for nothing by three teams within seven months. One of those teams was the Yankees, who never promoted him from Class AAA.In 2007, Pena signed a nonroster deal with the Rays, who were then still the doormat of the majors. Pena kept a notebook that spring, jotting down goals and tips from practice. He also used the journal to remind himself how grateful he was to still have a chance to make a major league roster.Pena was reassigned to the minor league camp late that spring but was called back when another first baseman, Greg Norton, hurt his knee. Pena responded by hitting .282 and belting 46 homers, a Tampa Bay record. He established himself as a player, but also learned perspective that has served him well lately.“I was begging and praying to be on the team when this team was the worst in baseball,” Pena said. “And all of a sudden we are one of the best teams in baseball, and I’m part of it. To see where I’ve come from keeps me grounded.”Pena has remained productive. Starting in 2007, only five players (Ryan Howard, Prince Fielder, Albert Pujols, Adam Dunn and Alex Rodriguez) have hit more home runs. Pena also plays stellar defense, and his agent, Scott Boras, will surely cite those factors when marketing his client in free agency this winter.But Pena’s average and on-base percentage have dipped each season, and this year has brought a toxic combination of bad luck and too many ground balls. His first two seasons with the Rays, Pena hit .297 and .298 on balls in play, roughly the major league norm. This season, that figure has dipped to .229.That suggests bad luck, but Pena has also hit far more ground balls than usual. He has hit 1.12 ground balls for every fly ball this season, compared with 0.54 grounders per fly last season.“The biggest thing is choosing the right pitches,” Shelton said. “At times, he gets in situations where he gets out of his hitting zone. But on the flip side, if you add some of the hits he should have because of balls he hits into the shift, that plays into it, too.”Shelton said Pena has stayed positive and maintained the same work habits, adding that he could get hot. The way Pena sees it, if he turns it around in October, his season — and perhaps his time with the Rays — could have an especially satisfying conclusion.“Who’s to say something really cool isn’t coming to make another dramatic chapter in my book?” Pena said. “That’s the way I look at it. I’m expecting something really good to happen.”'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Blockbuster, the struggling video rental giant, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, seeking to shed its onerous debt and remake itself to compete against nimbler rivals.The long-awaited filing, made in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, will wipe out the bulk of Blockbuster’s nearly $1 billion debt, while handing over a huge equity stake to senior bondholders led by the investor Carl C. Icahn. Junior bondholders are expected to be wiped out, the company disclosed in a court filing.The company said it expected its daily operations and video stores to continue without interruption. The company, however, plans to close a sizable number of those stores as part of its reorganization.Over the last 25 years, Blockbuster grew to become the dominant force in the movie rental market, only to slip significantly as consumers increasingly flocked to alternatives.Among the company’s most successful competitors is Netflix, which lets subscribers receive movies through the mail or stream them online. Netflix’s shares rose Thursday to a record high of $163.72 a share before closing the day up 2.26 percent to $160.47.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Harvin was plagued with migraines throughout the preseason but says he went almost six weeks between headaches. He said he was encouraged by his recovery from this migraine and no longer worried about getting headaches daily.REDSKINS TACKLE LIMPING Washington Redskins left tackle Trent Williams is still hobbling, making it appear unlikely he will play Sunday against the St. Louis Rams. Williams was unable to practice again Thursday and was limping noticeably. He hurt his left knee and a toe on his left foot Sunday against the Houston Texans.If Williams cannot play, Stephon Heyer will move into the starting lineup, either at left tackle or right tackle. Jammal Brown, who started the first two games at right tackle, could move to the left side.SLOWED BY CONCUSSIONS Saints Coach Sean Payton said cornerback Randall Gay had not yet been cleared to return from his concussion but still could play Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons. If Gay is cleared in time, the Saints may have him resume his role in five- and six-defensive back formations, Payton said. Otherwise, the rookie Patrick Robinson, who was inactive on Monday against San Francisco, will be expected to suit up.St. Louis Rams safety Craig Dahl was held out of practice because he was still feeling effects of a concussion. He said he was still sensitive to light and experiencing other symptoms after practicing Wednesday. Dahl was hurt on a helmet-to-helmet hit last Sunday. Coach Steve Spagnuolo said Dahl would try to practice Friday.BRONCOS CORNERBACKS AILING Two Denver cornerbacks, Champ Bailey and Andre’ Goodman, missed practice with injuries as the Broncos prepared to face Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Bailey has a sore right foot, Goodman a thigh injury.If Bailey and Goodman cannot play, Manning will see some combination of the rookies Perrish Cox, Cassius Vaughn and Syd’Quan Thompson, and maybe the more experienced Nate Jones as well.MATHEWS STILL HURTING Ryan Mathews, the San Diego Chargers’ rookie running back, missed a second straight practice with a high ankle sprain, making it less likely he will be available to play Sunday at Seattle. Coach Norv Turner said Mathews was getting better and had not been ruled out of the game.PACKERS MAY START ROOKIE The rookie Bryan Bulaga may start at left tackle for the Green Bay Packers on Monday night against the Bears in Chicago.Bulaga replaced the injured veteran Chad Clifton in the second quarter last Sunday against the Buffalo Bills after coaches determined that Clifton’s chronically bothersome knees were affecting his play.DEAL FOR RAVENS’ INJURED PICK The Baltimore Ravens agreed to terms on a one-year contract with their top draft pick, linebacker Sergio Kindle, even though he will not play this season.Kindle, a second-round draft pick out of Texas, fractured his skull shortly before training camp in July when he fell down two flights of stairs. He had a series of neurological exams from independent doctors in Baltimore, which led the Ravens to believe he would not be able to play in 2010.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Pity poor Marni (Kristen Bell), a high school student with acne, bad hair, braces on her teeth and glasses. In the opening scenes of the stupefying comedy “You Again,” she is persecuted and branded a loser by Joanna (Odette Yustman), a bullying alpha girl, and her fellow cheerleaders.Several years go by, and Marni’s beloved older brother, Will (James Wolk), brings his fiancée home to meet the family. Marni’s teenage trauma bubbles up on discovering that the bride-to-be is none other than her high school nemesis. Joanna, all sweetness and light, announces that she is devoting her life to helping others and seems not to recognize her former victim, who has corrected her physical flaws and is now a high-powered public relations executive. Even though Joanna couldn’t be more sisterly, Marni is certain it is all an act and sets out to rescue Will from the deceitful monster he is about to marry. It’s payback time.There is not a laugh to be found in this rancid, misogynistic revenge comedy, directed by Andy Fickman from a screenplay by Moe Jelline. Every female character — including Marni’s mother, Gail (Jamie Lee Curtis), and grandmother Bunny (Betty White), and Joanna’s Aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver) — is a recovering mean girl or a victim of one, or both. Gail and Ramona, it turns out, had their own falling out 30 years earlier when they were competitive seniors at the same high school.The anemically perky Ms. Bell (“Couples Retreat,” “When in Rome”) is no Reese Witherspoon, an actress who might have brought some spunky personality to the role. Ms. Weaver, who gives the movie’s only amusing performance, recycles the hoity-toity airs of Katharine Parker, her cold, uppity vixen in “Working Girl,” and adds an affectation: the pretentious tossing off of French phrases.Like so many Disney movies, “You Again” exalts shallow, materialistic values, then tries to camouflage its essentially poisonous content with several layers of sugar coating and weepy reconciliation. Once you’ve consumed its empty calories, expect a sickly aftertaste.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','Cambodia’s main opposition party leader was convicted in absentia on Thursday and sentenced to 10 years in prison for a comment he made about a border dispute with Vietnam. The party leader, Sam Rainsy, left, who is living in exile in Paris, was convicted of spreading false information. He had questioned whether the border had been incorrectly marked by the government, to Cambodia’s disadvantage. Mr. Rainsy, who heads the sole opposition party in Parliament, has often claimed that Vietnam is encroaching on Cambodian territory. The prime minister, Hun Sen, is sympathetic to Hanoi. In January, Mr. Rainsy was sentenced to two years in prison for leading a political protest in which markers were uprooted along the border.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','The order also contains provisions that seek to guarantee that wireless microphones have adequate space to operate without interference.Supporters of the measure hope the airwaves will be used for stronger and faster wireless networks — known as “super Wi-Fi” because of the signals’ ability to pass more easily through obstacles — and for use in providing Internet access to rural areas.“Today’s order finally sets the stage for the next generation of wireless technologies to emerge and is an important victory for Internet users across the country,” Richard Whitt, telecommunications and media counsel in Google’s Washington office, said in a posting on the company’s public policy blog.Though unlicensed airwaves have been used for decades in applications like garage-door openers, cordless phones and, most recently, Wi-Fi networks, the newly available signals are stronger and therefore offer greater opportunities for engineers and entrepreneurs, supporters say.But potential problems abound. Many urban areas, including New York, have so many operating broadcast TV stations that unused space is relatively rare. Broadcasters objected to some of the F.C.C.’s proposals, fearing that unlicensed devices would interfere with their station signals.Michael J. Copps, an F.C.C. commissioner who has been a longtime advocate of freeing up the unlicensed airwaves, known as “white space,” said that he expected technology companies would now find ways to overcome those obstacles.“One of the great lessons that I quickly learned here at the F.C.C. is the power of technology to turn scarcity into abundance,” Mr. Copps said. “I look forward to seeing new devices widely available in consumer markets next year.”The F.C.C. also approved changes to the E-Rate program, which provides federal money to pay for Internet connections at schools and libraries. The new rules will allow them to set up Internet connections that use the currently dormant fiber-optic lines that are already in place in many communities, giving users more options and theoretically bringing down the cost of Internet service.The new E-Rate rules also will allow schools to provide Internet access to their communities after students go home in the evenings, further expanding broadband availability. The F.C.C. also voted in favor of an E-Rate pilot program to explore off-campus wireless Internet connections for mobile learning devices, a practice that Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said would open the way to digital textbooks.The commission also approved measures that it thinks will help improve the ability of emergency call centers to better locate people who call 911 from wireless phones.'"
"'10-09-24,'1','But his hopes for signing legislation on campaign finance before the November elections quickly evaporated Thursday afternoon on the Senate floor. With no Republicans voting to cut off debate, the vote was 59 to 39 — one short of what the measure’s supporters needed. The House had approved the measure on a party-line vote in June.The measure would have forced companies, unions, special-interest groups and other organizations active in political campaigning to disclose in federal filings their donors of more than $1,000 and to require the head of an organization that paid for a political commercial to appear on camera to say, “I approved this message,” just as candidates themselves now do.It would also prevent government contractors, businesses that received federal bailout money and foreign corporations from spending on campaigns.Democrats maintained that with a recent surge in money from outside groups that do not have to disclose their donors, the bill was essential to maintaining some transparency in the political process and neutralizing the impact of big businesses.But Republicans asserted that it went too far. Republicans had also succeeded in July in blocking a vote in the Senate, but Democrats held out some hope that they could sway one or two moderate Republicans by making concessions this week. Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who authored the bill, offered to pare down the measure and to ensure that it would not be enacted until after the November elections to appease Republicans who asserted that the measure could be used to help Democrats gain re-election.Republicans, however, would not relent.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, said Democrats should be focusing on issues that Americans really care about — especially jobs and the economy — instead of wasting two days of debate on a measure that he asserted would mean “more government control” over political finance.Liberals pushing for changes in campaign finance did take some solace, however, in a separate vote in a House committee to provide some public financing for Congressional candidates.“It was a ‘you win some, you lose some’ day for campaign finance,” Lisa Gilbert, who tracks political finance issues for U.S. PIRG, a federation of public interest groups.The House committee on administration voted to approve a bill that would provide matching federal money for Congressional candidates who attract enough small local donors. The financing — potentially hundreds of millions of dollars — would come from the sale of broadcast spectrum and would not require any additional taxpayer money, sponsors say.Republicans quickly signaled that they would fight this bill as well. Mr. McConnell, in fact, linked the two measures in voicing his opposition and questioning the priorities of Democrats who support public financing.“Have they no shame?” Mr. McConnell asked. “The last thing the American people want right now is what amounts to welfare for politicians.”'"

"'10-09-24,'1','One study estimated that from 1999 to 2009, more than 47,000 people taking Avandia needlessly suffered a heart attack, stroke or heart failure, or died.The decision on Avandia signals a new era in the treatment of diabetes, a disease that is reaching epidemic proportions in much of the industrialized world. Because of Avandia, the F.D.A. announced in 2008 that it would no longer approve medicines simply because they help diabetics control blood sugar levels — the standard for more than 80 years. Instead, the F.D.A. now insists that drugmakers conduct trials lasting at least two years to show that their medicines do not hurt the heart and that they improve the quality or length of diabetics’ lives, far tougher tests.The Avandia story also begins a new and unsettling period for pharmaceutical companies because Avandia’s risks became known only after Dr. Nissen analyzed data from clinical trials that GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of the drug, had been forced to post on its Web site as a result of a legal settlement. Such public postings are increasingly the norm, which means that drugmakers can no longer easily hide or control scientific information about their medicines.The agency’s decision to order restrictions on Avandia’s sales also demonstrates that the F.D.A. — given new powers over drugmakers and drug distribution in a 2007 law — intends to use those powers. The agency has now ordered that dozens of drugs be sold only with special restrictions.In explaining why the F.D.A. decided against only adding more warnings to Avandia’s label, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.’s drug center said, “We know that labels are often not read.” It was an extraordinary acknowledgment from a veteran of an agency that for decades relied almost exclusively on label warnings to control drug use.The suspension and restrictions all but ensure that Avandia’s sales — $1.19 billion last year and $3.2 billion as recently as 2006 — will plunge as regulatory authorities around the world are bound to follow with similar restrictions. Avandia was once the biggest-selling diabetes drug around the world, but concerns about heart attack risks have already cut sales. There are about 600,000 people currently taking Avandia in the United States, Dr. Hamburg said at a press conference. “I think the numbers will go down very, very significantly with these new requirements.”GlaxoSmithKline responded that “the company continues to believe that Avandia is an important treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes” and is working with the F.D.A. and European regulators “to implement the required actions.” The company promised that it would end Avandia promotions around the world.The restrictions will take months to put in place. Patients now taking Avandia should continue to do so until they can consult their doctors, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner. But he said that doctors should now consider switching patients to other medicines.European regulators began their own reassessment of Avandia in July after seeing a study of the drug by F.D.A. medical officers and another by Dr. Nissen in advance of a July F.D.A. advisory meeting. Once each agency learned of the other’s impending and similar decision — both were reached independently, Dr. Hamburg emphasized — they decided to coordinate their announcements.Several consumer groups said that the F.D.A. should have removed Avandia from the market just as the Europeans did.The F.D.A. announced that it had ordered Glaxo to end a controversial study comparing Avandia and Actos, made by Takeda. It also ordered Glaxo to conduct an independent assessment of the Record trial, a landmark study of Avandia’s heart effects that an F.D.A. medical officer found was riddled with what he said were unpardonable errors that seriously biased the trial’s conclusions.In 2007, after a study by Dr. Nissen found that Avandia increased the risk of heart attacks, an advisory committee agreed but voted to keep it on the market.More studies intensified the controversy, so the F.D.A. held another advisory meeting in July. This time, a majority of experts — many of whom had supported Avandia’s continued sales in 2007 — decided that the drug should either be withdrawn or its sales should be severely restricted. With Thursday’s announcements, the F.D.A. and the European Medicines Agency are following that panel’s advice.Dr. Clifford J. Rosen, a member of the advisory panel that met in July, said he was gratified that the F.D.A. had followed the panel’s advice, and he said the new guidelines “will protect patients while at the same time allowing those few patients who have benefited from treatment to stay on the drug.”Approved in 1999, Avandia helps control blood sugar levels in diabetics by making patients more sensitive to their own insulin. It is one of a class of three drugs, the first of which, Rezulin, was withdrawn because it caused liver damage. Actos, the last remaining drug in the class, appears safe in part because it seems to affect a different set of genes than either Rezulin or Avandia.Senate investigators found that GlaxoSmithKline spent years hiding from regulatory authorities clear indications that Avandia increased heart risks. In July, GlaxoSmithKline took a $2.3 billion liability charge related to legal cases involving Avandia and another medicine, Paxil. At the time, investors cheered the news as the company’s attempt to set a ceiling for its liability surrounding the medicine.But the twin announcements by European and American regulators, along with a string of troubling findings about the company’s conduct by Senate investigators, may increase the company’s legal exposure.Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana who helped to spearhead an investigation of Avandia, said he was pleased. “The FDA’s tough new restrictions on the drug will help protect patients,” Mr. Baucus said.'"

"'10-09-25,'0','KB Home posted a narrow quarterly loss on Friday as fewer write-downs and higher average selling prices helped increase revenue. But the company’s backlog, which represents future housing revenue, declined, and net orders fell 39 percent as demand slowed after federal home buyer tax credits expired in April. KB Home said it lost $1.4 million, or 2 cents a share, in the quarter, which compared with a loss of $66 million, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period, which ended Aug. 31 and was the third quarter of KB Home’s fiscal year, rose 9 percent, to $501 million, the first year-over-year increase in almost four years. KB Home’s chief executive, Jeffrey T. Mezger, said orders in June, traditionally one of the builder’s best-selling months, fell by half versus, the same month last year. Orders gradually improved as the summer unfolded, but they remained well below prior-year levels. “While we have seen improvement in our net orders over the past few months, sales remain soft and the weak economy continues to be a major impediment to any housing recovery,” Mr. Mezger said.

"'10-09-25,'0','With health insurers jacking up their premiums by double-digit amounts for people who buy their own policies, Republicans have been predictably eager to blame health care reform. Consumers, and voters, beware.If your premiums are spiking suddenly, you can blame economic reality. The cost of medical care continues to soar upward, and the recession led many healthy people to drop coverage, leaving less-healthy enrollees who cost more to insure.As for health care reform, the major elements, and major costs, don’t even kick in until 2014. The only provisions with the potential to affect premiums right now are a handful of consumer protections that are popular with the public, and not especially costly to implement.Starting this week, insurers are prohibited from setting lifetime limits and restricted in setting annual limits on what they will pay for care, banned from rescinding policies after a beneficiary becomes sick and prohibited from excluding children with preexisting conditions. The new rules will also allow dependents up to the age of 26 to remain on their parents’ policies; preventive care will be provided without cost sharing; and there are new processes to appeal insurance company decisions. The critics aren’t saying anything about the huge value of those immediate benefits.These new requirements do impose some new costs on insurers, but they certainly can’t be blamed for the double-digit increases many insurers have been seeking. If you listen closely to the insurers, they admit that.The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the average premium increase to pay for the new benefits should be about 1 percent to 2 percent, roughly consistent with an independent evaluation by the Urban Institute. If those estimates are optimistic, they are unlikely to be off by much. A Wall Street Journal analysis found insurers in various states seeking increases of 1 percent to 9 percent to pay for the new requirements and often even more to cover rising medical costs.'"
"'10-09-25,'0','A federal judge in Manhattan rejected on Friday a request that he dismiss charges in a prominent Mafia case on the grounds that the government had engaged in misconduct by allowing a cooperating witness to run a sex-trafficking ring that involved a 15-year-old girl.The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, ruled in a case that received widespread attention in April, when prosecutors announced charges against 14 members and associates of the Gambino crime family in what one official called “a new low” for the organization.The charges included allegations that some defendants had been involved in a sex-trafficking network, in which they recruited women and a 15-year-old girl to work as prostitutes in New York and New Jersey.But a defense lawyer, Gerald J. McMahon, argued that the government had engaged in “outrageous” misconduct because one man involved in running the network, Jude Buoneto, was a cooperating witness in the investigation and had also sexually abused a young girl in the 1990s.The judge said Friday that the old abuse allegation was of “no moment whatsoever.”“The F.B.I.’s use of convicted criminals as confidential informants or cooperators, while perhaps distasteful, is necessary and appropriate,” he said.The judge also said Mr. Buoneto’s role in the trafficking while serving as a cooperating witness did not warrant dismissal of the charges.Prosecutors have said the operation was quickly ended after the witness and the Federal Bureau of Investigation learned of the girl’s age. The judge noted that even had the government allowed Mr. Buoneto to participate in the ring while “recklessly disregarding that it involved a minor,” the decision would not have justified dismissing charges.'"
"'10-09-25,'0','During more than two decades in politics, Mr. Caputo has advised Boris Yeltsin and promoted Reagan administration policies in Central America. At one point, he says, fearing that Russian thugs were after him, he went into hiding on a boat in South Florida with only a parrot named August West for company.He has brought his unconventional approach to American politics as well — deploying people wearing duck suits and blowing whistles to drown out opponents at political rallies, and dispatching comely models outside polling stations to lure more voters to his candidates.As he operates behind the scenes, Mr. Caputo, 48, has become an indispensable coach to Mr. Paladino, who likes to say that he is still learning to be a politician. Mr. Paladino considers Mr. Caputo the campaign’s creative force, devising his go-for-the-jugular offensives.“I’m facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes,” Mr. Paladino said. “You’ve got to let them know they are going to get punished.”Mr. Caputo, who spent much of his childhood in Buffalo, recalls that he met Mr. Paladino the hard way.He was 14 and a self-described juvenile delinquent. One day, he was caught by a newsstand worker stealing a box of change in a building owned by Mr. Paladino.Within seconds, Mr. Paladino was rushing downstairs. He grabbed the boy by the ears, dragged him outside and kicked him in the legs six times.“Don’t you ever come back,” Mr. Paladino said, according to Mr. Caputo.They did not cross paths again until March, when Mr. Paladino was considering a long-shot bid for governor. Mr. Caputo, who says he was hoping to settle into a leisurely life after spending much of his career in crisis management, had just moved back to Buffalo from Florida to work for his father’s insurance company.But then Mr. Paladino called. He had heard good things from Roger J. Stone Jr., a Republican consultant known for his ferocious tactics who remains an influential adviser to Mr. Paladino’s campaign. Mr. Stone was a mentor to Mr. Caputo, who had once served as his driver, and told Mr. Paladino that his protégé understood that successful campaigns involved making politics entertaining.Those who know Mr. Caputo say he shares Mr. Paladino’s sensibilities.“He’s a colorful character who has found a candidate who is just as colorful and just as much of a character as he is,” Robert H. Ryan, a longtime Republican consultant, said.But Mr. Caputo is his own brand of Republican. He cites Ronald Reagan and Jerry Garcia as people who have shaped his worldview (he has attended hundreds of Grateful Dead concerts). He has also written extensively on protecting the environment.“He’s a countercultural guy,” said Mr. Stone, who is second only to Mr. Caputo’s father on Mr. Caputo’s speed-dial. “He’s as likely to show up in a tie-dyed T-shirt as a three-piece suit.”Mr. Caputo began his career in message-managing as an Army public affairs specialist based in Hawaii.After leaving the military, he worked for conservative politicians, including former Representative Jack Kemp. His career eventually took him to countries including Ukraine, Mongolia and Honduras. He said he was briefly kidnapped in El Salvador on a diplomatic mission for Mr. Kemp.Mr. Caputo worked for the United States Agency for International Development as an adviser to the Yeltsin administration in 1995. It was in Russia that he got the scar, on his right ankle, from a run-in, he says, with a drunken political operative.When he returned to the United States in 1999, he found the American political scene boring.“In Russia, the fascists want to kill you, the communists want to starve you, and the democrats want to pick your pocket for a while,” Mr. Caputo said. “I got back to the United States and I realized that the only difference between John Kerry and George Bush was a degree of tax cut.”He made a cameo appearance in New York politics in 2007 when Eliot Spitzer was governor, making it his mission to forward negative articles and unflattering cartoons about Mr. Spitzer to anyone with influence.On the Paladino campaign, Mr. Caputo is part of a three-person team responsible for executing the campaign, which includes Nick Sinatra, a former confidant to Karl Rove, and John F. Haggerty Jr., a former campaign worker for Michael R. Bloomberg whom the Manhattan district attorney has accused of stealing $1.1 million of the mayor’s money.On a recent day at campaign headquarters in Buffalo, Mr. Caputo yelled at Mr. Paladino as the candidate stumbled through a script for a YouTube video on a plan to use prison space to teach job skills to welfare recipients.“Just think about it, Carl,” Mr. Caputo demanded as he tried to get his boss to focus.“It’s not coming good,” said Mr. Paladino, muttering a series of expletives.Opponents have denounced Mr. Caputo’s high jinks as crass. “Not every idea he has is a winner,” his friend Mr. Stone said.But Mr. Caputo is unapologetic. He wasted no time in cooking up another madcap advertisement on Wednesday when Mr. Bloomberg, New York’s billionaire mayor, came out in support of Mr. Cuomo.In an e-mail to reporters, Mr. Caputo dismissed the two men as political elites who traveled in the “same royal coach.”“One upside to this,” Mr. Caputo wrote. “The two can stop passing Grey Poupon back and forth from their limousines. It’s holding up traffic on Park Avenue.”'"
"'10-09-25,'0','Michael Jones, the Liquor Authority’s deputy chief executive in the city, has the tricky job of balancing the desires of the neighbors with the needs of restaurants, where the money pulled in by an outdoor operation can keep a business alive, especially after a recession-era winter like the last one.“They have a right to run a business,” Mr. Jones said, “and the community has a right to have quiet and the ability to sleep at night.”Now the sleepless are taking matters into their own hands. Last month, a state appellate court agreed with a co-op next to the Empire Hotel, near Lincoln Center, that music from its rooftop bar was “unreasonable and affected the residents’ right to use and enjoy their respective apartments.” A remedy has yet to be determined.State lawmakers are stepping in, too. The Legislature enacted a law this summer making it easier for the Liquor Authority to revoke a bar’s license if the police are called there at least six times in 60 days. And Assemblywoman Joan L. Millman of Brooklyn introduced legislation that would require restaurants and bars to secure a special license for backyard or rooftop spaces; those operations would have to close by 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and by 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, unless the local community board approved extended hours.In the meantime, community boards, which make nonbinding recommendations that they say the Liquor Authority has tended to follow in recent months, have become more aggressive. Increasingly, they have advised that applications be denied or have earlier closing hours negotiated for the outdoor spaces.“We try very hard to discourage applicants from using rear yards,” said Jo Hamilton, chairwoman of Manhattan Community Board 2, which governs some of the city’s most congested nightlife destinations, including NoLIta, Greenwich Village and the meatpacking district. If the applicants go ahead anyway, Ms. Hamilton said, the board at least tries to make them hew to the hours of sidewalk cafes, which generally must close by midnight on weeknights and by 1 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.But residents say that those stipulations are difficult to enforce. Neighbors can call the police, but by the time they arrive the noise may have quieted, or officers may not be aware that the bar has agreed to close early.“It’s not against the law to be open at 3 o’clock in the morning, but if there’s a stipulation, that would violate our regulations,” said Mr. Jones, the Liquor Authority official. “The police can’t really do anything, but they can tell us.”Even then, it can take more than a year to revoke a liquor license if the threat to the public is not considered dire, like violent crime or drug dealing, Mr. Jones said.That has fueled frustration in many corners of the city, especially downtown Manhattan, where community board meetings sometimes stretch late into the night as established and aspiring restaurateurs plead their cases and residents rally to block their applications. Anna Wintour, the editor of Vogue, recently descended on a meeting to prevent Miss Lily’s, a Jamaican restaurant, from moving to Houston Street in the West Village and opening a terrace space near the backyard of her town house.These frictions begin anew each year, as the first hint of spring nudges bar patrons to head outside and neighbors to open windows, according to data from the city’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications. The number of 311 noise complaints tends to spike in May, then dip, as it did this June, when it grew hot enough that people fled to air-conditioning. The calls pick up again as temperatures drop.Long Island City, a once-quiet neighborhood where mixed-use zoning has allowed restaurants, bars and clubs to proliferate, has followed this pattern; complaints for the first half of this year were up 44 percent from 2009, with the overwhelming majority in March, April and May. Lounge 47, a neighborhood hangout that is hardly among the city’s rowdiest, has become a lightning rod for many of the tensions surrounding the area’s revitalization.One of the first places along Vernon Boulevard to stay open late and cater to the younger residents moving in, the lounge quickly drew the ire of neighbors when it opened the backyard patio six years ago. Now, in an area where waterfront towers and condominium buildings loom over brick- and vinyl-clad houses, it is part of a four-block stretch north of 50th Street that has about 20 establishments.Fans of the bar say its owner has shown good faith, agreeing in recent months to close the patio by 10 p.m. on weeknights and midnight on weekends.“The crowds that have come to the area — artsy people, interesting people, it’s just a really good mix — wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the towers that have gone up and the restaurants and bars,” said Niall Carolan, who managed the lounge until recently. “Sometimes things get boisterous and there are some expletives used, but these things happen in bars.”Neighbors say the bar has not done enough to make patrons understand their concerns. Even a little noise — a moderate conversation, the occasional guffaw — can shatter the peace inside nearby homes once it has bounced off the surrounding brick and concrete walls.One resident, William Garrett, a sound engineer who said he was reluctant to comment for this article because the fight had become too personal, has been waging his own war to get Lounge 47 shut down, posting videos of late-night smoking, drinking and cursing on YouTube.How it will end is anyone’s guess. The Liquor Authority has been weighing disciplinary action for past violations, and Mr. Jones said there was “credible evidence” that the bar was not living up to its agreement.Mr. Raschilla, meanwhile, said he and his neighbors would continue to be frustrated by life on the banks of a watering hole.“My life should not be a sideshow — ‘Oh look, they’ve got the lights on. I wonder what they’re making for dinner,’ ” he said. “I think they could do a better job of educating the people who come in that once they’re in the back, they’re part of a community.”'"
"'10-09-25,'0','The accompanying charts compare various aspects of the last four recessions — the two followed by slow recoveries and the last of the old type, as well as the latest downturn.The lines all begin with the official beginning of the recession, allowing an easy comparison of how much worse that particular aspect of the economy became as the recession went on. The ending months of each recession are shown at the same point, making it easy to see how severe the downturn was and how rapid the recovery.There are some aspects of this cycle that have no direct precedent. One is the performance of service industries. For most of the years after World War II, the United States economy became more and more oriented toward service jobs, and both employment and spending rose, whatever the state of the rest of the economy. But this time service businesses suffered, and they have been slow to recover.That is particularly true for the industry that bears the most blame for the recession — financial services. The big banks were bailed out — Lehman Brothers excepted — but employment fell sharply during the recession and has continued to decline.Another area that is weaker than in previous recoveries is the condition of state and local governments. Working for them was always considered safe, if not particularly rewarding. Neither of the two recessions before the latest one had any significant impact on those jobs.But in this cycle, governments are facing severe budget shortfalls, and layoffs are accelerating.In the private sector, there have been some signs of recovery in jobs, but those signs are faint. Instead, employers are getting more work out of the workers they have. Total hours worked are rising much more rapidly than total jobs.That could be a sign of better times ahead. There are limits to how many extra hours are available, so the pressures to hire more people may be growing in some industries.If those pressures do grow, there is no shortage of people who need work. The unemployment rate has remained stubbornly high, and the long-term unemployment rate — defined as the proportion of the labor force out of work for at least 15 weeks — rose to levels not reached since the government started compiling the figures in 1948. It has slipped a bit since peaking in April, but remains higher than during any previous cycle.'"
"'10-09-25,'0','The concert was consistently impressive. That I was not blown away had more to do with the cooler characteristics of Mr. Muti’s artistry, in evidence here, than with any shortfall in the playing. The Chicago Symphony sounded terrific, and the rapport the musicians have with their new conductor was palpable.For decades Mr. Muti had a well-deserved reputation as a perfectionist. While still exacting, he seems mellower, though as limber and kinetic as ever. In a Chicago Symphony season brochure he is quoted as saying, “I believe the music director should be a leader, a father, a brother, but not a dictator.”This quotation came to mind when, as is customary, Mr. Muti conducted the national anthem to begin the new season. The night before I had heard Alan Gilbert conduct it to open the New York Philharmonic’s season, and the contrast was telling. Mr. Gilbert led a stirring performance, not too fast, not too emphatic, very audience-friendly.Mr. Muti faced the audience as he conducted. His tempo was bracing; no dawdling allowed. He brought sweeping flourishes to climactic phrases. Looking intently into the hall, he clearly wanted everyone to sing. Here was the leader, the father, who knew what he wanted yet was relaxed about it.Then he turned to the “Symphonie Fantastique.” Only someone as experienced in opera as Mr. Muti could have conducted “Dreams — Passions,” the first movement, with such sensitivity to phrasing. The tempo was somewhat contained, even during the movement’s episodic flights. There was no flashy excess. Subtlety, transparency, a feeling for the elusive character of the music: these were the hallmarks of the performance.Mr. Muti brought out the inner details and circuitous counterpoint in “A Ball” so clearly that for once this graceful, sly waltz seemed an extension of the strange first movement, not a diversion from it. “A Scene in the Country” had Beethovenian, pastoral calm. The “March to the Scaffold” was incisive, full of blazing colors and slashing chords. Still, for music that depicts a man half-crazed from an opium overdose, in despair over the woman he adores from afar, this death march sounded a little too regimented and efficient. I had the same reservation about the “Witches’ Sabbath” finale, brilliantly played but strangely clear-headed.The “Symphonie Fantastique” (1830) was inspired by Berlioz’s mad infatuation with the Irish actress Harriet Smithson. “Lélio” (1831; revised, 1855) was also provoked by real life, when Berlioz’s fiancée, Camille Moke, left him for another man. In this work he conflated Camille with Harriet and told a follow-up story to the symphony.The narrator, Lélio (a stand-in for Berlioz), anguished over the impossibility of love, takes comfort in art and music. The narration, written by Berlioz, is sometimes pierced by strands from the “Symphonie Fantastique” or cushioned by soft orchestral chords. But mostly the narration sets up six pre-existing shorter works that Berlioz chose from among his compositions at that time. They range in scope from “The Fisherman,” a bittersweet ballad for tenor (here the bright-voiced Mario Zeffiri) and piano, to “Song of the Brigands,” a hard-driving, infectious piece, robustly sung by the excellent bass-baritone Kyle Ketelsen and the men of the Chicago Symphony Chorus.“Lélio” was effectively semistaged, with the orchestra dimly visible behind a scrim. (Jason Brown was the lighting designer; Anya Plotkin was production stage manager.) In one striking image the choristers had mini-flashlights, which made a starry matrix in the background. Portraying Lélio was the acclaimed French actor Gérard Depardieu, who paced the stage in front of the scrim, bellowing lines in fits, then slinking despondently into an easy chair.For the final section, a wondrously strange and tinkling Fantasy on Shakespeare’s “Tempest” for full chorus and orchestra, the scrim was raised, and blinding light filled the stage. “Lélio” is essentially a dramatically inventive recycling job. Still, to hear this pairing of works as Berlioz intended was fascinating.New Yorkers will have a chance to hear the program, along with a concert performance of Verdi’s “Otello,” and check out the Muti-Chicago chemistry when the orchestra appears at Carnegie Hall for two nights in April.'"
"'10-09-25,'0','Mr. Gere said he was offered the script a few years ago, at a time when he was looking for films that his young son, Homer, could enjoy.“It had to do with these questions of life and death and loyalty,” said Mr. Gere, who in a recent telephone interview was careful not to use the word pet to describe the shelter dog his family keeps.“It does imply a hierarchy of import, doesn’t it?” Mr. Gere said. “I don’t know who’s the master of who in these relationships.”After joining the film in the role of the professor as well as a producer, Mr. Gere recruited Mr. Hallstrom, who had recently directed him in “The Hoax,” a 2007 film about the forger Clifford Irving.Mr. Hallstrom, who broke through in the United States with his Swedish coming-of-age film, “My Life as a Dog,” in which the young protagonist is shattered to learn of the death of his family’s hound, said he was wary of taking on material that was in any way similar.“I had taken pride in being absolutely unsentimental with ‘My Life as a Dog,’ and this was a very sentimental story,” Mr. Hallstrom said in a telephone interview.But he added that he found the title character in “Hachi” as compelling as any of the humans he’d focused on in his previous films.“I don’t point fingers at the different incarnations of life,” Mr. Hallstrom said. “Whether it is eccentrics or outsiders or dogs, I want to be as truthful as possible in depicting them.” The film was shot primarily in Rhode Island, using three Akitas to play the different stages of Hachi’s life and his varying dispositions: one dog that was good at sitting calmly, a second that was trained to walk slowly and a third that “ran a lot and jumped a lot and licked people’s faces,” Mr. Hallstrom said. Mr. Gere described his introduction to his four-legged co-stars by an animal trainer as if he were being initiated into a rock star’s entourage.“He said, ‘Don’t touch them, don’t reach out, don’t even look at them in that first meeting,’ ” Mr. Gere recalled. “ ‘Just come and hang with us and be yourself.’ ”There was, Mr. Gere said, “a certain amount of anxiety, of would we get along? They cannot be bought.” But after about three days, he said, “One of the dogs came over and put her head right on my lap. And that was a big moment — I was accepted in the pack.”But “Hachi” was not as eagerly embraced by Sony Pictures Entertainment. The studio, which controlled the film’s theatrical distribution when Mr. Gere joined the project as a producer, opted not to release it in American theaters. (The movie was shown at a handful of film festivals and made available on DVD.)“You think of all the people who really love their animals, love their dogs, love their cats, would embrace this specific movie,” Mr. Gere said. “But Sony just had no imagination for it. It was really bizarre.”Through a spokesman, Sony declined to comment for this article. Mr. Hallstrom could only speculate about the reasoning behind the studio’s decision.“It’s a very small movie, one could say, and Richard may not be the romantic draw that he used to be,” he said. Ultimately, Mr. Hallstrom said the studio’s strategy was “a mistake of being overly worried about the size of the movie as opposed to the emotional impact of it.”The Hallmark Channel, which broadcasts about 22 original movies a year and is available to 90 million cable subscribers nationally, quickly stepped into the breach. The opportunity offered by Sony to present the debut of a film with recognizable names, and a story line that resonated with its audience, was essentially irresistible.“It was one of those, ‘Would you like to buy it?’ — ‘Yes,’ ” said Michelle Vicary, the channel’s senior vice president for acquisitions and scheduling. “We didn’t even wait for them to finish the sentence.”Mr. Gere said that though all filmmakers would prefer their work to play in theaters, he was glad his dog story had found a home, and that his son, now 10, was able to appreciate it. For his part, Mr. Hallstrom seemed impressed with his Akita actors, particularly when compared with his family’s two Cavalier King Charles spaniels .“The Akitas had a very wonderful, reserved personality and stoic demeanor,” Mr. Hallstrom said. “You can’t say that about the Cavalier King Charles. They seem to be able to run away with anyone.”'"
"'10-09-25,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — New orders for long-lasting American manufactured goods fell more than expected in August to post their largest decline in a year as bookings for aircraft and motor vehicles tumbled, but business spending rebounded strongly, a government report showed on Friday.The Commerce Department said durable goods orders dropped 1.3 percent after a revised 0.7 percent increase in July. Markets had expected orders to fall 1.0 percent from a previously reported 0.4 percent gain. The decline last month reflected a 40.2 percent plunge in nonmilitary aircraft orders after a 69.1 percent surge in July.The Boeing Company received only 10 orders for civilian aircraft in August, a sharp slowdown from 130 bookings in July, according to information posted on the plane maker’s Web site. Orders were also weighed down by bookings for military aircraft, which fell 2.7 percent, and a 4.4 percent drop in motor vehicle orders.Excluding transportation, orders rose by a more-than-expected 2 percent after falling by a revised 2.8 percent in July, previously reported as a 3.7 percent fall. It was the largest rise since March.Durable goods orders are a leading indicator of manufacturing, a sector leading the economy’s recovery from the longest and deepest recession since the Great Depression as businesses replenish inventories.But manufacturing is slowing as domestic demand remains tepid, with households grappling with unemployment and falling wealth.'"

"'10-09-26,'0','Robert W. McCollum, a former dean of the Dartmouth Medical School who made significant contributions to the understanding of viral diseases, including polio, hepatitis and mononucleosis, died Sept. 13 at his home in Etna, N.H. He was 85.The cause was heart failure, said his daughter, Cynthia McCollum.Most of Dr. McCollum’s research was done during his nearly three decades as a professor and later chairman of the epidemiology department at Yale.Working on a team at Yale led by Dr. Dorothy M. Horstmann in the early 1950s, Dr. McCollum and his colleagues collected blood samples from people with polio and their families. They used some of the samples to isolate the polio virus and discovered that before it reached the spinal cord and paralyzed patients, it circulated in the blood.That finding was a breakthrough in the understanding of how the virus causes the disease and formed a basis for the development of polio vaccines, which elicit antibodies to block the virus before it enters the spinal cord.In the late 1950s, while still at Yale, Dr. McCollum collaborated with Dr. Saul Krugman at New York University to study hepatitis, which can cause liver disease and significantly contribute to liver cancer. Their team investigated the disease’s spread through blood transfusions by tracing its patterns in patients at the Willowbrook State School on Staten Island.'"

"'10-09-26,'0','Dr. Harrison died on Friday at the age of 75, the Nelson-Berna Funeral Home in Fayetteville said. He had received a diagnosis of leukemia in May.Dr. Harrison readily admitted that he destroyed life, but denied that he killed babies. His view was that an embryo was far from being a human being with a brain. The higher moral value to Dr. Harrison was salvaging the future of an often disadvantaged girl or woman.But he drew a line at performing abortions in the third trimester of pregnancy, partly, he said, because they made him uncomfortable and partly because he felt he lacked the expertise. He sent those who wanted one to his friend Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kan., an expert surgeon who was assassinated in his church by an anti-abortion zealot in 2009. Dr. Harrison often gave those patients money for gasoline for the trip to Wichita.William Floyd Nathaniel Harrison, the son of small-town teachers, was born in rural Faulkner County, Ark., on Sept. 8, 1935. His mother would say that she knew he was destined to become an obstetrician because he essentially delivered himself as his father rode on horseback to fetch the doctor. He grew up going to Methodist and Baptist churches (his mother played piano at both), and twice read the entire Bible at 12, ending up, he said, thoroughly unimpressed with the God it described.By his account, he piled up D’s and F’s at what is now the University of Central Arkansas in Conway before enlisting in the Navy at 17. He later enrolled at the University of Arkansas, where he studied business until he fell for Betty Waggoner. She was dating a pre-med student, he said, so he switched to that to impress her. They were married for 50 years.In addition to his wife, Dr. Harrison is survived by his daughters, Amanda Robinson and Rebecca Harrison; his son, Benjamin III; a brother, Ben; two sisters, Mary Harrell and Martha Harrison; and seven grandchildren.Dr. Harrison received his undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Arkansas and did his internship and residency there. He and a colleague set up the Fayetteville Women’s Clinic in 1972.Dr. Harrison performed his first abortion in 1974, a year after they became legal, and found himself doing them sporadically while his clinic was booming delivering babies. But by 1984, as older doctors retired and younger ones shied from offering abortions, often fearing being ostracized or attacked, he became the only doctor in his area performing them.As more and more abortion patients knocked on his door, he said, he began recalling the woman who would have preferred cancer to pregnancy. He also recalled the many women who had come to the hospital seriously injured by illegal abortions.So after delivering more than 6,000 babies, he gave up that practice and devoted himself to abortions, writing that if he wanted them to be legal, safe and available, the only moral and ethical course was for him to do them.As for the protesters frequently outside his clinic, he often said they were splendid advertising, drawing women in need to the clinic who might otherwise have not known where to go.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','If all the sexual allegations now swirling around the White House turn out to be true, President Clinton may be a candidate for sex addiction therapy. But feminists will still have been right to resist pressure by the right wing and the news media to call for his resignation or impeachment. The pressure came from another case of the double standard.For one thing, if the president had behaved with comparable insensitivity toward environmentalists, and at the same time remained their most crucial champion and bulwark against an anti-environmental Congress, would they be expected to desert him? I don’t think so. If President Clinton were as vital to preserving freedom of speech as he is to preserving reproductive freedom, would journalists be condemned as “inconsistent” for refusing to suggest he resign? Forget it.For another, there was and is a difference between the accusations against Mr. Clinton and those against Bob Packwood and Clarence Thomas. Commentators might stop puzzling over the president’s favorable poll ratings, especially among women, if they understood the common-sense guideline to sexual behavior that came out of the women’s movement 30 years ago: no means no; yes means yes.It’s the basis of sexual harassment law. It also explains why the news media’s obsession with sex qua sex is offensive to some, titillating to many and beside the point to almost everybody. Like most feminists, most Americans become concerned about sexual behavior when someone’s will has been violated; that is, when “no” hasn’t been accepted as an answer.Perhaps we have a responsibility to make it O.K. for politicians to tell the truth — providing they are respectful of “no means no; yes means yes” — and still be able to enter high office.Until then, we will disqualify energy and talent the country needs.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','He defined “governmental gridlock” as a period when no single party controlled the White House and both chambers in Congress. From 1926 through last year, an index of large-capitalization stocks returned about 7 percent, annualized, when there was gridlock, compared with about 12 percent when there was not.Despite some years of surging stock markets during divided governments in the Reagan and Clinton administrations, those stretches were outweighed in the long historical record by lagging returns in other years.Oddly enough, while the data doesn’t support the idea that gridlock is beneficial, it does show that stocks fare better when Congress is out of session, much as Rogers suggested. Along with Michael F. Ferguson of the University of Cincinnati, Professor Witte corroborated this finding in a 2006 paper.The researchers found that more than 90 percent of the price gains over the 108-year life of the Dow Jones industrial average through 2006 came on days when Congress was out of session. And in periods when polls showed that Congress was least popular, this “Congressional effect” was most pronounced.Their work was inspired by a 1992 article in Barron’s titled, “Legislator Go Home!” by Eric T. Singer, then an investment banker, who reached the same conclusions. Two years ago, he founded the Congressional Effect mutual fund, which has outperformed the market. The fund’s strategy is to abandon stocks when Congress meets, and to invest in them when it recesses.The idea, he said, is “to capture the returns of the stock market while limiting political risk.”Why should the Congressional effect work? Professors Witte and Ferguson aren’t sure, but have three possible explanations.One might be called the Will Rogers-Mark Twain theory. (In his autobiography, Twain wrote: “Suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.”) Because Congress has historically been held in low esteem, this explanation suggests, Congressional activity drags down the public mood, depressing prices.Another might be called the populist thesis: investors conclude that Congress isn’t acting in the public interest, the professors write, but “rather in the service of powerful financial and economic incumbents,” and this is most obvious when Congress meets.Most probable, Professor Witte said, is a third explanation, that investors are unnerved by “regulatory uncertainty,” which rises when Congress is active. When the atmosphere clears and Congress goes home, investors are more likely to bid up prices.But tensions may rise in periods of split government, when the two parties are at loggerheads, and this could add to perceptions of uncertainty, sometimes leading to market underperformance. “Uncertainty seems to be a key factor,” said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research, an investment consulting firm, who has found that any change in the political control of Congress seems to have a “modestly negative effect” on markets.A more powerful cyclical effect, he said, is the tendency of markets to rise in the third year of a presidential term, particularly for first-term presidents. But that’s the subject of another column.If government action is crucial, then gridlock is not an attractive outcome. Ethan S. Harris, chief North American economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, says that because of an unusual series of “automatic mechanisms” built into the law this year, if Congress is gridlocked, the result could be “disastrous.”On Dec. 31, he said, not only do Bush-era tax cuts expire, but tax breaks enacted in the Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus program will also disappear. In addition, he said, there could be a $60 billion tax increase if Congress can’t adjust another levy, the alternative minimum tax. “Put it all together and there is a potential $300 billion shock to the economy,” he said, and that could bring on a recession.“I can’t imagine a time in modern history where gridlock has been more of a problem than it would be right now,” he said.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','MY Washington town house was built in 1905 — just in time, perhaps, to observe the inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt, who was sworn in on March 4. As a writer living in what amounts to an ivory tower — or at least an off-white walk-up — I like to imagine myself seated here then, catching a few of Roosevelt’s screechy remarks. It was a windy day, and he had to keep a tight hold of his typescript. Who knows, the phrase “Power invariably means both responsibility and danger” may have blown across the park and buffeted against these curving panes.For sheer theater, however, nothing eclipsed Ronald Reagan’s decision, in 1981, to stage his inauguration on the other side of the Capitol. Like Davy Crockett (or was it Fess Parker?) crossing the Appalachian Mountains, like Lincoln and William McKinley returning home, like Grover Cleveland throwing open the great Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago, Mr. Reagan aligned himself toward the West. No matter that the fugitive frontier which “explains American development” had long since dissolved into the Pacific. He wanted to project his cheerful pieties in the same symbolic direction — and, not incidentally, give Yuri Andropov a view of his back.Alas for this house, the Reagan Realignment means that all future presidents, unless they are partial to parking lots, will take their oaths facing the same way, over one of the world’s great urban spaces. Whoever sits here after me and wishes to experience something of the elation attending the election of President M’Chege Hwange, or President Nguyen Nu, or even President Kathy McLane (my intern of a few summers back, and a cinch for the White House), is going to have to forsake this ivory tower and join the crowd further down the Hill.On Inauguration Day, though, I think I’ll stay put. Not that I don’t wish Bill Clinton well — who, knowing what confronts him, doesn’t? When noon approaches I’ll stand close to the glass and hope to sense, if not see, something of that most solemn of constitutional moments, the transfer of power from one president to another. If the transfer is also from party to party, then so much the better for democracy. Civilized government requires that the bums be thrown out with some regularity.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','LEE’S SUMMIT, Mo. — Elsewhere, the mourning dove is a symbol of peace.But here in western Missouri, the sight of those familiar speckled wings against the September sky means something altogether different: hunting season has arrived.On a blustery afternoon last week filled with the promise of rain, three friends squatted patiently in a field of wilted sunflowers, each resting a camouflaged knee on the muddy earth. Jon Rogers, who had skipped work even though he already had a freezer full of dove meat, cupped his hands together to imitate the familiar call: coo-Hoo, coo-coo-Coo.In Iowa, that is officially the call of a songbird, and the mourning dove is protected. In Michigan the hunting of mourning doves was banned, reinstated for a single season, then banned again after a statewide referendum. But hunters in 41 other states — including Wisconsin, where the bird is the officially designated symbol of peace — have made the mourning dove the most popular game bird in the United States.“You need a gun, a box of shells, the necessary permits and, if you want to get really fancy, a five-gallon bucket to sit on,” said John H. Schulz, a wildlife research biologist for the Missouri Department of Conservation. “It’s inexpensive, it’s easy and it’s a great gateway to hunting.”It is so popular that the Humane Society of the United States, which cited the sport as releasing more lead into the environment than any other hunting activity, has made no effort to fight the pastime in states where it is most established, said the organization’s president, Wayne Pacelle.Dove hunting offers some of the best shooting practice one can hope for in preparation for the coming deer, turkey and quail seasons. A mourning dove in flight moves like a windswept tumbleweed. It will dart and dive and swerve unpredictably; its movements can almost seem like evasive maneuvers. An average of five shells are fired for each bird killed.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','One day, a barber said, “Do you want me to do something about your eyebrows?” I’d never thought of my eyebrows as needing something done. They didn’t beetle outward or obscure my sight like a thicket of gorse. I said yes, wondering George Clooney or Joan Crawford? Snick, snick, snick. The answer was Clooney, and I knew I’d found my regular barber.The years passed. I was never an ideal customer. I required too few services, too little product, and I stopped in too seldom. My eyebrows grow slowly, so I added a beard. My barber knew that when I left, the first thing I did was mess up my hair. Therefore I tipped well. It was a partnership.Not long ago, when I called for an appointment I was told that my barber had retired — to Florida. I agreed to be taken on by another barber in the shop, but when I showed up the shop was gone — the space boarded up in the construction around the Grace Building. I called again and was told the shop had merged with another on the ground floor of a nearby building. I found it, sat down in a roomful of strangers, and had my hair cut by another stranger. She, too, offered to do something about my eyebrows. I let her. I liked her, but I realized I wasn’t ready for another relationship.This is New York. Your biological rhythms overlap with the city until one day they seem to converge. Routine becomes ceremony. Habit acquires a kind of sanctity. Then one day, boom, your barber decides he’s scissored enough scalps, somebody slaps up plywood, and you’re out on your own again. I feel fine most days, but sometimes I look at the men on the street, waiting at crosswalks, marching through Grand Central, and I wonder how many of them feel barber-less.So get a new barber, you say. It’s not that simple. You have to ease into these rhythms. You want to come out of the shop feeling like your head’s your own. You want the conversation to be amiable, lulling, like a Turkish bath, until there’s only the sound of the scissors. Above all, you want to be able to find the shop when you go looking for it.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','“I don’t think it’s over yet,” he said. “But no, there’s no disappointment at all. I think New York made great strides this summer, the players that we have at hand.”This is the Knicks’ new burden. They acquired an elite player in Stoudemire and revamped the roster with fresh young talent, but the conversation is still about whom they failed to get: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and now, apparently, Anthony.The Knicks had hoped to sign Anthony as a free agent next summer, and are managing their salary cap accordingly. Anthony has made no secret of his desire to play here. His impatience has probably obliterated those plans and accelerated his departure.News of Anthony’s discontent began leaking over the summer, poisoning the well with the Nuggets. Rather than bring a brooding superstar to camp the team resolved to trade him.The Knicks had fleeting discussions with Denver about Anthony, but Nuggets officials were not enthusiastic about any of the Knicks’ young talent — specifically Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler and Anthony Randolph. The Knicks also lack the draft picks Denver is seeking.In the proposed four-team trade, which also involves the Utah Jazz and the Charlotte Bobcats, Denver would acquire Derrick Favors, the third pick in the June draft, from the Nets and Andrei Kirilenko from the Jazz, along with multiple picks.There are mixed reports about whether Anthony is prepared to accept the trade. Although he cannot veto a deal, he could scuttle it by refusing to agree to an extension with the Nets.Donnie Walsh, the Knicks’ president, is close to several executives involved in the deal —notably Bobcats Coach Larry Brown, Nuggets Coach George Karl and Nets General Manager Billy King. Walsh professed not to have any insight into the reports, but said, “I think there could be some validity to it.”As the weekend began, there were interested spectators on both sides of the Hudson. Favors and point guard Devin Harris — who would be shipped to Charlotte in the deal — practiced Saturday morning.“I just try to look on the bright side of everything,” Harris said. “My job is to get everybody ready for preseason, and that’s what I’m doing.”Harris said he had received no official word on the trade. He had hoped to lead a Nets turnaround after a 70-loss season.Nets Coach Avery Johnson referred questions about the trade to King, who was not made available to reporters. “Ninety percent of the trades you hear about never happen,” he said.Knicks Coach Mike D’Antoni was also guarded on the subject, saying, “I’ve got 15 stars right here I’m worried about.”If the reports are a distraction to the Nets, they provided a measure of relief to some of the Knicks. Gallinari, their most promising prospect, was frequently mentioned as a trade chip in any Anthony deal.“I’m here,” Gallinari said. “And I’d like to stay here.”The Knicks would prefer to keep their young players in any case, and add another elite player via free agency. After a busy off-season, their roster is deeper and more talented than any they have had in years.“Carmelo’s decision is based on him and his family,” Stoudemire said, adding, “But we got to focus on the team that we have right here.”Stoudemire and Raymond Felton, the Knicks’ new starting point guard, were named co-captains by D’Antoni on Friday night. Stoudemire responded by telling his teammates that they all need to be leaders this season. But there is no mistaking where the Knicks’ swagger begins.“Teams are going to be aiming for us, because we’re now a team to beat,” Stoudemire said. “So we got to make sure we’re ready.”'"

After the couple’s renovated three-bedroom one-bath colonial, priced at $499,000, had lingered on the market for four months without an offer, it was rented out for $2,900 a month.“We could not have made the move without getting the rent to cover our mortgage,” Ms. Dagle said. With the current lease expiring as of Jan. 1, the house at 52 Overlook Road is again on the market — at the same price — and also offered for rent.“It’s sort of ‘whichever comes first,’ ” Ms. Dagle said.In Montclair, in Essex County, the residential market is still outperforming the state’s as a whole, but specialists say the rental alternative is becoming more common, especially if a short sale may be in the works.For example, 305 North Mountain Avenue, a six-bedroom Victorian, was offered last summer as a short sale, and also for rent. Martha Kolko of Keller Williams Towne Square, the listing agent, said the thinking was that since short sales take at least six months a family relocating to the area might want to rent it in the interim. Last week, however, the rental option was withdrawn, and the price lowered to $735,000 from $759,000.One side effect of a market flooded with both sales and rentals is that renters are gaining clout when it comes to negotiating, just as buyers have.“Renters may not be aware that they can negotiate,” said Ms. Idler, who represents parties on all sides of home transactions. “They always have the right to try, and in this market, they certainly have the opportunity.”Ms. Idler said many homeowners she represents still could not come to terms with the reality of prices’ having fallen by an average of 20 percent.“If a seller is pricing a home too high,” she added, “then I usually make sure they also offer it for rent.”Among her current offerings is 1325 Fayette Street in Teaneck, a six-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath colonial with a chef’s kitchen, a banquet-size dining room, and sliding glass doors to the deck.Previously listed by another agency at $829,000, it is now on the market for $789,000, which the listing material posted on Realtor.com says would mean an estimated monthly mortgage and tax payment of $4,639. The rental rate is $4,000 a month.Likewise, a four-bedroom split level at 4-40 Bryant Place in Fair Lawn is listed by Winzona Realty at a rental rate slightly below the monthly mortgage and tax payment: $2,600 to rent; $529,000 to buy, with a $3,100 monthly payment.This is usually but not always the formula. But Ms. Idler says renters need to be aware of maintenance costs that might surprise them — “snow removal after a blizzard at a corner property,” for instance.She says she believes that buying a home is still the better deal as long as a buyer plans to stay in a house at least five years.Jeffrey G. Otteau, a real estate analyst, said that with interest rates so low, that choice is probably better, as long as the buyer’s source of income remains stable — and there is no danger of going underwater on a mortgage. Mr. Otteau noted, however, that average home values were likely to continue to decline statewide.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','A PENTHOUSE on the top floor of the 56-story Park Millennium building near Lincoln Center is being listed this weekend by Prudential Douglas Elliman for $34.5 million.The owner is Gideon I. Gartner, an information technology mogul, according to public records.Howard Margolis, the listing broker, said that three penthouses had been merged to create one 5,000-square-foot condominium. Public records show that Mr. Gartner paid a total of $7.9 million for two of the properties in 2005, and later added a third.The luxury market was hard hit by the housing crisis, and big price tags are still a big gamble. But Mr. Margolis said he was hoping that the 360-degree views from the West 67th Street apartment, which has five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, would give the condo an edge. “I’ve never seen views like this in 20 years,” he said.Eugene Melnyk, the owner of the Ottawa Senators, a National Hockey League team, is selling his 4,800-square-foot condo in the same building for $16.9 million. Mr. Melnyk, who also founded Biovail, one of Canada’s largest drug makers, had bought three units on the 44th floor, combining them into the four-bedroom, according to someone close to the deal, spending about $3.5 million on the units in 1995. The listing brokers are Dorothy Somekh and Patrycia Harbison of Halstead Property.'"
"'10-09-26,'0','THE Big Apple Meat Market, on the Port Authority bus terminal’s western flank, lures chefs and those who watch their pennies with London broil and filet mignon for a fraction of the prices charged elsewhere — $2.88 and $5.98 a pound, respectively. It is a giant walk-in fridge of a store, where meat hooks and rails hang from the ceiling.One recent afternoon, two women steered shopping carts brought from home, eyeing bargains on seven-pound jars of pork and beans ($5.29), rainbow sprinkle cookies ($3.59) stacked next to sliced bologna (99 cents a pound) and pillow-size bags of sauerkraut ($1.99). Firefighters from Engine 26 on West 37th Street picked out fixings for the night’s chicken parmesan.Listening to the Schumann Trio on headphones attached to a cassette player, Charles E. Gerber, an actor, paused before a wall of blue Goya cans that included canary beans (99 cents) and green pigeon peas ($1.39). “This is the mecca for everyone with a stomach in a square mile who is tired of being ripped off,” he said.Several aisles over, another regular face at the market, Ed Bozzonetti Jr., could be heard complaining about the higher prices at the nearby Food Emporium. In one hand he carried a shopping list, in cursive handwriting, reminding him to bring home Café Bustelo ($4.29) and balsamic vinegar ($2.89); with the other, he pulled his dentures from a pocket and popped them into his mouth.“If it wasn’t for this store, the majority of the people in this neighborhood would be out of luck,"" Mr. Bozzonetti said, drowning out the clang of metal hitting shelves and sticker guns firing.Established in 1992, Big Apple occupies a storefront on Ninth Avenue between 41st and 42nd Streets that used to belong to Washington Beef, which packed and sold meat wholesale for more than 60 years. The store’s manager, Pat Maddalena, 65, stands sentry six days a week — he takes Sundays off, though the store is open 7:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. — in a deli coat, a stoic white-haired presence overseeing orange checkout counters worn from the constant stream of customers.'"

"'10-09-26,'0','On a crisp morning in Sarajevo, the filmmaker Danis Tanovic breezed through the front door of Delikatesna Radnja wearing designer sunglasses and a newsboy cap. There are something like 1,300 cafes in Sarajevo, each embodying a unique ambience and clientele — Zlatna Ribica (“the Goldfish”) has a speakeasy aesthetic and serves a famed Mexican coffee; Kino Bosna is a converted movie theater known for its live music, rakija (a local fruit brandy) and unabashed seediness. The Delikatesna Radnja, with floor-to-ceiling windows that face the Miljacka River and the mountains beyond, caters to the theater and film crowd. Tanovic, who directed “No Man’s Land,” winner of the 2002 Oscar for best foreign language film, is something of a celebrity here. While the waiter prepared macchiatos for us, Tanovic chatted up customers at nearby tables. With his heavy eyelids and tendency to speak out of the side of his mouth, he resembled a younger, stockier Robert DeNiro. He seemed to know everyone in the room.“No Man’s Land,” a troubling and brilliant parody about the absurdity of the war that ripped the former Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s, opened many doors for other Bosnian filmmakers. Four years after “No Man’s Land” appeared, another Sarajevan, Jasmila Zbanic, won the Golden Bear, the highest prize awarded at the Berlin Film Festival, for “Grbavica,” her film about a child conceived through rape during the war. Now the city has emerged as a center of European cinema, with an important summer festival regularly watched by Hollywood. (Morgan Freeman attended this year.) The success of its filmmakers has in turn galvanized a whole cultural movement, with Tanovic acting as pooh-bah, in which artists, actors and musicians are trying to transcend the ethnic divisions that contributed to — and have prevailed since — the war. “The best art always come from oppressive regimes,” he said. “When an artist is living in a country like this, art is the only tool available to you.”Bosnia is not oppressive in the sense of, say, North Korea or Iran. Wandering the cobblestone streets in Bascarsija, the city’s Ottoman quarter, it’s hard to imagine that just 15 years ago Serbian snipers, tanks and artillery units were laying siege. Nowadays, Sarajevo’s restaurants, galleries, hotels and shops make it one of the most compelling capitals in Europe.An afternoon stroll guides you through five centuries of history: the Ottomans, the Austro-Hungarians, the Nazis and the Communists all left marks here. Along the narrow lanes that bunch around the 16th-century mosque of Gazi Husrev-Beg, the Ottoman warrior who once ruled Sarajevo, coppersmiths bang out plates and handled urns. Within a few hundred yards stands a Catholic church, a Serbian Orthodox church and a synagogue. “If you go to Istanbul, you can see Ottoman styles. Go to Vienna, you see Austro-Hungarian. Go to Moscow, you see Orthodox,” Nihad Kresevljakovic, the producer of Sarajevo’s annual experimental theater festival, told me. “Here you can see all of these together in miniature.”Still, there is plenty of recent destruction on display. Facades are punctured with bullet holes, and the National Library, shelled by Serbian artillery in 1992 and left to burn for days, remains shrouded in scaffolding, awaiting renovation. Red paint, called Sarajevo’s “roses,” marks spots around town where Serbian artillery killed civilians standing in bread lines and browsing market stalls. At the Tunnel of Hope, a nearly-900-yard underground passage dug in 1993 by Bosnian Muslims to ferry people out and bring supplies in, there are dozens of photographs of previous visitors, including the American diplomat Richard Holbrooke and the actor Richard Gere. At the bottom of his photograph, Gere wrote: “Hopefully this tunnel will never be used again.”'"

Spike DDB is a joint venture of the filmmaker Spike Lee and DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. And Carol H. Williams Advertising, Emeryville, Calif., and Chicago, will create such campaigns for the Cadillac division, which also had not recently had an agency of record for the African-American market. Williams had previously created ads aimed at black consumers for both Cadillac and Chevrolet.¶Post Foods, part of Ralcorp Holdings, St. Louis, expanded its relationship with the Burns Group, New York, by awarding the agency the lead creative duties for cereal brands like Grape-Nuts, Honey Bunches of Oats and Shredded Wheat. Spending was estimated at more than $90 million. The decision came after Post selected Burns to create campaigns for its Pebbles line of children’s cereal. Campaigns for the other cereals had been created by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, New York, part of WPP, when Post was owned by Kraft Foods; Ralcorp acquired Post in 2008. ¶Sports Authority, Englewood, Colo., named Team Detroit, Dearborn, Mich., part of WPP, as its lead agency. The assignment, with spending estimated at more than $40 million, had been divided between Post Central, Rochester, and Deutsch, New York, part of the Lowe & Partners Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, for media planning and buying.¶Pinnacle Foods, Mountain Lakes, N.Y., shifted the creative duties for its Birds Eye frozen foods division to TBWA/Chiat/Day, New York, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, after only two months of working with Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners, New York, part of MDC Partners.

"'10-09-27,'0','BEIJING — China released a report on human rights on Sunday, highlighting the country’s willingness to deal with the highly contentious issue but also the differences between its perceptions of human rights and those of many other countries.The report acknowledged that China suffers from large inequalities in its practice of human rights, and that “there is still much room for improvement in its human rights conditions.” But it said that the country had made large strides despite difficult economic times.Published on the Internet in Chinese and English, the report lists achievements in a variety of fields, including the growing role of the Internet. It noted that many government agencies now routinely use the Web to gauge public opinion, and highlighted a new law passed this year to outlaw police brutality and torture after exposés in the local press about the abuse of detainees.Outside human rights groups said that these steps were real and that China deserved credit for them, but they pointed to what they said was the country’s history of passing laws that are not enforced. “China deserves credit for taking that step of making new rules where they didn’t exist before,” said Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua Foundation, a human rights group in Hong Kong. “But that can’t stand for actual results. The legislation itself needs to be enforced before you can measure its impact.”Assessing enforcement is difficult because the government outlaws independent human rights monitors.Over all, the report contrasts sharply with outside assessments. This year, the United States State Department found in its annual review of human rights that the situation in China remained “poor and worsened in some areas.”Part of the reason for these widely divergent opinions has to do with China’s definitions of human rights. Much of its report was taken up with a detailed discussion on the economic rights of the Chinese people and how the growing economy was raising living standards and providing better education. Many international human rights organizations consider these rights, while important, to be a separate category. For China, however, they are at least on a par with rights like free speech and the right to assemble and to vote without intimidation.'"
"'10-09-27,'0','The Mongol conqueror Genghis Khan may have been globalization’s most ardent early supporter. But Mongolia has taken its time embracing international capital markets. Now this “mortar economy” (the country is wedged between Russia and China, two of the BRIC countries) may be set for rapid growth.Mongolia is on the verge of opening a new national stock exchange. The market will finally plug the landlocked nation into the grid of global finance, facilitating privatizations, investment and the flow of capital to would-be entrepreneurs among its three million people.And the money almost certainly will flow. Renaissance Capital reckons Mongolia’s economy, while small at around $6 billion, will be the world’s fastest growing over the next five years, increasing to $23 billion by 2013. Handling that growth will be a big challenge.Luckily for Mongolia, it doesn’t, for example, have to reinvent the wheel with its bourse. The London Stock Exchange is the front-runner among four contenders to run the new Ulan Bator exchange. In theory, that will allow the nation to vault overnight from markets not so different from the Naran Tuul bazaar right to electronic trading.That should help the government start its privatization program. It is committed to handing a tenth of all proceeds to its citizenry, almost a third of which is still nomadic. Developing a modern exchange means Mongolians can receive tradeable securities in state companies with market prices. That should avoid the missteps of Eastern European nations that handed out vouchers without obvious value that were quickly accumulated by today’s oligarchs. There are also plenty of case studies that may help Mongolia manage cash inflows and their potential impact on its currency, the tugrug, and its economy.'"
"'10-09-27,'0','¶With Brett Favre again struggling to move the ball through the air, Adrian Peterson rushed for 160 yards and 2 touchdowns to lead the Vikings to a 24-10 victory over the Lions. Peterson bounced off Lions tacklers all day and had an 80-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that put the game out of reach. “There was definitely a sense of urgency,” Peterson said. “Starting 0-2 was not the plan.” After showing feistiness in losses to Chicago and Philadelphia, the Lions (0-3) lost their 22nd straight road game — the third longest streak in league history — and their 13th in a row at the Metrodome.Randy Moss caught two of Tom Brady’s three touchdown passes as the Patriots bounced back from a disappointing loss to the Jets with a 38-30 victory over the visiting Bills, New England’s 14th straight win against Buffalo. C. J. Spiller, Buffalo’s first-round pick this year, scored his first N.F.L. touchdowns, on a 5-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick and a 95-yard kickoff return.¶Joe Flacco threw three touchdown passes to Anquan Boldin, and the Ravens survived an off-day by their esteemed defense in a 24-17 victory over the Browns. Baltimore (2-1) allowed its first touchdowns of the season and failed to force a turnover, but it did not matter because of Flacco, who had come under fire after throwing four interceptions a week ago in a loss at Cincinnati. “Obviously, I’m happier this week than I was last week,” he said.Charlie Batch, making his first start in nearly three years, helped the Steelers remain unbeaten with a 38-13 rout of the Buccaneers. Batch, 35, started only because Ben Roethlisberger was suspended and his replacement, Dennis Dixon, was hurt. “Everybody knows Ben’s the starter,” Batch said. “One thing I didn’t want to do was be that weak link.”¶Dominating in every phase, the Chiefs got three touchdown passes from Matt Cassel and sacked Alex Smith five times in a 31-10 victory over the visiting 49ers. The Chiefs are 3-0 for the first time since 2003. “Each win, we’re getting more and more confident,” linebacker Derrick Johnson said. The 49ers (0-3), who rolled up 417 yards Monday night against New Orleans, managed only a field goal until the final play from scrimmage.Peyton Manning passed for three touchdowns without the injured Anthony Gonzalez and Pierre Garcon and the visiting Colts beat the Broncos, 27-13. Kyle Orton threw for a career-best 476 yards on 37-of-57 passing and the Broncos (1-2) outgained the Colts (2-1) by more than 100 yards. But Denver failed to get into the end zone on five trips inside the 20In Other GamesMichael Vick threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score in the Eagles’ 28-3 win over the Jaguars. Vick completed 17 of 31 passes for 291 yards, mostly staying in the pocket and picking apart host Jacksonville’s beleaguered secondary. One of the few times he did run, he broke a tackle, juked a defender and scored from 17 yards. The Eagles (2-1) improved to 2-0 with Vick as their starter.¶Leon Washington returned two second-half kickoffs for touchdowns of 101 and 99 yards, and the Seahawks held off Philip Rivers and the Chargers, 27-20. Rivers passed for a career-high 455 yards.¶Carson Palmer shook off two interceptions to throw a clinching touchdown pass to Cedric Benson in the fourth quarter of the Bengals’ ugly 20-7 victory over the Panthers, who started the rookie Jimmy Clausen but found he was unable to jump-start their turnover-prone offense. Benson also had a 1-yard touchdown run for the visiting Bengals (2-1), who won last week without scoring a touchdown. “This isn’t the B.C.S.,” cornerback Leon Hall said. “We just need to win.”¶The backup running back Kenneth Darby scored the go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter, helping the Rams overcome an injury to Steven Jackson and end a 14-game home losing streak with a 30-16 victory over the Redskins. The Rams (1-2) won for only the second time in 29 games over all, but lost Jackson to a groin-muscle injury in the first half.¶Sebastian Janikowski missed a 32-yard field goal as the game ended to allow the Cardinals to escape with a 24-23 victory over the Raiders in Arizona’s home opener, a game littered with mistakes on both sides from start to finish. The kick, after a pass interference call against Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, was wide left. Janikowski missed two others, a 41-yarder and a 58-yarder, that were wide right.'"
"'10-09-27,'0','Many of the company’s studio deals require it to delay making titles available — either on DVD or online — until they have been on store shelves for 28 days. For example, “Robin Hood,” starring Russell Crowe, is available to stream on Amazon but will not be available on Netflix until Oct. 19. Hulu Plus has the current season of “The Office,” while the most recent episodes on Netflix are from last season.The industry is still very young, they said, and many companies are experimenting with business models and expanding their video libraries. Streaming requires less infrastructure and therefore has lower barriers to entry than a system built on sorting machines and distribution or even brick-and-mortar stores.“Streaming is a much more competitive environment, and Netflix’s competitors have the money it takes,” said John Blackledge, an analyst with Credit Suisse. Few weeks go by without some strategic maneuver by a company with ambitions in streaming movies or television.YouTube signaled its larger ambitions last week by hiring a former Netflix vice president for content acquisition. YouTube, part of Google, is counting on him to license more Hollywood video to beef up its nascent online rental service, which premiered in January. YouTube has mostly small, independent movies, but it recently secured rights to more mainstream movies from Lions Gate Entertainment.Apple unveiled an upgraded Apple TV device for streaming video to television sets. Fox and ABC agreed to make their shows available for rental at 99 cents each.Hulu, the online video hub jointly owned by NBC Universal, the News Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, in June opened its Hulu Plus subscription service to supplement its existing free video library. Under the plan, which costs $10 a month, consumers can watch some television shows that are not available free. (Paying customers still see commercials, though.)Netflix declined to comment for this article. But a new streaming service it began last week in Canada may be a sign of where the company is headed. Netflix is selling a subscription for online streaming only, with no DVDs. That gives Netflix a chance to conquer a second market without conquering another postal system (or building new distribution centers).In the United States, analysts expect the company to begin closing some of its 58 distribution centers as DVD rentals decline. The company has said it is not making any more major investments in the centers.Mr. Blackledge of Credit Suisse predicts that Netflix’s DVD business will peak in 2012 and then slowly decline. Shifting people to watching movies online will save Netflix some of the $700 million it spends annually on postage.A streaming-only subscription is also being considered for the United States in the coming months, Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive, wrote in a company blog post last week. Presumably, the plan would be cheaper than the company’s standard $9 monthly subscription because it would not include the cost of mailing DVDs.Netflix is making less revenue per customer as streaming catches on because customers are subscribing to less expensive plans, with fewer discs and unlimited streaming. But the company is gaining subscribers at the rate of nearly 50 percent a year.“Netflix has been very clever and good at getting good content,” Mr. Blackledge said. “It’s the virtuous cycle: They get new subscribers, which improves their finances, which allows them to get more and better content.”'"
"'10-09-27,'0','The day after Thanksgiving, 2002, was a slow day in the Pittsburgh office of the F.B.I., so a supervisor sent a special agent to a rally against the threatened war in Iraq to look for any terrorism suspects who might be there, just to “see what they are doing.” The peace rally was sponsored by the Thomas Merton Center, which has opposed violence and armed conflict since the days of Vietnam, and consisted largely of people distributing leaflets. There was not the slightest indication that there were any terrorists there or even the hint of a connection to terrorism. Nonetheless, the agent kept the leafleteers under surveillance and even took pictures.It sounds like the paranoid approach to dissent of J. Edgar Hoover’s F.B.I., but this and other abuses took place during the Bush administration. A report on the subject by the Justice Department’s inspector general is a reminder of how easily civil liberties can be cast aside during suspicious frenzies, such as that unleashed after the 9/11 terror attacks.The report did not find evidence that the F.B.I. routinely targeted groups that were trying to exercise their First Amendment right to protest government policies. It characterized the Merton Center incident as a slip-up. But it also found other incidents in which the F.B.I.’s investigation of various groups was based on a weak case of connection to terrorism or any other crime. And it found that the agency trumped up routine civil disobedience violations, such as trespassing or vandalism, and considered them potential terrorism. Several members of animal-rights or environmental groups were improperly placed on terrorism watch lists, according to the inspector general, Glenn Fine.Mr. Fine’s report also demonstrates that the F.B.I. still engages in familiar bureaucratic cover-ups when its missteps are made public. After the American Civil Liberties Union criticized the Merton Center surveillance, the agency came up with a statement saying that it took pictures at the peace rally because it was looking for a specific individual as part of an investigation. This information was false, but it was relied upon by the F.B.I.’s director, Robert S. Mueller, when he testified before Congress on the matter in 2006. (There is no indication that he knew it was false.)The inspector general made several good recommendations in his report: no investigation of an advocacy group should take place without indications of a specific crime. Nonviolent civil disobedience should not be investigated as an act of terrorism. And the F.B.I. should not retain surveillance information it gathers at public events unless it is related to criminal or terror activity — a prohibition that used to be in force at the agency but was relaxed in 2008. To keep the agency from backsliding into the Hoover days, those recommendations should be followed promptly.'"

"'10-09-28,'1','“You’re asking me to speculate,” Girardi said. “I’m not going to do that. We’ve got to get in first before we can talk about anything.”Burnett’s dreadful start deflated the Yankees, sending them to their fifth loss in six games. That, coupled with Boston’s victory in Chicago, denied their entry into the postseason by at least another day and cost them a chance to vault into first place in the American League East over Tampa Bay, which lost to Baltimore, 4-0.It may also have a short- and long-term impact on their postseason rotation strategy, undermining their plans of holding C. C. Sabathia out of his scheduled start Tuesday.Instead of having his next outing delayed three days (to Friday in Boston) to put him in line to work the Oct. 6 opener on regular rest — as he preferred — Sabathia is now set to climb the Rogers Centre mound. In his left arm, the Yankees trust.In Burnett’s right arm, the Yankees merely hope and pray. In his last 21 starts, dating to June 4, he is 4-13 with a 6.67 earned run average, and opponents are batting .301 against him.“I’ve been through way worse nights than tonight, and I’m going to have way worse nights than tonight,” said Burnett (10-15). “It’s a matter of turning the page and getting over it.”Over two seasons, the Yankees have seen Burnett at his overpowering best and his underperforming worst. In the World Series last year, he looked alternately dominant and disturbing, but Yankees fans, resigned to his inconsistency, chugged some Pepto-Bismol and recognized that no other appealing options existed. Not so now. Although Girardi said last week that he was leaning toward a four-man rotation, that, like everything else involving this team, is subject to change.Using three starters, especially in the shorter division series, is plausible. Andy Pettitte would work Game 2, with Phil Hughes, who pitched well Sunday night against Boston, working Game 3. The Yankees could turn to Sabathia on short rest in a potential Game 4 and, if necessary, Pettitte on normal rest in Game 5.Burnett has pitched well against Minnesota and Texas, their two potential first-round opponents, going 2-0 with a 2.12 E.R.A. in five starts. Unlike Burnett, Hughes could be valuable working out of the bullpen. But the sight of Burnett starting a playoff game ahead of Hughes may cause a fan base to revolt.“We talk about one of the key components to consistent winning is starting pitching,” Girardi said, “and you need to have that if you’re going to win on a consistent basis.”It is hardly surprising, then, that during the Yankees’ skid — 14 losses in 21 games — their starters are 2-10 with a 5.77 E.R.A. After they lost four games in a row last week, Girardi juggled his rotation Sunday in what could be perceived as a desperate move, starting Hughes over Dustin Moseley. Hughes responded, but Burnett could not match him, failing spectacularly.He failed to last more than five innings for the 10th time in 32 starts — two, both this month, were abbreviated because of rain — and wound up pitching longer in each of those rain-abridged starts than he did Monday. With the Yankees trailing, 2-0, Burnett began the third by walking Travis Snider, drilling Yunel Escobar and allowing a three-run homer by Vernon Wells. “It was everything,” Burnett said. “Fastballs down the middle. The hooks I threw weren’t even close.”After three more hits, Girardi called on Jonathan Albaladejo. When Pettitte wobbles, Girardi can point to 16 seasons of reliability and express confidence. In 65 starts with the Yankees, Burnett is not even average. With Monday’s loss, he dropped to 23-24. Burnett, no doubt, is hoping that a victory this weekend in Boston will do much more than even his record in pinstripes.The afternoon after blowing a save for the third time in two weeks — after giving up a run for his third straight outing, after allowing four stolen bases, after revealing his vulnerability — Mariano Rivera had a troubleshooting session Monday with the pitching coach Dave Eiland. Rivera has a 9.53 E.R.A. in his last six appearances.'"

(AP) — The oft-injured Knicks center Eddy Curry will miss at least four weeks with a strained right hamstring, marking the third straight year he was sidelined early in training camp.Curry was hurt during practice Sunday and had a magnetic resonance imaging exam Monday that confirmed the injury. The Knicks said the recovery time would be a minimum of four to six weeks, and that Curry was not expected to travel with the team on its trip to Europe for exhibition games in Italy and Paris.Curry was hospitalized with an illness on the eve of training camp two years ago and tore a calf muscle on the opening day of practices last season.'"
"'10-09-28,'1','In a statement, Mr. Paladino’s campaign manager, Michael Caputo, said: “If Andrew Cuomo thinks the Tea Party movement has no place in New York, Carl knows more than 200,000 registered voters in New York who will disagree with Status Cuomo loudly on November 2.”Mr. Cuomo’s meeting on Monday in Harlem came after complaints from African-American leaders that he had spent too little time reaching out to black voters, raising fears of a low turnout against Mr. Paladino’s energized conservative base. But the meeting may not have mended those divisions entirely: It was skipped by some black officials who had been invited, including a delegation from Brooklyn.Mr. Cuomo also scheduled a campaign stop outside a Harlem subway station, where he arrived early Monday to shake hands with commuters. But he encountered fewer than a half-dozen pedestrians, who were overshadowed by dueling squads of supporters of Mr. Cuomo and Charles Barron, a city councilman from Brooklyn who is running a protest candidacy for governor with the Freedom Party.As Mr. Cuomo’s supporters chanted his name, Mr. Barron’s supporters shouted: “Cuomo-Paladino: Different name, same game.”Mr. Cuomo soon walked to the Dwyer Center, where he met for more than an hour with about a dozen black leaders, nearly all of them based in Harlem. They emerged full of praise for Mr. Cuomo and ready with promises to help him rally voters to his side.“If we didn’t have him, this would be a time for us to create him,” Mr. Rangel said. “Because he and his family and his record has proven what our state and what our country should be all about. He doesn’t come here to solicit minority votes. He comes here to bring our family together with issues that we can perhaps break the indifference that people have.”Mr. Cuomo also criticized Mr. Paladino for forwarding to friends a number of pornographic and racist e-mails, one of them demeaning President Obama. Responding to a reporter, Mr. Cuomo described the offense of sending along the e-mails as “personal to the African-American community.” Mr. Paladino has apologized.“Do I believe they were offensive?” said Mr. Cuomo, who has avoided commenting directly about the e-mails in other appearances. “Yes, I believe they were offensive. I believe they’ve been universally characterized at a minimum as offensive.”Others with Mr. Cuomo offered more pungent criticism. “That guy from upstate, that is living off of the state, and has the nerve to insult our community, the president of the United States — I’m calling it racism,” said Hazel Dukes, president of the New York State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P. “If it’s the last breath in my body, we will not have him as governor of the state of New York.”'"
"'10-09-28,'1','Moreover, buying Massmart should improve margins in Wal-Mart’s international business, which accounts for about a quarter of its revenue. While Wal-Mart International’s operating margins were about 3.8 percent in the first half of this year, Massmart’s stood at closer to 5 percent. Apply Wal-Mart’s huge purchasing power, and profitability could increase further.This entry ticket to a Civets lair doesn’t come cheap. But with growth elusive at home, it should be a price Wal-Mart shareholders are happy to pay.There’s no quick way for the federal government to exit American International Group. Converting $49 billion of preferred stock to common shares and selling them would, like the exit from Citigroup, take time. And that’s assuming other share sales, needed for separate repayments relating to A.I.G., go smoothly.As of June 30, A.I.G. owed the government just over $100 billion. A.I.G. has also made progress offloading assets. Big examples include the initial public offering of A.I.A., the Asian unit currently expected to begin trading on the Hong Kong market in the next month or so, and the pending $15.5 billion sale to MetLife of American Life Insurance, or Alico. The New York Fed converted debt in those entities into preferred shares worth $16 billion and $9 billion respectively, and the deals will help pay that off.Back at A.I.G. itself, there are about $49 billion of preferred shares owned by the Treasury. The Citi example shows how those securities might be swapped into common equity and then sold, over time. In the Citi case, the government is turning a profit on its shares, potentially making the idea interesting for A.I.G. as well.But it seems that selling the government’s Citi stake — initially nearly 30 percent — will take longer than anticipated. Offloading the A.I.G. stake could take far longer, because the government already effectively owns 80 percent of the company. Converting the preferreds could take that nearer to 90 percent.That’s not all. An AIA I.P.O. probably won’t raise enough to repay the New York Fed’s preferred interest right away, let alone give A.I.G. proceeds to apply to its own obligations. Meanwhile the Alico sale will come with only $6.8 billion of cash. So the government will depend on further sales of AIA and MetLife equity interests to get repaid.Furthermore, ahead of all that is another $20 billion or so, including interest, that A.I.G. still owes the New York Fed under a credit facility. The insurer might at some point be able to refinance that. But put the pieces together, and taxpayers could wait a long time before enough shares in enough different companies are sold for them to be made whole.'"
"'10-09-28,'1','BOGOTÁ, Colombia (AP) — Colombia’s inspector general on Monday ousted an outspoken opposition senator, barring her from public service for 18 years and accusing her of “promoting and collaborating” with Latin America’s last remaining rebel army.The senator, Piedad Córdoba, gained international attention by brokering the release of more than a dozen hostages who had been held by the rebels, known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.Known for her trademark turban, Ms. Córdoba has been a polarizing force in domestic politics and is a close ally of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela. Ms. Córdoba, 55, has not been charged with any crime.The inspector general, Alejandro Ordóñez, has the constitutional power to dismiss any member of Congress. In fact, the inspector general has jurisdiction over nearly all public servants in Colombia except for the president and senior judges.Ms. Córdoba has been in the Senate since 1994 and was mentioned last year as a possible candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize.

"'10-09-28,'1','Nestlé said on Monday that it planned to invest more than $500 million over the next decade to develop health and wellness products to help prevent and treat major ailments like diabetes and obesity.Nestlé will create a wholly owned subsidiary, Nestlé Health Science, as well as a research body, the Nestlé Institute of Health Sciences, “to pioneer a new industry between food and pharma,” the company said in a statement.The company, which is based in Vevey, Switzerland, said the initiatives would seek to develop nutritional products for diseases like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s, which are placing an increasing burden on governments at a time when budgets are being squeezed.“It is our strong conviction that disease prevention will have to play a much bigger role” in future health spending, Nestlé’s chairman, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, told a news conference in Lausanne.According to the World Health Organization, more than 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes and about 18 million people have Alzheimer’s.

"'10-09-28,'1','Re: “A Perk of Our Evolution: Pleasure in Pain of Chilies” (Sept. 21): My colleague Dan Janzen suggested that hot peppers and the evolution of capsaicin involved the competing demands of deterring seed predators (i.e. rodents) and encouraging seed dispersers (birds). When rodents consume fruit such as peppers, they are often attacking the fruit for its seeds. Birds, on the other hand, are after the pulp of the fruit and disperse seeds undamaged. Janzen suggested that the bright red of a hot pepper serves as warning coloration for mammals (don’t eat me) and advertisement for birds (eat me, please).I don’t think Dan ever published the idea, but it did appear in a research report in Nature (Tewksbury, J. J. and G. P. Nabhan. 2001. Directed deterrence by capsaicin in chillies. Nature 412:403-404.)The writer is a professor of biology at the University of Pennsylvania.How could you discuss chili peppers and capsaicin without mentioning endorphins? Capsaicin is a powerful endorphin release agent. In high dosages, it rivals opiates (which is undoubtedly why it works to suppress other pain). We return to the pain of hot chili peppers not because we are masochists, but because, in spite of the pain, we are seeking pleasure.'"
"'10-09-28,'1','“If there is any risk to that data, those companies will look elsewhere,” said Peter Sutherland, a former Canadian ambassador to India who is now a consultant to North American companies doing business there.S. Ramadorai, vice chairman of India’s largest outsourcing company, Tata Consultancy Services, echoed that sentiment in a newspaper column on Wednesday. “Bans and calls for bans aren’t a solution,” he wrote. “They’ll disconnect India from the rest of the world.”Few doubt that India has valid security concerns. In recent years, attacks against India have included the use of sophisticated communications technology — as when the terrorists who stormed Mumbai two years ago communicated with their Pakistani handlers by satellite phone and the Internet. Or when Chinese hackers infiltrated India’s military computer networks this year.But critics say that India’s security efforts, which they describe as clumsy, may do little to protect the country, even as they intrude on the privacy of companies and citizens alike.“They will do damage by blocking highly visible systems like BlackBerry or Skype,” said Ajay Shah, a Mumbai-based economist who writes extensively about technology. “This will shift users to less visible and known platforms. Terrorists will make merry doing crypto anyway. A zillion tools for this are freely available.”Senior Indian officials, though, argue that they have no choice but to demand the data that could help thwart and investigate terrorist attacks.“All communications which is done by Indians or coming to and fro into India — and where we have a concern about national security — we should have access to it,” said Gopal Krishna Pillai, the secretary of India’s Home Ministry, which oversees domestic security.During the Mumbai attacks, he said, officials could not gain access to some of the communications between the terrorists and their handlers.Some legal experts indicate that Indian law — which has few explicit protections for personal privacy — is on the government’s side. But they also say India is trying to enforce the law in unnerving ways.“The concern of corporate users and general users of BlackBerry is that if this is allowed, the government will become the single biggest repository of information,” said Pavan Duggal, a technology lawyer who practices before India’s Supreme Court. “And we have no idea how this information will be used and misused in the future.”The Indian government has also clamped down on the importation of foreign telecommunications equipment, saying it wants to ensure that the technology does not contain malicious software or secret trap doors that could be used by foreign spies.The technology and security debates playing out here are not new or unique to India.During the 1990s, for instance, American security officials tried unsuccessfully to restrict the use of encryption because of worries that law enforcement would not be able to monitor communications. Now, in legislation the Obama administration plans to introduce next year, officials want Congress to require all services that enable communications — including encrypted e-mail systems like BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook and software that allows direct “peer to peer” messaging like Skype — to be technically able to comply if served with a wiretap order.Currently, other countries including the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia are trying to impose various measures similar to India’s.The debate here, though, is complicated by the fact that despite private industry’s technology prowess in this country, in technologies like cryptography Indian law enforcement agencies still lag significantly behind their counterparts in the United States and other advanced countries.The Indian government says it is intent on improving its code-cracking skills. But “in the interim, it has this very blunt instrument,” said Rajan S. Mathews, the director general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, a trade group. “It comes to the operators and says: ‘I’m going to make you responsible for giving me access,’ ” he said.Mr. Pillai, the Home Ministry secretary, said the government was not opposed to the use of encryption to protect the privacy of legitimate electronic communications. But he said that as government-licensed entities, network operators were obliged to give law enforcement officials a way to decode messages when required or to block communications that they cannot decipher.But network providers say they may not always have the technical ability to do that. In much of the world — including for business users in India — companies and individuals now often use encryption systems that generate new code keys for each message and lack a convenient master key that could unlock everything for government viewing.Google, for its part, has enhanced the encryption for its Gmail service, making it harder for hackers and the Indian government to read messages. Mr. Pillai said his ministry had begun conversations with Google and Skype, the Internet phone company, which also uses strong encryption, to provide access to decoded data.Representatives for Google and Skype said that they could not comment because they had not yet received formal demands from the Indian government.Meanwhile, government officials have demanded that the maker of BlackBerry, Research In Motion of Canada, set up a server computer in India from which law enforcement agencies can gain access to unencrypted versions of messages when they need to. The government has given R.I.M. until the end of October to comply.The company has said that it is willing to meet “the lawful access needs of law enforcement agencies.” But the company says it cannot provide unencrypted copies of messages of corporate users because of how the BlackBerry system is designed, noting that even R.I.M. cannot decode them.“Strong encryption has become a mandatory requirement for all enterprise-class wireless e-mail services today,” R.I.M. said in a statement in late August, “and is also a fundamental commercial requirement for any country to attract and maintain international business.”'"
"'10-09-28,'1','The Red Sox, a very good and valiant team, were trying to stay alive in the same division with the nearly perpetual Yankees and the upstart Rays. The Red Sox were one game from elimination after Juan Miranda of the Yankees walked with the bases loaded.The Yankees and the Rays each lost Monday night, so the Rays maintained a half-game lead as they battle for the meaningful difference between first place and the wild-card spot. The Red Sox remained alive after beating the White Sox in Chicago. We may not soon see the Yankees and the Red Sox play a game that is not significant at this time of year — unless Buck Showalter can produce a miracle in Baltimore or Toronto can return to the early ’90s. Either of which would be fine. The World Series has had a number of fresh faces in the past decade — the Diamondbacks, the Angels, the Red Sox, the White Sox, the Tigers, the Cardinals, the Phillies. I could swear the Colorado Rockies were in a World Series.As much as I welcome diversity, there is still something compelling about the Yankees and the Red Sox not wanting to lose any game, ever.A fan could look into the Red Sox dugout and guess that grizzled Mike Lowell, who is about to retire, could be part of the game before it was over. (He wound up at first base, reaching into the runner for the hurried throw from Martinez.) And there was no doubt that somewhere in the night, the sound of “Enter Sandman” by Metallica would stir the crowd as good old Mariano Rivera jogged to the mound — in this case to blow a save for the shocking third time in six games.The thrill of the game was watching these two rivals throw everything they had — the Yankees pushing up Phil Hughes, who was supposed to be rested a few more days, both sides using anonymous September call-ups.The gravity of this game was that the Red Sox were almost eliminated despite having an 86-68 record going into the night. And the Yankees did not want to settle for the wild-card spot because they would forfeit the home-field advantage for the first and second rounds.Watching really good teams scramble is a late September joy in baseball. Football sends 12 of 32 teams into the postseason, hockey sends 16 of 30 teams to the Stanley Cup playoffs, basketball sends 16 of 30 teams to the postseason, and Major League Soccer sends 8 of 16 teams to the playoffs. Recently, baseball’s commissioner, Bud Selig, has been musing about expanding the postseason.“We certainly haven’t abused anything,” Selig said last Friday when he materialized for the Cubs-Cardinals in Chicago. Whatever else is said about Selig, he is a fan, whose mom used to take him to Wrigley Field or Ebbets Field in Brooklyn.“As the guy who brought the wild card and took a lot of abuse — maybe from nobody in this room — it’s worked out great, nobody’s against it,” Selig said last Friday.Some of us — no names mentioned — clucked when baseball added the wild card in 1995, but the Yankees and the Mariners scrambled into the postseason in the final hours, and then staged one of the greatest series I’ve ever seen, culminating in Junior Griffey’s smile emerging from the victorious pile at home plate.The home-field advantage at the monstrous dome the Mariners used back then was vital, as the Yankees won two at home and lost three straight on the road. The series format has been wisely adjusted to 2-2-1, but home field still means a lot.The Yankees want to win the division and open at home against Texas; if they are the wild-card team, they will have to open up in Minnesota’s new ballpark. The Yanks will probably still be competing for that very real home-field advantage next weekend when they close out the season, oh, did I mention this, at Fenway Park.The Yankees are 601-409-7 in New York in this long rivalry, but only 511-505-7 in Boston. The prospect is good for more games with a classic feel.'"
"'10-09-28,'1','Reopening the schools was considered critical, and the state government announced that teachers with work cards and students in school uniforms would be allowed to pass through the myriad security checkpoints in the region’s summer capital of Srinagar. Bus schedules also were announced.But on Monday there was an uneven response, with government officials estimating that 30 percent to 80 percent of students showed up for class throughout the Kashmir Valley.Several students interviewed by telephone said they failed to attend because security officers refused to lift the curfew. At the University of Kashmir in Srinagar, Muhammad Ibrahim, 22, arrived at 10 a.m. for his first day back in 14 weeks. Yet he was the only student in his class of 38 who navigated the checkpoints and made it to school.Showkat Shafi, spokesman for the university, said most classes on the main campus were closed Monday, while the curfew impeded other students from reaching satellite locations throughout the valley. He said students at the off-campus locations were supposed to begin taking examinations on Monday.“Students are complaining that they are trying to reach examination centers across the valley, but very few have made it,” he said.Many students also stayed away as a means of protest over their demands that India make good on promises to allow a referendum on self-rule in Kashmir. Some may have been following the separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who belittled the new government package and announced that families should not send their children back to school. Yet it is unclear how much control leaders like Mr. Geelani have over a protest movement fueled largely by college students.“The government insists that we go to classes because they want to show the international community that things are normal here in Kashmir,” said Saliq Abbas, a postgraduate student at the University of Kashmir, who refused to return to classes. “But things are not normal.”The impact of the new political package is likely to become clear only after several more weeks. Last Monday, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram led a parliamentary delegation on a two-day visit to the region and then announced the new policies from New Delhi late on Saturday afternoon.On Monday, Mr. Chidambaram framed the efforts to reopen the schools in a positive light, noting that most had opened, while also criticizing a few minor reported episodes of stone throwing at school buses that resulted in no injuries.“How can any right-thinking person pelt stones on school buses?” he asked in a statement.Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, called on all political groups — including separatists like Mr. Geelani — to support the resumption of education. “Let us keep education neutral to all conflicts,” he said in a statement.One of the most pressing questions is when, and to what degree, the authorities will ease the security lockdown that many residents in Srinagar describe as “collective punishment.”Mr. Chidambaram’s package included a directive for state leaders to reassess the security presence and consider scaling back — a step previously promoted by Mr. Abdullah. Many Kashmiris want India to repeal emergency laws that have given broad powers of arrest and immunity to soldiers, paramilitary officers and police officers in many parts of the region.Kuldeep Khoda, director of the state police, said decisions on security would be made after a meeting of the Unified Command, consisting of civilian leaders and leaders of security and military agencies.He said the police had maintained a curfew in Srinagar on Monday as a protective measure against the threat of violence against schools or buses presented by Mr. Geelani’s call for a strike. The police did relax the curfew on Sunday to allow residents to rush out to buy food and other provisions.The recent political attention on Kashmir has coincided with an almost complete absence of violence during the past week. Taj Mohi-ud-Din, a senior minister in the state government, predicted that more students would attend classes in the coming days, as the situation stabilized and parents became more comfortable with sending out their children. He also said that security would be eased in the future, as long as violence did not return.“It has to be gradual,” he said. “We have to be certain the withdrawal will not affect the security position.”'"

"'10-09-29,'0','Maura Downes, Mr. Blumenthal’s campaign spokeswoman, confirmed that wrestling will continue to be a focus of his media strategy. “It is especially important to us what happens outside the ring,” she said. “We’re going to be making an issue of how she treated her workers.”The campaign and the state Democratic Party have begun highlighting news reports about concussions and premature deaths among W.W.E. wrestlers, steroid use, and the company’s reliance on hundreds of independent contractors who do not receive health care benefits.Asked about the contractors at a recent news conference in New Haven, Ms. McMahon said that W.W.E. workers preferred that arrangement because it gave them more freedom. The campaign said that under Ms. McMahon’s leadership, the W.W.E. raised the industry’s health and safety standards.A McMahon campaign spokesman, Ed Patru, said on Tuesday that the campaign is ready for the criticism. “We’ll absolutely be prepared to respond and set the record straight to the negative attacks,” Mr. Patru said.“Every day that our opponents are talking about wrestling and we’re talking about jobs, we’re moving up in the polls,” he added. “In every town and neighborhood in Connecticut, jobs are the No. 1 issue on people’s minds.”The Quinnipiac University Poll director, Douglas Schwartz, said some voters have responded to the wrestling-related attacks on Ms. McMahon, but most have not. In a Quinnipiac poll released on Sept. 14, 33 percent of likely voters said that Ms. McMahon’s wrestling industry background would make them less likely to vote for her, 20 percent said it would make them more likely to support her and 47 percent said it would have no effect. Mr. Schwartz said those numbers are similar among the independent voters whose support is considered crucial in the election.The poll also found that few Connecticut voters are waiting to make up their minds. All but 1 percent of Democrats and about 4 percent of unaffiliated voters remain undecided, it found.Mr. Blumenthal is leading among women, the poll found, and Ms. McMahon among men. And right now, Mr. Schwartz noted, “men seem to be more energized than women” to vote.On the campaign trail, men often stop Ms. McMahon and ask to be photographed with her. It happened during a recent swing through the Naugatuck Valley, a stronghold of so-called Reagan Democrats, and again last week when Ms. McMahon toured New Haven’s Fair Haven neighborhood, which is heavily Latino and solidly Democratic.Aaron Vignola, a 21-year-old hair stylist, asked her about a W.W.E. video clip that one of Ms. McMahon’s Republican opponents had highlighted in a television advertisement during the primary campaign. In what seemed like admiration, he asked Ms. McMahon if she had really kicked a wrestler between his legs.“You know, W.W.E. is scripted entertainment,” Ms. McMahon replied with a laugh.Mr. Vignola said he has always voted Democratic, but he planned to vote for Ms. McMahon this year. He said that he was a fan of the W.W.E. So are many Latino and working-class voters: the W.W.E. television program “Raw” is the fifth most-watched prime-time show on cable among Hispanic viewers, according to the company’s Web site.The company’s audience in general mirrors the angry working-class men who have replaced soccer moms as this election’s most talked-about target group. W.W.E. reports that 65 percent of its audience is male and that 74 percent of the visitors to its Web site have an average household income of $75,000 or less.Could wrestling, for all its controversy, actually help Ms. McMahon?Her backers appear not to think so: A few days after an extended clip of her crotch-kicking act appeared online in a New Haven Independent article, the W.W.E. had it removed from YouTube.At least one Blumenthal supporter questions, though, whether the campaign’s focus on wrestling will have an impact.“Under normal circumstances, her background and the way she has been portrayed would hurt her,” said the supporter, Thomas D’Amore, a former Republican state chairman who went on to serve as Gov. Lowell P. Weicker’s chief of staff. “But that’s yesterday. I don’t know about today.“I’m afraid people have gotten very, very cynical. They happen to think this is all entertainment in any case — by that I mean politics. For the most part independent voters are fed up in general with the state of politics.”Otherwise, he said, “they wouldn’t be independents and up for grabs at this stage.”Yesterday’s Pariah Mr. Blumenthal did get a reprieve from bad news on Sunday, when former President Bill Clinton headlined a rousing campaign rally for the faithful at New Haven’s Wilbur Cross High School.The event was a vivid rendition of this campaign season’s Tale of Two Presidents: a former president scorned by his vice president in the 2000 presidential race campaign trail is now the hottest Democratic campaign; and a sitting president embraced by Democrats in 2008 is shunned two years later. Mr. Blumenthal stood grinning beside Mr. Clinton on stage for more than a half hour on Sunday. His campaign invited over 1,000 people to the event. Mr. Blumenthal hailed Mr. Clinton’s “historic courage and leadership of this nation and this world.” By contrast, Mr. Blumenthal scheduled no public appearances with President Obama when he headlined a Sept. 16 campaign fund-raiser; Mr. Blumenthal even held a news conference before the event in which he criticized Mr. Obama’s handling of bank bailouts, economic stimulus and even parts of the health care overhaul.Dueling Polls Mr. Blumenthal’s campaign sought to mitigate the latest Quinnipiac poll results on Tuesday morning by releasing the results of its own internal poll, by the Democratic firm of Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, showing Mr. Blumenthal 12 points ahead. Quinnipiac did call the Democratic gubernatorial primary wrong in August; in that instance, it is believed that many voters moved to support the winner, Dannel P. Malloy, at the last moment.'"

"'10-09-29,'0','This year, it is out with the superstore and in with the pop-up.Borders, making a push to sell e-readers and books during the holiday season, plans to open 25 so-called pop-up stores in cities like Minnetonka, Minn.; Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; and Scottsdale, Ariz., beginning in early October.Most of the pop-ups will be in malls where Borders once had stores. The company has closed more than 200 stores in the last year, most of which were its smaller Waldenbooks outlets in malls.“Where it didn’t make business sense for us to operate stores on a permanent basis in these areas, we can open a seasonal store and serve the holiday shopping needs of our customers,” Mike Edwards, the chief executive of Borders, said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to once again be part of these communities.”The concept of the pop-up store has been embraced by landlords who are looking for short-term tenants and by retailers like Target who need a flexible, attention-grabbing way to showcase their wares.For Borders, it is a way to capture a larger piece of coveted holiday sales in the biggest season for the publishing industry. Borders has lagged Amazon and Barnes & Noble in the e-reader race — in July, it began selling its device, the Kobo, in its stores, long after its competitors introduced their own e-readers.Last year, Borders opened pop-up stores in five locations, including Short Hills, N.J., and Schaumburg, Ill., and considered the experiment successful enough to merit an expansion this year.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','That’s fine with us, actually, so long as the study is based on the science and draws on technical insights of experts, not the political wishes of activists.Hydraulic fracturing has been used safely in New York State for 50 years. The Marcellus Shale won’t change that. But it might just change New York’s economic future for the better.The writer is executive director of Energy in Depth, a coalition of independent gas producers.You are to be commended for urging caution when it comes to natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale. But thus far most of the debate over shale gas extraction has been focused on the contamination of drinking water wells and underground aquifers.There are larger questions. Natural gas may burn cleaner than coal and oil, but when you factor in the greenhouse gas emissions produced during the extraction process it may be no better.In addition, we may not have as much domestic natural gas as the industry claims we do. Taken together — natural gas may not be as abundant or as clean as we are being led to believe — the transition fuel to the future doesn’t look quite so shiny.Perhaps we should be investing in renewable energy rather than a bridge fuel to nowhere.I just served on a National Research Council panel that looked at the environmental effects of extensive coal bed methane development in the United States. I can say the environmental risk to water from hydrofracking, by any scientific standard, will be negligible.New York State has some of the most stringent drilling regulations in the nation, and other states are following suit. I fully expect that the new Environmental Protection Agency study of hydrofracking will come to the same conclusions as its 2004 report, which was neither “skewed” nor “superficial.”I find it odd that people in New York City do not worry about the widespread salinization of both Croton and Catskills waters by road salt and water softeners, nor the widespread addition of nutrients and microtoxins from farms and home septic systems. Yet the potential for a minor release of hydrofrack fluids from the demonstrably rare accident does seem to lead to excessive worry.The writer is a professor of earth sciences at Syracuse University.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','The A.P. and The Los Angeles Times also wrote that federal agents were investigating more than $100,000 paid to Alejandro Stephens, the former president of an S.E.I.U. local in Los Angeles, who lost that job when his local was merged into another local. Mr. Stern signed an agreement to pay Mr. Stephens severance as well as $75,000 a year for three years to serve as a consultant to the S.E.I.U. California State Council.Federal agents are said to be investigating whether Mr. Stephens received $150,000 in payments over two years without doing any consulting work. Federal law bars unions from paying for no-show jobs.Mr. Stephens has asserted that he did the promised consulting work, but the S.E.I.U. has asked an arbitrator to rule that Mr. Stephens should reimburse it, arguing that he did not do the agreed-upon work.A federal judge sentenced Mr. Stephens on Sept. 2 to four months in prison and another three months of home confinement on charges of embezzling $52,000 from a voter outreach program.Michelle Ringuette, the S.E.I.U.’s communications director, said the union cooperated with a federal investigation of Mr. Stephens more than a year ago and had heard nothing about that investigation since.“We believe Stephens violated the terms of his separation agreement with our union,” she said, adding, “We have aggressively been seeking” repayment.Ms. Ringuette said, “We’ve seen not the slightest indication” of “a federal inquiry into the publication” of Mr. Stern’s book. She said the union’s general counsel and executive board had carefully approved “every aspect of the transaction related to the book.” She said that the Simon & Schuster contract did not require the S.E.I.U. or any of its locals to purchase books and that they did so on their own volition. She said Mr. Stern received no royalties from book sales to the union.“We have to wonder why these anonymous allegations are being raised at this time,” she said.Laura Eimiller, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.’s office in Los Angeles, said, “We neither conform nor deny any investigation.” Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the United States attorney in Los Angeles, declined comment, as did the Labor Department.Adam Rothberg, a spokesman for Simon & Schuster, said, “We haven’t been contacted by any government agency in this matter.” He added, “From our perspective there was absolutely nothing unusual about our publishing agreement with Andy Stern.”'"
"'10-09-29,'0','The results confirmed suggestions by sociologists that the sluggish economy had a broader impact on the way people lived. The proportion of women in the city who had never married crossed the 40 percent threshold in 2009 (men hit 46 percent), the number of women 20 to 34 who gave birth during the preceding year declined, and more people were living with roommates or unmarried partners.While the poverty rate remained largely unchanged in the city, it rose in New York State to 14.2 percent in 2009 from 13.8 percent in 2008 (according to a different census survey released this month, it climbed in the state to 15.8 percent from 14.2 percent) and in New Jersey to 9.4 percent from 8.8 percent (although New Jersey was among only five states in which the rate was below 10 percent).In the city, the poverty rate ranged from a low of 6 percent among non-Hispanic whites on Staten Island to a high of 36 percent among Hispanics in the Bronx. It was 18.7 percent over all in 2009.“We strengthened our safety net and made unprecedented efforts to expand job training and support the entrepreneurs in our city who have created 1 in 10 of every new job in America so far this year,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.Earlier this year, the city said its own more sophisticated measure of poverty classified 22 percent of New Yorkers as poor in 2008, when the Census Bureau put the official figure at 17.6 percent. Officials would not speculate on what the 2009 rate would be by the more complex measure that takes account of costs like commuting and day care and benefits like tax credits.“The official measure does not include much of what has been done to cushion the blow of the recession on low-income families,” said Mark K. Levitan, poverty research director for the city’s Center for Economic Opportunity. “The new and expanded tax credits and the large increase in food stamp participation don’t get counted in the official measure; they will get counted in ours.”Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said the rising raw numbers and percentages of city residents living below the federal poverty line ($17,600 for a family of three) and the shrinking income of many New Yorkers were “the latest proof that low-income, hungry and even middle-class New Yorkers are suffering mightily in this recession, even as the ultrarich become even wealthier.”Jilly Stephens, executive director of City Harvest, cautioned that “all indicators show that demand for emergency food isn’t static. It’s going up.”The proportion of residents receiving food stamps in 2009 rose to 17.2 percent from 14.9 percent in 2008 and 13.3 percent in 2007.The share with no health insurance declined to 4.5 percent from 5.2 percent, the result of government programs’ picking up the slack.Home values have plunged by double digits since 2006 in the suburbs, but they have dropped less in the city, to an average of $517,900 in 2009 from $537,600 in 2008. In the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan, they barely changed.Median household income was lower in 2009 than it was in 2007, dipping in the Bronx to $32,893 from $35,341 and on Staten Island to $66,292 from $69,309. But the median income was unchanged in Brooklyn at $43,166, in Manhattan at $68,706 and in Queens at $55,120. The citywide median was $50,033.The American Community Survey is a separate measurement from the 2010 census, which will be released next year.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','“The Invested Life” episodes will be accompanied by blog posts, video clips and online materials to help the audience with their own personal financial needs. The Web series will also have a presence in social media like Facebook and Twitter.TD Ameritrade will spend an estimated $5 million to $10 million on the campaign, which is being developed by two agencies and the MSN unit of the Microsoft Corporation.The list of marketers sponsoring Web series includes many who spend heavily on television advertising, like American Express, Fortune Brands, Kraft Foods, Newell Rubbermaid, Samsung and Unilever. So, too, does TD Ameritrade, which runs commercials featuring the actor Sam Waterston.“We do plenty of advertising on TV, and our executives appear on CNBC to talk about the market,” said Peter Sidebottom, executive vice president for product and marketing at TD Ameritrade, who is based in the company’s Jersey City office.“This is an additional way for people to engage,” he added, “and puts it in a context that makes it more accessible to more people.”“With our history as a leading online brokerage, doing something online seemed like a natural choice,” Mr. Sidebottom said. And “getting Americans to engage in their financial life in a new and creative way is important at this time,” he added.Generate, a production and talent management agency in Santa Monica, Calif., collaborated on “The Invested Life” with MSN and Ogilvy Entertainment in New York.“We have done a lot of webisodes, but this is the first unscripted Web series we’ve worked on,” said Doug Scott, president of Ogilvy Entertainment, a sibling of the TD Ameritrade creative agency, the Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide division of WPP.Mr. Scott likened “The Invested Life” to “ ‘The Real World’ in Suze Orman’s house,” invoking the MTV reality series and the financial adviser.“Or if you want to elevator pitch it,” Mr. Scott said, “it’s ‘Extreme Makeover: Finance Edition.’ ”The Web is a better home for “The Invested Life,” he added, because of the markets’ changing dynamics; the longer lead times required for television production could render the recommendations from the advisers as outdated or irrelevant.According to Mr. Sidebottom, the cast members of the Web series were not required to be TD Ameritrade clients. He described them as “a broad swath of Americans — singles, couples, early in careers, retired, early in their investing lives, sophisticated enough to be trading every day in the market.”One is Jennifer Sherwood, 42, who moved to Wellesley, Mass., from New York after the death of her husband, Scott, a jazz guitarist, in 2009. She is called “the rookie” among the participants.“I didn’t feel I would know how to pick a financial adviser,” Ms. Sherwood said, so she replied to an ad she found online that was recruiting participants for the Web series. She was matched with Boyce Watkins, a professor and author, whom she described as “great.”Taking part in the series was “cathartic,” said Ms. Sherwood, who has completed filming her webisodes and said it taught her not to be “overwhelmed working on anything financial.”Matt Sapaula, 36, a professed financial coach in Chicago, was paired with Tom Forde, a young opera singer whose nickname for “The Invested Life” is “the adventurer” because of his penchant for being adventurous with his investments.“I felt very comfortable with the show and what it wanted to communicate,” Mr. Sapaula said, adding: “Everything you’ll see on camera is authentic and genuine. The only thing pre-positioned was where we were going to shoot.”The awareness of what TD Ameritrade is and what it does varied among the cast members. Mr. Sapaula said he is “a huge fan of Morningstar,” the investment adviser, and praised the Morningstar tools on tdameritrade.com.Ms. Sherwood said she was unaware during production of “The Invested Life” that TD Ameritrade was the sponsor. She underscored her unfamiliarity with the company by remarking that she had “worked with Amex 15 years ago.”When a reporter interjected that TD Ameritrade is unrelated to American Express, Ms. Sherwood replied, “They need better branding.”'"
"'10-09-29,'0','Two men held in Norway have admitted planning bomb attacks, one of them against a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005, the Norwegian authorities said Tuesday. The other planned attack was against the Chinese Embassy in Oslo, security police said. Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak, a 37-year-old Iraqi Kurd with Norwegian residency, had confessed to plotting to attack Jyllands-Posten, one of Denmark’s largest newspapers, before his arrest in July. Mikael Davud, 39, a member of China’s Uighur minority with Norwegian citizenship, admitted Tuesday that he planned to blow up the Chinese Embassy in Oslo, his lawyer told the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Police Security Service said the charge against the two, conspiring to commit terror in Norway, could be amended to reflect Mr. Bujak’s Danish target.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','The Police Department and the Housing Authority had observers present at the hearing, which lasted several hours as housing residents, lawyers and advocates, one after the other, blasted both agencies. One housing tenant from Manhattan, Marquis Jenkins, 27, said getting stopped had become a sort of “rite of passage” for young men of color growing up in the developments.The policy, which the department has increasingly turned to in recent years as a core part of its crime deterrent strategy, allows officers to temporarily detain anyone they believe may be engaging in criminal activity, and to conduct a search if the person is believed to be carrying a weapon. Police officials also declined to appear at a similar council hearing in April 2009, Council officials said.In a sharply worded letter to Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly on Tuesday, Ms. Quinn criticized him for “yet again” failing to testify about stop and frisk.“Your failure to appear and answer these questions only reinforces some of the worst suspicions critics of the department hold,” wrote Ms. Quinn, who has generally supported the department’s stop-and-frisk policy.Ms. Quinn said the hearing was to include stop-and-frisk and other initiatives. But once it became clear police and housing officials would not discuss stop and frisks, she decided to split it into two hearings to give the other broader initiatives a fair discussion.A federal class-action lawsuit filed against the police and the Housing Authority in January claims that public housing tenants and their visitors are subjected to police aggression and unwarranted trespass arrests. The lawsuit was filed by the Legal Aid Society, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.A separate lawsuit filed in 2008 by the Center for Constitutional Rights accuses the department of engaging in racial profiling and baseless stop and frisks.Councilman Jumaane D. Williams of Brooklyn described the Police Department’s failure to appear as disrespectful. “Lawsuit or not, we’ve had other testimony when litigation is pending,” he said.Mr. Browne called the criticisms “disingenuous in the extreme and a sop to plaintiffs’ lawyers,” because the Council knew the department was prepared to testify about other initiatives until the hearing’s scope was narrowed. The department did send a letter to the Council on Monday outlining public safety initiatives it has undertaken in public housing, including changes to the Patrol Guide regarding how officers patrol public housing buildings and when to conduct stop and frisks inside them.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','But it seems that is beginning to change. At the World Equestrian Games here this week, a few prominent riders have been wearing helmets in the practice arenas.Steffen Peters, an American dressage rider and the 2009 World Cup champion, could normally be recognized in the practice area at major competitions by his baseball cap. Since King Dye’s accident, he has traded his cap for a helmet.Peters said that going to the hospital to see King Dye, a teammate of his at the 2008 Olympics, was one of the most difficult things he had experienced.“When I walked outside, I had to sit down,” he said. “I was crying like a little kid, I felt so helpless.”His World Equestrian Games teammate Katherine Bateson-Chandler also wears a helmet in practice, as do all the members of the Canadian dressage team.Dr. Craig Ferrell, who has been the United States equestrian team’s doctor since 1996, said wearing a helmet made sense.“If you’re on a horse long enough, usually you’re going to come off and I think there’s a chance of hitting your head when that happens,” he said. “You’re a lot safer wearing a helmet.”A 2007 study by the Centers for Disease Control found that horseback riding resulted in 11.7 percent of all traumatic brain injuries in recreational sports from 2001 to 2005, the highest of any athletic activity. Last year, there were 14,466 emergency room visits for brain injuries among riders, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons.At the World Equestrian Games, the vast majority of dressage riders were not wearing helmets in the practice arena. Many of those riders come from Europe, which has dominated dressage for years and where top dressage riders typically do not wear helmets.Rachael Sanna, an Australian rider, has worn a helmet for years, but none of her teammates here do.“They’ve all come from Europe,” she said. “When I get here and put my old crash hat on, they all go, ‘What are you doing?’ ”At the world games, three of four German dressage riders warmed up in helmets, including Matthias Alexander Rath. Rath was present when the United States Olympian Guenter Seidel was seriously injured in a fall in June. Seidel was wearing a helmet. “From that day on, I said it’s stupid not to wear a helmet,” Rath said.Peters’s American teammate Tina Konyot sometimes wears a helmet when she rides inexperienced horses, but she does not ride her Grand Prix horse, Calecto V, in a helmet and said she would not here. “You’re not going to go and change anything” right before a major competition, she said.In an interview with The Chronicle of the Horse earlier this year, Konyot said she had a photograph of herself as a child, riding without a helmet or a bridle, jumping with her arms out to the side. She had learned to ride that way, she was reported saying, and whether she wore a helmet now was a personal decision.Ferrell, who is also the chairman of the medical committee of the International Equestrian Federation, the sport’s governing body, said he planned to convene a meeting to discuss helmet use.“I don’t mind bringing pressure to an organization to consider changing the rules,” Ferrell said. “If you make it a rule, everyone becomes comfortable with it. Eventually you’re not a dork for doing that.”Such a change would very likely encounter opposition, even among riders who support helmet use.“I’m a proponent for helmet use, but it’s totally up to the individual,” King Dye said in an e-mail typed with her left hand.While issuing statements in support of helmet use, the United States Equestrian Federation and the international federation have stopped short of saying they would require helmets.“U.S.E.F. would support if it is felt from that individual discipline that they want to go down that road,” the organization’s president, David O’Connor said.Many say that King Dye’s accident has helped make helmet use more acceptable, at least in North America.“I know people personally who feel a certain relief that they now have permission to wear a helmet,” Gray said.Since March, King Dye has recovered the ability to speak and walk with assistance. Her ambitious rehabilitation plan involves a return to international dressage, where she says she will lose the top hat in the competition ring.“I will definitely wear a helmet to show,” she wrote.At the World Equestrian Games, Peters, the American favorite, will warm up in a helmet, but he seemed to be grappling with the issue of wearing one in competition.“I’m an extremely superstitious person,” he said, explaining that he had worn the same tailcoat and top hat for 22 years, including during the Olympics. “As much as I’d like to compete in a helmet, I’m still arguing about it with myself.”'"
"'10-09-29,'0','It takes real skill to give the fermented juice of fresh apples the graceful allure of white wine instead of the more robust character if its cousin, hard cider.To make his apple wine, Roman Roth, the winemaker for Wölffer Estate Vineyards in Sagaponack, N.Y., starts with apples like Fuji, Braeburn and Jonagold, which normally go in a fruit bowl, not a cider press. “The apples are more aromatic and sweeter than cider apples,” Mr. Roth said. “With more sugar we can get alcohol that’s higher than what is classified as cider, 7 percent or more.” The apples come from the orchards of a nearby farm owned by a branch of the Halsey family, which first started tilling the land in the 17th century.The label calls it Big Apple Wine, clever but almost a misnomer, because it is all about delicacy, not grandeur. It is pale straw in color, with a whisper of effervescence, a blossom fragrance and a light, refreshingly tart yet fruit-driven flavor. It would not be out of place at Thanksgiving, as an aperitif or even with the turkey.Wölffer Estate Big Apple Wine is $9.99 for 750 milliliters at Astor Wines & Spirits, and $11 from wolffer.com.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','“Nine Nation Animation” is the third installment in the series The World According to Shorts, anthologies of award-winning short films made outside the United States. It’s the first to consist entirely of animation, and it’s a winner, with only one or two duds among the nine movies.The simplest entry, the stop-motion “Average 40 Matches” by the Turkish team of Burkay Dogan and M. Sakir Arslan, is a lusciously colored cautionary tale set on a red tabletop holding an open matchbox and a pack of smokes. Hearing the cigarettes’ siren call, the matches crawl from their box like zombies from a crypt, sliding toward their inevitable doom.Also funny and relatively simple in technique is the Belgian animator Jonas Geirnaert’s “Flatlife,” whose title refers to both its “Cathy”-like cartoon drawing style and its setting, three apartments in which every action — pounding a nail, tapping on the ceiling with a broom, whacking a recalcitrant television — has an equal and opposite reaction in an adjoining unit.At the other end of the scale in visual complexity is Patrick Pleutin’s “Bâmiyân,” from France. Its story about a seventh-century Chinese monk who travels to see the Buddhas of Bamiyan (which the Taliban dynamited in 2001) is facile, but the ways it’s illustrated include the manipulation of piles of colored pigment — much like the creation of a sand mandala.Two of the best films use mixed-media and collage techniques to lend poignancy to true stories. In “Home Road Movies,” from Britain, Robert Bradbrook combines computer animation in a 1960s travel-brochure style, family photos and the Scottish actor Bill Paterson with a story about summer holidays with the director’s father.The Swedish filmmaker Jonas Odell brings a harder edge to “Never Like the First Time!” in which he animates four recorded interviews about first sexual experiences in distinct styles appropriate to the natures of the stories and the ages of the protagonists.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','The shopping carts are lined up hours early in Tompkins Square Park, not far from the dog run, where the East Village’s more genteel residents are unleashing retrievers and beagles and chatting animatedly. The poor or elderly waiting on benches to get the free food that comes with a dose of the Gospel seem more lost in their own thoughts, even though many meet every Tuesday.A guard, Mike Luke, a powerhouse known as Big Mike who himself was a consumer at church pantries until he found religion and decided to work for “the man upstairs,” manages the crowd with crisp authority until the 11 a.m. service starts across the street at the Tompkins Square Gospel Fellowship. There is nervous tension because only the first 50 will get in, and suddenly two women are squabbling over a black cart.“How do you know that’s your cart?” Big Mike firmly asks one, a fair question since the carts look alike. But the mystery is cleared up with the discovery of an orphaned gray cart.Inside the worship hall, the 50 men and women sit in neat rows in front of a pulpit and a painting of a generic waterfall while a pianist softly plays hymns. Their carts are reassembled in neat rows as well.The room has the shopworn air of Sergeant Sarah Brown’s Save-a-Soul Mission in “Guys and Dolls.” One almost expects Stubby Kaye to get up and sing “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat.” But people don’t mind having to sit through a sermon as the price of admission, and few have jobs they need to run to. While they wait, volunteers fill each cart with a couple of bread loaves — redolent of a Gospel miracle, except these are ciabatta and 10-grain — a couple of bananas, a couple of less-than-freshly-picked ears of corn, a box of eggs, a box of blueberries, even an Asian pear.The food is donated by Trader Joe’s, the gourmet and organic food purveyor, which has a store nearby. It usually feeds the kinds of professionals who use the dog run, but it provides the fellowship with a wealth of unsold baked goods, fruit and vegetables.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','The state secrets case arises in a surprising context. The court has turned back appeals from people who say they were sent abroad to be tortured but whose lawsuits were dismissed after the government invoked the privilege.This month, a sharply divided 11-member panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in , dismissed a lawsuit against Jeppesen Dataplan, a subsidiary accused of arranging flights for the to transfer prisoners to other countries for imprisonment and , on state secrets grounds.Boeing, as successor to the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, is one of the parties to the state secrets cases the court agreed to hear on Tuesday, Boeing Company v. United States, No. 09-1302, but now it objects to the government’s invocation of the privilege. Its case has been consolidated with the second one, v. United States, No. 09-1298.Both arose from a 1988 contract to develop the A-12 Avenger aircraft. Dissatisfied with the contractors’ progress, the Navy terminated the contract three years later and demanded the return of $1.35 billion.The contractors refused to return the money and sued, saying among other things that their work had been frustrated by the government’s failure to share classified technology. The government disputed that assertion but would not explain why, invoking the state secrets privilege. An appeals court repeatedly ruled against the contractors, saying at one point that the Constitution’s due-process clause does not require that they be able to present “a defense that would threaten national security.”The leading Supreme Court case on state secrets, from 1953, also concerned an aircraft. In that case, United States v. Reynolds, the widows of men who died when a B-29 bomber crashed in Waycross, Ga., during a secret mission, sued the government for negligence.The Supreme Court ruled against the widows on state secrets grounds. But the court said things might be different if the government were pressing a claim rather than defending against one.It would be unconscionable to allow the government to pursue a criminal prosecution, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson wrote for the majority, “and then invoke its governmental privileges to deprive the accused of anything which might be material to his defense.”“Such rationale,” Chief Justice Vinson went on, “has no application in a civil forum where the government is not the moving party.”The new cases are civil rather than criminal, and the parties disagree about which of them is the plaintiff and which the defendant. With interest, the government now seeks about $3 billion.The privacy case, v. , No. 09-1279, will consider whether a provision of the Freedom of Information Act concerning “personal privacy” applies to corporations.AT&T seeks to block the release of documents it provided to the F.C.C., which conducted an investigation into claims of overcharges by the company in a program to provide equipment and services to schools. The documents were sought under the freedom of information law by a trade association representing some of AT&T’s competitors.AT&T relied on an exemption to the law for law enforcement records that could “constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in , ruled for the company, relying in part on a definition of “person” in the law that included corporations.“Corporations, like human beings, face public embarrassment, harassment and stigma” because of their involvement in law enforcement investigations, Judge Michael A. Chagares wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel.The federal government, represented by Solicitor General Kagan, urged the Supreme Court to reject the argument that the exemption “protects the so-called ‘privacy’ of inanimate corporate entities.”The court also agreed to hear a case on the exclusionary rule, which sometimes requires the suppression of evidence obtained through police misconduct. The court has cut back on the rule in recent decisions.The new case, v. King, No. 09-1272, will consider a ruling from the Kentucky Supreme Court overturning a drug conviction. The case began when police officers pursued a man suspected of dealing drugs into an apartment complex, heard a door slam but were unsure about which unit he had entered. Smelling outside one unit, they forced their way in without a warrant.The police did not find the suspect but did find several people with drugs. The state court said they should not have entered without a warrant and threw out a defendant’s conviction. The attorneys general of 16 states joined Kentucky in urging the Supreme Court to hear the case.The court also took a small step toward allowing greater public access to its proceedings, announcing that it would post audio recordings of arguments at the court on its Web site a few days after they take place.The court does not allow cameras in its courtroom but does release same-day transcripts of arguments. Its general practice has been to delay release of audio recordings until the beginning of the next term.But the court has on 21 occasions provided same-day audio recordings of notable arguments, starting in 2000 with two in the case that came to be known as Bush v. Gore and ending in January with Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission.Same-day release of recordings will now be discontinued.That will take the court out of the business of making judgments about which arguments are newsworthy, a practice that raises First Amendment concerns. But it also means that recordings of major arguments will be released too late to aid most journalistic coverage. On the other hand, the public, practitioners and scholars will have much prompter access to recordings of scores of arguments each term than they had in the past.The court ordinarily hears arguments on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and recordings of them will now be posted on Fridays.Susan Swain, president of C-Span, was muted in her praise. “We continue to hope that the court’s next step will be same-day release of all oral arguments, and ultimately, television coverage of its public sessions,” she said in a statement.The court has been recording arguments since 1955. Many are available at the and on the Oyez Project, a multimedia archive.Jerry Goldman, the project’s director, said a transcript was no substitute for a recording.“It’s the difference between reading the libretto and listening to the opera,” he said. “It’s the emotional component.” ADAM LIPTAKChief Justice recently sold his shares of stock so he could participate in two coming cases involving the company, the world’s biggest drug maker, a Supreme Court spokeswoman said Tuesday.Patricia Estrada, the spokeswoman, said Chief Justice Roberts sold his stock on Aug. 31 specifically so he could hear the cases.

"'10-09-29,'0','Neymar has been struggling to find his best form and “had some problems off the pitch,” Menezes said.The coach is being kind. Neymar is in danger of burning out before breaking out. In the last two weeks, he has thrown a tantrum that ended with his club coach, Dorival Júnior, being dismissed for trying to discipline him.Dorival landed a new job, as coach at Atlético Mineiro, before anyone could say the word compensation. And that is the way it is in Brazil, where the trainers hop around the coaching carousel and switch jobs before the growing youths can finish their apprenticeships at any one club.Santos is Neymar’s home club, just as it once was Pelé’s — his one and only Brazilian squad, where he played more than 1,000 games. But while Pelé is one of those imploring Neymar to stay at Santos, for his own sake, suspicions are growing that he will be in Europe by the January transfer period.Money is only part of the problem.“We are creating a monster in Brazilian football,” another much-traveled Brazilian coach, René Simões, said last week. “Someone has to educate him for the good of sports.”Simões, 57, has a different view of the world than does Neymar. It is the view of a man whose specialty has been in coaching youths, boys and girls, in Brazil, Iran, Jamaica and Costa Rica.He has not had responsibility for Neymar’s meteoric rise. But like everyone from the head of state down, Simões has opinions on what is good, bad and apparently ugly in the young man with the world at his feet.Neymar compares to Pelé in 1959, or Diego Maradona in 1976. The fledgling might mock senior pros with the ball at his feet, but the fast track to fortune is laden with traps. He might be injured, he might fall to temptations, he might become exploited.His outburst toward Dorival was not in itself monstrous. Neymar wanted to take a penalty kick, but his coach and team captain gave the kick to somebody more experienced, and Neymar threw a foul-mouthed fit.It happens. A boy in a man’s game is usually put in his place in the confines of the team camp, and we hear no more about it.This is a young man, however, whose every action is on camera. The nation watches, debates, chastises, lauds. The fear that he might develop habits more like Maradona’s than Pelé’s exercises the minds of a country where soccer is so ingrained.Discipline Neymar, and be seen to be doing so, was the cry.So Santos issued a statement: “The club will demand profound changes in his behavior, on and off the field. The club will support the player so that this moment of difficulty can be overcome.”The statement said there would be a fine and a one-game ban. How big the fine was, Santos would not say. It was most likely a slap on the wrist to a young man who came into millions some time ago.Just how does Santos reform this man-child without tampering with the free spirit that makes him the biggest meal ticket in the club’s recent history?The day after the tantrum, Neymar did what teenagers today generally do. He used his Twitter page to apologize to the coach (whom he addressed as “professor”), to his parents, to the fans. “It’s all good,” he posted on Twitter. “We are together.”The togetherness lasted one week. When Dorival benched Neymar for a second match, the Santos president removed the coach. Neymar returned and fired a goal against Corinthians, but Santos lost the game, 3-2, last Wednesday.Poor, rich, adolescent Neymar took some blame for that loss.His form is bound to fluctuate, but who can guide him through it? Last June, July and August, there was an uproar because Chelsea, dealing with Neymar’s parents and his agent, is believed to have tried to transfer him without the approval of Santos.The club threatened to report Chelsea for an illegal approach, and Chelsea, which has had enough threats in that regard, backed off. Santos’s president, Luis Alvaro, triumphantly announced that he would keep Neymar in Brazil for years to come. He tripled his salary and now seeks global marketing to recoup the cost.Santos thus hopes to reverse the trend that has brought every great Brazilian to Europe for decades. With the World Cup scheduled to arrive in 2014 and the country’s economy improving, Brazilians hope to enjoy the fruits of their own embryonic superstars.We will see. Reports persist that Chelsea will be back next year and could be outbid for Neymar by Juventus.Neymar’s countrymen Coutinho and Pato already play in Italy. The three are forecast to be the new trident of Brazil’s World Cup squad.Being abroad is not easy, however. Pato, sold to Milan as a 17-year-old, was married and divorced before his 21st birthday this month. His bride, the actress Sthefany Brito, cited soccer as the culprit, for occupying too much of his time.'"
"'10-09-29,'0','Ms. Gillard scored her first parliamentary victory on Tuesday when her nominee for speaker of the 150-member House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins, was elected unopposed. Under Australian conventions, the speaker is not allowed to cast a vote except in the event of a tie, effectively giving Ms. Gillard a one-vote majority in the lower house.With such a razor-thin advantage, Ms. Gillard cannot afford to have a single member of Parliament, including herself, absent for any major vote.Moreover, Mr. Abbott has threatened to restrict the traditional practice of “pairing,” in which the opposition party agrees to remove one of its lawmakers from the floor when the prime minister or a senior minister is absent from a parliamentary vote.The opposition leader has said he will only grant pairings in some medical cases or when the government lawmaker is engaged in business vital to the national interest, a position that could severely hamper the ability of the prime minister and other senior legislators to travel while Parliament is sitting.“This is an opposition that will hold this government to account,” Mr. Abbott said on Tuesday. “This will be a Parliament of robust debate.”Under such rancorous conditions, many analysts believe that the success of Ms. Gillard’s minority government will depend on her ability to keep the independents and the Greens happy. However, having joined with Labor, the four nonparty members of Ms. Gillard’s minority government now have a vested interest in ensuring the government’s success.“I would be surprised if the government did not last its full term,” said Geoff Robinson, an expert in Australian politics at Deakin University in Victoria State. “In terms of keeping the Greens and the independents on side, that is going to require some work.”The four coalition members have not given their unqualified support to Labor. While they have agreed to support the government’s annual budgets and oppose no-confidence motions from the opposition, they have retained the right to judge each Labor policy on its merits.Ms. Gillard has already given a number of concessions to her coalition partners. She has appointed a new cabinet-level minister for rural affairs, in response to concerns raised by two of the independents, who represent country areas, and has reversed her previous opposition to the idea of a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“Clearly, we are in a very different environment than we were during the election campaign,” Ms. Gillard said on Monday at the announcement of a new parliamentary committee to assess the best way of putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. “If you’re going to have this work, then you’ve got to have options on the table.”'"
"'10-09-29,'0','Almost as if determined to prove something, he conducted the score with exceptional vigor, sweep and uncommon textural clarity. Inner details emerged, but always subtly folded into the overall arching episodes and spans of the opera. In the scene in which Wotan and Loge, the demigod of fire (here the tenor Richard Croft in a vocally suave and sly performance), try to wrest the booty of gold and the magic ring from Alberich in the lower realm of Nibelheim, Mr. Levine was an attentive accompanist, allowing the singers to exchange lines with conversational urgency, yet always there to nudge and juice the orchestral subtext. Mr. Levine clearly has some way to go in getting back his stamina and health. But this performance was an encouraging sign.And the machine worked. Well, almost worked. There was one serious glitch at the end. The “machine” is what the cast and crew have taken to calling the 45-ton gizmo that dominates Mr. Lepage’s complex staging, the work of the set designer Carl Fillion. It consists of a series of 24 planks on a crossbar that rise and sink like seesaws, singly, in tandem or in patterns. To evoke the churning currents of the river where the Rhinemaidens protect the magic gold, the planks, bathed in greenish lights, undulate slowly. As in many traditional productions, the three aquatic sisters (Lisette Oropesa, Jennifer Johnson, Tamara Mumford) first appear dangling from cables. But when planks rise to create a wall of water for the maidens to rest on, there are video images of stones and pebbles on the river floor tumbling downward as the sisters rustle them.Otto Schenk’s Romantic “Ring” production, which was retired in 2009, had passionate defenders. In talking up the Lepage “Ring,” Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, tried to assure everyone that this was not going to be some high-concept, Eurotrash staging. Mr. Lepage uses the latest in staging technology to “tell the story,” Mr. Gelb said repeatedly in interviews.Actually, in many ways, even with all the high-tech elements, Mr. Lepage’s production is fairly traditional. François St-Aubin’s costumes are like glitzier, quirkier riffs on old-fashioned Wagnerian “Ring” outfits. Mr. Terfel’s Wotan has stringy hair that falls over the god’s blind left eye, and a rustic shirt missing an arm. Yet he sports a bronze breastplate right out of a storybook “Ring.” The giants, Fasolt and Fafner (the booming basses Franz-Josef Selig and Hans-Peter König) are like rugged bushmen, with scraggly hair and beards, and leggings covered with fur. Loge has a Peter Sellars hairdo (an inside joke from one director to another?), a ragtag outfit and hands that emit a fiery glow on command.The production is also traditional in that Mr. Lepage essentially defers to Wagner. If he has strong personal takes on who these characters are, they did not come through here. One thing about those high-concept, updated “Ring” productions is that a director can put Wagner’s characters in a setting that makes you see them afresh. We will have to wait for the later installments of this “Ring” to see how, say, Mr. Lepage views Wotan’s role as a father to a rebellious daughter whom he loves and vicariously lives through.There are breathtaking stage tricks in this production. When Wotan and Loge descend into Nibelheim, we see them walking down the planks as if descending a huge stairway. But, as presented, we look down on them from above: the Wotan and Loge that we see are body doubles harnessed to cables and walking the wall perpendicular to the stage. Mr. Lepage is like a magician eager to show off how a trick works, knowing it will still hook you. This one hooked me.At other times, the use of body doubles seems gratuitous and distracting. When Fricka’s sister, Freia, whom Wotan has foolishly promised to the giants as payment for their construction job, first appears, she (actually a body double) careens on her stomach head-first down the planks, tilted like a playground slide. Really, this is just not a very godly thing to do.The production worked well in scenes in which the machine turned into a stationary backdrop, and the planks became a video screen. In Nibelheim, for example, when on a lower level we saw Alberich’s slaves sweating over molten pots of gold, the wall above them was alive with shifting russet, earthen and blazing yellow colors.Mr. Lepage deserves credit for coaxing vivid portrayals from his cast. And most of the action is played on an apron of planks that extend from the stage, which brings the singers into exciting proximity. Mr. Terfel’s singing was sometimes gravelly and rough. But his was a muscular Wotan, in both his imposing presence and his powerful singing.Mr. Owens’s Alberich was no sniveling dwarf, but a barrel-chested, intimidating foe, singing with stentorian vigor, looking dangerous in his dreadlocks and crazed in his fantasy of ruling the universe.The bright-voiced soprano Wendy Bryn Harmer was a sympathetic yet volatile Freia. The tenor Gerhard Siegel won your heart as the pitiable Mime, Alberich’s oppressed brother. The mezzo-soprano Patricia Bardon was not the most earthy-voiced Erda, but she sang with grave beauty. Adam Diegel, a youthful tenor in his Met debut, was Froh; the Met veteran baritone Dwayne Croft was in good voice as Donner.Alas, the machine malfunctioned in the final scene, when the planks did not move into place to form the rainbow bridge to Valhalla. So the gods just wandered off the stage. Given the complexity of the device, it’s a wonder that it worked so well on its debut night.'"

"'10-09-30,'0','The ancient convention for naming newly discovered geographical features is fairly simple: royalty, sponsors, loved ones and crewmates come first, possibly followed by the explorer. That is how most of the landmarks around Antarctica got their names. But now a new set of names is being added — not to geographical spots, which are mostly taken, but to navigation waypoints along the main air routes between New Zealand and McMurdo Station in Antarctica.They will bear the names of the dogs and ponies used by Robert Falcon Scott and by Roald Amundsen during their great race to the South Pole in the winter of 1911-1912, names like Bones and Nobby, Helge and Uroa. Everyone responsible for the waypoints — civil air authorities, scientific bodies — yielded to a two-year campaign by Ronald Smith, an American Air Force colonel, to honor those animals.It is apt and lovely. Neither explorer would have succeeded without the aid of their animals. Amundsen, who reached the pole before Scott, relied solely on dogs. Scott chose small, stout Manchurian and Siberian ponies, who found the going hard and, in the end, hampered his expedition. But those ponies were also reminders of home and the object of much care from the men. On the Web site of the Scott Polar Research Institute, you can see photographs of the ponies — four in their stalls above decks, 15 under the forecastle.“Poor patient beasts,” they were called by Apsley Cherry-Garrard, a crew member and author of the best account of Scott’s expedition. He wondered what they would remember of sailing through Antarctic waters. “It would seem strangely merciful,” he wrote, “if nature should blot out these weeks of slow but inevitable torture.” Most of us will never fly over those newly named waypoints. But we can call up the photos of the ponies aboard the Terra Nova and marvel at their beauty and acceptance.'"

This is simply not the case.Countless products exist in marketplaces and on store shelves that are environmentally preferable, better performing and cost-effective.By stating that green products and technologies cost more, do not perform as well and are not convenient, the article perpetuated a dangerous myth. Such sweeping generalities only reinforce a misconception that has impeded the widespread adoption of green alternatives.Just like traditional technologies, green alternatives exhibit a range of performance across a spectrum of price points. And when it comes to environmental impact, green products far outperform traditional ones, which can contribute to degradation of our lakes, streams and atmosphere.Green products and technologies have redefined our standards of performance.

"'10-09-30,'0','So a calling card in the code could be part of a mind game, or sloppiness or whimsy from the coders.The malicious code has appeared in many countries, notably China, India, Indonesia and Iran. But there are tantalizing hints that Iran’s nuclear program was the primary target. Officials in both the United States and Israel have made no secret of the fact that undermining the computer systems that control Iran’s huge enrichment plant at Natanz is a high priority. (The Iranians know it, too: They have never let international inspectors into the control room of the plant, the inspectors report, presumably to keep secret what kind of equipment they are using.)The fact that Stuxnet appears designed to attack a certain type of Siemens industrial control computer, used widely to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and many kinds of nuclear plants, may be telling. Just last year officials in Dubai seized a large shipment of those controllers — known as the Simatic S-7 — after Western intelligence agencies warned that the shipment was bound for Iran and would likely be used in its nuclear program.“What we were told by many sources,” said Olli Heinonen, who retired last month as the head of inspections at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, “was that the Iranian nuclear program was acquiring this kind of equipment.”Also, starting in the summer of 2009, the Iranians began having tremendous difficulty running their centrifuges, the tall, silvery machines that spin at supersonic speed to enrich uranium — and which can explode spectacularly if they become unstable. In New York last week, Iran’s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, shrugged off suggestions that the country was having trouble keeping its enrichment plants going.Yet something — perhaps the worm or some other form of sabotage, bad parts or a dearth of skilled technicians — is indeed slowing Iran’s advance.The reports on Iran show a fairly steady drop in the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium at the main Natanz plant. After reaching a peak of 4,920 machines in May 2009, the numbers declined to 3,772 centrifuges this past August, the most recent reporting period. That is a decline of 23 percent. (At the same time, production of low-enriched uranium has remained fairly constant, indicating the Iranians have learned how to make better use of fewer working machines.)Computer experts say the first versions of the worm appeared as early as 2009 and that the sophisticated version contained an internal time stamp from January of this year.These events add up to a mass of suspicions, not proof. Moreover, the difficulty experts have had in figuring out the origin of Stuxnet points to both the appeal and the danger of computer attacks in a new age of cyberwar.For intelligence agencies they are an almost irresistible weapon, free of fingerprints. Israel has poured huge resources into Unit 8200, its secretive cyberwar operation, and the United States has built its capacity inside the National Security Agency and inside the military, which just opened a Cyber Command.But the near impossibility of figuring out where they came from makes deterrence a huge problem — and explains why many have warned against the use of cyberweapons. No country, President Obama was warned even before he took office, is more vulnerable to cyberattack than the United States.For now, it is hard to determine if the worm has infected centrifuge controllers at Natanz. While the S-7 industrial controller is used widely in Iran, and many other countries, even Siemens says it does not know where it is being used. Alexander Machowetz, a spokesman in Germany for Siemens, said the company did no business with Iran’s nuclear program. “It could be that there is equipment,” he said in a telephone interview. “But we never delivered it to Natanz.”But Siemens industrial controllers are unregulated commodities that are sold and resold all over the world — the controllers intercepted in Dubai traveled through China, according to officials familiar with the seizure.Ralph Langner, a German computer security consultant who was the first independent expert to assert that the malware had been “weaponized” and designed to attack the Iranian centrifuge array, argues that the Stuxnet worm could have been brought into the Iranian nuclear complex by Russian contractors.“It would be an absolute no-brainer to leave an infected USB stick near one of these guys,” he said, “and there would be more than a 50 percent chance of having him pick it up and infect his computer.”There are many reasons to suspect Israel’s involvement in Stuxnet. Intelligence is the single largest section of its military and the unit devoted to signal, electronic and computer network intelligence, known as Unit 8200, is the largest group within intelligence.Yossi Melman, who covers intelligence for the newspaper Haaretz and is at work on a book about Israeli intelligence over the past decade, said in a telephone interview that he suspected that Israel was involved.He noted that Meir Dagan, head of Mossad, had his term extended last year partly because he was said to be involved in important projects. He added that in the past year Israeli estimates of when Iran will have a nuclear weapon had been extended to 2014.“They seem to know something, that they have more time than originally thought,” he said.Then there is the allusion to myrtus — which may be telling, or may be a red herring.Several of the teams of computer security researchers who have been dissecting the software found a text string that suggests that the attackers named their project Myrtus. The guava fruit is part of the Myrtus family, and one of the code modules is identified as Guava.It was Mr. Langner who first noted that Myrtus is an allusion to the Hebrew word for Esther. The Book of Esther tells the story of a Persian plot against the Jews, who attacked their enemies pre-emptively.“If you read the Bible you can make a guess,” said Mr. Langner, in a telephone interview from Germany on Wednesday.Carol Newsom, an Old Testament scholar at Emory University, confirmed the linguistic connection between the plant family and the Old Testament figure, noting that Queen Esther’s original name in Hebrew was Hadassah, which is similar to the Hebrew word for myrtle. Perhaps, she said, “someone was making a learned cross-linguistic wordplay.”But other Israeli experts said they doubted Israel’s involvement. Shai Blitzblau, the technical director and head of the computer warfare laboratory at Maglan, an Israeli company specializing in information security, said he was “convinced that Israel had nothing to do with Stuxnet.”“We did a complete simulation of it and we sliced the code to its deepest level,” he said. “We have studied its protocols and functionality. Our two main suspects for this are high-level industrial espionage against Siemens and a kind of academic experiment.”Mr. Blitzblau noted that the worm hit India, Indonesia and Russia before it hit Iran, though the worm has been found disproportionately in Iranian computers. He also noted that the Stuxnet worm has no code that reports back the results of the infection it creates. Presumably, a good intelligence agency would like to trace its work.'"

"'10-09-30,'0','But Gardenhire would not speculate whether Morneau could play at some point in the postseason.Smith and Gardenhire both say they no longer ask Morneau how he’s feeling. Both seem intent on not pressuring him into coming back too soon. Still, if Morneau does work out with the team Thursday, the question of how he feels will be front and center. The importance of being cautious will undoubtedly have to be re-emphasized.“Every one of us would love to have Justin Morneau in the lineup tonight,” Smith said last week. “But we’re not going to jeopardize Justin Morneau’s long-term health or his long-term career. If we have to wait two days or two weeks, we wait two days or two weeks. If we have to wait six months, we wait six months.”Among the major leaguers who sustained concussions this season — a list that includes St. Louis Cardinals catcher Jason LaRue, who has decided to retire, and Jason Bay of the Mets — Morneau is the biggest name. The 2006 A.L. most valuable player, Morneau was in the midst of another successful season (.345, 18 homers, 56 runs batted in) when he was accidentally kneed in the head by Toronto’s John McDonald on a takeout slide into second base on July 7.The Twins pulled Morneau out of the game immediately. He did not play the next day and accompanied the Twins to Detroit to be examined by Dr. Kenneth Podell, a neuropsychology consultant for the Detroit Lions and Red Wings. Podell sent him back to Minneapolis to rest.Smith said the Twins’ medical and training staffs took a greater interest in concussions after the plight of Corey Koskie, a longtime Twin who missed two and a half seasons with post-concussion syndrome, for an injury sustained with the Milwaukee Brewers, before retiring in March 2009. Koskie called Smith shortly after Morneau was examined and later talked to Morneau.The Twins already knew to be careful with Morneau, who had previously told the medical staff he sustained four head injuries playing basketball and hockey as a youngster. As a Twin, he missed 10 days with a concussion after a 2005 beaning.At first, Morneau said his symptoms were not as severe as in 2005. But they did not subside as quickly. He took batting practice on the field on Aug. 7, and there was talk he might soon begin a rehabilitation assignment. That did not happen. In late August, Morneau was told to cease baseball activities and concentrate on cardiovascular work at home. He quietly resumed hitting several weeks ago.Dr. Christopher Giza, an associate professor of pediatric neurology and neurosurgery at U.C.L.A., said the Twins had followed established guidelines in their treatment of Morneau. He said some patients with a history of head injuries did not recover quickly from another incident even if the initial symptoms, as in Morneau’s case, did not seem that severe.In an interview on Sept. 8, Morneau expressed frustration over sitting out for a second consecutive season. Last year, Morneau did not play after Sept. 12 because of a cracked bone in his lower back. The Twins won the A.L. Central but were swept by the Yankees in the playoffs.This season the Morneau-less Twins have compiled a 47-23 record in the second half. Among the keys to the surge have been a career season from left fielder Delmon Young (110 R.B.I.), unexpected production from the 40-year-old designated hitter Jim Thome (25 homers and a .280 average) and a .383 second half from Joe Mauer.“It seems like they play pretty good without him,” White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle said of Morneau. “That’s the type of team they have. When one of their superstars goes down, even a great hitter like he is and defensive guy at first base, it seems like they have somebody to step right on in.”In the September interview, Morneau lamented his ongoing absence, saying, “You never know how many chances you’re going to get to win.”Michael Cuddyer, who missed more than two and a half months in 2008 with finger and foot injuries, said he understood Morneau’s frustration but could not offer him much comfort. “Automatically, if you’re not on the field, you’re going to feel like that,” said Cuddyer, who replaced Morneau at first base. “So you have to do stuff to make yourself feel like a part of it.”Morneau tries. On Sept. 17, when center fielder Denard Span reported a jammed shoulder, Morneau gave the minor league callup Ben Revere advance notice that he would be making his first major league start. Last Tuesday night, Morneau sprayed Champagne with teammates after the Twins clinched and carefully hugged the much smaller Span on the field. But he turned his head to avoid an accidental bump.Meanwhile, Gardenhire said he could not help but think how much more formidable the Twins would be with his phantom in the lineup.“I just wish I had my first baseman,” he said.'"

"'10-09-30,'0','Half an hour into Teenage Fanclub’s set at the Bowery Ballroom on Monday night, Norman Blake, the chattiest of the Scottish band’s three songwriters, paused to hold five fingers out to a crowd that had been singing along to every word.“Five years since we played here,” Mr. Blake said. “I recognize the faces.” Then, as apology, explanation or just his usual self-deprecation, he added, “We’ve been working on the Scottish calendar: 384 days in a year, 26 1/2 hours in a day.”In the 20 years since its first album, time has slowed down for Teenage Fanclub, and the big mainstream audience once predicted for its music — bright, harmony-rich songs in the tradition of Big Star and the Byrds, with undercurrents of noisy guitar abrasion — has settled into a modest cult dedicated enough to wait for albums that come less frequently than the World Cup. The band’s latest, “Shadows” (Merge), was released in June, five years after “Man-Made,” which came five years after the previous one, “Howdy!” After two shows earlier this week at the Bowery, Teenage Fanclub plays again on Thursday with Belle and Sebastian, another Scottish group, at the Williamsburg Waterfront in Brooklyn.In the grunge gold rush of the early 1990s, Teenage Fanclub, which had an early affinity with groups like Nirvana and Sonic Youth, seemed destined for a splashy career. In 1991 Spin magazine chose its “Bandwagonesque” as album of the year over Nirvana’s “Nevermind,” a head-scratcher that neither magazine nor band has ever lived down. That led to outsize sales expectations for Teenage Fanclub and, inevitably, to commercial disappointment. But to hear the band members tell it now, they are perfectly comfortable with the quieter, steadier career they have carved out as they enter middle age.“The first few years of the band felt like a conveyor belt, and it’s good to choose to step off it and just do our own thing,” said Gerard Love, the bassist, who aside from the cracks around his smile looks far younger than his 43 years. “I prefer it now, when we’re more in control,” he added, “even if there’s less money or less opportunities.”The career arc for many of their peers has included a spiteful breakup and a lucrative reunion. Teenage Fanclub, founded in Glasgow in 1989, has avoided both. But even as its audience has narrowed, the band has retained a rare prestige among critics and other musicians.“To me they are the perennial benchmark of quality songwriting,” said Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie. “Great pop music should sound like the easiest thing in the world to write, but once you try to accomplish it yourself, it just becomes impossible. And it’s only in that moment of trying to recreate the magic that you realize how brilliant it really is.”“Shadows” continues a trend in recent Teenage Fanclub albums of ruminative, deceptively delicate songs tinged with darkness. The songwriting is split evenly among Mr. Love and the guitarists Mr. Blake and Raymond McGinley, each contributing four of the album’s 12 songs. Their voices are distinct, yet they share a preoccupation with autumnal reflection and coming to terms with maturity. “When I light a fire underneath what I was/I won’t feel sad, only warmed by the loss,” Mr. McGinley, 46, sings in “The Fall.”“You can’t write the songs you wrote when you were 22, because you’re not 22 anymore,” Mr. Blake, 44, said in a group interview on Monday over coffee and sugared doughnuts in Midtown Manhattan.The songs on “Shadows” also yearn for nature’s peace as a remedy for a life of computers and technological distraction. “I’m aware that certain elements of contemporary existence make me less of a person than I would like to be,” explained Mr. McGinley, who like Mr. Blake sported a big, shaggy mop in the old days but now has a head of salt-and-pepper hair. “Part of me wants to live life more through sensation than information.”In person the three men are gregarious and lighthearted, talking about the “normal life” that their latter-day schedule affords them — it seems to involve a lot of soccer — and poking fun at their history of near-misses with fame. They were too pop to really fit in the grunge world and too Scots for the London-centric Brit-pop scene, they said, but life on the fringes ultimately spared them the paparazzi and hype that destroy more fashionable bands.“We didn’t go down with the Brit-pop Titanic,” Mr. Blake said, to chuckles from his band mates.Being Scottish, of course, is no death sentence. On Thursday Teenage Fanclub will open for Belle and Sebastian, a group of slightly younger Glaswegians who conquered the world of indie chamber-pop in the late 1990s, eventually selling 1.2 million albums in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan.Teenage Fanclub, by comparison, has sold only about 270,000 since 1991, when SoundScan began. The band — which includes the drummer Francis Macdonald and the keyboard player David McGowan as auxiliaries — is far more popular in Britain and has toured widely even as its recorded output has slowed. The band members have not needed day jobs but say that making money from music is getting harder. On Monday they lugged their own gear in and out of a tightly packed black van.These days, they say, they feel much the same way they did when they started the band, when the money was tight but sufficient and there were no sales expectations to live up to or record executives to answer to. Their last two albums have been released in the United States by Merge Records, founded by two members of Superchunk, old pals from the grunge days. (Superchunk also plays two shows with Teenage Fanclub next month, in Seattle and Portland, Ore.)How long it will take them to make another album is anybody’s guess. Mr. Blake recently moved to Canada, where his wife is from, and then there’s the whole question of Teenage Fanclub time.“From experience we’ve learned that if you try to rush things against the feel of it, it doesn’t work,” Mr. McGinley said. “You have to wait until you feel ready.”'"
"'10-09-30,'0','But with its unabashed utilitarian bent, LinkedIn has built a presence in social media. Anyone with a career, a business or ambitions to climb the corporate ladder can network with 75 million people who use it, in large part, to find jobs or to recruit candidates for jobs.But in the last year or so, LinkedIn has been offering plenty of information and tools that can help its users, whether they work for themselves or at a company, to conduct research, find new customers and expand their business contacts and prospects. Much of it remains free, though some advanced features require a subscription of $25, $50 or $100.For the LinkedIn novice, the first step is to create a profile, which is much like putting together a résumé listing education, professional experience and skills. But the online profile is different from a printed résumé.For example, putting more content, rather than less, will make your profile more likely to come up in searches. That means listing not just major positions you’ve had, but also minor internships and summer jobs. And it means listing all the skills you have. Change the privacy settings to be as open as possible; if you are looking for work, you want strangers to find you.Next, it is good to have other people vouch for you. You ask people you know to write brief recommendations that also appear in your profile. A little logrolling never hurts. Recommend people you know as they may be more inclined to return the favor.Then network as if LinkedIn were a big industry trade show. Search for people you know and invite them to be part of your network. Regular users of LinkedIn say a common mistake that newcomers make is to limit their network. So how many is enough?There are no absolutes, but Krista Canfield, a LinkedIn spokeswoman, says that 35 connections appears to be the minimum to make the viral properties of social networks truly useful. (As in any network, you don’t want to include people who could drag down your reputation. LinkedIn lets you deflect unwanted invitations with the Archive button so no one knows they have been rejected by you.)Once you’ve gone this far, it is easy to look for jobs using the company’s search tools. But there are plenty of other ways to use it to help your job search or other business aspirations.Perhaps the most useful places to look are the million or so company pages LinkedIn has compiled. The pages will reveal the names of people who were recently hired or left the company, as well as those who have changed positions within the company.Not only will you be able to pinpoint the right person, you will be able to see all the people who are in your network — your direct connections and their connections — who are somehow affiliated with that right person inside a company. I thought I hardly knew anyone at Oracle, for example, and found that 245 people in my network either work there now or have worked there in the past — all potentially useful contacts if I were looking for a job there.If you have your eyes set on a particular company, be it Time Warner, Bank of America or Procter & Gamble, it is a good idea to “follow” their LinkedIn page. Just like when you follow friends or businesses on Facebook or Twitter, you will receive updates in your news feed. They will include company news and job postings, but also updates when people get hired, leave or move up, as well as any activity in your network connected to the company.Company pages are also good for other kinds of research. A module called “related companies” displays typical career paths. For example, the page for Johnson & Johnson shows that the health care giant hired more people who had previously worked at Pfizer than from any other company. And when they left, the most popular destinations were Merck and Novartis.That may give you an idea how to plan your career path, or may help you discover a little known company that is a stepping stone to the company where you want to end up.Other useful company information includes the percentage of employees in research and development or sales and marketing compared with similar companies. That could come in handy for anyone trying to find out what kinds of opportunities are more likely to come up, and useful in preparing for an interview.The premium services allow you to see who looked at your profile and the keywords they used to find it. They also let you see expanded profiles of people outside your network or check references on people you are hiring.But anyone who is trying to use LinkedIn effectively will want to do more than just snoop around. Being active on the site can help to get you noticed by other people.Status updates work much like those on Facebook or Twitter, though telling your professional contacts that you just stopped in at Starbucks is probably not very useful. Joe Rosenberg, a certified public accountant in Florham Park, N.J., says he recently used a status update to alert people that the deadline for self-employed people to file estimated quarterly tax payments was coming up. “People noticed it,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “It could be a reminder to people to call you,” he added.Mr. Rosenberg will also frequently answer questions about tax matters. Those, along with his participation in various groups, have resulted in $10,000 to $15,000 in business from new clients he found on LinkedIn over the last year, he said.Ms. Wiseberg took a similar approach to get Red Scarf Equestrian off the ground. She had been on LinkedIn for several years but had never really learned how to use the site. When she started the business, she began joining groups related to her field and participating in discussions on them. She is now a member in more than a dozen groups, including Luxury and Lifestyle Professionals, Luxury Addict Group, Woman 2 Woman Business, and Horse Lovers of the Business World.It is through these affiliations that others in the industry discovered her and began inviting her to events in Europe, North America and Asia.“I had to go global, because the market in Canada is too small,” Ms. Wiseberg said. “I’m getting there.”'"
"'10-09-30,'0','Still, it was striking just how stylistically cohesive the designers were in their spring collections, which, with a few exceptions, promoted a new longer skirt length, intense color blocking and print combinations, stripes that suggested rugby jerseys or beach cabanas, a broader and rounder shoulder and yards and yards of fringe.“There’s a good spirit here,” said Ron Frasch, the president and chief merchandising officer of Saks Fifth Avenue, shortly after Roberto Cavalli’s 40th-anniversary collection was shown on Monday. That show was held under an enormous tent decorated with a plastic rain forest and a see-through ceiling that was attached to the neoclassical Arco della Pace, constructed in honor of Napoleon in the early 19th century to mark the entrance to the city (the arch, that is, not the tent). Mr. Cavalli’s dresses, trimmed with fringe, and with seashells dangling from the handbags, seemed themselves to be marvels in suspension engineering. You wondered how some of them even managed to remain attached to the models.“Jil Sander was fantastic, but that was not the only show that we loved,” Mr. Frasch said. “There has been a great sense of color and proportion, which I like, and you can tell who all went to the Yves Saint Laurent exhibition in Paris, and who didn’t.” He was referring to the couture shapes, the long trouser suits and the trench dresses that appeared in many collections, which could have been influenced by the YSL retrospective that opened at the Petit Palais in March. “Everyone interpreted them in their own way,” he said.At the Cavalli show, Tim Blanks, a Style.com critic, was among the editors who were entirely upbeat about the Milan season, a feeling he attributed to the widespread use of color and peculiar prints for spring.There were several standout shows, starting with Miuccia Prada’s lively collection that included banana prints and monkeys climbing up the sides of dresses, and a new rounded shoulder that marked a strong departure from the shrunken-top shape that has all but dominated fashion for the last few seasons. On Friday, Etro, a house known for prints, foreshadowed a trend of jarring mixtures with bold florals combined with geometric patterns — a look that later turned up in acid tones on the runways of Versus; interwoven with rock lyrics at Missoni; and finally at Aquilano.Rimondi, where suits, long dresses and shirts were made of contrasting stripes of bright micro-floral prints. At Pucci, the designer Peter Dundas showed hippie-ish versions with blue-and-white bandanna prints.“Who is a Pucci girl?” asked Agnès Boulard, a French television personality, thrusting a microphone in the face of Emmanuelle Alt, the fashion director of French Vogue.Many retailers were encouraged as well, since, as Stephanie Solomon, the fashion director of Bloomingdale’s, said: “It means there’s a new reason to buy, after we’ve been looking at miniskirts for the last two years. This longer silhouette is something new, and it might be more commercial, since it accommodates a broader audience of women.”To recapture a bit of its soul, Italian officials are also promoting an emerging generation of designers, some of whom showed together outside the Duomo. But buzz is slow to build here, to the point that designers like Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi of Aquilano.Rimondi (and Gianfranco Ferré) can work for years and still be considered “new.” Despite the enthusiasm for this season, it is still common to encounter a bit of posturing from editors and designers who remain concerned about Milan’s pace of adapting to the global production and consumption of fashion.“The Italian mind-set cannot understand change that is not step by step,” Mr. Aquilano said, somewhat resignedly.Francesco Scognamiglio has been working for the better part of a decade before enjoying more widespread acknowledgment, in part because of putting Lady Gaga in a plastic dress. For his latest collection, he worked in a few styles that were evocative of that look, plastic minis that were studded with pearls, but he also showed more traditional jackets and dresses with the strong shoulders of Neapolitan tailoring, some trimmed with contrasting black lace and shocking sheer insets at the breasts. “In Italy,” he said, “if you are not a big name, you have to wait for someone else from the outside to discover you.”On Monday night, at the end of the collections, many of the designers gathered for a black tie gala to benefit amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research.“It seems like the whole city is coming back to life,” said Dean Caten, one of the designers of Dsquared, a label that had presented its collection only 12 hours before and was itself an optimistic show with cute clothes and bookworm glasses worn by models who looked like future Eliza Doolittles. “It took us half an hour to get here with the traffic.”'"
"'10-09-30,'0','Later, on the home page of the app, I found the “People” tab, where I could type in my name. Only then did my name appear beneath the “No person” tab I’d seen earlier.I complain about this at the risk of obscuring one of the app’s best qualities; it lets you track medications of more than one person. (The free version works for two people; the paid tracks unlimited people.) For parents, adult children or other caretakers, this can be extremely useful.After you enter the medications, you set the alarm down to the minute. MedsLog requires you to connect the app with your iPhone’s calendar, which is a hassle other apps avoid. But because my iPhone’s calendar is linked to my Google calendar, that step allowed me to receive alerts at any computer.As a medicine tracker, the app brimmed with useful features. You can customize the medication page to include information about peak air flow for asthmatics, for instance, or blood sugar for those with diabetes. MedsLog will also predict when you’ll run out of medication, and you can record where you bought the medication, among other things. Finally, you can set a passcode and keep a medication log that you can e-mail or download to your computer.MotionPHR Health Record Manager ($10 for full version on Android and iPhone, $2 for a Lite version on iPhone) is a similar app that received good reviews from iPhone users until recent weeks, when users began complaining about flaws in the reminder system and a service that backs up user data.The company acknowledged those problems and said it was working on fixes.Medsy ($2, only on the iPhone), meanwhile, was more user-friendly than MedsLog or MotionPHR Health Record Manager, but had many fewer features. Touch the “plus” symbol and tap in the name of your medication. (The auto-fill feature from MedsLog is, sadly, missing here.) Next, choose the quantity and frequency of dosages.It’s a nice touch, but what sets Medsy apart from MedsLog and others is that it will — with no added steps — push alerts even when the iPhone is locked, when other apps are running and when you have no cellular or data connection. If the ringer is off, the phone vibrates until you respond.Medsy is, however, limited in one important respect. Most of my medications are supposed to be taken with meals three times daily, which is a common enough prescription. I could not set the alerts accordingly.Dosecast, a new app, is perhaps the best of the iPhone-only offerings. The application is free for the first month, and $4 after that, but it will be worth the price for most users. It lets you set reminders according to your own schedule, or, if specific intervals are paramount, it will set a schedule for you. You can turn off the interval reminders during bedtime, if you wish.You may also e-mail a list of your medications and your compliance history to anyone you wish. One drawback is that users will miss a reminder if they do not have a 3G or Wi-Fi connection.BlackBerry users have fewer options, as usual. MediRemind ($3, for both BlackBerry and Android devices) is the most highly rated medication tracker in BlackBerry’s App World, but those ratings are based on just a few reviews.As with Medsy, the app allows for “push” notifications when other programs are running, or when the device is locked. The software has a longer list of features than Medsy, however. Among other things, it can store all of your medical contacts and make a phone call with a single push of a button.It’s a highly useful feature when you’re on your last pill and you want to call for a refill before you forget. Or, perhaps, when you have a fistful of pills and a nagging suspicion that swallowing them all at once may not be such a great idea.Suddath, a relocation specialist, recently released “Moving Guru,” a free BlackBerry and iPhone app that includes a task list that begins eight weeks before the move date, packing tips and a “We’ve moved” notification feature. ...“Swing By Swing,” a free iPhone rangefinder for golfers, recently updated the app to include zooming and panning capabilities, so you can spot obstacles on the course with faster loading and less battery drain. ...TripIt is a (free) must-have travel planning app for iPhones, BlackBerrys and Android devices. Forward your travel confirmation e-mail to plans@tripit.com and it creates a master itinerary in a private TripIt.com account. The service recently added a new feature for Gmail users, in which travel-related e-mail is automatically forwarded to your TripIt account.'"
"'10-09-30,'0','It is unclear whether the terrorist threats amount to a new, concerted campaign against European targets, or represent a variety of unconnected plots by terror groups operating in different places and on different time frames. European officials played down the risk of any imminent threat, while saying that they took any reports of terrorist plans seriously.An American official said plans for European attacks among groups operating in Pakistan were at “varying stages of maturity” and were at “a worrisome level.”The official said they involved either Western operatives trained by Al Qaeda in Pakistan or pre-existing Qaeda cells in Europe that relied on Qaeda handlers in Pakistan for guidance and support, or some combination of the two. The official said that American intelligence authorities had identified specific plotters, presumably through communications intercepts.“It appears that the concern is of a coordinated plot launched by core A.Q. leadership in Pakistan to hit soft targets in European cities,” said Juan C. Zarate, a former senior counterterrorism official in the George W. Bush administration who is a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Counterterrorism authorities are very worried, but it will be interesting to see how the media coverage impacts this.”Intelligence officials say most of the information points to plots aimed at targets in Europe, but American officials were monitoring closely any indication that the plots could include the United States. As one senior American counterterrorism official put it, “It doesn’t take much to jump across the ocean.”President Obama has received several briefings from John O. Brennan, his senior counterterrorism adviser, as well as from American intelligence officials since the Qaeda plots were first detected several weeks ago, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. Congressional committees have also been briefed on the heightened threat levels.“The president has received daily — sometimes several times daily — updates on threat information,” the senior official said. “The president directed that all threat information be shared immediately with appropriate intelligence, security and law enforcement partners, and he has specifically asked the counterterrorism community to advise him if they need anything to deal with the current terrorist threat.”In response to media coverage, James R. Clapper Jr., who became director of national intelligence last month, issued this statement on Tuesday:“We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies. As we have repeatedly said, we know A.Q. wants to attack Europe and the United States. We continue to work closely with our European allies on the threat from international terrorism, including Al Qaeda.”The German government said in a statement from the Interior Ministry that it was aware of Al Qaeda’s “long-term” aim to attack Western targets, but that “at present there are no concrete pointers to imminent attacks on Germany stemming from this.”French officials say they are mainly focused on threats from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb that stem from a separate stream of intelligence. Tensions have been high generally since the anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, and on Sept. 15, five French citizens, along with two African colleagues, were kidnapped by the Qaeda-linked group in a uranium-mining region of Niger, in central Africa, where six of them were working for French companies. The seventh hostage is married to one of the employees. The French believe the hostages are alive and being held in northwestern Mali.German intelligence officials say that some of the latest reports are related to the interrogation of a German of Afghan origin captured in Afghanistan in July. The German, said to be named Ahmed Sidiqi, 36, from Hamburg, had traveled to Waziristan, in Pakistan, and received firearms and explosives training. He told American interrogators in Afghanistan about plans for attacks by a network of small armed groups in European cities, a senior European official said.Mr. Sidiqi said some of the potential attackers might already be in Europe, according to the official, and Mr. Sidiqi mentioned the Haqqani network in Pakistan as being involved in the plot. The network is allied with the Taliban and Al Qaeda and has been a target of some recent drone attacks in Pakistan.Another French official speculated that the leak of Washington’s concerns about attacks in Europe by the Pakistani Qaeda and the Taliban was meant to justify the increasing drone attacks on targets in Pakistan, to press Pakistan to use ground troops more aggressively in the tribal areas and even to prepare the way for using American ground forces, covert or otherwise, in Pakistan.This month, the C.I.A. has escalated its bombing campaign in Pakistan using armed drones. American officials said the intense bombardment in the tribal areas was intended to keep militant groups from sending operatives across the border into Afghanistan to replenish Taliban ranks, as well as to disrupt any communications between Pakistani militants and operatives who might be placed in Europe. American officials said it was unclear what impact, if any, the drone attacks would have on a terrorism plot that might be carried out in Europe.'"
"'10-09-30,'0','Infant sleep positioners that are used to keep babies on their backs and protect them from sudden infant death syndrome have led 12 children to suffocate in the past 13 years and should no longer be used, federal officials said Wednesday.Most of the infants suffocated after rolling from a side position to a stomach position. In addition to the reported deaths, the government has received dozens of reports of infants who were placed on their backs or sides in sleep positioners, only to be found later in potentially hazardous positions within or next to the sleep positioners.The two main types of infant sleep positioners are flat mats with side bolsters or inclined mats with side bolsters.Both types of sleep positioners typically claim to help keep infants on their backs and reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, but the Food and Drug Administration has never approved these products as safe. And the government said it was unaware of any scientific studies demonstrating that infant positioners prevented death or were proven to prevent suffocation or other life-threatening harm.“To date, there is no scientifically sound evidence that infant sleep positioners prevent SIDS,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal deputy commissioner.'"
"'10-09-30,'0','The Just-Say-No-to-Sulfates movement has further caught fire among patrons of salon lines who liked results they saw from washing their hair less often and less vigorously. Two fan favorites are Pureology (which is under the L’Oréal umbrella) and DevaCurl from Devachan, the curly-hair-centric New York salons. Online, consumers trade lists of zero-sulfate shampoos that delivered for their dry, fragile or fine hair.Last week Lorraine Massey, a founder of Devachan and a longtime antisulfate evangelist, challenged women at Cafemom.com to stop using traditional shampoos. (Seventy responded, so far.) “Sodium laurel sulfate is the archenemy of the universe,” she said without a hint of levity in an interview. She argues that her sulfate-free, suds-less No Poo cleanser, which has won over curly-haired clients since 2002, can benefit manes of any texture. “It allows your scalp to regulate, and your hair to become more what nature intended,” she said.Devachan’s competitor Christo, a Greek hairstylist with a Fifth Avenue salon that specializes in curls, says he thinks that there is little evidence that sulfates , and says that stylists who believe this are brainwashed. Still, this month, even he came out with a sulfate-free shampoo for use after his in-salon keratin straightening treatment. “Some chemicals in there don’t do well with sulfates,” he explained, adding that he had clients who used regular shampoo post-treatment calling back weeks later to say their straightening never took.Not everyone, though, takes issue with sulfates. When it comes to color fading, Perry Romanowski, a cosmetic chemist who used to work in product development for , the maker of Tresemmé hair care, fingers a more common culprit. “Any time you expose hair color to water, hair swells up and some color can leak out,” he said. “But the shampoo that you use is not really going to pull color out appreciably more than anything else.”Aveda, the ecologically friendly professional line, offers four sulfate-free shampoos, including one, Scalp Benefits, introduced in 1996 — but has never labeled them as such. “We don’t call out, ‘Ohhh, sulfate free’ because when we look at the benefits that are being proclaimed for sulfate free, the connection with dry hair, the connection with color stripping, we don’t find that to be something connected to sulfate or nonsulfates,” said Pat Peterson, the vice president for product development. “You can’t pinpoint one ingredient that’s doing good or bad in your shampoo. It doesn’t make sense.”Mr. Romanowski, who writes for thebeautybrains.com, said there’s a downside for mainstream cosmetics companies touting sulfate free. “If the rest of your entire line is based on sulfates, you’re essentially undercutting all your other products with this advertising,” he said.Jennifer Disomma, the director for product development for L’Oréal Paris, said, “We do know sulfate-free shampoos are gentler on the hair fiber.” Yet the company’s Vive Pro line has shampoos that list sodium laureth sulfate as the second ingredient. Nine shampoos, in fact. In an e-mail, Ms. Disomma said, “Providing EverPure, EverStrong and VIVE Pro shampoos gives the consumer choices that meet her needs.”“Sulfates are associated with harshness,” said Paul Schiraldi, the vice president for L’Oréal Paris’s sister salon brand, L’Oréal Professionnel, which this month introduced two sulfate-free shampoos, for consumers who want less lather and a cleansing that feels “a little bit more gentle,” as he put it.But Mr. Schiraldi insisted his division’s dozen sulfate-containing shampoos won’t leach dye from hair, either. “It’s really a consumer preference rather than a defined difference on the care of the color,” he said.There is some disagreement over whether sulfate-free options can offer the robust lather that many associate with the shampoo experience. L’Oréal Paris claims to have a breakthrough technology that allows for a formulation with zero sulfates, but copious suds. “We offer the luxurious sensory experience at a price acceptable to the masses,” said Nathalie Kristo, the senior vice president for marketing. Pureology, the color-care brand, offers seven zero-sulfate frothy shampoos.Ms. Massey isn’t buying it. “If it bubbles, there’s no way it’s sulfate free,” she said, adding that the EverPure commercial featuring Ms. Longoria Parker’s sudsy mane outraged her. “She’s washing her hair and there’s all that lava, are you kidding me?” said Ms. Massey, whose latest “Curly Girl” book details her “no more shampoo” epiphany. “It’s a load of rubbish!”Some critics of sulfate-free shampoos say that they don’t properly clean the hair, leaving dull locks.One mousy blond client whom Christo saw recently hadn’t shampooed with sulfates in six months. “She was using a non-sulfate shampoo that just doesn’t clean the hair well,” he said. She complained that a colorist at another salon had done a lackluster job. Christo promised to color-correct her hair, a service that can cost $500, but instead simply washed it with his clarifying, low-sulfate shampoo called the Aqualizer, and deep-conditioned it. (It didn’t cost $500.)According to Christo, the customer then squealed: “The color looks so good! It’s worth every penny.”To which the stylist replied, “Maybe you should shampoo every once in a while.”'"
