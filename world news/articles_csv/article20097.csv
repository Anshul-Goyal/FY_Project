"'09-07-01,'1','The Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that it had granted California the right to enforce its first-in-the-nation standards controlling greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and light trucks.The move reverses a 2008 ruling by the Bush administration and effectively ends a seesaw political battle between automakers and environmental regulators that began in Sacramento eight years ago when the California Legislature first took up the issue.Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator, said in an interview that she had reversed the ruling by her predecessor, Stephen L. Johnson, because the traditional presumption had been that California, with its history of air pollution, had grounds to establish rules that exceed federal requirements.“The burden is on those that object,” Ms. Jackson said.The immediate impact of the decision, which had been widely anticipated, is more symbolic than practical. The 2009 fleet of new vehicles is already in compliance with the California rules and the 2010 fleet is also expected to meet the requirements, said Tom Cackette, deputy director of California’s Air Resources Board.“Auto manufacturers have been making changes to vehicles both because they anticipated they might have to meet California standards and because there was a general interest in public in buying more efficient cars,” Mr. Cackette said.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','The events have raised two possibilities deeply troubling to many in this city, which is home to both the state Capitol and the University of Texas. One is that two innocent men have served nine years in prison for a crime they did not commit. The other is that there might be another killer out there.“We wanted this case to be closed, but there is this gnawing sense that perhaps it wasn’t,” said Thomas Spencer, the head of an association of ministers in Austin. “We wish we had more certainty.”Some Austin residents are angry at the turn of events.“We’re stressed because they let these two guys go,” said Terry Ayers, 61, a cousin of one of the slain girls. “They totally botched this whole case.”The Travis County district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, said she was confident that her office would resolve doubts about the evidence. The new DNA evidence did not mean the confessions were false, Ms. Lehmberg said.“It doesn’t exonerate anybody,” she said. “It just leaves us with a new aspect of the case.”But, she quickly added, “We need to identify this person before we ask a jury to decide a case again.”The killings on Dec. 6, 1991, have come to be known throughout Texas as “the yogurt shop murders,” and for many here, they were a turning point for Austin, the moment when a sleepy college town became more like a big city, where brutal crimes could be committed at random for no obvious motive.The girls were attacked just after closing time at the “I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt” shop in a strip mall.Two of the girls, Jennifer Harbison and Eliza Hope Thomas, both 17, worked part-time at the shop. Ms. Harbison’s sister, Sarah, 15, was sitting at a table with a friend, Amy Ayers, 13.Before the attackers left, the four girls had been stripped, bound with their own clothing and shot in the head. At least two of the young women were sexually assaulted.The assailants piled three of the girls in a back room, covered them with Styrofoam cups, poured lighter fluid and lit a fire. The bodies were badly burned, and most of the other physical evidence was destroyed when firefighters put out the blaze.Noting evidence of rape, coroners were able to gather a small amount of material from the girls. But the only person positively identified from the DNA swabs was a boyfriend of one of the older girls. The police ruled him out as a suspect.For years, investigations went nowhere. The police chased down thousands of leads and received several false confessions.In 1999, cold-case detectives went back to interview Maurice Pierce, who had been a suspect for a brief time early on. Then one of Mr. Pierce’s friends, Mr. Scott, gave a rambling 20-hour confession in September 1999 in which he described the attack in detail. He said a teenager named Forrest Welborn had waited outside in a getaway car while he, Mr. Springsteen and Mr. Pierce had committed the crime.Within days, Mr. Springsteen gave a shorter confession in West Virginia, where he was living, confirming many details in Mr. Scott’s account, the police said. Both retracted their confessions before trial.Sgt. Ron Lara, who interrogated both men, said they had given details about the crime that had never been made public, like the position of the bodies. “There is no doubt in my mind, personally,” Sergeant Lara said of their guilt.But Carlos Garcia, a lawyer for Mr. Scott, said the police had bullied his client into confessing and fed him details of the crime. “They broke all the rules,” Mr. Garcia said.Mr. Springsteen was convicted in 2001 and sentenced to death, later reduced to life in prison. A year later, Mr. Scott was convicted and given life in prison. Both refused to testify against Mr. Welborn and Mr. Pierce; those men had never confessed and were released for want of evidence.The convictions did not stand. In 2007, an appeals court ordered new trials because the defendants had not been able to cross-examine each other about their videotaped statements, which prosecutors had introduced at trial because they had no physical evidence.In preparing for a retrial, prosecutors decided to perform a new test on samples from Miss Ayer’s body in hopes of finding evidence to bolster the case. The technology, which had not been available in 2001, was able to detect minute amounts of genetic material.But the DNA did not match any of the four suspects.“It blew up in their faces,” Joe James Sawyer, a lawyer for Mr. Springsteen, said. “They went out looking for Robert Springsteen, and the poor prosecutors ended up with the truth.”Faced with the new evidence, Judge Mike Lynch of State District Court ordered Mr. Scott and Mr. Springsteen released on bond.Ms. Lehmberg, the prosecutor, said she was reluctant to go to trial until the mystery person was identified. So far, prosecutors have tested more than 100 people, including firefighters and laboratory technicians who might have touched the evidence.Mr. Scott’s wife, Jeanine, said the authorities were grasping at straws. “They have got a sinking ship,” she said, “and they are trying to figure out how to save it.”Sergeant Lara and his cold-case squad, meanwhile, are still searching for people whom the accused men may have confided in.“There are a lot of people out there that know about this case,” Sergeant Lara said. “But they just won’t give it up.”'"
"'09-07-01,'1','In the last two years, upscale food trucks have swarmed the streets, entrancing New Yorkers with everything from artisanal Earl Grey ice cream to tacos. These highly visible trucks, their outspoken owners and their followers on , and food blogs, have broken the code of the streets that has long kept a relative peace among food vendors.Turf wars are nothing new for carts selling kebabs and cheap coffee. But the makers of thumbprint cookies, chicken-Thai basil dumplings, and crème anglaise are not happy about the sharp elbows that are part of the city’s sidewalk economy, or the murky bureaucracy that oversees the issuing of permits. (Six people were arrested on Tuesday on fraud charges related to food vending permits.)These new culinary entrepreneurs, most of them with English as their first language and little fear of police or authorities, say that they are on a mission to bring better street food to New Yorkers, and ready to bring dark corners of the business to light.“Right now the system actually favors the black market over people who want to do things right,” said Nathalie Jordi, an owner of People’s Pops, who makes frozen treats with ingredients like locally grown rhubarb and strawberries. “How can that be good for the city?”Now, having been through the hassle of getting established on the street, these vendors are determined to find gold there. Like Mr. Di Mille, who has two children to support and a six-figure to recoup, they say they can’t afford to give in to the vendors who want them to move.“If I only did business where these hot dog guys said I could do business,” said Lev Ekster, owner of the new CupcakeStop truck, “I would be vending in .”The established vendors, on the other hand, see newcomers as competitors with an unfair advantage in a desperate economy. “They think they can come in with their big fancy truck and push into a spot where I’ve been for 18 years,” said Norman Sweeney, the jewelry vendor who tried to block the Street Sweets truck Monday. He said that the strain of holding down two jobs and sleeping in his truck had caused him to “snap.” “This spot is all I have left,” he said.Since last fall, when the city’s economy turned especially rough, the trickle of new trucks has become a flood. “We used to get two or three calls a week from people wanting to become food vendors,” said Michael Wells, a director of the Street Vendor Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for vendors. “Now we get a dozen.”More variety and better street food for the people of New York might seem like an uncontroversial proposition. But new food trucks have encountered resistance from brick-and-mortar businesses; huge backlogs in the city’s licensing system; and harassment from established vendors, which, new vendors say, is increasing as the trucks attract more attention.“Absolutely the situation has deteriorated since last fall,” said Kenny Lao, an owner of the Rickshaw Dumpling Truck, who says that his life was threatened by other vendors when the truck opened for business last year. “The old vendors are edgy, and they don’t bother to figure out which one of the new trucks is which,” he said.“A new vendor used to mean someone’s cousin coming in from ,” said Zach Brooks, whose blog Midtown Lunch chronicles the sidewalk-food scene. “Now it’s a major culture clash.”The early summer has brought at least a dozen new trucks, many of them run by people with advanced degrees and white-collar backgrounds: CupcakeStop is owned by a 2009 New York Law School graduate. Cravings, a Taiwanese food truck, is the brainchild of Thomas Yang, who developed the truck’s business model before graduating from in 2008. The owners of Street Sweets both left six-figure jobs to build their business, and the Big Gay Ice Cream Truck is driven by Doug Quint, a doctoral candidate in bassoon performance at CUNY. “The whole season was canceled,” he said. “I have to get through the summer somehow.”The new truckers, knowingly or innocently, often roll right over unwritten rules about which corner belongs to whom, and when. The city, other than blocking certain streets entirely and enforcing parking regulations, does not dictate locations for food carts. But spots are virtually owned by vendors who have worked them for decades; they are handed down within families and even sold on the black market.“You can set your watch by it: park in a new spot, and within 15 minutes someone will come and check you out,” said Kim Ima, a former actress who owns the Treats Truck. Ms. Ima, one of the first upscale mobile vendors, had the tires of her truck slashed near her bakery soon after opening in 2007. “The street is like the playground when you’re a kid, and you have to learn your way around,” she said. “You have to learn where the sixth graders sit and where the dodgeball game is before you can safely sit and eat your lunch.”Vendors say that the traditional code of the streets may be effective, but that it feeds on fear, intimidation and the city’s lack of enforcement of permit rules.“It only works because everyone is a little bit in the wrong, and no one is 100 percent clean,” said Mr. Lao. “We can’t go through legal channels to resolve our disputes.” Mr. Lao was referring to the notorious black market in the food vendor permits issued by the city’s Department of Health. Most of the vendors interviewed would not talk publicly about the status of their permits. But several of them, asking not to be identified because of the dubious legality of the arrangements, said they had secured theirs by paying unauthorized “fixers” or by entering into partnerships with existing permit holders. A common form of retribution among vendors is to report one another to city authorities for permit violations.The black market, vendors say, is nourished by the city’s bureaucracy. Many, especially those for whom English is not a first language, pay brokers to navigate the system. These illegal go-betweens are common in the central depots where food vendors are required by the Health Department to park their carts and trucks.Of all the gray areas for food vendors — who are regulated by a cluster of agencies including the , the Police Department and the sales authority — permits are the murkiest. The Health Department set the number of full-time food vending permits at 3,100, in 1979. (In the fall, the will vote on a proposal that would increase the number of permits to 25,000.)The $200 permits are valid for two years and can be renewed indefinitely. Their black-market value is tremendous: up to $15,000 for two years, according to a report released Tuesday by the city’s Department of Investigation. The new vendors are openly questioning the black holes of the system. “Every day, the city is leaving thousands of dollars on the table” by not taking control of the illegal trade in permits, said Mr. Yang, of the Cravings truck.Ben van Leeuwen, whose artisanal ice cream business has expanded from one to three trucks in the last year, said that the city’s revenue from the food vendor business was “laughable” compared with the potential earnings. “I could pay as much as $5,000 a month for the summer season and still have a workable business model,” he said.Many vendors believe that vastly increasing the number of permits, and selling a percentage annually at auction, would work. Others believe that strict limits are necessary to pacify the owners of the city’s thousands of delis, bakeries, restaurants and food stores.“High-visibility trucks seem like a good thing, but there might not be room for everyone,” said Thomas DeGeest, owner of the Wafels & Dinges Belgian waffle truck, who left a spot on Hudson Street downtown on June 10 after being warned off by a building employee. “I can see the pushback from the brick-and-mortars coming a mile away.”Mr. Ekster said he encountered resistance even before his CupcakeStop truck hit the streets in June. He said he received a phone call from the publicist for the popular Crumbs Bake Shop chain pointing out that the spot where he planned to park, near the Crumbs on University Place, was illegal. (Through a spokeswoman, Jason Bauer, the bakery’s chief executive officer, said that he was providing friendly advice to a fellow baker.)“These bakeries should focus on making better cupcakes, and not on stamping out the competition,” said Mr. Ekster, who, like many vendors, loudly proclaims his belief in free-market food fights.Mr. Ekster said that before starting out in June, he wrongly believed that other street vendors would not see his fancy cupcakes as competition, but that was not the case. “When a hot dog guy sees a line in front of my truck, he thinks: ‘That’s my line,’ ” Mr. Ekster said.The notion of a tiered market for street food does not ring true to some established vendors. “If someone comes out of the building with $5 to spend, he is going to choose between my truck and another one,” said Atif Qureishi, a vendor of halal lamb in Midtown.Others have begun to see the new vendors as inevitable, and possibly lucrative. “It brings more people out on the street,” said Lotfi Mouchrak, who was working on the Steak Truck on Park Avenue last Thursday when a new truck serving burgers made from grass-fed beef parked one block away. “Different food for different people.”The troubles for Street Sweets began when diners sitting outside at Bistro Milano on West 55th Street left the restaurant, complaining of the truck’s noise. A few days later, the management of 1350 Sixth Avenue, a glossy high rise that is the landlord for Bistro Milano, called officials to pressure the couple into moving on for good. Soon the truck was surrounded by police officers, firefighters and a hazmat squad.For Mr. Di Mille, who until recently was a graphic designer earning about $200,000 a year, being treated like a vagrant was unsettling. “For 20-odd years, I was the kind of person who put on a tie and ate lunch in restaurants like that every day, and now I’m being shooed away from the curb like a low life-form,” he said. “I would not in my wildest dreams have thought it would be like this.”After the truck’s showdown with the authorities was reported on the Midtown Lunch blog, the restaurant received angry phone calls from readers. “Everybody loves the truck, but we are also a small business, with 20 families depending on us for their jobs,” said Enrico Migliaccio, a manager of the restaurant. “Because we are not a truck, we are nothing?”'"
"'09-07-01,'1','While Evans is one of the best riders, his team has needed some work. In past Tours, his teammates have often been too far behind to help him through the tough stages. Silence-Lotto hired a few good riders to help usher Evans through the Tour this year. But Bernard Kohl of Austria retroactively failed a test for the blood booster erythropoietin, or EPO, at the Tour last year where he had finished third, winning the king of the mountains jersey. And Thomas Dekker of the Netherlands, who was to be part of the team this year, failed a doping test Wednesday for EPO. More evidence of Evans’s bad luck.Carlos Sastre, a 5-foot-8, 130-pound ball of aerobic power, is often quiet and reserved, but he certainly does not blend into the peloton. He comes into the Tour as the race’s defending champion — it was his first Grand Tour victory — and is one of the most consistent riders today.Sastre, who moved to the new Cervelo Test Team this season from CSC Saxo Bank, is a pure climber. Last year his awe-inspiring ascent on Alpe d’Huez was a moment to remember. He attacked in the first mile of the 8.5-mile climb, churning his legs as he rode to the top by himself. He won by more than two minutes, enough to take the yellow jersey. Even in the subsequent time trial, where skeptics expected him to lose the overall lead to Cadel Evans, Sastre hung on to win. This time around, his competitors are bracing for a similarly spectacular effort, but he may struggle with his new team, which is much weaker .After winning the Giro d’Italia in May, Menchov did not look the least bit weary. Steady and nearly emotionless, he had just ridden more than 2,100 miles over 21 days. He was not rattled even when he crashed on the final day, skidding about 30 feet across the pavement in the time trial. When all was done, Menchov said he felt fresh and ready for more. Now, in the Tour, he is ready to prove it.Menchov is trying to become the first man since Marco Pantani of Italy in 1998 to win the Giro and the Tour in the same year. With his climbing skills and his raw talent in the time trial, he could very well do it. But questions remain. Did Menchov expend so much energy in the Giro that he will not have enough oomph for the Tour? Peaking for both races is tricky, riders say. Menchov insists, however, that he is up for it. He has won the Spanish Vuelta two times, and the Giro once. Finishing first at the Tour would give him the trifecta.Despite his youth, Schleck has enough talent to challenge more experienced riders at cycling’s biggest races. His résumé proves it. In 2007 he was the runner-up at the Giro d’Italia. In 2008 he won the best young rider jersey at the Tour, while helping Carlos Sastre win. This year he won Liège-Bastogne-Liège and was runner-up at Flèche-Wallonne. His teammates — including his older brother, Frank, and old-timers like 37-year-old Jens Voigt — are strong enough to support him when he needs it most.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','A: I’ve learned languages all my life. I’m Swedish, but I also grew up in St. Cloud, a suburb of Paris, and Cookham Dean, a London suburb where we moved when I was 10. I didn’t know a word of English then. That was a very humiliating kind of defining time for me.I knew I wanted to do my own thing full time after living and working in China as a commodity merchant, sourcing copper from Mongolia. I went to business school at Insead in France hoping, eventually, to run my own company.Q: Was it specifically your charge to take Rosetta Stone public?A: Absolutely not. From the day I started, my goal was, and still is, to change how people learn languages, make it so that anyone, regardless of where they live or their age or stage in life, can learn successfully on their own.Q: Were there any people, internally or otherwise, who resisted the I.P.O.?A: There were some worries in our product development, sales and marketing teams about being able to get things done quickly and creatively if we were subject to all kinds of regulation. Many people have this notion that as a private company you can do whatever you want — and as a public company you’re suddenly a cannibal.I asked them: How should we make sure our investors get liquidity? Should we take on new investors? For how long can we cycle in and out of that? Do you want the company to be sold to a strategic buyer with a mission and a culture that is different than ours?When they stopped to think about the I.P.O. and how it could bring resources to us, and elevate our brand, they began to see the pros and cons of staying private and going public differently.A: Ironically, the recession may have helped us in ways. For example, we had lots of people turning out for most of our investor presentations.We would show them our product, talk to them about our strong Q4 results and our 53 percent revenue growth last year. We can’t disclose how oversubscribed we were but there was very, very strong interest. It was not a highly challenged placement in the end.Q: Did you consider waiting for a healthier market?A: Without naming names, I did think about companies that went public when markets were healthier. Maybe their I.P.O. moment was really good. But in actual fact their stock now trades below the level when they went public. They have lost people a lot of money, and as a business today feel the pain of their investors.A: Net, following the I.P.O., we are cash-flow positive with no debt. This is a very strong position and balance sheet.Q: Didn’t you have a strong balance sheet before the I.P.O.?A: This is true. We were profitable for three years consecutively before the I.P.O. But there is a difference between being a company that has enough cash in the bank to pay expenses for 2 months versus 9 or 12 months. Your approach to everything changes with the capital and resources the I.P.O. brings. You can become more proactive and aggressive in your business.As a private company, your primary recourse is to go to the bank and borrow the money. You just are kind of stuck with whatever you get there. Or, these days you can deal with private funding at very discounted valuations.Entrepreneurs in that situation cannot take excess cash onto their balance sheet. So, they don’t have as strong a “risk profile” as they might have if they went public. Look at Google and how much cash they throw at projects that may or may not work. They take great risks to great results.Q: How are you going to use the money you raised?A: Adding to the offerings we have today and expanding sales internationally. We are excited about hardware trends and the potential of educational technology in general. We are working in new ways with online socialization. For the first time, there will be a way for language learners to both practice and connect with native speakers in one platform online. We’ll have a big announcement about this soon.We see our primary opportunity as growing through our own innovation. But with added financial resources we can entertain mergers and acquisitions down the line.Q: Has regulation changed the way you work day to day?A. Yes. I feel a few headaches. I have to allocate more time to talking with more investors and reporting on all aspects of the business. And I can’t always discuss products or developments I am eager for the world to know about with customers or the press.Q: Is there anything you regret about going public?A: Nothing. I know it is not in vogue to consider an I.P.O. in this day and age. But sometimes, the way to stay independent is to go public. It won’t be your own company, entirely, but you and all of your employees can own some of it, and you have held onto your mission and cultural values.A previous version of this article mistakenly referred to John Stoltzfus as the original C.E.O. of Rosetta Stone. The original C.E.O.'s name is Allen Stoltzfus.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','While use of the products in such operations has since fallen, one expert said the new report should convince doctors to stop using them in anterior cervical fusions, as the procedure is known. The use of a bioengineered protein should be “discontinued either permanently or until further information becomes available regarding how to use it safely,” said Dr. Thomas A. Einhorn, chairman of orthopedic surgery at Boston University.One form of the bioengineered protein is marketed by Medtronic under the brand name Infuse, and another form is sold by Stryker as OP-1 Putty.Infuse is also at the center of a controversy in which Army officials have accused a Medtronic consultant who was a former military doctor of falsifying data in a study about the product. Medtronic recently suspended its relationship with that doctor, Timothy R. Kuklo.Federal and state investigators are conducting separate investigations to determine whether either company illegally promoted off-label use of their products for procedures including cervical fusions. Both companies deny the accusations. Although doctors are free to use any product on the market for whatever purposes they choose, companies may promote them only for their federally approved uses.The products’ use in cervical fusion procedures is a small component of their total sales, which reached an estimated $760.3 million in 2008, with Medtronic’s share the larger one, according to Millennium Research Group, a consulting firm in Toronto.Marybeth Thorsgaard, a Medtronic spokeswoman, said the company was close to completing a clinical trial involving the use of Infuse in anterior cervical fusion. In a statement, she said the trial would help address how the procedure, if approved by federal regulators, “should be appropriately managed to minimize complications.”Some experts have speculated that the adverse effects were dose-related. Medtronic has also noted such effects in Infuse’s warning label.The study published Tuesday found that patients who had received the bioengineered proteins during spinal fusions for lower or middle back pain did not have increased complications when compared with those who did not get the product. But complications rates while patients were still in the hospital were 50 percent higher for cervical fusions procedures, researchers reported.Dr. Kevin S. Cahill, a neurosurgeon at Brigham and Women’s, who led the study released Tuesday, said he believed the complication rates for the cervical fusion procedures were actually higher than those reported in the study because complications often occurred after a patient left the hospital.“Ours is probably a bottom estimate,” Dr. Cahill said.He added that the study also confirmed how quickly physicians had adopted the proteins both for approved and unapproved uses. By 2006, just four years after such products were first sold, the proteins were used in about 25 percent of all spinal fusions, the review found.Dr. Richard A. Deyo, a spine expert who is a professor at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, said the new study also suggested that the F.D.A could do a better job monitoring problems by analyzing hospitals records, just as Dr. Cahill and his colleagues had done.The research team based its report on records collected through a database known as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, which gathers information from 20 percent of the nation’s hospitals. The high complication rate was seen in 2006 data..“I would have hoped that this sort of surveillance would be a routine part of F.D.A practice,” Dr. Deyo said.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','Anger among Chinese and Indians, the country’s main minority groups, over the ethnic preferences was perhaps the main reason that the opposition made large gains in elections last year that nearly dismantled the governing coalition led by Mr. Najib’s party, the United Malays National Organization.“We want to be fair to all communities,” Mr. Najib said in a speech in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. “No one must feel marginalized.”Mr. Najib’s success in rolling back the ethnic preferences will depend in large part on his ability to hold together his coalition and fend off a resurgent opposition led by Anwar Ibrahim, a former finance minister.Mr. Anwar, who leads a diverse group of opposition parties, has promised to undo the system of ethnic preferences.By positioning himself as a reformer, Mr. Najib, who came to power in April, appears to be calculating that he can stave off opposition advances and be seen as an agent of change.“The world is changing quickly, and we must be ready to change with it or risk being left behind,” he said Tuesday.The change would leave some ethnic preferences intact and come with caveats. But it would dilute one of the most important components of what is known as the New Economic Policy, introduced in 1971: the requirement that companies listing on the stock exchange sell 30 percent of their shares to ethnic Malays.That requirement was scrapped for companies already listed on the stock exchange and reduced to 12.5 percent for initial public offerings. The requirement will remain in place for “strategic industries” like telecommunications, water, ports and energy.Mr. Najib also said he would lower barriers for foreign investors. The government would eliminate a special vetting process for foreign companies wanting to invest in, merge or take over a Malaysian company, he said.“The global economic crisis is amplifying the need to be a preferred investment destination,” he added.Malaysia’s trade-dependent economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this year.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','That could mean that lowering CRP could prevent heart disease. Of course, it also could have been the cholesterol lowering that was protective, but many researchers argued that it was the reduction in CRP.“There certainly has been a very vocal constituency in the idea that CRP causes or contributes to the development of heart disease,” said Dr. Daniel Rader, a lipid expert at the University of Pennsylvania. He noted that some companies were trying to develop drugs to lower CRP.But Dr. Michael S. Lauer, director of the division of prevention and epidemiology at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said it might now be smart to abandon that search.“It is likely that drugs or agents that specifically target CRP are not going to work,” Dr,. Lauer said.The findings will not change current treatment. And one leading CRP researcher, Dr. Paul M. Ridker of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, director of last year’s study, called Jupiter, and the researcher most closely associated with the excitement over CRP, said the new study did not change anything for him.Dr. Ridker, an inventor of a laboratory test for CRP who profits from its use, said that while the new results did not support causality, he did not think they definitely excluded it either.Anyway, he said, it does not matter because the real issue is inflammation. CRP goes along with inflammation, and it is inflammation that is likely to be causing heart disease, Dr. Ridker said.The thought is that white blood cells invade artery walls and release damaging chemicals, leading to plaque formation.The new study, by Dr. Paul Elliott of Imperial College in London and 35 co-authors, used a recently developed technique that can get answers quickly about causality. Without it, the only method was what is seen as the gold standard in medicine: large clinical trials in which people are randomly assigned to take a drug, or not, and followed for years.The new method, Mendelian randomization, “is changing the way we think about causality,” Dr. Lauer said. It only recently became feasible as researchers found genetic variants associated with proteins like CRP and developed tools to analyze data from what was, in this case, more than 100,000 people.Different people produce different amounts of CRP, and the amount a person produces is determined by tiny inherited changes in the CRP gene. So in a population, there are people who just happen to produce more CRP throughout their lives and others who just happen to produce less. If CRP causes heart disease, those who make more would have more heart disease. That, however, is not what the study found.“There was no association” between CRP genes and heart disease rates, Dr. Elliott said.The association between CRP and heart disease must be reflecting something else. For example, if CRP levels go up when heart disease begins, because of inflammation in arteries, CRP levels would be higher in people with incipient heart disease. But CRP itself would be playing no role in heart disease risk; it was just marker of inflammation.A smaller study of CRP, using the same method and published last October in The New England Journal of Medicine, came to the same conclusion.But this second, larger, study was needed to convince heart experts, said Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital.“It’s a very important question particularly in the context of the Jupiter trial,” Dr. Kathiresan said.Dr. Rader, at Penn, said he still did CRP tests on selected patients and expected to continue. An elevated CRP level indicates increased risk, even if the protein does not cause the risk. Dr. Rader tests CRP to help decide whether to give a statin to patients with normal cholesterol but with a family history of heart disease. A high CRP, he said, could tip the balance, leading him to prescribe a statin.Dr. Altshuler noted that part of the power of a Mendelian randomization study was that it could stop a hypothesis from prematurely becoming viewed as fact.Ordinarily, science starts with an observation, like the one associating CRP with heart disease. That generates a hypothesis — that CRP causes heart disease. Then comes a trial, if there is a treatment, like a drug to specifically attack CRP, that people can be randomly chosen to take or not.But it can be years or decades before the clinical trials are completed. In the meantime, Dr. Altshuler said, the hypothesis comes to be regarded as true.And if the clinical trial contradicts the hypothesis, “some people are unwilling to question their beliefs, even if there was no evidence of causality to begin with,” Dr. Altshuler said.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','The other numbers confirmed what was suspected: Though her first-serve percentage was less than 50 percent, Williams served nine aces and no double faults. She had 26 winners and only 7 unforced errors, a remarkable ratio for a big-swinging player who has power to spare but does not like to spare it.“She really showed the unbeatable Serena today, I guess,” said Azarenka, a 19-year-old Belarussian who has been on the rise this season and who had routed Serena in the final in Miami in April.But that was on a hardcourt with Serena sustaining a flare-up of the chronic knee pain that has caused her more worry than most of her opponents over the years. This time, she started and finished strong — marking her territory by chasing down drop shots and hitting forehand winners on the stretch against a fine athlete who has no fear of high-velocity rallies.“I really wanted to do well today,” the second-seeded Serena said. “I didn’t do well the last time we played. I was not feeling great, and I felt like I really wanted to show up today.”Thursday’s semifinals will be Williams-Russian affairs. The third-seeded Venus will face No. 1 Dinara Safina, who defeated the German Sabine Lisicki, 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-1, in an edgy match littered with errors and shrieks of frustration from Safina.Serena will face No. 4 seed Elena Dementieva, who defeated the unseeded Italian veteran Francesca Schiavone, 6-2, 6-2.Despite the tape on Venus’s sore left knee, the sisters are also thriving in doubles. They reached the quarterfinals on Monday, winning, 6-0, 6-0, against the Chinese twosome of Zheng Jie and Yan Zi, who beat the Williamses in Australia last year.Dementieva, a Muscovite, has looked at home on the lawns this year. Like the Williamses, she has not lost a set and has not been pushed to a tie breaker.Once hampered on grass by her unreliable serve, Dementieva has worked hard to address that weakness and reached the semifinals last year, losing to Venus in straight sets.She then went on to win the Olympic gold medal, which looked as if it might soothe her persistent self-doubt and propel her to greater success. She started the year in ferocious fashion by winning in Auckland, New Zealand, and Sydney, Australia.But Serena stopped her run in the semifinals of the Australian Open, and Dementieva has yet to win another tournament. She looks fit and focused, however, and has been training hard on the grass with the help of the former touring professional Andrei Cherkasov, even though her mother, Vera, remains her primary coach.“I know it surprised a lot of people that I’m still working hard and trying to improve my game,” the 27-year-old Dementieva said. “But this is what is so interesting for me about tennis, that I’m still trying to learn a lot about my game, and I feel very open to change something in my game.”Safina, still looking for a Grand Slam singles title, has already had her best Wimbledon result. Never past the third round in six previous visits, she has matched her older brother Marat Safin’s best performance here by reaching the semifinals.Safina double-faulted to start the first set and lose the first set, receiving a code violation for racket abuse after flinging her instrument of self-torture to the grass. She finished with 15 double faults, but Lisicki’s inconsistency and the quality of Safina’s returns, particularly her backhand return, ultimately made the difference in this deflating match.Safina will have to be better, much better, to stop Venus Williams’s 19-match winning streak at the All England Club. Safina won their most recent match, in the semifinals in Rome this year. But that was on clay, not the grass that continues to bring out the champion in Venus.“When I go out there, I’m going to, of course, feel like I want to make it happen on my side of the net,” Venus said. “She has the top ranking, but I have more the experience in this tournament and more success.”'"

"'09-07-01,'1','The industry’s heated reaction presages an intense lobbying battle that is already beginning. Opponents include JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo as well as thousands of regional and local banks that have close ties to lawmakers in every part of the country. But the opposition could also include countless mortgage lenders and independent mortgage brokers.House and Senate Democrats, as well as many consumer groups, strongly support the proposal. The House Financial Services Committee hopes to complete work on a bill by the end of July, and House Democrats hope to send the measure to the Senate in September.“I’m very much in favor of it,” said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “Anyone who thinks we’re not going to create this agency is mistaken. The American public wants it.”Bank executives said they knew they faced a difficult political fight, given the soaring number of homeowners facing foreclosure.“We know the optics are bad,” said Scott Talbott, vice president for government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable, a trade association in Washington. “If you are against a consumer regulatory agency, then everybody will say you’re against consumer regulation.”The proposal would strip away all the consumer responsibilities that are currently assigned to existing bank regulators, like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Comptroller of the Currency.It would give the new agency marching orders to set standards for traditional mortgages, and the agency would have the authority to demand that lenders offer those kinds of loans or give consumers the chance to opt out of riskier products.It would also give the new agency the power to restrict or prohibit mortgages that come with hidden fees and steep penalties for borrowers who pay the loan off early. It would also be empowered to interpret and enforce the new credit card law that Congress passed last month, aimed at restricting banks from arbitrarily raising interest rates.It would also have examiners, much like existing bank regulatory agencies, who would have the authority to go into specific institutions, issue subpoenas and scrutinize their practices, demand changes and seek penalties.Administration officials said the proposal would create a “level playing field” and provide the same regulation for particular consumer products regardless of what kind of financial institution was selling them.By contrast, existing regulators have authority over only particular kinds of financial institutions. The office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks, while the Fed supervises bank holding companies.“The agency will be able to get to the root of the mortgage crisis that we saw in the past,” said Michael Barr, assistant Treasury secretary for financial institutions. “It will be able to go in to examine, supervise the operations of previously unregulated parts of the sector.”The plan’s supporters, which includes consumer groups, argue that a dedicated, standalone agency is crucial to reining in risky and deceptive financial practices.“It’s obvious from the history of the last 20 years that the regulators never understood that protecting consumers is also a way of ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions,” said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.Administration officials acknowledged that their proposal would give the new agency broader powers than bank regulators have under existing laws.But they said the proposal included safeguards to prevent overzealous restrictions that stifle innovation and limit consumer choice. The agency’s mandate would include supporting growth and innovation, and it would be required to consider the costs of proposed regulations to both consumers and to financial institutions.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','NEW DELHI — Even Snapple, an American iced tea maker with a homespun image, is outsourcing work to an Indian company. But in a twist, the deal may increase jobs in the United States.The Dr Pepper Snapple Group said on Tuesday that it had signed a five-year contract with HCL Technologies, a major information technology and outsourcing company in Noida, India. HCL will manage Snapple’s computer networks — but may be hiring in the United States to do it.HCL said that Dr Pepper Snapple would be its “anchor service desk customer” in an operation in Raleigh, N.C., that would eventually employ 500. With the new deal, HCL is continuing to “bring on new staff at our new facility in North Carolina,” Shami Khorana, president of HCL America, said in a statement.Indian Informational technology and outsourcing companies have been increasing their use of so-called onshoring, or putting jobs in a client’s home market, as political pressures build to increase jobs in countries hard hit by the slowdown.The practice is being directly promoted in some markets. The Australia Computer Society, a trade group, said this month that it was trying to help its members win back work that had gone overseas.HCL said in last August that it would invest $3.2 million to open a North Carolina facility. At that time the company employed 3,000 workers in the United States and also had operations in China, Ireland and Poland. HCL employs more than 60,000 worldwide, most of them in India.Other information technology companies, like Tata Consultancy Services, have set up overseas operations. TCS, as it is known, now employs about 12,000 foreigners, according to the company’s latest annual report.'"
"'09-07-01,'1','In a hint of hope for the country’s struggling housing market, home prices did not fall as fast in April as they did in previous months, according to figures released Tuesday.Home prices continued to fall as unemployment rose and new foreclosures hit the market. But the pace of declines, which had been accelerating, leveled off slightly, according to the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Home Price Index, a closely watched yardstick of the market.“This is a real relief,” Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a research note. “With sales volumes now stable and likely to rise a bit over the next few months, we think sustained slower price falls are a decent bet.”In April, home prices in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.1 percent from a year ago. Although that is a stark drop from April 2008 (when prices were already 15 percent below their April 2007 levels), it is milder than the 19 percent decline recorded in January.“It echoes parts of the larger economy,” said David M. Blitzer, index chairman at Standard & Poor’s. “The stock market bottomed in March and started to go up. Consumer sentiment numbers have gotten better as well. There’s a little pickup in the way people view the financial world, and it’s beginning to show up in housing.”'"
"'09-07-01,'1','Yet by almost any measure, the second quarter was one for the record books. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 15.2 percent in the second quarter. The Dow Jones industrials gained 11 percent in the quarter, while the Nasdaq composite index soared 20 percent.Many blue-chip stocks posted spectacular gains. Bank of America soared 94 percent. American Express gained 71 percent. Microsoft was up 29 percent.But some analysts sense the euphoria is tempered. Markets ended basically flat for the month of June, pulled in different directions by economic figures showing improvement and those revealing unexpected weakness.Trading on Tuesday underscored those wobbles. The Dow Jones average fell 82.38 points, or 0.97 percent, to 8,447. The broader S.& P. 500 slid 7.91 points, or 0.85 percent, to 919.32. Gains in some technology shares kept losses on the Nasdaq to 9.02 points, or 0.49 percent. It declined to 1,835.04.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 14/32, to 96 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose 3.53 percent, from 3.48 percent Monday.Bullish forecasters say the S.& P. 500, which is up 1.8 percent for 2009, will continue to rise as the economy bottoms out, and close the year at 1,050 or 1,100. But bears say that taxpayer aid is still holding up the financial system, and they warn that investors who expect better returns may be in for a bitter disappointment.“We feel like we’re entitled to go back up again,” said David Tice, a prominent Wall Street bear. “We went from the telecom bubble to the Internet bubble to the corporate finance bubble to the real estate bubble. Now each of those has broken. We have never been more convinced that the worst is not yet over.”Some analysts say that stocks may simply rise and fall fitfully in the months — or years — to come without making broader progress, as they did from the mid-1960s to the mid-’70s. And they say that investors who once bought and held stocks or pieces of index funds and rode them higher will need to devise different investment strategies.“The market is going to be range-bound for this year and going into next year,” said Mary Ann Bartels, head of technical and market analysis at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. “Is the market still investable? Our answer is yes.”Some investors say energy companies and basic-materials producers will lead the markets as commodity prices rise. Others like technology firms, emerging markets or any company that offers a dividend and is not steeped in debt.Unemployment is at 9.4 percent, and economists expect it will rise to 9.6 percent when the Labor Department releases its June employment figures on Thursday. Private wages and salaries are continuing to fall, and Americans are saving more money as they try to hedge against job losses.All of which, say some analysts, could mean slower growth in consumer spending, corporate earnings and stock prices in the months to come.“We’d all like our stocks to go up,” said Mr. Tice, the bear. “But now’s the time to defend ourselves.”Following are the results of Tuesday’s Treasury auction of four-week and 52-week bills:'"
"'09-07-01,'1','Japan’s rescue plan comes during its worst recession since World War II. On Tuesday, the government said Japan’s unemployment rate rose 0.2 percentage points, to 5.2 percent, in May, the highest level in nearly six years.The Japanese economy has contracted for 12 consecutive months, despite government efforts to bolster growth with stimulus spending. Weak domestic demand and a dwindling population mean that recovery remains at the mercy of its struggling exporters, concentrated in autos and electronics.As a maker of DRAM chips, which are used in PCs, Elpida is seen as especially important to the country’s electronics industry. Japanese officials fear that Elpida’s demise would force domestic manufacturers to rely on overseas rivals like Samsung Electronics of South Korea, the market leader.Elpida is reeling amid a collapse in demand and an oversupply in chips that has caused prices to plummet. It suffered a loss of 179 billion yen in the year to March, after a 24 billion yen shortfall a year earlier. Weaker players, like Spansion of the United States and Qimonda of Germany, filed for bankruptcy protection earlier this year.“Elpida is Japan’s only DRAM maker, and it has been hit by extremely severe conditions amid the global economic slump, despite its superior technology,” the trade minister, Toshihiro Nikai, said Tuesday. “Securing a supply of DRAM is very important for Japan’s industry and livelihood.”Elpida’s aid package of 160 billion yen includes 40 billion yen in public funds and loans from the state-run Development Bank of Japan, and 100 billion yen in loans from private banks, according to a statement by the trade ministry.Taiwan Memory, a chip maker set up by the Taiwan government to reorganize the island’s own struggling chip sector, will also invest 20 billion yen in Elpida, the ministry said. Taiwan Memory had recently announced it would partner with Elpida to develop memory chips for cellphones.Elpida’s bailout is the first under an emergency measure that makes public money available to businesses hurt in the global economic crisis, part of the economic stimulus plans championed by Prime Minister Taro Aso. Companies that accept public money are required to develop strategies to turn around their businesses in three years.Elpida will use the bailout to invest in cutting-edge technologies, the company’s chief executive, Yukio Sakamoto, said.“In the competitive DRAM industry, companies without the capacity to invest are sure to lose out,” Mr. Sakamoto told reporters after the rescue package was announced. The challenge for Japan is how to handle companies seeking public funding that are shouldered with woes that go beyond the financial crisis.Another company, Pioneer, a long-struggling electronics maker, is expected to seek billions of yen in aid, for example. Excessive government intervention “hampers necessary consolidation and industry shake-out, sapping the nation’s industrial vigor,” Nikkei, Japan’s largest business daily, wrote in a recent editorial. “The government fosters moral hazard if it extends a helping hand too readily.”'"
"'09-07-01,'1','Twenty-nine civilians, including eight children, were killed in what appeared to be six missile strikes by Israeli drones in Gaza in December and January, according to a report released Tuesday by Human Rights Watch. The group questioned whether Israeli forces had taken “all feasible precautions” to avoid civilian casualties.Israel’s military has never acknowledged using the remotely piloted planes to fire missiles. In a statement released Tuesday, it said that it had used an assortment of weapons and technologies to minimize the risk to Palestinian civilians.Lt. Col. Avital Leibovich, a spokeswoman for the Israeli military, said Israeli forces had also gone to extraordinary lengths to warn civilians during the Gaza offensive, and she questioned the credibility of some of the Palestinian witnesses cited by the advocacy group.The report, based on interviews with witnesses to the attacks and an examination of the missile debris, represented the latest in a series of accusations about Israel’s conduct of the Gaza war. And it raised broader concerns about how carefully drones were being used, much like the complaints that the Central Intelligence Agency has encountered in its use of drones to attack suspected members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Pakistan.The report was partly written by Marc Garlasco, the senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch, a New York-based group, who was a weapons-targeting official at the Pentagon from 1997 to 2003.Mr. Garlasco has praised the American military’s use of drones in Iraq and Afghanistan, saying that their ability to hover over a target for many hours had improved the accuracy of many missile attacks and limited civilian casualties.The group’s findings in Gaza suggest that “the weapon itself isn’t the problem,” he said in an interview. “It’s the way it’s used that is.”He added: “The operators have the ability to distinguish between combatants and civilians and can even divert the missiles after launch. So it’s hard to understand how the Israelis did such a poor job of targeting.”Israel has said that it uses drones to gather intelligence and to help provide target information for helicopters and other aircraft. But Mr. Garlasco said the missile impact marks and the highly fragmented debris in the six attacks matched the smaller missiles typically used by drones rather than the larger antitank missiles that Israeli helicopters were seen carrying in Gaza.The report said one missile had hit a group of university students waiting for a bus in the center of Gaza City, while another struck a truck hauling oxygen tanks and a third smashed into a school sheltering people who had lost or left their homes.In three other attacks, the report said, the victims were six children, ages 10 to 15, who had been playing on residential rooftops. Muhammad al-Habbash, the father of one of the girls who was killed, told Human Rights Watch that some of the children had been feeding chickens that the family kept on the roof when the missile struck.At another house, Nahla Allaw said her son’s legs had been crushed and blood poured from small holes in his chest as he died.While fighters from Hamas, the militant Palestinian faction that controls Gaza, often placed artillery spotters on rooftops, the group found no evidence of militants in the area at the time of the attacks, the report said.When asked about the rooftop attacks, Colonel Leibovich, the Israeli military spokeswoman, said, “This is the first time I am hearing of these specific incidents.”Israel has said that over all, 1,166 people were killed in the Gaza offensive. Of those, 295 were noncombatants, 709 were Hamas fighters and 162 were men whose affiliations could not be identified, Israeli officials have said. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights in Gaza has said 1,417 people were killed, including 926 civilians.The Israeli military has conducted internal investigations into its conduct during the 22-day war, which determined it had operated in accordance with international law. The United Nations Human Rights Council is conducting an investigation into allegations of war crimes by Israel and Hamas.After the attack on the truck, the Israel Defense Forces released video of the event, contending that they had killed men who were loading rockets. The military later acknowledged that the cylinders on the truck were oxygen tanks, though it also said they could have been used in rocket production.Colonel Leibovich said few military forces had ever taken as many precautions to minimize civilian casualties as Israel did in Gaza, dropping 500,000 leaflets warning people that its forces were arriving and even making telephone calls to neighbors of those thought to be Hamas fighters.“There were also numerous cases where pilots had to reverse the missiles because they saw civilians enter the area,” she said.P. W. Singer, the author of a recent book on military robots called “Wired for War,” said Israel might also be finding that using the drones “certainly raises the bar of expectations.”“Because you can target more precisely, people hold you to a higher standard,” he said.'"

"'09-07-01,'1','Anger among Chinese and Indians, the country’s main minority groups, over the ethnic preferences was perhaps the main reason that the opposition made large gains in elections last year that nearly dismantled the governing coalition led by Mr. Najib’s party, the United Malays National Organization.“We want to be fair to all communities,” Mr. Najib said in a speech in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. “No one must feel marginalized.”Mr. Najib’s success in rolling back the ethnic preferences will depend in large part on his ability to hold together his coalition and fend off a resurgent opposition led by Anwar Ibrahim, a former finance minister.Mr. Anwar, who leads a diverse group of opposition parties, has promised to undo the system of ethnic preferences.By positioning himself as a reformer, Mr. Najib, who came to power in April, appears to be calculating that he can stave off opposition advances and be seen as an agent of change.“The world is changing quickly, and we must be ready to change with it or risk being left behind,” he said Tuesday.The change would leave some ethnic preferences intact and come with caveats. But it would dilute one of the most important components of what is known as the New Economic Policy, introduced in 1971: the requirement that companies listing on the stock exchange sell 30 percent of their shares to ethnic Malays.That requirement was scrapped for companies already listed on the stock exchange and reduced to 12.5 percent for initial public offerings. The requirement will remain in place for “strategic industries” like telecommunications, water, ports and energy.Mr. Najib also said he would lower barriers for foreign investors. The government would eliminate a special vetting process for foreign companies wanting to invest in, merge or take over a Malaysian company, he said.“The global economic crisis is amplifying the need to be a preferred investment destination,” he added.Malaysia’s trade-dependent economy is expected to contract by 5 percent this year.'"

"'09-07-02,'0','Much of “Lion’s Den,” the Argentine director Pablo Trapero’s sprawling, unpredictable drama about a woman who gives birth in prison while awaiting trial for murder, was filmed inside maximum-security lockups in the province of Buenos Aires using real inmates and staff members as extras. Let me emphasize, however, that “Lion’s Den” repeatedly confounds expectations about its being a typical women’s prison movie fraught with the usual overtones of lesbian sadism and caged-heat prurience.One of the more admired films at last year’s Cannes International Film Festival, “Lion’s Den” is neither an exposé of harsh prison conditions nor a weepy melodrama about a wrongly accused innocent redeemed by last-minute revelations of the truth. When first seen, the heroine, Julia Zarate (Martina Gusman, the director’s wife), appears to be a sullen, bleached-blond sybarite who awakens fully clothed one morning in a state of shock, covered with blood, and her apartment trashed.After showering quickly she takes the train to work. It is only upon returning that she discovers the body of her live-in boyfriend, Nahuel, killed with a knife, and the wounded Ramiro (Rodrigo Santoro), Nahuel’s boyfriend, whom she later says Nahuel brought to live with them. No sooner has Julia taken in the carnage than the police burst in and arrest her on suspicion of murder. Examined in prison, she is found to be pregnant but can’t say for sure which one is the father, although she guesses it is Nahuel.If “Lion’s Den” were a Hollywood film, the identity of the father of her baby, Tomás, would be determined, and flashbacks would reveal exactly what happened on a night of violence that Julia insists she can hardly recall. (Ramiro, who recovers from his knife wounds, gives an account that contradicts her incomplete, carefully rehearsed story and drives her ballistic with rage at his lies.)Instead of raking over the past, the movie observes Julia’s personal growth during several years spent in a maternity cellblock. From a smoldering antisocial depressive she evolves into a popular, defiant inmate for whom motherhood gives purpose to a previously aimless existence.'"

"'09-07-02,'0','“The market took a nose dive and business virtually stopped in September,” said Dorothy Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. “Now you are seeing people at least spending money again. I am not saying it is a different world; buyers are still looking for value.”The reports issued by the major brokerage firms show that the steepest declines in sales and prices occurred in the largest and most expensive apartments, where banks are requiring large down payments from buyers seeking mortgages. Sales were also off sharply in new condominium developments, which have been hit hard in the economic downturn. Mr. Miller put the decline in sales of new condos at 61.7 percent.The strongest activity was reported in smaller, less expensive apartments, often bought by renters buying their first homes. They benefited by low mortgage rates available for loans that conform to federal guidelines, and a federal tax credit available to many first-time home buyers.The lag in time between the time a contract is signed and the time a deal closes is unusually long in Manhattan because many sales cannot close until a buyer is approved by a co-op board, or a sale is reviewed by a condominium board. Many of the sales reported in contract in the last few weeks will not close until later in the summer or the fall.The Brown Harris Stevens report found that sales of trophy apartments had shriveled during the downturn, with sales of co-ops costing more than $10 million off by 82 percent from the same period a year ago. This contributed to a sharp weakening in average prices of all co-ops, off 29 percent to $918,795, the report found.But sales of these larger co-ops have picked up along with the rest of the market. “As 2009 has progressed we have continued to see a significant increase in activity and sales each month,” said Hall F. Willkie, president of Brown Harris Stevens.A number of statistics supported this view. The inventory of apartments on the market, and the number of days an apartment lingered on the market before it sold, were up sharply from a year ago, but down a bit from the first quarter as the market strengthened. Streeteasy.com, a real estate Web site, said that 2,477 apartments went into contract during the second quarter, an 82 percent increase from activity in the first quarter.Still, there was very little optimism that sale prices would strengthen significantly from their current level. Pamela Liebman, the chief executive at the Corcoran Group, said she expected prices to stabilize and then perhaps rise “a couple of points” a year. Sellers are better off selling now than waiting, she said.“If I were a seller, I would take the risk out of the calculation,” she said. “Time does not necessarily equate to money here for the seller.”Mr. Miller said that at best, the market would move sideways. “We will probably get a little worse before it is going to get better,” he said, “because unemployment is likely to continue to rise after the recession ends this year.”But Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said the economic outlook in New York had improved, with unemployment, so far, remaining below the national rate. “A lot of things are bottoming out,” he said.'"
"'09-07-02,'0','Nicholas D. Kristof rightly draws attention to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the “glacial pace” at which the Environmental Protection Agency’s screening program is moving (“It’s Time to Learn From Frogs,” column, June 28), but this is only one of the many problems with the program.The chemicals the E.P.A. is planning to test, mostly pesticides, have already been thoroughly characterized for toxicity, including effects on reproduction. Despite this, more than 80,000 animals could be killed to test just the first 67 chemicals — even though these animal tests, developed in the ’30s and ’40s, are so inexact they will yield data difficult to interpret. This will only delay regulatory action.To effectively regulate endocrine-disrupting chemicals, testing must be modernized to include nonanimal tests that reveal biological mechanisms, and the laws must be changed so that chemicals with known toxicities can more easily be removed from our environment.Catherine WillettScience Policy Adviser, People for the Ethical Treatment of AnimalsNorfolk, Va., June 29, 2009'"
"'09-07-02,'0','Neither Curry’s agent, Leon Rose, nor his Chicago-based lawyer, Kelly Saindon, would comment on the lawsuit.The lawsuit identified Carter as Curry’s former agent and business manager and stated that he handled all of Curry’s “financial and business affairs” and “owed a fiduciary duty” to Curry. Carter “maintained all of the books and records” for Curry during the time of his employment, the suit states.Curry and his lawyers have made “multiple demands for an accounting from defendant,” according to the suit. Although Carter has produced some of the requested documents, he “has failed and refused and continues to fail and refuse to provide a thorough accounting and all of the records demanded.”Curry has been dogged by financial problems and has been sued at least five times in the last 18 months for failing to pay for goods and services. Most of the cases have been settled or dismissed. But Curry was dealt another blow this week, when a bank began foreclosure proceedings on his suburban Chicago home. According to court papers, Curry is behind on $217,502 in payments on a $3.7 million mortgage.In another sign of financial distress, Curry asked the Knicks last fall for a substantial advance on his $9.7 million salary. According to The Daily News, which first reported the story in January, Curry was granted $2 million after asking for an $8 million advance. A person briefed on the matter confirmed the basic parameters of the story but said that the figures were significantly lower. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of privacy rules regarding player salaries.Curry employed Carter and Darren White as his agents while he played for the Chicago Bulls. He hired Rose, one of the N.B.A.’s most powerful agents, in October 2005, when he joined the Knicks. Carter, who ran his own small agency, continued to work as a co-agent and business manager, but he worked independently of Rose, who works for Creative Artists Agency. Rose, who is based in Philadelphia, has a client stable that includes LeBron James, Allen Iverson and Richard Hamilton.Neither Carter nor White represents any current N.B.A. players.White, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, declined to comment when reached by telephone.“I don’t know anything about that,” he said.'"

Kaplan of Federal District Court, to order the government to preserve any sites where their client was held. They noted that the C.I.A. has said that it no longer operates detention facilities or black sites, and is planning to decommission them.“The concern,” the lawyers said in court papers filed this week, “is that by the time the defendant’s team obtains the necessary security clearances, the C.I.A. black sites will have been ‘decommissioned’ or destroyed.”'"
"'09-07-02,'0','The reasons are a combination of lower trading profits than its rivals and higher charges. Those charges include $892 million the bank incurred when it joined its Wall Street brethren in repaying taxpayer support. Much more is likely to be caused by an accounting rule that requires banks to book losses on improvements in credit spreads, which act as an indication of investor confidence in the creditworthiness of a bank.Now that the financial system is healing, Morgan Stanley and others must record losses as their credit spreads improve because they are deemed more likely to pay off all their debt. That charge at Morgan may be as high as $1.8 billion this quarter, according to Howard Chen, an analyst at Credit Suisse, who wrote in a report this week that Morgan has $4.1 billion in possible charges in future quarters related to its credit spreads alone.Morgan will not be the only one to take charges related to its credit spreads. Goldman, its perennial rival, is also expected to take such a charge. But analysts say they think that Goldman will still make a profit because its charge will be smaller than Morgan’s and its revenue higher.Mr. Chen, for instance, estimates that Morgan’s charge for credit spreads will be $1.8 billion, compared to $400 million for Goldman.Yet the improvement in credit spreads, while costly to earnings, are a “positive signs for franchise health,” Mr. Chen said, because it signals the market has more faith in the bank’s creditworthiness.Morgan can cover its losses in part because it raised billions in equity just before it returned the bailout money. The company’s executives have described 2009 as a transition year and cautioned against expectations for high profits. There are also likely to be bright spots in Morgan’s results in parts of investment banking, where Morgan is at the top of league tables for equity underwriting and merger and acquisition deals, according to Dealogic.And over the long term, Morgan Stanley’s decision to pare risk and expand its footprint in wealth management may remake the company and to produce long-term, stable profits. Morgan executives acknowledge they have been cautious in areas like fixed income.But reducing risk can also cut into profits. Mr. Chen estimated that Morgan Stanley would generate $2.3 billion in fixed-income revenue before write-downs. By contrast, he expects Goldman to generate $6.8 billion.“The rest of the market is going to be booking extremely good fixed-income numbers,” said Brad Hintz, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “If Morgan Stanley doesn’t book good fixed-income numbers, it tells investors that Morgan is really holding the reins on their traders.”But the expected second-quarter loss at Morgan may surprise those who saw good days ahead in the bank’s eagerness to repay the government.“The intuition was that the losses are behind these companies,” said Douglas Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. “I’m a little surprised that Morgan Stanley would lose money. Among folks in Washington, they seem to have decided that the losses are over.”Of the 10 large banks that returned the bailout money, Morgan is one of just two that analysts expect to lose money in the quarter, according to Thomson.The other is Capital One, a regional lender in Virginia with a large credit card book that analysts expect to lose $205 million, or 48 cents a share. A spokeswoman for Capital One declined to comment, but the bank’s executives have said they expect to incur consumer credit losses for quite some time.There is no indication that Capital One or Morgan Stanley will have to return to the government trough. The government’s stress tests and decisions about how they could repay the bailout money were centered on the banks’ capital levels, not the likelihood that they would profit.“The government has determined they can stand on their own, that they can sustain their losses on their own without the government money,” said George Allayannis, a professor at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia.'"
"'09-07-02,'0','Private equity firms can tap into huge pools of capital and they have been yearning to buy banks at bargain prices.Federal regulators have allowed private equity investors to buy a handful of failing banks, notably the BankUnited Financial Corporation in Florida and IndyMac Bancorp in California.But the approvals have been made slowly, and on a case-by-case basis. Agency officials said the rules to be adopted on Thursday amounted to a clarification of their policy rather than a drastic change.Indeed, industry executives said on Wednesday evening that they were not sure if the new rules amounted to an easing or a tightening of longstanding restrictions that have kept most private equity investors out of the banking industry.Among the rules under discussion, according to industry executives and government officials, are higher capital requirements for private equity investors than for traditional banks. The agency will also demand that private equity firms document their sources of strength, a reference to their ability to provide follow-up financing.For investors that own several banks, the agency would require cross guarantees in which a strong bank owned by an investment group could be enlisted to shore up the capital of a weaker bank owned by the same group.Last but not least, the agency plans to include rules against flipping, to prohibit people from buying a bank and reselling it a few months later. Under the new rules, private equity firms would have to retain their investment in a bank for at least 18 months and possibly two years.H. Rodgin Cohen, a lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell who represents some private equity firms, said he was not sure whether the new rules would speed up or slow down their investment in banks.“It’s always good to have an element of certainty,” Mr. Cohen said. “The question is whether this will put up barriers that are so discouraging economically that it will actually restrict private equity firms. We won’t know until the details are out.”Regardless of the details, the new rules are not expected to change the main regulatory obstacle for private equity firms buying banks. That obstacle is the Federal Reserve, which requires that institutions holding more than 24.9 percent of a bank’s voting shares be subject to regulation as bank holding companies.Except for a handful of private equity firms that specialize in banks, most firms are loath to fall under those regulations.To get around those restrictions, private equity firms have teamed up to form “club” deals in which no individual firm exceeds the Fed’s threshold for control. But that arrangement is often unwieldy and cumbersome, because none of the investment firms is supposed to be in “control.”“The F.D.I.C. does not control what happens,” said Joshua Siegel, managing principal at StoneCastle Partners, a private equity firm in New York. “The Fed is in charge.”'"

"'09-07-02,'0','Crabtree & Evelyn, the purveyor of specialty soaps, fragrances and lotions, became the latest retailer to fall victim to the economic downturn, filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday in the United States.The company, a unit of Crabtree & Evelyn Holdings in Britain, said it would continue to operate its stores and would honor gift cards and returns as it reorganizes under bankruptcy protection.The company said it would close some stores and try to renegotiate leases for others. It currently operates 126 stores in 34 states and employs about 950 people.In a court filing, Crabtree & Evelyn’s acting president, Stephen Bestwick, said a decline in the housing market and tightening of credit had reduced consumer discretionary spending, especially in shopping malls where many of its stores were located.He also said management changes at the company resulted in strategy shifts, including lower sales to wholesale accounts and a “disconnect” between executive pay and performance.The retailer expects to lose $13.3 million on revenue of about $100 million in the current fiscal year, compared with a loss of $8 million on revenue of $107.5 million in the year that ended Sept. 30, 2008.Crabtree & Evelyn has $10 million to $50 million of both assets and debts, a court filing said.

"'09-07-02,'0','The last three major titles at the fourth European Open Championships in San Remo, Italy, were decided on Saturday afternoon. The Women’s Pairs was won by Martine Verbeek and Wietske van Zwol from the Netherlands. The Open Pairs went to Bjorn Fallenius and Peter Fredin from Sweden (although Fallenius has lived in New York City for many years). And the Senior Pairs was captured by Amedeo Comella from Italy and Jacek Romanski from Poland.In a long pair event it usually pays not to have great games early. Better to save your best for the late rounds. The winners of the Open Pairs did exactly that, starting the four-session final with a 41 percent game, but progressively improving and only taking the lead during the last session.Fallenius and Fredin scored well in the diagramed deal.North and South were using the Precision Club system, in which a one-club opening shows 16 points or more. Other one-of-a-suit openings promise 11-15 points. Hence South’s aggressive one-diamond bid. Fallenius (West) overcalled one no-trump, showing a good 15 to 18 high-card points. Fredin (East) transferred to spades. Then North came to life with two no-trump, which asked his partner to choose a minor suit.When South bid three diamonds, East made an aggressive match-point penalty double. He expected his side to score plus 110 in two spades. If three diamonds was going down one, plus 100 would be a bad result, but plus 200 would be excellent. Also, East expected his opponents to be in a 4-3 fit because West would not normally overcall one no-trump with only a doubleton in the opener’s suit.West led the club ace, confident on the bidding that his partner would be short in the suit. West continued with a low club, declarer making the mistake of playing dummy’s king. East ruffed and shifted to a heart, ducked to West’s king. West led another club, East ruffing with his ten and South overruffing with the ace.'"

"'09-07-02,'0','Mr. Green, known as Chip, and his mentor, Carmen Rarden, an I.B.M. purchasing executive, spent two days in 2007 brainstorming at the corporation’s diversity supplier program in Charlotte, N.C., to pinpoint Green Ink’s capabilities and determine its short- and long-term goals — a process assisted by Leonard Greenhalgh, a management professor at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.“It’s typical that companies like Chip’s know how to do the work rather than know how to run a business,” said Professor Greenhalgh, who is also director of the business school’s programs for minority and women-owned business enterprises.“They tend to always be dealing with crises and meeting deadlines,” Professor Greenhalgh said. “But for two days, they sit down, reflect on what they’re good at doing, whether it’s strategy, marketing or figures — and no one is good at all three.“And the mentor is there to hold their feet to the fire — in a nice way,” he added.Since it began mentoring suppliers in 2003, I.B.M. has used volunteers from its ranks to guide 50 small companies, said Michael K. Robinson, the program’s director.“We identify those with good management, and match them with one of our executives to work with them on identifying and developing two or three business areas to focus on improving,” Mr. Robinson said.Despite the economic downturn, Mr. Robinson said I.B.M. was continuing to focus on helping its suppliers because “we spent nearly $2.5 billion in 2007 with 350 suppliers in the United States alone.” I.B.M. is one of 16 major corporations — Honda is the newest member — that make up the Billion Dollar Roundtable. Each member corporation spends at least $1 billion annually with minority- or women-owned suppliers.Corporations have a strong motivation to help smaller businesses, said Donna Long, of the National Minority Supplier Development Council, which provides a link between minority-owned businesses and corporations, universities, hospitals and similar institutions.“They don’t want to change suppliers every year,” said Ms. Long, vice president for development. “They would rather work with the supplier they have, but they also want them to be extensions of the corporation and to buy into its values.”At the same time, major companies “don’t want to be the only source of business for a small firm,” Ms. Long said.Expanding his customer base was one of the goals that Mr. Green and Ms. Rarden set for their collaboration. But first, they worked extensively on refashioning Green Ink’s image and message.Ms. Rarden, who had previously mentored a company owned by a woman, reviewed Green Ink’s presentations — which Mr. Green described as “a lot of eye candy, but not a lot of substance” — and coached the company on how to make them better.“I pretended I was the customer, and listened to a mock presentation,” Ms. Rarden said. “Then we improved on that.” She also encouraged the three-person company to “think through its values and mission” and put them into a new marketing video. In addition, she offered guidance on nuts-and-bolts areas like the specifics that an I.B.M. purchasing department looks for in a contract bid.In Atlanta, Home Depot also selects promising young companies to mentor, and participates in the state’s mentor-protégé business program, where small businesses are paired with large companies.Gwen Thomas, president of HR Now in Atlanta, which advises companies on human resources management, headed Home Depot’s first protégé company. When the companies were matched in 2004, Ms. Thomas was not assigned one mentor, but rotated through a number of the corporation’s departments, including legal and finance, and learned from their executives about Home Depot’s policies and needs.The same year, Ms. Thomas renamed her company and, she said, she realized under Home Depot’s tutelage that she needed to develop strategies to become better known nationally and connect with other suppliers.“It was almost like getting an individual business degree,” Ms. Thomas said of her mentoring. “I had a wish list of what I wanted to learn, and they helped me with it.“Even now, I can pick up the phone and ask, ‘Hey, what do you think about this?’ and I’ll get a response.”Some small companies also can get corporate scholarships to attend weeklong programs for entrepreneurs at Tuck and Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. But Mr. Green said his workers were fully engaged in building on what they had learned in the brainstorming session.“It was like a steroid injection,” he said. “We came out of that session so charged and ready to go. It really helped us realize how we could develop our competencies, and how we could grow without hurting our core business.”Details about the I.B.M. and Home Depot corporate supplier diversity programs can be found here and here. The Billion Dollar Roundtable lists the 16 large companies that spent $1 billion or more each annually with suppliers owned by minorities or women.The National Minority Supplier Development Council partners with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University each June to provide the Advanced Management Education Program. Corporate members recommend small businesses to participate in the four-day program, which teaches the skills needed to expand and sustain a business.The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth offers two-week programs. This year, it is offering “Building a High-Performing Minority Business” in July, August and December to teach skills like cost analysis, control systems, marketing and leadership.A second program, “Growing the Minority Business to Scale,” offered in November, builds on information learned in the initial program.Tuck provides a $4,000 scholarship to minority participants to defray the $8,500 cost.

"'09-07-03,'0','Detroit is merely trying to regain its swagger after a 39-43 season. Joe Dumars, the team president, is trying to recreate the magic of his 2003-4 team, which won the title without an All-Star. Gordon is not Chauncey Billups and Villanueva is no Rasheed Wallace, but the principle is the same: stockpile solid players and hope that they become greater than the sum of their parts.The twin signings effectively take the Pistons out of the free-agent market, which should send a shudder through the free-agent field. Detroit had the most salary-cap room, about $20 million, but has now spent most of it.For the players who are still chasing a major payday, there are five teams with at least $8 million in cap space: Memphis, Toronto, Portland, Oklahoma City and Atlanta. However, the list comes with some caveats.The Raptors would have to renounce the rights to two starters — Shawn Marion and Anthony Parker — plus Carlos Delfino to create about $12 million in cap space.The Hawks could create up to $15 million in cap space, but would have to renounce the rights to Mike Bibby, Marvin Williams and Josh Childress, among others.The Grizzlies have about $9 million of cap space left after agreeing to trade for Zach Randolph. (Like all trades and signings, nothing can become official until the N.B.A. moratorium ends on Wednesday.)Portland has about $8 million in cap space, assuming Channing Frye leaves. Oklahoma City has about $10 million available. The league’s other teams have only their midlevel exception, about $5.6 million, to spend.Now consider the list of free agents who earned at least $10 million last season and who are on the market: Kidd, Wallace, Marion, Lamar Odom, Allen Iverson, Andre Miller, Bibby, Stephon Marbury and Wally Szczerbiak.Now consider the list of other players who are seeking at least $7 million to $10 million per season: Williams, Childress, Hedo Turkoglu, David Lee, Paul Millsap, Trevor Ariza, Raymond Felton and Anderson Varejao.There are not enough $60 million contracts to go around. Some big names will be squeezed out of the market and left to sign for the midlevel exception, or even the veterans minimum.The advantage will shift to the home teams, who can sign their own free agents without regard to the cap. That is why Knicks officials have to be smiling right now. Their odds of keeping Lee, their energetic young power forward, improved drastically when the Pistons and the Grizzlies made their moves.The Blazers’ main target is Turkoglu, and they are well stocked in the frontcourt, with LaMarcus Aldridge, Greg Oden and Joel Przybilla. Oklahoma City is said to be chasing Millsap and has little interest in Lee. Although the Grizzlies still have enough room to make Lee a big offer, it seems unlikely given the millions they have tied up in Randolph, Marc Gasol and the rookie Hasheem Thabeet.It also seems unlikely that Lee would want to trade the New York spotlight and a starting job for a backup role in a small market.Mark Bartelstein, Lee’s agent, contended that the market was still strong.“There’s a bunch of people we’re talking to,” including the Raptors and the Grizzlies, who, Bartelstein insisted, “could still do something,” despite acquiring Randolph.Bartelstein said a sign-and-trade deal was another option, but that would require Lee to have leverage (in the form of a big offer) and the Knicks to have a willingness to make a deal, which is doubtful.In the N.B.A. version of musical chairs, the game ends when the last bit of cap space vanishes.'"

"'09-07-03,'0','But it would not be the first time that politicians tried to co-opt religious symbols to win votes. The ruckus over the jilbab began a few months ago when Mr. Yudhoyono, whose wife, Kristiani Herawati, does not wear a jilbab, and Vice President Jusuf Kalla, whose wife, Mufidah, does, decided not to run together again.The president selected as his new vice presidential running mate a respected central banker, Boediono, whose wife, Herawati, goes unveiled. Mr. Kalla, in turn, decided to run for president as the Golkar Party’s standard-bearer and picked as his No. 2 a retired general, Wiranto, whose wife, Rugaya, is veiled. (Many Indonesians go by only one name.)Perhaps sensing an opening as it trailed in the polls, the Golkar Party soon put up posters of the veiled wives. With the news media in tow, the wives went shopping together for jilbabs at Tanah Abang, the city’s largest textile market, where the general’s wife was known as a regular, but Mr. Kalla’s wife was not.Golkar Party officials rejected accusations by the president’s party that they were trying to exploit Islam for politics; they also denied having anything to do with the recent distribution of leaflets that stated, falsely, that Boediono’s wife was not Muslim, but Roman Catholic.President Yudhoyono was also getting pressure from a current coalition ally, the Prosperous Justice Party, the country’s largest Islamic party. A party leader said that members were gravitating toward the Golkar candidates because of their jilbab-wearing wives.The country’s Islamic parties have core supporters that are coveted by the major parties, though the Islamic parties have failed to make inroads among mainstream voters. In fact, in April’s parliamentary elections, they suffered a steep drop in support compared with five years ago, a decline interpreted as mainstream voters’ rejection of Islam in politics.Neng Dara Affiah, an official at Nahdlatul Ulama, the country’s largest Islamic organization, which espouses moderate Islam, said the fight over the meaning of wearing the jilbab was taking place between “fundamentalists” and “progressives.”The fundamentalists are trying to force women to wear the jilbab as an act of submission, and had already done so in various municipalities across the Indonesian archipelago in recent years, Ms. Neng said. For the progressives, she said, wearing the jilbab was an expression of a woman’s right.“For women in Indonesia, whether they want to wear the jilbab or not is their choice,” said Ms. Neng, who started wearing one five years ago. “It shouldn’t be political.”Despite being the world’s most populous Muslim nation, Indonesia does not have a tradition of Islamic dress. Most Indonesian women started wearing the jilbab in the last decade, after the fall in 1998 of President Suharto, who had kept a close grip on Islamic groups.Fashion and clothing industry experts said the number of women wearing jilbabs rose sharply in the past three years, for reasons of religion, fashion or something undefined.“If you ask 10 different women why they’re wearing jilbab, you’ll get 10 different answers,” said Jetti R. Hadi, the editor in chief of Noor, a magazine specializing in Muslim fashion, which features jilbab-clad models on its cover. “You cannot assume that because a woman is wearing a jilbab, she’s a good Muslim.”At Tanah Abang, the market where the political wives shopped for jilbabs, many small shop owners had recently switched from selling Western clothes to jilbabs to capitalize on the boom. One shop owner, Syafnir, 53, said 7 of his 15 relatives working in the market had begun to sell jilbabs in the past two years. He himself now has two stores; the second opened just two months ago.Asked whether faith was fueling the boom, he shook his head emphatically. Fashion was, he said, an answer echoed by others in the market.Deni Sartika, 36, who was shopping with her mother and young daughter, all three of them veiled, said she started wearing a jilbab in 1991, long before most Indonesian women did. She was a member of the Prosperous Justice Party, the Islamic party that supports President Yudhoyono.Ms. Deni said she would vote for Mr. Yudhoyono and his vice president even though their wives did not wear jilbabs.“I’m looking at the candidates themselves instead of their wives,” she said, before adding, “but we’d be happy if the wives wore jilbabs.”'"
"'09-07-03,'0','Lawyers for J. Ezra Merkin contend in court documents that investments he made with Bernard L. Madoff on behalf of four funds he managed were no secret.The lawyers on Wednesday asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit in which the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, accused Mr. Merkin and his Gabriel Capital Corporation of secretly placing $2.4 billion of client funds with Mr. Madoff, who was sentenced on Monday to 150 years in prison for running the largest Ponzi scheme ever.The Merkin funds are Ascot Fund Ltd. and Ascot Partners, which were almost entirely invested with the Madoff firm; Ariel Fund Ltd.; and Gabriel Capital L.P.“It was well known to investors that substantially all of Ascot’s assets were invested through Madoff,” Mr. Merkin’s lawyers, including Andrew J. Levander of the Dechert law firm, wrote. “Nor was it concealed that the highly liquid portion of the Gabriel and Ariel portfolios was invested with Madoff.”The lawyers asked the court to schedule July 17 arguments on their motion to dismiss the suit. Mr. Cuomo is seeking payment of damages, disgorgement of all fees and restitution.Mr. Merkin steered the assets to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities in exchange for $470 million in fees, Mr. Cuomo said in his April complaint in New York state court.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','Still, as far as stocks go, analysts say it’s almost 2007 all over again.“Sentiment has staged a remarkable recovery,” said Jing Ulrich, chairwoman of China equities at J. P. Morgan. “This is about confidence. The money has always been there, even in the dark days of 2008.”In 2007, Chinese stock markets were in the midst of a record-breaking, multiyear rally that quadrupled share prices from their 2005 lows. Everyone, from mom-and-pop store owners to big corporations, was playing the stock market — and winning.At the time, state-owned companies sometimes set up separate divisions just to speculate and trade stocks. And in those heady days, some of the world’s biggest initial public stock offerings took place in Shanghai and Hong Kong.Then, in early 2008, predictions of a huge sell-off began to materialize, and stock prices plummeted. The global economic crisis prompted an even bigger sell-off.The Shanghai composite was as low as 1,717 last November — a 70 percent drop from its peak in late 2007.Chinese stock markets are known for their volatility, and investors often treat them like casinos. The government pushes and pulls the market by occasionally tweaking regulations. Many listed companies are known for fuzzy or suspect accounting.But in China, where interest rates are typically low and the government restricts investors from sending money overseas, there are few options for big returns.Many analysts say the Chinese economy is showing signs of improving, but there are also hints that huge, government-initiated bank loans are flowing into the stock and real estate markets now, lifting prices.Speculators, in other words, may be back.In the first half of the year, banks operating in China made about $1 trillion in new loans — an astounding figure considering that all of the 2008 bank loans totaled about $620 billion, analysts say.“The fundamentals are positive, but it’s not party time again,” said Stephen Green, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank who is based in Shanghai. “Profitability is pretty weak. We’re in a U-shaped recovery, but things are only gradually improving.”Economists are debating the recovery in China, but a strong consensus is forming about the size of China’s growth by the end of this year.Many economists are now forecasting that China will grow by about 8 percent in 2009.In the first quarter of 2009, China said its economy grew by 6.1 percent, the lowest in a decade. Exports have been down as much as 25 percent from a year earlier.But an immense economic stimulus package and huge loans seem to be driving domestic growth, commodity prices and retail sales growth.“We can hit that 8 percent target,” Ms. Ulrich at J. P. Morgan said, “even without meaningful contributions from exports.”'"
"'09-07-03,'0','Many people on Wall Street and in Washington dismiss such claims, arguing that while short-sellers may have accelerated some stock declines, the real problem was the precarious state of the companies’ own finances.Given the climate in Washington, as well as the running suspicion of Wall Street, new rules seem inevitable, analysts say. Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., has said that considering new rules restricting short-selling is a priority. Members of Congress like Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House financial services committee, are calling for quick action.For the moment, the most likely outcome may be for the S.E.C. to reinstate a rule that the commission itself abolished with a unanimous vote in 2007, under its previous chairman, Christopher S. Cox. Known as the uptick rule, it would bar investors from shorting a stock until its price ticks at least a penny above its previous trading price.But current and former S.E.C. staff members appear to doubt that reinstating the uptick rule would have much of an effect on trading. Some say the change would be merely cosmetic.“The government wants a confidence measure right now, and that’s all this is,” said Lawrence E. Harris, a former S.E.C. chief economist.Traders, he said, will simply find ways to circumvent the rule, but the commission probably will make the move if only to deflect outside pressure.“Every crisis requires action,” he said. “It’s not worth fighting over.”In March, Mr. Frank urged Ms. Schapiro to reinstate the uptick rule. That same month, Senator Edward E. Kaufman, Democrat of Delaware, introduced a bipartisan bill to reinstate the rule, saying its demise in 2007 “added fuel to the fire of distressed stocks and markets.”But a more radical solution — a so-called circuit breaker that would halt trading in a stock for an entire day if its price fell by a certain percentage — appears to be off the table.The S.E.C. first enacted the uptick rule during the Depression, after the market crashed in 1937-38. It then voted to repeal the rule in mid-2007, after internal studies showed that removing the restrictions would not have a “deleterious impact on market quality or liquidity.”To some, the issue is clear-cut. The American Bankers Association, a trade group representing the vast majority of American banks — whose equity values have been especially battered in the last 18 months — recently submitted an opinion in favor of reinstating the short-sale restrictions.Sally Miller, a spokesman for the A.B.A., said the member banks thought there was a clear link between the market turmoil and the rule change.“All of a sudden subsequent to 2007 they can see all their stocks going haywire,” Ms. Miller said. “It’s cause and effect.”Traders and fund managers, however, say the rule is a part of a broader opposition to short-selling, a tool investors need to bring overvalued stocks back into line. Short-sales, they say, are a frequent scapegoat for companies of exaggerated fundamental strength. Others say that the rule will have little meaningful impact. “I don’t mind what I see as minor inconveniences,” said Whitney Tilson, an author and managing partner of T2 Partners, “if it will get rid of the critics who like to blame short-sellers every time a stock goes down.”Duncan Niederauer, the chief of NYSE Euronext, which runs the New York Stock Exchange, said in March that while “there was no economic benefit” from having the uptick rule, “it would go a long way to adding confidence.”The exchange has since officially voiced its support. Joseph M. Mecane, the chief administrative officer for United States markets at the NYSE, said that the exchange was not trying to curb traders’ ability to sell short but was wary of the “kind of herd mentality” that gripped the markets during the few most staggering days of the fourth quarter last year.“You want some sort of a dampener in those periods,” Mr. Mecane said, “and let the stock breathe a bit.”'"
"'09-07-03,'0','But the timeline for assessing the project appears to have shifted. When the city unveiled the idea in February, a Transportation Department presentation said data on the plazas would be collected over three weeks in May and June, and all of July. (A spokesman said Thursday that the schedule was revised as the project developed.)Now, observations and measurements are scheduled to start in the middle of August and continue into the fall. The final report is due in December, when the pilot project faces a thumbs-up or thumbs-down vote from the mayor.Ms. Sadik-Khan stressed that her office was focused on getting the project finished on time. “As soon as it’s done, we will turn our sights to data collection,” she said. She added that June’s outsize rainfall would most likely skew any information on traffic volume and speed and that drivers were still adjusting to the changed street pattern.“I’d be surprised if they haven’t been doing some monitoring of it,” said Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic consultant and former first deputy transportation commissioner for the city.But he noted that the summer was a poor time to gather data, at least statistically speaking. “For something like Midtown Manhattan, you always takes measurements between Labor Day and before school lets out,” Mr. Schwartz said.To determine a basis for comparison, the city conducted an extensive survey of Midtown traffic and pedestrian patterns in March and April. The survey, which examined an area stretching from Fifth to 11th Avenue and 23rd to 65th Street, is striking in its granularity; for example, it provides average travel speeds on nearly every square block in and around Times Square.Officials said the same techniques — which include video monitoring and hourly and daily traffic counts taken by city employees with clickers — would be used when surveys begin next month.Until then, city dwellers will have to rely on anecdotal accounts from parties with a great deal of self-interest. Tourists have praised the plazas as pleasant places to sit and relax, even as motorists complain about congestion. Some local businesses have welcomed the added foot traffic, while others have howled over the difficulty of making deliveries in the area.Passions about the plazas run particularly hot among taxi drivers, a few of whom expressed horror on Thursday about the effect on traffic speed.“If you have one fare to go to the theater district, your day or night is finished,” said Fhahidul Hossain, a cabdriver and part-time dispatcher at City Transport Management. “A 10-minute fare is going to take you an hour or so. It’s a nightmare.”And Mr. Hossain offered what amounted to a cri de coeur for drivers who believe that the union of automobiles and Midtown — in all its exhaust-filled, horn-honking glory — is a coupling that cannot be quietly undone.“In Manhattan, you have to move, man. You cannot do it like this,” he said. “This is not Europe. This is New York City, for God’s sake!”For her part, Ms. Sadik-Khan acknowledged the hunger for an assessment of one of the most ambitious transportation planning projects in decades. But she asked that New Yorkers be patient.“You wouldn’t want to look at a Picasso that’s halfway done,” she said.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','An NBC News investigation program about a counterterrorist team’s search for suspected war criminals and terrorists will have its premiere on July 20, The Hollywood Reporter said. The program, “The Wanted,” will follow specialists in foreign intelligence and war crimes, assembled for the series by NBC, as they pursue suspected international terrorists, focusing on subjects including Mullah Krekar, the founder of Ansar al-Islam, a radical Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda, and Mamoun Darkazanli, who is suspected of providing logistical and financial support to Al Qaeda. The program has raised concerns in the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies, which say it could interfere with criminal investigations, and from human rights advocates, who say it could broadcast false accusations. In February NBC News was criticized for its investigation of Leopold Munyakazi, a visiting professor at Goucher College in Maryland. He has been charged in Rwanda with taking part in the genocide there in 1994. He denies the charges.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','In their theatrical lark “Speedmouse” the affable Australian doofuses known as the Umbilical Brothers  whose comedy double act includes snippets of dance, puppetry, clowning and the playground gags of adolescents on a sugar rush  practice a chaotic brand of unadulterated silliness. But even while they dart around the unadorned stage, stopping, starting, rewinding and occasionally breaking down, requiring a battery change (in mime of course), the longtime performers maintain a confident chemistry that reveals itself most impressively in the way that one actor provides sound effects for the movements of the other.Chattering in unison, showing the benefits of more than two decades together, the Umbilical Brothers are joined at the lip.Dressed identically in suspenders, tank tops and loose pants, David Collins, a hysteric with a mop of curly hair, and Shane Dundas, deadpan and bald, belong to a long tradition of frustrated tramps stuck in an absurd theatrical space in which they have no control over their fate. But these characters aren’t waiting for Godot so much as a light cue. (Blackouts keep arriving unexpectedly.)The world they inhabit is that of unforgiving show business. An offstage voice tells them what to do, and a sinister masked roadie controls their fate with the touch of a remote control that can freeze the show with the push of an imaginary button. Their various humiliations are played for giggles and little more, and the stakes here are as amiably low as that in a children’s television show.“Speedmouse” features the world’s loudest Arnold Schwarzenegger impression and a satire of the old stand-bys of mime  pulling the rope, walking down the staircase  in a mock-serious routine presented as a tribute to “European visual comedy.” These sketches are loosely tied together, and while the casualness of the presentation is part of the duo’s appeal, the 90-minute show starts to feel a bit baggy by the end of the first hour.At their best the Umbilical Brothers can turn a puppet show or an impression of a dinosaur into a virtuoso work of physical lunacy. Other times, getting by on charm and old tricks, they veer madly toward anarchy but never get there.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','The cause of the crash has not been determined. Yemenia officials said the aircraft that crashed, an A310-300 Airbus, had passed safety inspections and flown twice to London in the past week.Representatives of SOS Voyage aux Comores, a group created a year ago to lobby for better safety on Yemenia routes, said the French authorities had not heeded calls to clamp down on the airline.They contended that European and American aviation authorities were not sufficiently concerned about the safety practices of airlines that operate outside European or American airspace, where lax performance has led to a higher rate of fatal accidents. In Africa, there is one accident for about every 250,000 flights, about five times the global average.“No one ever took us seriously before this tragedy,” Mustapha Abdou-Raouf, a spokesman for SOS, said in a telephone interview. He and other members of the group described loose baggage piled in the cabin during Yemenia flights to Moroni, broken seats and seat belts and filthy toilets.“You can’t play with people’s lives like this, in such a casual, such an arrogant way,” Mr. Abdou-Raouf said.Dominique Bussereau, France’s secretary of state for transportation, called Thursday for a global blacklist of airlines that did not fulfill safety requirements. Antonio Tajani, Europe’s transportation chief, made a similar proposal earlier this week. The European Union sent a letter on Wednesday to Yemenia seeking full details of the crash and of safety procedures, said a European Union spokesman, Fabio Pirotta.In an interview published in the French newspaper Le Figaro, Mr. Bussereau said that, because of Europe’s stringent safety controls, airlines from “certain distant countries” used their best aircraft on European routes. He said French inspectors in 2007 had found “unnerving anomalies” in the plane that crashed Tuesday; it was used only for the leg of the journey between Sana, the capital of Yemen, and Moroni. The flight, which originated in Paris, used a different aircraft from France to Yemen.The European Union already publishes a so-called blacklist of nearly 200 airlines, many of them based in Africa or former Soviet states, which are banned from flying in European airspace.In addition, the International Air Transport Association, the airlines’ trade group, requires that members comply with its operational safety audit, a system that measures compliance with hundreds of processes and procedures that enhance safety. Anthony Concil, a spokesman for the association, said Yemenia had passed its audit in 2008 and had never before had a fatal crash.Airline officials and experts said a global blacklist could be difficult to enforce since it would have to be carried out by aviation authorities in countries where corruption, weak governments and poverty compromise safety standards.And sometimes the aviation infrastructure in the developing world can be the cause of a crash, not the airline, said Paul Hayes, the head of accidents and insurance at Ascend, an aviation industry consulting firm in London. An effective blacklist would have to cover national aviation authorities as well, Mr. Hayes said.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','Johnson & Johnson, the health care giant, will pay $1 billion to the Irish biotechnology company Elan to gain access to Alzheimer’s disease treatments, the companies said Thursday.Johnson & Johnson will acquire substantially all of the assets and rights of Elan related to its Alzheimer’s immunotherapy program through a new company, the two drug makers said. In return, Johnson & Johnson will invest $1 billion in Elan in exchange for American depositary receipts equivalent to 18.4 percent of Elan’s shares. Elan executives said that Johnson & Johnson was paying a premium of about 33 percent to Wednesday’s closing price.The Alzheimer’s program stake represents Elan’s share a project with Wyeth, another American drug maker. The arrangement calls for Johnson & Johnson to commit up to $500 million to develop promising Alzheimer’s treatments, including bapineuzumab, which is in advanced clinical trials.Also part of the program, are efforts to develop a vaccine for Alzheimer’s, a type of dementia that usually affects people over 65.It was the second major biotech deal in two days.

"'09-07-03,'0','“It looks shockingly bad compared to last month,” but it is better than April when the economy shed 504,000 jobs, said Art Hogan, the chief market strategist at Jefferies & Companies. “The trend is much better than when we started the year” losing 700,000 and 800,000 jobs a month.Besides competing for fewer jobs, Americans are also working fewer hours a week on average and thus have less expendable income to funnel into the economy.Like New York exchanges, those in Europe declined on unemployment numbers from the Continent. According to Eurostat, unemployment in the euro zone in May also rose to 9.5 percent — the highest level in a decade — from 9.3 percent in April. The European Central Bank on Thursday also kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 1 percent, and said that it expected to maintain its course for the immediate future. The news underwhelmed some investors who hoped that the bank would cut rates to spur lending.The FTSE 100 index in London settled down 2.45 percent, or 106.44 points, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 3.81 percent or 186.95 points. The CAC 40 in Paris was 3.1 percent lower, or 100.59 points.In a second economic report on Thursday, American factory orders rose 1.2 percent in May, the largest jump since June 2008. Economists had expected a 0.8 percent increase.But the increase was largely attributed to new Boeing aircraft orders, according to Joseph Brusuelas, a director at Moody’s Economy.com. “I would not put too much stock in a single factory orders number and extrapolate it to the entire economy,” Mr. Brusuelas said. “We’re not in recovery yet.”After the jobs report, all eyes are now shifting back to the equity markets to see whether the business environment is improving. Companies begin to report second-quarter earnings next week, led by the metals giant Alcoa, which is scheduled to report on Wednesday. Alcoa was one of the biggest blue-chip losers on Thursday, falling 4.73 percent to $9.86 a share.Thursday capped a generally downbeat two-week period in which the market struggled to break through its mid-June highs, and nagging doubts about a brittle macroeconomy have left investors feeling somewhat bearish.The New York Stock Exchange pushed back its closing time by 15 minutes after technical problems disrupted trading earlier in the day. “There is a very significant barrier at 870 on the S.& P.,” said Bruce Bittles of Robert W. Baird & Company.“If we broke that level our confidence on the economy would have to be downgraded,” Mr. Bittles added.Crude oil futures fell by $2.58 to settle at $66.73 a barrel in New York trading after the payroll data depressed the overall economic outlook for the United States, the world’s largest oil consumer. High levels of unemployment are expected to restrain gasoline demand for the summer driving season.The Treasury bond market steadied as investors pulled out of equities for safer alternatives. The 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, to 98 27/32 and the yield slipped to 3.49 percent, from 3.54 percent late Wednesday.'"
"'09-07-03,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea test-fired four short-range missiles into the sea that lies between it and Japan on Thursday, amid simmering tensions over the latest international sanctions against the Communist state, according to news reports and a spokesman for the South Korean government.North Korea fired two missiles from a base near Wonsan, a major city on the North’s east coast, at 5:20 p.m. and at 6 p.m. local time, said a spokesman at the South Korean Defense Ministry who spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal announcement had not been made yet.Later Thursday, the North fired another short-range missile, the spokesman said. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported that a fourth short-range missile was also fired.The spokesman did not provide additional details, but Yonhap called the weapons surface-to-ship cruise missiles and reported that each flew about 60 miles before falling harmlessly into the sea.While such missiles are routinely tested by the North Koreans, they raised speculation that North Korea might launch a long-range ballistic missile in defiance of a United Nations ban, further heightening regional tensions after the North’s last long-range rocket launching on April 5 and its nuclear test on May 25.'"

But if the reports were correct, the North Korean tests on Saturday were bound to raise tensions between the North and its neighbors.After a nuclear test by North Korea on May 25, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution that, among other things, barred it from testing ballistic missiles.A South Korean military official, speaking on condition of anonymity citing government policy, said the missiles launched Saturday were believed to have flown no more than 300 miles, indicating that they might be the North’s Scud-type missiles. The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted military sources as saying the missiles were either Scud or Rodong missiles.A statement from the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said the military was “fully ready to counter any North Korean threats and provocations based on strong South Korea-U.S. combined defense posture.”'"
"'09-07-04,'0','Microsoft made it clear that it wanted to cooperate, announcing partnerships with two leading advertising companies, the WPP Group and the Publicis Groupe. Yet Mr. Ballmer expressed skepticism about the extent to which advertising could be used to finance an explosion of online content.Advertising agencies have long been big customers of Google, Microsoft and other Internet companies, shifting an increasing portion of ad budgets online. WPP, the largest ad agency owner, spends $850 million a year of its clients’ money with Google, according to Martin Sorrell, WPP’s chief executive. Ninety-eight percent of Google’s revenue comes from advertising, largely from “sponsored links” that appear alongside its search results.Mr. Sorrell once called Google a “frenemy” of the ad industry, a characterization that reflected the Internet giant’s efforts to move into businesses like media buying, which in the past have been controlled by the likes of WPP. Agency executives also complained that Google remained aloof, spending hardly anything on advertising itself.Asked during an onstage interview with Maurice Lévy, chief executive of Publicis, whether he even liked advertising, Mr. Schmidt insisted: “We love advertising.”Microsoft, minus its chief executive, has been a prominent participant at the ad festival for several years, bringing hundreds of employees to the event. It is also a big advertiser, spending $700 million a year, according to Mr. Ballmer. But the breadth of its ambitions — in addition to buying and selling ads, the company owns an agency that creates them — has also caused alarm in some advertising quarters.Analysts say the rivalry between Microsoft and Google may also play into their overtures to the ad industry. While Google has dominated the search business, Microsoft introduced a new search engine, Bing, in late May. It has lifted Microsoft’s share of online searches in the United States to about 12 percent, according to comScore, a research firm, from 8 percent for Microsoft’s previous engine.Mr. Schmidt acknowledged that Google had, in recent months, found itself in the unfamiliar position of stumbling on certain projects, including efforts to develop systems for selling newspaper and radio advertising. He said marketers were also lowering their bids for keywords on Google’s search engine, where ads are sold through online auctions.Google has also struggled to generate significant advertising from YouTube, its online video-sharing service. Mr. Schmidt said he had high hopes for new kinds of advertising formats on YouTube — some of which, he added, were developed through a partnership with Publicis.That agreement, which has taken shape over the last year, represented the start of a thaw in the previously frosty relations between advertising companies and Internet giants.Since then WPP has also struck a deal with Google to examine the future of digital advertising.Last week in Cannes, WPP, whose agencies include Ogilvy & Mather and Grey, Young & Rubicam, announced a separate research deal with Microsoft.Publicis, whose agencies include Saatchi & Saatchi and Leo Burnett, also moved to balance its partnership portfolio, announcing a broad agreement with Microsoft. The companies said they would jointly develop new kinds of digital advertising for a range of devices, including personal computers, mobile phones and Microsoft Xbox game consoles. They said they would also work on ways to send tailored advertising to individual television viewers’ sets.Darren Huston, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s consumer and online businesses, described the linkup as “a major step forward in the relationship between our industries.”In addition to generating new business, he said, Mr. Ballmer intended the partnership to send a signal to Microsoft employees about the benefits of working with the ad industry.“It’s about the tone at the top,” Mr. Huston said. “What I’m saying, and what Steve is saying, is, ‘Here are some folks we’re going to work together with to crack some code.’ ”Analysts say there may be another reason for the new friendliness between Microsoft and companies like Publicis and WPP. Microsoft has been trying to sell a digital ad agency, called Razorfish, which it acquired two years ago when it bought the agency’s parent company, aQuantive, for $6 billion.WPP and Publicis have reportedly been among the potential buyers; both companies declined to comment.'"
"'09-07-04,'0','So far the banks are winning, and the hot money continues to fuel bank growth. The industry has even invented variants to get around the few rules that have been put in place by regulators.Banks defend the use of brokered deposits as an important tool to bring in money to help communities grow. But even some industry executives acknowledge that certain banks became too dependent on the deposits, and that this abuse caused banks to fail. The consequences can be seen across the country.The 79 banks that have failed in the United States over the last two years had an average load of brokered deposits four times the national norm, according to an analysis performed for by Foresight Analytics, an industry research firm based in . And a third of the failed banks, the analysis shows, had both an unusually high level of brokered deposits and an extremely high growth rate — often a disastrous recipe for banks.The data also shows that the problem isn’t likely to go away. The 371 still-operating banks on Foresight’s “watch list” as of March held brokered deposits that, on average, were twice the norm. Even this year, in the depth of the , a number of struggling banks have been piling up hot money in a desperate effort to survive.It is the same mix — rapid increases in hot money and heavy lending for risky real estate development — that brought down many of the in the late 1980s.Regulators now acknowledge that they saw the warning signs during the most recent boom, but failed to take aggressive action. “We went through this golden age of banking and I just think that everybody lost their compass,” said , the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Their indifference has been costly. Even brokered deposits are insured, up to $250,000 for each customer account. But once a bank fails, these deposits become an albatross to the F.D.I.C., which often looks for a healthy bank to take over the failed bank. Most new owners refuse to accept the brokered money — it doesn’t bring branches or real customers — forcing the F.D.I.C. to repay it. The fight over brokered deposits, though far less public than other struggles over the nation’s regulatory system, is one of many in Washington that will help determine the shape of industries ravaged by the economic crisis.To make their case, a delegation of nearly 50 Georgia bankers assembled at the F.D.I.C.’s headquarters in May to plead with regulators to ease restrictions on brokered deposits.“It is a bullet to their head,” Joe Brannen, president of the Georgia Bankers Association, recalled members of the group telling senior agency officials. “This is insanity.”Brokered deposits, industry players and regulators agree, are not inherently a bad thing. Many institutions have relied on brokered deposits for years without troubles. Without brokered deposits, small regional banks in fast-growing parts of the country would not have been able to keep up with the demand for construction loans.The brokers receive much of the money from firms like , which are looking to park high-interest certificates of deposits they have sold to clients. Merrill customers get two things out of the arrangement: high returns on their investments and a haven because the money is placed in a bank insured by the F.D.I.C. One brokerage firm, Finance 500, in Irvine, Calif., started a hot money program in 1997 with seven bank customers. A decade later, it delivered $14 billion to more than 1,500 banks.But the money is volatile. It can be easily shifted from one bank to another as brokers seek the highest interest rates. Thus the term hot money.Some banks prosper by supplementing their accounts with these deposits, but try not to rely too much on them because the interest payments are high and the brokers can be fickle. “It’s simple, really,” Michael Hobbs, the chief executive of in wrote to the F.D.I.C. late last year, in defending the industry’s practices. “If brokered deposits are managed accordingly, they provide a safe alternative funding source.”But William M. Isaac, chairman of the F.D.I.C. from 1981 to 1985, said he became wary nearly three decades ago after watching the spectacular fall of Penn Square Bank of , which had grown astronomically by gorging on brokered deposits. Alarmed by the practice, Mr. Isaac moved to eliminate F.D.I.C. for most brokered deposits — a rule that provoked an industry revolt and was ultimately overturned. Congress later made a similar attempt, but it too was defeated.“I have a lot of scars on my back,” Mr. Isaac said in an interview, recalling the fight over the rules. “I don’t have any doubt that tens of billions were lost in the S.& L. crisis because of brokered deposits. And we were on our way to shutting that practice down.”By 1991, Congress prohibited weak banks from obtaining brokered deposits unless they were adequately capitalized. But because approximately 97 percent of the banks in the United States are considered “well capitalized,” the limit has little impact. Three years later, the F.D.I.C. watered down that rule by repealing the requirement that banks looking to grow rapidly with brokered deposits seek special permission from the agency.The risks and rewards of brokered deposits played out visibly here in Georgia, where a red-hot real estate market in metropolitan drove a lending frenzy that was heavily financed by hot money.Mr. Pittard built MagnetBank solely on brokered deposits, eschewing even traditional branches. “It was very simple,” he said. “It was clean.” And the F.D.I.C. approved it.The bank was chartered in , but did much of its lending in Georgia. When the real estate market here turned in 2007, many borrowers fell behind and Magnet began to crumble. Its failure in January 2009 cost the F.D.I.C. an estimated $129 million.Magnet is the extreme example: 100 percent of its deposits were brokered. The story of Security Bank is more typical of the risks.For years it stayed out of the brokered deposit trade. Mr. Walker, its president and chief, who was known to everyone here in Macon as Rett, bragged to the newspaper about how much he valued local customers.“The more accounts they have with you — from a child’s savings account to a safety deposit box — the more loyal the customer is and less likely to leave,” Mr. Walker said in 2001, the same year he dressed up in a tuxedo shirt and jacket, jeans and boots to cook up a quail dinner for employees at a branch that had met a sales goal.But even as he spoke, suburban Atlanta was booming, and Security wanted to take advantage.It bought small banks to ramp up its lending. But that did not satisfy its ambitions, government records show. So, despite Mr. faith in small depositors, Security called the brokers.At the start of the decade, Security held just $693,000 in brokered deposits. By last year it had $798 million, or 33 percent of its overall deposit base.To attract the wholesalers, Security had to offer interest rates that, as of 2007, averaged 5.28 percent, or 20 percent higher than what local banking customers got.To generate the profits to pay such rates, Security began concentrating its lending in the riskiest corners of the market: acquisition of raw land and construction of housing developments. These loans can bring higher profits from fees and higher interest rates. In 1999, construction lending was 8 percent of Security’s loan portfolio. By 2007, it peaked at 53 percent, including prominent projects like converting 230 acres of a former plantation into an upscale new neighborhood called the Highlands.For a while, the hot money strategy seemed to be working; Security’s profits soared, as did its stock price. Then the economy went sour. Now Mr. Walker has been forced out of his job, and the bank acknowledges it is struggling to survive. It built itself a sprawling new headquarters here in Macon, but it is no longer putting its name atop the tower. Instead, it is trying to find someone to lease the empty space. The Highlands project, like many others it financed, sits unfinished.Thomas D. Woodbery, the bank’s senior vice president, defended the strategy as a “proven and reliable” way to get more money for loans. But he said the bank was now reducing its allowance on brokered deposits — under orders from the F.D.I.C., which only in April placed heavy restrictions on Security by issuing a cease-and-desist order.Through this hot-money explosion, the regulators largely watched from the sidelines, offering warnings at times, but declining to intervene forcefully, officials in Washington now acknowledge. The F.D.I.C. allowed many banks that lost their “well capitalized” status to keep taking brokered deposits, approving waivers for about 65 percent of the applicants over the last five years.“Don’t get in the way, don’t take away the punch bowl,” Ms. Bair said, describing the approach taken by regulators, including her own agency.At the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , part of the , bank examiners in 2005 found that ANB Financial of relied heavily on brokered deposits to fuel rapid growth, an audit shows. Yet the regulators did not take “forceful action” for two more years, the audit says, just before ANB was shut down.At the Office of Thrift Supervision — a Treasury agency that wants to eliminate — regulators advised BankUnited of Coral Gables, Fla., to backdate financial records, allowing it to continue to lure brokered deposits, the department’s inspector general reported in May 2009.In recent years, even some brokers became concerned about the dependence on hot money that certain banks had developed, said Paul T. Clark, an industry lawyer in Washington. They shared those concerns with regulators at the F.D.I.C. last year, hoping to head off a crackdown. “We looked at this and we were very nervous,” he said. “We are going to get blamed because these banks failed. It is not our fault. Where were the regulators?”Looking back on the reluctance to slow the growth, Timothy W. Long, chief national bank examiner in the comptroller’s office, asked: “When do you tap on the brakes versus slamming on the brakes? It is a hard thing to do sometimes, particularly when management is pushing back hard.”Late last year, the F.D.I.C. proposed a new rule. Banks that rely too heavily on brokered deposits to accelerate their growth will have to pay a higher insurance premium to help cover losses if they fail. The proposed limit was 10 percent brokered deposits and a growth rate of 20 percent over four years.Just as it did in the early 1980s, industry opposition emerged almost overnight.“Brokered’ is not a 4-letter word!” Dennis M. King, chief officer of North in , wrote in one of hundreds of letters the agency received condemning Ms. Bair’s plan. “They are especially important to community banks in our present economic environment.”The banks won important concessions. The regulator relaxed the part of the rule that required higher premiums if banks grew too fast with brokered deposits, allowing a growth rate of up to 40 percent over four years. And it left open a loophole that lets banks — even those considered unsound — turn to a “listing service,” a source of hot money by another name. Instead of paying a broker, banks pay to subscribe to an electronic bulletin board of credit unions with money to park.One listing service, QwickRate, based in Marietta, Ga., has just 18 employees crammed into a tiny second-floor office. But it delivered $1.6 billion in hot money to banks in May, up from $450 million last May. The growth is coming partly because banks on the edge of failure are coming to the service for a lifeline.Bank regulators are just learning how popular these unregulated services have suddenly become — and are already worried that they will be the next source of hot money abuses.Ms. Bair said she planned to ask Congress for greater powers to limit the role of hot money in banking — be it brokered deposits, listing services or simply Internet sales by banks offering unusually high interest rates.“We have seen the error of our ways,” she said.'"
"'09-07-04,'0','The European Union called on Friday for the use of clearinghouses for some over-the-counter derivative trades to “ensure they do not harm financial stability.”As part of a response to the global economic crisis, the European Union will also study shifting more trades to exchanges and consider the creation of a data warehouse to heighten the transparency of trades and to promote the standardization of contracts, the European Commission said.The proposals, which could lead to legislation later this year, are an attempt to cut risk in the $592 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. President Obama released a similar plan last month that would require standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be guaranteed by clearinghouses.“From 10,000 feet it all looks fine, but for us what matters is how it looks much closer to the ground,” Andre Allee, a derivatives lawyer at Simmons & Simmons in London, said in a telephone interview. “It’s really similar to what was proposed in the U.S. to the extent that it does look like there was coordination. Our clients are really happy with that.”The European Union plans come after Timothy F. Geithner, the United States Treasury secretary, sent a proposal to Congressional leaders laying out his plan to police over-the-counter derivatives trading, the unregulated market where swaps based on interest rates, currencies, commodities and a company’s ability to pay back debt are exchanged.'"
"'09-07-04,'0','But Mr. Obama faces a reservoir of resentment among Russians who believe that the United States has rarely followed through on such gestures. “There’s a lot of suspicion that this has been talk, talk, talk — let’s see some real action,” said Vladimir Pozner, a state television talk show host. “At this point, there is a little bit of hope and a lot of distrust.”Richard R. Burt, a former American arms control negotiator and a member of a Russian-American group, Global Zero, that is pushing for nuclear disarmament, said Mr. Obama must overcome that suspicion. “I just get the sense that the Russians are kind of grumpy, so there’s still some sharpness on the Russian side, despite pushing the reset button,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Obama faces pressure not to go soft on Russia. He sounded a tough note this week, saying Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin still “has one foot in the old ways.” He is also sending Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to Georgia and Ukraine after the summit meeting to show he will not abandon them.“We’re not going to reassure or give or trade anything with the Russians regarding NATO expansion or missile defense,” said Michael McFaul, the president’s top adviser on Russia.Georgian officials visiting Washington last week said that they had faith in the administration, but they expressed skepticism about a real change in relations. Russia maintains as many as 15,000 troops in two breakaway Georgian republics, despite a cease-fire agreement, and last month it used its veto to end the United Nations observer mission in one of them. Both Russia and NATO recently conducted war games in the region.“Attempts by American officials to talk with them in a civilized manner are perceived as weakness,” Grigol Vashadze, Georgia’s foreign minister, said, comparing Mr. Putin to a bandit. “Of course you can talk with him. But in the end, you know the bandit will end up kicking you and taking your wallet.”Looking for a breakthrough for his visit, Mr. Obama tried to cut a deal to finally admit Russia into the World Trade Organization. But days after Mr. Obama’s advisers visited Russia in June to discuss the idea, Mr. Putin unexpectedly suspended Moscow’s membership bid, dashing hopes for an announcement next week.Russian officials said they were showing good faith, pointing to their suspension of the delivery of an S-300 air defense system to Iran. “In Moscow and in Washington, people have been known to lose opportunities,” said Mikhail V. Margelov, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of Russia’s upper house of Parliament. “We have to hope that this time we won’t lose the opportunity.”The new airspace agreement represents an important step. Until now, Russia has restricted use of its territory for the Afghan war to railroad shipments of nonlethal supplies. Under the new arrangement, officials said, planes carrying lethal equipment and troops will be allowed to make as many as 10 flights a day, or thousands a year over Russia.The agreement was a priority for Mr. Obama, who has ordered 21,000 more American troops to Afghanistan. Supply routes through Pakistan have been troubled by that nation’s increasing volatility. Uzbekistan evicted American troops from a base in 2005, and Kyrgyzstan threatened to do the same, until American negotiators persuaded it to reverse itself, in a deal that increases the rent.But with Mr. Obama about to depart for Moscow, negotiators were still hashing out a preliminary agreement on nuclear arms cuts to announce along with President Dmitri A. Medvedev. The agreement would lay out parameters of a treaty to be drafted by the end of the year to replace the expiring cold war Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.Negotiators are talking about setting a range of perhaps 1,500 to 1,700 warheads (down from 2,200 now allowed under treaty) and 500 to 1,100 delivery vehicles (down from 1,600 currently allowed). But they have not settled on the numbers, and Russia wants to link the issue to missile defense.The two sides have agreed to create a new standing commission with subgroups on issues like climate change to work between presidential meetings. The Obama team at first proposed a new version of a commission in the 1990s named for Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. But the Russians refused to pair Mr. Putin with Mr. Biden. “Putin’s not a vice president,” an American official quoted the Russians as saying.“This is like a midsemester report card,” said Sarah E. Mendelson, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who is organizing a conference on civil society here that Mr. Obama and perhaps Mr. Medvedev will attend. “It’s not looking like an A, but it’s not a D either.”'"
"'09-07-04,'0','“African-Americans,” he said, “represent longer-term challenges because soccer is not as popular in the same way.”The challenges soccer faces are not new, but perhaps more can be done at a time when football and basketball have saturated poorer neighborhoods. The question is how to persuade young athletes to make soccer their sport of choice.“If we can get the star athletes when they are 13, 14, 15, 16 to stay with soccer rather than play other sports where the economic payday down the road may be greater, that would be a plus for us,” Gulati said. “If we can get the best athlete interested in soccer, that’s a plus. We’ve got to do more in that community.”Irv Smalls, the executive director of Harlem Youth Soccer, said the key to tapping the raw resources of economically disadvantaged communities was supporting local youth leagues. These leagues, he said, must become part of the social fabric of the community, as natural a part of life as the corner grocery store.Smalls was part of the traditional sports pipeline. He grew up in Pennsylvania and played football for three seasons at Penn State. Before Harlem Youth Soccer, he worked for Major League Soccer, primarily to gain sports administration experience.After watching the 2002 World Cup, Smalls said, he became so turned on to the sport that he became dedicated to spreading the gospel of soccer in Harlem. It hasn’t been easy and it hasn’t been cheap, but Smalls is convinced that the only way the sport will blossom in communities like Harlem is if the teams are operated and run primarily by African-Americans.Harlem Youth Soccer was founded in 1990 by Dwight and Iris Raiford, who also founded Harlem Little League.“We’re the ones who really know what is in the best interest of our kids,” Smalls said. “It has to be a grass-roots initiative and the movement has to come from the inner city.”Luis Montoya, who founded the Big Apple Youth Soccer League in Queens 11 years ago, made a similar point about Hispanic youth. Local involvement, he said, is essential.“If you are a white man with blue eyes and you are coming to my Latino community, what do you think the parents of my kids are going to think about you?” he said. “The first question will be, What does the white guy want? If I go to the Latino community, I speak to them in their own language. There’s a different approach.”Then there’s Don Sheppard. “I’m a different kind of Latino,” Sheppard said. “I’m Canadian.”Sheppard walked into a Hispanic community in Los Angeles four years ago with resources and a vision. He had just retired and sold his business, and he had a dream: He founded the Los Angeles Futbol Club, which has become one of the most highly regarded youth soccer leagues in the country.Sheppard eliminated the fees that most clubs use to support themselves but which also serve as barriers to wide participation.“Some of the best soccer players, Latino youth, have been left out of the mainstream of soccer because they couldn’t pay,” Sheppard said. “We changed that because we removed the pay-to-play. That’s been a huge barrier.”Last year, the Los Angeles Futbol Club formed an alliance with Chelsea, a club in the English Premier League that has an alliance with two other youth clubs in the United States. Chelsea will provide additional financial support as well as coaching and, for some, an opportunity to train in England once a year.This is all well and good, but the key for soccer to be what it really can be in the United States is local initiative.“We’ve got to build those leagues in the communities,” Sheppard said, “run by people that they trust, coached by people that they trust but supported by people like L.A.F.C., who want to help them get into soccer.”United States soccer officials say the sport’s time is finally here. The question is, do they know how to seize the moment?'"
"'09-07-04,'0','Financially, the total of my savings and new earnings will net out to about $2,000 annually after taxes, thanks mostly to a better savings account rate.That doesn’t quite replace the lost income, but it’s a lot more money than I had before.The real gain here, however, was in establishing a new ritual. I got enough done that I now plan to take a fiscal health day at least once a year, 10 hours on a weekday when all phone lines and financial institutions are open, with no interruptions except for e-mail.Here’s a list of some of the things I knocked off or got started. Or, if you prefer movies to articles, watch the mini-documentary of my day.HIGH-YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT Though Internet savings accounts that pay above-average rates have been around for some time, I haven’t needed one. Now that we’re keeping more cash around in case we want to buy a new place to live, however, it makes sense to enroll.I put our money in an account via SmartyPig, a Web-based savings program. It pays an industry-beating 2.75 percent, though it comes with certain restrictions, like the requirement that you put at least $10 in your account each month.CASH-BACK CREDIT CARD The new Bank Invest First pays a straight 2 percent back into our Schwab brokerage account. That’s 0.75 percentage points better than we were earning with our card. The Schwab card also levies no foreign exchange fees for use outside the .JEWELRY INSURANCE We are paying nearly $400 annually to insure our wedding and engagement rings. Jewelers Mutual, which I’d been meaning to call for more than two years, can do it for about $250, as long as we produce an appraisal.PHONE SERVICE We stripped our landline bare of any long distance or special features and got rid of our DSL service, which we had been using as a backup for our cable Internet connection. That will save about $500 annually, though that savings will be partly offset once we find another backup plan.Not surprisingly, given that we’re talking about the phone company here, this task ate a bigger part of the day than any other. I had to talk to the landline people, the DSL people and the billing people to confirm a switch on the auto-payment system to our card (now that finally accepts it). Of course, I waited on hold, ended up in the wrong call center and had one call dropped. But hopefully, I won’t have to talk to them again for years.NANNY TAX SERVICE I signed up with the Nanny Tax Company in to deal with the quarterly and annual tax filings related to paying our baby sitter on the books. While this costs $425 annually plus a one-time $100 registration fee, the time savings makes this a wash, if not a net gain in money.A representative with our bank at Schwab also explained that it would allow us to make free, regular direct deposits into our baby sitter’s account at a different bank. That means we can create a free, basic payroll service, since we’ll get help calculating withholding amounts from the Nanny Tax Company.WILL We still don’t have one, even though we’ve been parents for three and a half years now. Pathetic and inexcusable. But it won’t be that way for long. We’re considering hiring a lawyer from who is far from our home to save money, and I called three lawyers on fiscal health day looking to price the possibilities. Local lawyers who think this approach is foolish should sound off in the comments on this story. We will finish this task before summer’s end.INSURANCE PAPERWORK If you’re lucky enough to have , you’re probably constantly adrift in a sea of forms that make no sense. We’re no different, but a major snafu caused us to have to switch plans a few months into 2009, throwing everything into utter disarray.On fiscal health day, I got all of the paperwork divided into about a dozen piles to begin our assault on the benefits office and the various insurance companies involved.WHAT TO DO IF WE’RE DEAD gives away a terrific form titled “Organizing your financial life. Critical information at your fingertips.” It’s basically a road map to sorting your financial affairs in case you fall off a large cliff, though Mother Merrill doesn’t quite market it that way. After several years of putting this off, I finally filled out the form on fiscal health day and will send copies to our families soon. There’s a link to the form from the version of this story online.NONPROFIT AUTOPILOT In less than 10 minutes, I put a bunch of our charitable giving on autopilot. We signed up with Networkforgood.org and then asked it to charge our credit card each month and pass along the money to the nonprofit groups. No more end-of-the-year scramble to get donations out, and the institutions will receive more regular income.Network for Good does charge a fee for its service, and it may be possible to set up recurring donations free with individual nonprofit organizations.SHOPPING SPREE Yes, you get to have fun on fiscal health day. Gather up all of your gift cards and spend the money that’s left on them. The longer they sit, the more interest or or the department store will earn from your money and bigger the chance you’ll misplace the card.We had $68.63 that had been on a Barneys card for a while, and I used it to add to my collection of colorful socks. This being Barneys, I needed an extra $15 or so to add a second pair. Still, the beautiful hosiery was a great reward for having finished a bunch of longstanding financial chores.'"

"'09-07-05,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea, Japan and the United States condemned a barrage of short-range missiles fired by North Korea on Saturday, while Russia and China called for calm.North Korea fired seven ballistic missiles into the sea between the Communist state and Japan on Saturday, flouting a United Nations Security Council resolution and sending a message of defiance to the United States on its Independence Day holiday.North Korea has a record of timing missile tests to coincide with July 4; the tests on Saturday constituted the North’s biggest one-day missile barrage since it launched seven missiles on July 4, 2006.After a North Korean nuclear test on May 25, the Council adopted a resolution that, among other sanctions, barred the country from testing ballistic missiles. North Korea had promised that it would respond to the resolution with more tests of its ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons, and followed through on part of that threat on Saturday.The North’s neighbors swiftly condemned the tests. In a statement, Moon Tae-young, a South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman, called them “provocations that clearly violated” the Council resolution.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','What has changed is the financial investment of manufacturers that had contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the sport each year. As part of its reorganization, G.M. eliminated support of the second-tier Nationwide Series and the third-level Camping World Truck Series. There have been cuts in the premier Sprint Cup circuit as well.Petty Motorsports laid off nine employees in June as a result of cutbacks by Chrysler. It has been reported that Petty, the quintessential American racecar driver and owner with a long history of racing Dodges, could be in Toyotas next season, although neither Petty nor Toyota officials have confirmed that possibility.The manufacturer cutbacks come at a time when corporate sponsorship continues to be hard to find. Drivers traditionally had one major sponsor on the hood of their racecar each season. Now, they have two or three companies splitting the estimated $20 million annual cost. That is why there is a scramble to seek out new sponsors — and to woo sponsors from other teams.“The good news for all of us, we don’t see any sponsors looking to leave the sport, but they are looking to not take as big a bite of the rights as they have in the past,” Geoff Smith, the president of Roush Fenway Racing, said Thursday in a telephone interview. “It’s pretty uniform across the sport right now at all levels, where most sponsors of the big teams, the big primary sponsors, are looking to attract additional partners.“I believe that the number of sponsors needed to keep everybody happy in the garage has almost doubled.”As difficult as it has become to find sponsors in the Cup series, the situation is worse in the truck series. Every manufacturer has cut back or is planning to cut back support. Tom DeLoach, the owner of Red Horse Racing, estimated that only five trucks were fully sponsored in a series in which it costs $3 million to $3.5 million to compete.Among the missing is the defending champion, Johnny Benson. He signed with Red Horse after winning the title last year with Bill Davis Racing, which was sold and no longer competes in the truck series. When a sponsorship deal fell through, DeLoach went ahead with the team, believing he would find sponsorship.“We started the season without a sponsor on that truck, trying to say, well, he’s the defending champion, so we should be able to go out and find another sponsor,” DeLoach said Wednesday in a telephone interview. “After several months of trying to make that work, after a while, you have to face reality that it’s not working.”The team was suspended June 8. The long-term viability of the truck series is unknown.“Based on what we’re seeing, there is always going to be a customer in this country, in my opinion, who is going to need to buy a pickup truck,” the Toyota Racing Development president, Lee White, said Friday in a telephone interview. “Consequently, I think the truck series probably is still viable. Now, does it need some adjusting and tweaking and so on? Well, perhaps. But that’s up to the Nascar guys to figure out, and based on conversations I’ve had, I think that they’re giving it a serious look and see if there is some changes they need to make.”Perhaps the biggest change that could come to Nascar would be the addition of new manufacturers. Once a feared possibility, the infusion of money would no doubt be welcome now. France said other manufacturers had expressed interest in Nascar. But given the time needed to start a program, it will probably be years before a newcomer is racing.In the meantime, Nascar will have to brace itself. After an off-season that included mergers and a reduction in the number of competitive teams, the worst may not be over.“I don’t think the full impact of this economic recession will show up for a couple more years when some of the longer-term contracts shrink up,” Smith said. “I think we’re going to see some continued contraction.“It’s always been tougher on the people who couldn’t quite get the performance done on the racetrack.”That might be why Petty was happily sipping wine in victory lane.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','To gain a foothold in that market, Terranea is offering rooms for as little as $145 a night.As the economy declined last fall, Mr. Lowe knew that there could be cash-flow challenges for the new hotel, and he began planning ahead. “We weren’t going to put ourselves in a position where we were going to open and then run out of cash a week later,” he said in a recent telephone interview.In the months leading up to the opening, Mr. Lowe said he explored a number of ways “to create some additional liquidity to fund operating losses in this tough environment.”As it turned out, the usual sources were not forthcoming. “It’s difficult and expensive to borrow in this market,” Mr. Lowe said.So Mr. Lowe looked for help closer to home. Rancho Palos Verdes, a city of about 40,000, had expected to collect a room tax of 10 percent, which it hoped would create a revenue stream of more than $4 million a year.Lowe Hospitality asked the city to rebate the tax — known as the transient occupancy tax — for 10 years. Unless it received the rebate, company officials suggested, Terranea might not be able to open.After weeks of negotiation, the City Council approved a deal to rebate four-fifths of the hotel tax revenue to Terranea over 34 months, up to a total of $8.2 million. The agreement requires Lowe to repay the rebated tax, as well as interest, by the end of 2013, with a possible one-year extension.Douglas Stern was one of the council members who voted in favor of the rebate plan. “In my mind, it was a very close call,” Mr. Stern said, adding, “We’re not a bank.”Not everyone favored the arrangement.Dennis McLean, the director of finance for Rancho Palos Verdes, wrote in a report that the deal was “not fiscally prudent.” He based his recommendation, in part, on a study by HVS, a hotel consulting company hired by the city. HVS told the city that “economic recovery in the hospitality industry is not expected until 2013 at the earliest.” That could mean at least four lean years for Terranea.Mr. Lowe said he agreed with HVS that the hotel industry “won’t completely stabilize” until 2012 or 2013. But he predicted that “things will begin turning around long before that.”The Lowe Hospitality Group, a division of Lowe Enterprises, where Robert J. Lowe Sr. is the chief executive, operates more than 30 hotels, including the Inn and Spa at Loretto in Santa Fe, N.M., and the Driskill Hotel in Austin, Tex.Residents who spoke at the council meetings were largely in favor of the rebate, according to Ken Dyda, a former mayor of Rancho Palos Verdes. “At each meeting, two or three people opposed it, mainly on philosophical grounds,” he said. But most people, he said, “wanted Terranea to get off to a good start.”Mr. Dyda says he thinks that Terranea would have opened even without the rebate. “You can’t take a $480 million facility and just close it down,” he said.BUT he said he was worried that the hotel might be making its debut without all the services that guests expected, including formal and informal restaurants and a 50,000-square-foot spa. “And that wouldn’t have helped Terranea or the city,” he said. (The hotel did, in fact, open with all the amenities.)As part of the deal, which the council approved on a 4-to-0 vote, Lowe agreed to give Rancho Palos Verdes residents a 25 percent discount at the hotel.At the same time it is working to fill hotel rooms, Lowe is trying to sell the 82 condominiums on the resort property. Mr. Lowe said 49 of the units had been reserved, at prices from $2 million to $4.5 million. But closings have yet to begin and, he conceded, “there will be some fallout.”“A lot of people don’t have the same financial capability they had three years ago,” he added. “Including me.”Still, Mr. Lowe said, he is glad that Terranea opened this spring instead of a year ago.“If we had opened in 2008, we would have been caught off guard by the market,” he said. “At least we had a year of preparing ourselves for the market that we were in, rather than being surprised.”'"
"'09-07-05,'0','Last year, after taking big losses, investors often fretted about the real possibility of losing capital invested in stocks.Today, investors are rushing back into them — nearly $40 billion of new money has poured into stock funds since the end of March — and are acting as if their biggest risk is being left behind by a rebounding market.“It’s the opposite of panic selling — it’s panic buying,” said Greg Schultz, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors, a financial planning firm in Walnut Creek, Calif.The fear is that they’ll miss out on an opportunity to quickly make back last year’s losses, especially if it turns out that the economy is really improving and an enduring bull market has begun.But what if the underlying assumption that has driven this rally — that the economy is on the mend and that a recovery will occur by year-end — is wrong? What if the economy takes longer to heal?For now, though, many investors are counting on a robust recovery.He noted that the Russell survey found that professional investors were favoring economically sensitive market sectors, while shifting out of defensive areas like consumer staples.“Managers are now positioning their portfolios to take advantage of an economy that’s set to grow,” he said.But if investors don’t see confirmation in the coming data — for instance, if economic reports point to further troubles in the housing market — “it’s not going to take much for them to start selling off,” he said.In fact, there is a growing sense among economists and market watchers that investors have moved stock prices far ahead of the economic fundamentals.In a recent report, Stephen Biggar, director of global equity research at Standard & Poor’s, noted that in a recovery, stocks typically anticipate how the economy is likely to be faring six months down the road. Today, he wrote, “the market is already discounting the level of improvement we likely won’t see until mid- to late 2010.”Yet Mr. Biggar warned that there is a strong possibility that the economic rebound would be hindered by slow job creation, continued weakness in housing, higher interest rates and rising oil prices.If the economy fails to meet expectations, there is another cause for concern: the possibility that investors who’ve been diving back into the market will be punished a second time — compounding their losses in the recent downturn by buying stocks just before another drop. Then some shellshocked investors will sell at a loss.Buying and selling at the wrong time is a common hazard in markets that shift gears so quickly, as this one did back in March.Lately, there has been much buying of the flavor of the month — the previous month, that is.“In March, it was high-quality bonds; now its emerging-markets stocks,” Mr. Schultz said. “You can buy what did well just recently, but you have to remember that that doesn’t get you any of the profits those investments have already rung up.”Mike Scarborough, the president of Scarborough Capital Management, an investment advisory service in Annapolis, Md., warns that even if this rally is real, history shows that recoveries don’t send stock prices straight up.Typically after a bear market, some investors begin to question the sustainability of the initial surge and sell into the rally. This can push prices back down, and make the market “retest” its lows.This happened after the bear market in October 2002. After an initial post-bear run-up that lifted stock prices more than 21 percent, the S.& P. 500-stock index fell 15 percent from Nov. 27, 2002, to March 11, 2003.MR. SCARBOROUGH says he is concerned that investors now rushing into the market are likely to exit once the market retests its lows.“The risk you run, going from abject fear over to greed so quickly, is that you’ll run into a huge whipsaw,” he said. “That’s the very reason why you’re supposed to have a disciplined asset-allocation plan in place,” where you commit a certain percentage of your portfolio to stocks and a certain percentage to bonds at all times — regardless of market conditions.Unfortunately, Mr. Scarborough said, “just as the sun rises and sets, people are going to chase returns.”'"
"'09-07-05,'0','Yet Ms. Palin is in a different place than was Nixon, or any other politician who has gone the rehabilitation route. She is viewed disparagingly by many of the elites in her party, no matter how many conservative Republicans have flocked to her. She has grown increasingly unpopular in her own state and nationally; 43 percent of respondents questioned nationally in a CNN Poll in May viewed her unfavorably, compared with 21 percent shortly after Senator John McCain of Arizona chose her as his running mate last August.And unlike Nixon’s, Ms. Palin’s credentials are a weak point. Nixon had been a vice president, a senator and a member of the House, while Ms. Palin is in her first term as governor of Alaska.By stepping down before finishing her term, she cannot claim to be even a one-term governor. Without a positive record of accomplishment as governor, Ms. Palin may find she has little to run on as she seeks to achieve a critical political goal: expanding her appeal beyond the conservative voters who crowd her rallies and write checks on her behalf.“I think a lot of it has been unfair, but, fair or unfair, there has been a question in the eyes of most Republican primary voters about whether she has demonstrated an ability to govern,” said Sara Taylor, who was the White House political director under President George W. Bush. “So the best opportunity you have to demonstrate you can lead is to do it, and you can’t lead if you don’t have a platform.”“So I do think that this is a mistake if she wants to run for office,” Ms. Taylor said. “It’s a brilliant move if she wants to go make money, write books and give speeches, and I don’t think anybody could fault her for that.”If one of Ms. Palin’s goals was to erase the perception of her as flighty, a perception encouraged by some McCain lieutenants in the rough aftermath of the failed campaign, it certainly could not have been helped to have staged an out-of-the-blue announcement that shocked even her closest aides and whose theatrics probably tempted Tina Fey and the “Saturday Night Live” production crew to abandon their vacations and head to the studio.“I can’t imagine that anyone saw this coming,” said former State Senator Kim Elton, a Democrat who is now director of Alaska affairs for the interior secretary. “I think the consensus in Alaska was she had her eye on the prize and that the way to get that was being governor.”And if another of Ms. Palin’s goals was, as she suggested, to put an end to the rush of what she described as hectoring investigations from the news media, the sheer frenzy of the reaction to her decision was a reminder of how difficult that might prove to be. Even her lawyer put out a statement late Saturday denying what he called “false and defamatory allegations” that her resignation stemmed from a criminal investigation.It is unclear precisely what Ms. Palin intends to do. The assumption, given her remarks and record over the past year, is that she sees an opportunity now, with the ranks of potential Republican presidential candidates so depleted.In fact, assuming she has any interest in staying in national politics, she might be more interested in filling another vacuum and positioning herself as the de facto leader of the social conservative movement. Even if she did not run herself, she could be extremely influential as Republicans move to choose a presidential candidate in 2012, given the power conservatives have in the party nomination process.And there is an argument, advanced by some of her supporters, that this might be a risk worth taking, given the problems she has had as a national figure.Even if serving as governor might have allowed her to build up a record to run for higher office, as Ms. Taylor argued, her departure removes what has proved to be a bruising political environment at home. Not incidentally, it frees her to move closer to where the action is in the 2012 presidential race.“And she has a following that will jump in front of a plane for her,” said John Coale, a lawyer who helped create her political action committee. “If she takes this time to develop that base, she could be a real force in the Republican Party, and maybe run.”Jonah Goldberg, an editor at large at the conservative National Review Online, posted an open letter to Ms. Palin even before she announced her decision, urging her to use the time before the 2012 race to fill in what he said were deficiencies in her knowledge that had hampered her as a vice-presidential candidate.“So here’s my advice,” Mr. Goldberg wrote. “Stay home and do your job and your homework. You’ll still be a national figure come the primaries. But if you can’t surprise your detractors with your grasp of policy when you re-emerge on the national stage, you won’t win the nomination. More important, you won’t deserve to.”Yet the dominant reaction of Republicans has been befuddlement. Her move may play well with her strongest supporters, but her political instincts and stability were once again being questioned in other circles of the party, which had already been wary of her after the election last year. That is hardly a development Ms. Palin could welcome as her party looks for a candidate who can endure what could be a very tough race in 2012.“Somebody has to explain to Republicans how this woman is going to expand her support base,” said John Weaver, a former adviser to Mr. McCain.“Yes, she is the darling of a certain element of our party,” Mr. Weaver said. “But it remains to be seen — in fact, it remains rather doubtful she can grow beyond that.”'"
"'09-07-05,'0','“I think they have missed a very important opportunity of demonstrating their willingness to commit to achieving reconciliation of all political leaders,” the secretary general said.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi has been on trial, facing a prison term for breaking the conditions of her lengthy house arrest by sheltering an American who swam across a lake to her house because he had a vision about her. Mr. Ban said he was told that he could not visit her because “they did not want to be seen as being interfered with or pressured from the outside.”The basic reaction from the State Peace and Development Council, as the five-member junta calls itself, seemed to be that while it was happy to welcome Mr. Ban, it was not particularly interested in his message. The front page of the English-language daily New Light of Myanmar featured a picture of Mr. Ban meeting with General Than Shwe, but the article merely listed the members of the delegation, referring to it as a social call.After his overtures met a cool reception, Mr. Ban spent his last hour in the country delivering a public speech — rare for an outsider in Myanmar. Addressing an audience of humanitarian organizations and the diplomatic corps, he warned the leadership that the country’s future prosperity hinged on opening up.Saying Myanmar sits stagnant amid Asia’s economic miracle, the secretary general noted the country’s human rights record is a matter “of grave concern.”“The question today is this: how much longer can Myanmar afford to wait for national reconciliation, democratic transition and respect for human rights?” he said.Mr. Ban was criticized for embarking on the trip by some Western governments, notably the United States and France, which viewed it as window dressing for the junta without any guarantee of progress. But even as Mr. Ban left empty-handed, a senior United Nations official defended the visit.“This says that the secretary general can’t go out and talk to questionable regimes anywhere in the world without putting a label on them,” said the senior official, speaking anonymously according to United Nations guidelines. He said any outcome from the visit would hinge on how the junta treated the elections. “The real question is will they take on board the statements that are there and will it affect the process,” the official said.Other Security Council members, like Britain, supported the visit as a means to get a dialogue going with the junta toward diminishing its isolation and improving its record on human and civil rights.But it was unclear that the ruling generals see it that way. The senior official quoted General Than Shwe as saying that the next time the secretary general visited, the leader would be an average citizen. That implies that the next visit would come after the elections expected in early 2010. The military plans on a civilian government that, among other measures in the new Constitution, reserves one quarter of the seats in the new Parliament for the officer corps.Analysts suggested that it was time for a different approach.“Trying to broker a deal between the generals and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been a graveyard for foreign mediators for nearly two decades,” said Thant Myint-U, the author of a history of Myanmar, previously called Burma, entitled “The River of Lost Footsteps” and a former United Nations official. “I think it may be time for a slightly more creative approach to addressing Burma’s challenges.”Mr. Ban visited Myanmar a year ago in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, which killed some 138,000 people. He won praise then for persuading the country’s recalcitrant generals to reverse themselves and allow foreign aid.On Saturday, Myanmar officials showed off a village of some 60 wooden houses with tin roofs that housed several hundred people who lost their homes.“Comparing the situation which I saw last year, this is quite a different improvement,” Mr. Ban said of Kyan Da village in the Irrawaddy Delta. “I am glad the government has taken necessary measures.”Foreign relief workers called Kyan Da a Potemkin showcase, where each house cost about $2,000 and ran about 300 square feet, far beyond their United Nations-approved budget of about $200 for a 160-square-foot shelter. At the same time, the government was insisting that some lower-cost shelters be torn down as unsightly at a time when about 130,000 people are still without shelters, they said, out of the original 500,000 homeless.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','NO surprise, perhaps, but Natasha Khan, the British singer better known as Bat for Lashes, has a thing for costumes.On stage and in videos she wears feathers and animal heads, new wave makeup and shredded T-shirts, an expression of her hipster chic as well as her musical aesthetic: girlish but cloaked in grit. (At her debut show in New York in 2007, half the girls were already aping her style, with thin headbands worn over dark bangs.)So on a recent visit to the city, before a summer tour to support her album “Two Suns,” Ms. Khan went right for a favorite hangout, New York Costumes in the East Village.“I love dressing up,” she said, pulling a barmaid outfit off a rack. Too overtly sexy (Ms. Khan, 29, is striking but underplays it). A Superman cape met with more approval. “I quite like androgyny,” she said. She knocked on the stiff chest of a Batman costume (“Oooh!”) and wandered in search of something bat-like to fit her. “There’s a place near my house, I buy all my skeletons and animal heads there,” she said. No such luck here, but she did like the store’s soundtrack, singing along to “If I Only Had a Brain” from “The Wizard of Oz.”An hour later, having bought a feathered mask (to wear as a hat), some glittery makeup and a fake stuffed raven for the stage, Ms. Khan headed to Freemans on the Lower East Side to meet her bandmates. Charlotte Hatherley, the guitarist, and Sarah Jones, the drummer, turned up, but Ben Christophers didn’t, so it was a girls’ night.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','Mr. Adamo likened the current mortgage market to a barbell, with pockets of availability for borrowers at both ends of the income spectrum but less for those in between. Those with annual incomes up to about $250,000 have access to mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration, while the very affluent can obtain loans from private banking institutions.For borrowers with household incomes between $250,000 and $500,000, however, mortgages are not as easy to get, Mr. Adamo said. “These people are living in places where starter homes might be $1 million,” he said, “and it’s really affecting them.”Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will accept only loans below $729,500 in the highest-cost markets like New York City and northern New Jersey. For mortgages larger than that, mortgage brokers and bankers must find other investors who want to take the loans. (Mortgage brokers process the applications on a lender’s behalf, while mortgage bankers will finance the loan and sell it shortly thereafter.)When the mortgage market collapsed last year, investors wanted nothing to do with conventional home loans, much less jumbo mortgages, which represented greater risk in a slumping economy and crippled housing market.Jumbo loans are still available, but they often come with stringent qualifications. They are offered by so-called community banks, like Astoria Federal and Hudson City Savings Bank, which make the loans and keep them on their books rather than sell them to investors.Mr. Adamo said that before the market’s collapse, borrowers of jumbo mortgages could qualify for loans with a 5 percent down payment, credit scores of 620 and enough cash in the bank to cover two months of payments. Now, they must generally have six months’ reserves, a 700 credit score and a down payment of at least 20 percent.According to Monte N. Redman, Astoria Federal’s president, the bank has tightened its jumbo-mortgage lending requirements not just because it is logical to do so in a bad economy, but also because it has so little competition. “We’ve tightened things significantly, because we can,” he said.To buy a home with a jumbo mortgage of less than $1 million, Astoria’s borrowers must have a down payment of at least 25 percent; and for mortgages above $1 million, borrowers must have 30 percent. Astoria’s jumbo borrowers must also have more cash on hand than a year ago, Mr. Redman said. On loans below $1 million, borrowers need 25 percent of the loan’s amount in reserves, and that figure increases as the loan amount grows.The difference between interest rates on jumbo and conventional loans has recently been around 1.5 percentage points, compared with less than a percentage point in July 2008, according to Mr. Adamo of Luxury Mortgage. Last week, a 30-year fixed-rate jumbos loan averaged 6.47 percent, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher. The average rate on a similar conventional loan was 5.32 percent, according to Freddie Mac.Astoria Federal does not offer fixed-rate jumbo mortgages. But Mr. Redman said that rates are particularly attractive for 5/1 jumbo ARMs, where rates hold steady for the first five years, then adjust in accordance with Treasury bill rates. Last week, Astoria Federal’s rate was 4.5 percent. Borrowers who take these loans are essentially betting that interest rates will remain modest in five years.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','A blunt slogan and a simple image: these basic elements of persuasion, protest, propaganda or making a point have been used in tandem and to great effect for as long as anyone reading this has been alive. Presumably, these messages have always been received in a variety of ways. But these days, it seems, when a slogan and an image reach a significant audience, that’s not the end of the process. In fact it’s just the beginning.For example, when red posters bearing the sans-serif slogan “Keep Calm and Carry On” underneath a simple crown icon started catching on in Britain a few years back, Bex Lewis knew their provenance. Now an associate lecturer in history and media studies at the University of Winchester, Lewis wrote her Ph.D. thesis on British propaganda posters devised for the home front during World War II. The “Keep Calm” poster, meant to be distributed in the event of a German invasion, was extremely obscure for many decades. So she was interested, she recalls, to see it turning into “sort of a consumer item.”That process began with a fluke: in 2000, Stuart and Mary Manley, owners of a shop called Barter Books in north England, found one of the original posters folded up in the bottom of a box of old books and framed it. Customers liked it, and eventually the Manleys decided to sell reproductions. “Part of it is that it does have this sort of intrinsic British feel about it,” Mary Manley says, adding that the poster evokes a “nostalgia for a certain British character, an outlook.”On a less romantic note, the design is in the public domain, meaning it can be remade and sold by anybody. A British freelance television-production manager named Mark Coop, for one, decided it “would be a brilliant idea to put it on a T-shirt.” In 2006, he bought the domain name keepcalmandcarryon.com, and offers the slogan and design on a variety of goods, including cuff links and duffel bags. Around the same time, Victoria Smith, a San Francisco Bay Area design blogger and photographer, bought one of the Barter Books posters secondhand and ended up producing her own silk-screen “Keep Calm” prints in a variety of color variations that she sells on Etsy.com. Barter Books has added mugs and mouse pads to its lineup. (Relations among these sellers are not particularly friendly; each complains of copycats selling low-quality versions.)It turned out that the “Keep Calm” merchandise resonated all over the world. “Germany’s really big on it, oddly enough,” Coop observes. The banking crisis, Smith adds, brought a wave of orders from people working for American financial firms (and, more recently, advertising agencies). In fact, the travails of the global economy seem to have given the slogan fresh relevance to many — as reassurance for some but as creative fodder for others. For instance, one T-shirt design tips the crown upside down and reads “Now Panic and Freak Out.”'"
"'09-07-05,'0','If an issue “devoted to architecture and infrastructure would be incomplete without architects,” the vision of future infrastructure offered in the June 14 issue is curiously lacking. The most exciting infrastructure advances today are not being developed by architects. Urban designers and landscape architects are creating public spaces that double as water-treatment facilities; new businesses are using cars to transform energy distribution and storage; artists are rethinking municipal waste facilities; product designers are making it possible to aggregate individuals’ choices to create real change; and engineers are inventing transformative technologies right now.The infrastructures of the 21st century will undoubtedly take on visible form and create public benefits as suggested by Grimshaw Architects et al. But they will do so because they integrate the expertise of planners, designers and engineers. These interdisciplinary teams are already creating new visions of what urban infrastructure can be — visions The New York Times should be celebrating, as they are the future systems we need.While thrilled by the Infrastructure issue of The New York Times Magazine, I was struck by a gaping absence. Here in New York City, we are undergoing our own infrastructure revolution, and yet I didn’t see even a cursory mention of it. In our own backyard, we are in the process of gaining bus rapid transit, protected bike lanes (one on Ninth Avenue reduced collisions between bikes and cars by more than 40 percent) and traffic islands’ making street intersections safer for children, the disabled and the elderly. And pedestrianization! Don’t get me started! Locals, tourists and the upper crust are mixing, with laughter and sandwiches, in the middle of new plazas in Madison Square, the Meatpacking District and Times Square. The work and the vision of our own local hero Janette Sadik-Khan [commissioner of the city’s Department of Transportation] and her staff deserve praise and a lengthy feature article in the next New York Times Magazine.New YorkIn “Bridging the Gap,” Henry Petroskifocused on bridges, the most visible infrastructure. But he ignored the invisible infrastructure: aging underground water and wastewater pipes that are rupturing at an increasing rate. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives these aspects of our underground infrastructure a grade of D-minus. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency there are more than a million miles of underground pipes; many are getting old. Our own utility has had more than 4,000 breaks and leaks among our water pipes in the last two years. Please don’t forget the underground pipeline. Our lives depend on clean water.I applaud Henry Petroski for his timely essay about our need to rethink the way we build infrastructure. With stimulus money providing a fraction of what is needed, the current administration must support a highway reauthorization bill capable of improving our crumbling roads and bridges. In addition to sufficient funding, governments can and should use alternative delivery methods to get “best value” proposals for their projects, as the success of the Interstate 35 W bridge demonstrates. One such alternative is public-private partnerships, through which governments can borrow money from the private sector and pay it back over a longer period of time than is traditionally possible with municipal bonds. This means cash-strapped states can build projects immediately without raising taxes or diving deeper into debt.With a viable model already working in Canada and elsewhere, the United States should adopt these proven methods to finance and build our much needed public infrastructure.Thank you for Jim Lewis’s thoughtful piece on humane prison design (“Behind Bars . . . Sort Of”). Our organization has collected the signatures of more than 1,000 architects (and their supporters) who have pledged not to design prisons in the United States — not because we oppose the type of humanism displayed by Josef Hohensinn’s design at Loeben, but because U.S. prisons are failures irrespective of their design. The facts we rely on were thoughtfully and cogently presented in the article, but our conclusion is different from the implication that better architecture cannot reverse the social injustices and policy failures of today’s American criminal-justice system but will only make it larger and capable of warehousing more people. Perhaps when American criminal justice is based on the concept of respect for human dignity in all circumstances, as Hohensinn so eloquently carved into his building, we will be ready for a new generation of prisons. For now, more prisons just expand the space for the racism, violence, antidrug hysteria and contempt for the poor that pervade the “tough on crime” demagoguery of too many American politicians and their supporters. In other words, before American architects can follow Mr. Hohensinn, we must have “clients” who are willing to challenge the current attitudes toward criminal justice. We hope this article will move the conversation in that direction.'"
"'09-07-05,'0','Just a few weeks after opening in an old tool shop in Copenhagen’s trendy meat-packing district in February, BioMio was already doing brisk dinner-hour business. Under the soft light of energy-saving bulbs in the large, open dining room (painted a chemical-free off-white), chic young Danes were gathered at ecologically logged oak tables, eating happily.In Denmark, one of the European Union’s largest per capita consumers of organic foods and one of the greenest places on earth, Karsten Hoydal decided two years ago that the time was right for an entirely organic restaurant in which every aspect, from the wait staff’s Fairtrade organic cotton uniforms to the ventilation system, is thought through in terms of environmental sustainability.“I was inspired by my wife, who was very big on buying organic products,” said Mr. Hoydal, 35, who was working as a marketing manager for a large food conglomerate at the time. Once he had the idea for an organic-only restaurant, Mr. Hoydal started thinking about the restaurant’s operations. “We thought, if we are going to do this, we have to do it 100 percent,” he said.Induction ventilators, for example, recycle the heat produced by the kitchen. Hand soaps in the bathroom and detergents in the kitchen are certified nontoxic according to strict Danish standards. The dishwashing staff is trained in water conservation. Carbon footprints are calculated before Danish hothouse tomatoes are ordered instead of their African-grown counterparts. Fifty percent of the menu changes each season to keep meat and produce as local as possible. Even the German-made china is one of the most environmentally friendly available, thanks to the way in which it was fired.The dishes, which BioMio brought in a nutritionist to help develop, are vegetable-loaded, simple and tasty. With its clean lines, good lighting, and relaxed atmosphere, the restaurant struck me as the perfect place for when you want something healthy to eat but can’t or don’t want to cook at home. By Copenhagen’s standards, BioMio is also inexpensive, at 200 kroner (about $37 at 5.45 kroner to the dollar), on average, for a meal with a drink.Mr. Hoydal said BioMio is hoping to expand as a chain, first in Denmark, then internationally. He added that while there were lots of challenges that come with being green, it feels good to be giving it a go. “What we thought is: you have to start.”'"

It was often the club of choice for pitch and chip shots and some recovery situations near the green.This year, Cleveland Golf has resurrected the niblick name in a club that might best be called a short-iron hybrid. It combines elements of a putter, a wedge, an iron and a hybrid. The Cleveland Niblick has a protruding rear flange like a hybrid and is 20 grams heavier than a standard wedge. It has a 35-inch shaft more like a putter and an upright lie, so the usual stroke is a little more like a putter stroke. The wide sole has eight degrees of bounce. There’s also a vibration-dampening material behind the sweet spot and something called zip grooves.So what do you have when you hold it in your hands?If you are not terribly confident chipping and pitching, the Cleveland Niblick ($109.99, golfgalaxy.com) is likely to give you new self-assurance because it gets the ball airborne quickly and promotes solid contact. It’s good out of the rough near greens, and because it comes in 37- and 42-degree models, it will be the right club for some approach shots.Like longer hybrid clubs, the Cleveland Niblick just looks easy to hit. If you already have a set of wedges you love, this isn’t the club for you. If you’re searching for some short-game feel, the modern niblick may lead you out of the darkness of skulled or fat shots. Now we need someone to get to work on the hybrid mashie.'"
"'09-07-06,'1','Bemis, a Midwestern packaging maker, said late Sunday that it had agreed to buy the American operations of Alcan Packaging, a unit of Rio Tinto, for $1.2 billion in cash and stock.Through the deal, Bemis, based in Neenah, Wis., will gain 23 packaging sites in North America, South America and New Zealand, and nearly 4,600 employees. The unit, Food Americas, reported $1.5 billion in sales and $166 million in profit for 2008.Alcan Packaging is a Paris-based unit of Rio Tinto, the giant international mining company that has recently come under pressure to reduce its $39 billion in debt. Much of that was incurred by Rio Tinto’s 2007 purchase of Alcan, Alcan Packaging’s Canadian parent.Even before it was acquired by Rio Tinto, Alcan had put up its entire packaging unit for sale, but it could not fetch bids for the whole operation throughout 2007 and 2008. But it eventually relented, and earlier this year began talks with Bemis, which had been interested in parts of Alcan Packaging for several years, over Food Americas, according to a person briefed on the matter.“Both Bemis and Alcan Packaging have strong, collaborative relationships with renowned food and consumer products customers,” Henry Thiesen, Bemis’s chief executive, said in a statement. “In pooling our resources, we will diversify our existing technologies and product lines, which will broaden our product offering and augment our technical capabilities.”Bemis said it expected the Food Americas purchase to add to its earnings by next year. Bemis expects the deal to increase its annual sales by 40 percent, to about $5.3 billion. The deal is to close by year end.'"
"'09-07-06,'1','Either way, though, her 10 months on the national stage have been a dispiriting period for American democracy.If Palin were exactly what her critics believe she is — the distillation of every right-wing pathology, from anti-intellectualism to apocalyptic Christianity — then she wouldn’t be a terribly interesting figure. But this caricature has always missed the point of the governor’s appeal — one that extends well outside the Republican Party’s shrinking base.In a recent Pew poll, 44 percent of Americans regarded Palin unfavorably. But slightly more had a favorable impression of her. That number included 46 percent of independents, and 48 percent of Americans without a college education.That last statistic is a crucial one. Palin’s popularity has as much to do with class as it does with ideology. In this sense, she really is the perfect foil for . Our president represents the meritocratic ideal — that anyone, from any background, can grow up to attend Columbia and Law School and become a great American success story. But Sarah Palin represents the democratic ideal — that anyone can grow up to be a great success story without graduating from Columbia and Harvard.This ideal has had a tough 10 months. It’s been tarnished by Palin herself, obviously. With her missteps, scandals, dreadful interviews and self-pitying monologues, she’s botched an essential democratic role — the ordinary citizen who takes on the elites, the up-by-your-bootstraps role embodied by politicians from Andrew Jackson down to .But it’s also been tarnished by the elites themselves, in the way that the media and political establishments have treated her.Here are lessons of the Sarah Palin experience, for any aspiring politician who shares her background and her sex. Your children will go through the tabloid wringer. Your religion will be mocked and misrepresented. Your political record will be distorted, to better parody your family and your faith. (And no, gentle reader, Palin did not insist on abstinence-only sex education, slash funds for special-needs children or inject creationism into public schools.)Male commentators will attack you for parading your children. Female commentators will attack you for not staying home with them. You’ll be sneered at for how you talk and how many colleges you attended. You’ll endure gibes about your “slutty” looks and your “white trash concupiscence,” while a prominent female academic declares that your “greatest hypocrisy” is the “pretense” that you’re a woman. And eight months after the election, the professionals who pressed you into the service of a gimmicky, dreary, idea-free campaign will still be blaming you for their defeat.All of this had something to do with ordinary partisan politics. But it had everything to do with Palin’s gender and her social class.Sarah Palin is beloved by millions because her rise suggested, however temporarily, that the old American aphorism about how anyone can grow up to be president might actually be true.But her unhappy sojourn on the national stage has had a different moral: Don’t even think about it.'"
"'09-07-06,'1','PartnerRe, a reinsurance company, said Sunday it had agreed to buy a smaller European competitor, Paris Re, in an all-stock deal valued at $2 billion.The deal will add about $1.4 billion of gross written premiums to PartnerRe, which is based in Bermuda. The merged company will have nearly 1,400 employees and nearly $23 billion in total assets.Under the terms of the deal, PartnerRe will purchase a 57 percent stake in Paris Re, paying 0.3 of its shares for every Paris Re share, or $19.38 at PartnerRe’s closing price of $64.60 on Friday. PartnerRe in recent weeks had already acquired a 6 percent stake in Paris Re.That portion of the deal will essentially buy out Paris Re’s private equity investors, who formed the company in 2006 by acquiring AXA’s reinsurance business. The buyout firms, including Stone Point Capital and Hellman & Friedman, took Paris Re public on Euronext in 2007.Before that part of the deal closes, expected sometime in the fourth quarter, Paris Re will distribute $310 million in cash to its shareholders. Afterward, PartnerRe will begin a tender offer for the remaining Paris Re shares at the same price.PartnerRe first began exploring a deal with Paris Re last year, Patrick Thiele, PartnerRe’s chief executive, said on Sunday. PartnerRe had been seeking to increase its assets to provide a buffer against potential shocks in the insurance sector, and Paris Re’s clean balance sheet and focus on reinsurance made it an attractive target, he said.“We think this acquisition secures our future for some time, no matter what the environment will be in the next year or two,” Mr. Thiele said.'"
"'09-07-06,'1','Companies like SunGard Data Systems, Smurfit Kappa and VNU have done so-called amend-to-extend deals in the last few months, paying in most cases a small fee as well as a higher interest rate. For example, SunGard extended $2.5 billion of a $4.2 billion loan by three years, paying lenders an additional 1.9 percentage points in interest and a one-time quarter-point fee, according to Leveraged Commentary and Data.That sounds good for lenders — they get paid more and don’t have to worry as much about the refinancing squeeze down the line. And in a number of cases, the revised loans have traded higher than the residual nonmodified debt in the secondary market. But borrowers seem to have gotten the better deal from some of these modifications.Consider a borrower’s alternative, which is to refinance an entire loan. Then, it would have to abide by the stricter covenants and otherwise less-forgiving terms now demanded by creditors. It would also have to offer them an upfront price discount. By instead just modifying an existing loan written during the borrower-friendly credit glut of several years ago, it can avoid the full extent of market changes since then. And a loan modification requires only the consent of 50.1 percent of lenders, so borrowers may find it easier to get controversial terms approved.Some borrowers have actually managed to use the process to loosen covenants. SunGard, for example, eased some of the borrowing and debt limits written into its loan. Such changes would probably have been impossible to secure had the company been forced to completely refinance its loan. But by modifying only part of it, SunGard, a financial technology company, needed to persuade just half of its banks to play along.Of course, the nonmodified parts of these loans still have the original covenants. But if the borrower later modifies the remainder of its loan, as many are expected to do, it may be able to wriggle free.Granted, tweaking a loan to reduce the probability of default can be valuable for a lender, especially at a time when creditors’ recoveries from bankrupt borrowers are running below their long-term average of about 40 percent. So borrowers are right to take a strong stand when negotiating a modification. But the prospect of making concessions during a credit drought must nonetheless stick in lenders’ craws.'"
"'09-07-06,'1','The publisher of The Washington Post apologized to the paper’s readers on Sunday after a controversy erupted over the company’s plans to organize sponsored meetings that would include Washington lobbyists, government officials and the paper’s own journalists.The Post canceled the first of what it billed as exclusive “salons” at the home of the publisher, Katharine Weymouth, after critics accused the paper of seeking to profit from its access to members of Congress and administration officials.Ms. Weymouth, in a letter to readers that appeared on the opinion page Sunday, wrote that “firm parameters” had not been followed in planning the events. These included having reporters and editors participate as moderators and not setting any limits on what questions they can ask.“Our mistake was to suggest that we would hold and participate in an off-the-record dinner with journalists and power-brokers paid for by a sponsor,” she wrote.She added that if The Post were to hold any such event, “everything would be at arm’s length — sponsors would have no control over the content of the discussions, and no special access to our journalists.”'"
"'09-07-06,'1','Mr. Biden’s visit has heartened Iraq’s political elite somewhat, reassuring them that they had not been abandoned, though the question remains whether Mr. Biden can make a difference.Indeed, the troubles he is hoping to solve are those that stymied three previous ambassadors and President George W. Bush: political reconciliation between different ethnic and sectarian groups; a hydrocarbon law that will provide revenue to all of Iraq; and, tied to both knotty problems, a resolution of the disputed border between the Kurdish region and the rest of Iraq.“This is truly mission unaccomplished in the larger scheme of things,” said Barham Salih, the deputy prime minister, a Kurd.“Iraq may have been stabilized, Al Qaeda might have trouble regrouping, we may not need General Odierno day in and day out doing operations,” he said, referring to the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno. “All that may be true, but the big battle over Iraq and stability and security has yet to be won fundamentally because of the politics of Shia, Sunni, Kurd, Arab Sunni. These are fundamental issues of power, resources and territory.”Ayad al-Sammaraie, the speaker of the Iraqi Parliament, said Iraqis welcomed American involvement but looked forward to more details. The Americans said “they would concentrate on supporting institutions, not supporting individuals,” he said. “O.K., that’s nice, but how are you going to do that? What institutions are they going to support and how?”As he left Iraq, Mr. Biden told a New York Times reporter that he had gotten the message from Iraqi officials who feared that Iraq was no longer a high priority for Mr. Obama. Mr. Biden said he was surprised to hear that, and tried to assuage those concerns. He quoted one official, whom he did not name, as telling him, “We were concerned we were moved to the bottom shelf.” He added, “I said, ‘Well, you’re not.’ ”As they deal with Iraqi politics, the Americans must find a new tone. They have a reputation for being heavy-handed, for telling Iraqis what to do rather than asking what they want — a legacy of the period when Americans were in charge as an occupying force. Now that Iraq is in most respects a sovereign country, that approach only generates hostility.Although the Americans helped most leading Iraqi politicians, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, come to power — and stay there — they can no longer expect the Iraqis to acknowledge the help, because being close to the Americans risks alienating average Iraqis.Abdul Karim Abbas, who runs a wholesale soda shop in a mixed Sunni and Shiite working-class neighborhood, said the Americans were hindered because their very presence made people suspicious. “It will complicate things, since there are many sides who don’t want the Americans to interfere,” he said.“The Sunnis accuse the Shia and the Kurdish of working with them. There is no trust for the Americans because they made us fight each other,” he said repeating the argument often heard on the streets that it was Americans who brought sectarian strife to Iraq and that previously, the sects had lived together happily.Regardless of who brought sectarianism, national parliamentary elections set for January already look likely to be run along sectarian lines. Shiite parties are leaning toward forming a united coalition with only nominal Sunni support. That could push Sunnis to run together in order to maximize the number of seats they get — perpetuating a Lebanese style of politics, with ministries and other posts divided along sectarian and ethnic lines.The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, an Islamist party founded in Iran, is one of several parties championing the return to a single Shiite coalition. It lost seats in the provincial elections and is looking for a way to regain ground. Its members say that many people who ran as individuals or as members of small parties never gained even a single seat; it would have been better if they had run under one umbrella. “If we have bigger blocs, that will result in fewer lost votes,” said Amar al-Hakim, the son of the party’s leader, Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, and his likely successor.In the north of Iraq, competition over control of Kirkuk Province and in that way control of some of Iraq’s richest oil fields is in a tense stalemate, with neither the Kurds, nor Sunni Arabs nor Turkmens willing to give an inch.“Iraq is not going to stay together if there is no oil law binding the country together through the revenue stream; that’s 95 percent of the Iraqi budget, you can’t just let that slide,” said Joost Hiltermann, an Iraq analyst with the International Crisis Group. “The Obama administration understands that very well. The analysis is there; it’s been the oomph that’s lacking.”'"
"'09-07-06,'1','At the close of last week’s trading, oil futures fell $2.58, to $66.73 a barrel, after rising above $72 a barrel last month.These gyrations have rippled across the economy. The automakers and have been forced into bankruptcy as customers shun their gas guzzlers. Airlines are on pace for another year of deep losses because of rising jet fuel costs.And households, already crimped by falling home prices, mounting job losses and pressures, are once more forced to monitor their discretionary spending as energy prices rise.While the movements in the oil markets have been similar to swings in most asset classes, including and other commodities, the recent rise in oil prices is reprising the debate from last year over the role of investors — or speculators — in the commodity markets.Government officials around the world have become concerned about a possible replay of last year’s surge. Energy officials from the and , meeting in last month, said that “the speculation issue had not been resolved yet and that the 2008 bubble could be repeated” without more oversight.Many factors that pushed oil prices up last year have returned. Supply fears are creeping back into the market, with a new round of violence in ’s oil-rich Niger Delta crimping production. And there are increasing fears that the political instability in could spill over onto the oil market, potentially hampering the country’s exports.The OPEC cartel has also been remarkably successful in reining in production in recent months to keep prices from falling. Even as prices recovered, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been unwilling to open their taps.Top officials said that OPEC’s goal was to achieve $75 a barrel oil by the end of the year, a target that has been endorsed by , the group’s kingpin.“Neither the organization, nor its key members, has any real interest in halting the rise in oil prices,” said a report by the Center for Global Energy Studies, a consulting group in founded by Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former Saudi oil minister.But unlike most of 2007, when the economy was still not in recession and demand for commodities was strong, the world today is mired in its worst slump in over half a century. The warned the recession would be deeper than previously thought and said any recovery next year would be subdued.The International Energy Agency held out the prospect that energy demand was unlikely to recover before 2014. Yet the indicators that would traditionally signal lower prices — like high oil inventories or OPEC’s large spare production capacity — do not seem to hold much weight today, analysts said.“Crude oil prices appear to have been divorced from the underlying fundamentals of weak demand, ample supply and high inventories,” analysts said in a recent report.Investors are betting that the worst of the economic slump may be coming to an end, and are bidding up what they perceive will become scare resources once demand kicks back again, analysts said. This uncertainty is making it difficult for companies to plan ahead, they said.“People do not like that kind of volatility, they want to know what their costs are going to be,” said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group.For the global airline industry, the latest price surge is certain to translate into more losses this year, according to the industry’s trade group, I.A.T.A. Airlines are expected to post losses of $9 billion this year, following last year’s losses of $10.4 billion. “Airlines have not yet felt the full impact of this oil price rise,” according to I.A.T.A.’s latest report.At Southwest Airlines, for example, fuel accounts for about a third of the company’s costs, according to Ms. Wright, the chief financial officer. The experience of the past year, she said, “has convinced us we cannot afford to not be hedged.”The company has currently hedged part of its fuel use for the second half of the year at $71 a barrel, and for 2010 at $77 a barrel. Hedging acts as an policy if prices rise above these levels.But last year, reported two consecutive quarters of losses, as prices spiked and collapsed — all within a few months. “Prices were falling faster than we could de-hedge,” Ms. Wright said.To survive the slump, many airlines have cut routes and raised both fares and fees, like charging for luggage, while some of the industry’s top players have merged. For example, bought Airlines last year, and in , of bought Austrian Airlines and acquired Alitalia of .Likewise, automobile showrooms emptied out as gasoline prices rose, forcing General Motors and Chrysler to cut production sharply as they wade through bankruptcy. Meanwhile, they are under pressure from to improve their fuel ratings.“Do not believe for an instant that sport utilities are making a comeback,” Pipas, ’s chief sales analyst, told reporters last week.But to Jeroen van der Veer, who retired as chief executive officer of last week, prices are increasingly dictated by long-term assessments of supply and demand, rather than current market fundamentals. He advised taking a long-term view of the market.“Oil has never been very stable,” Mr. van der Veer said. “If you look at history, you have to expect more volatility.”'"

"'09-07-07,'0','Juicy photos have also appeared, including images of attractive young women frolicking in the nude — or scantily clad on a merry-go-round — during parties at Mr. Berlusconi’s Sardinian villa.Through it all, Mr. Berlusconi has remained defiant. “This is how I am,” he said last month. “I’m not going to change a thing. If they like me this way, they like me this way.”Indeed, a well-regarded poll last week found that the prime minister’s approval ratings had fallen only two points since the scandal began in May, to 49 percent, with his popularity dropping most among women and practicing Roman Catholics.Mr. Berlusconi is famous for his ebullient personality and off-color jokes — he has repeatedly called President Obama “young, handsome and suntanned” — but news reports say his advisers are urging him to tone things down.“Those student-like jokes that he likes to play, like stepping in front of Angela Merkel from behind the monument, he better not do that,” Mr. Romano said, referring to the German chancellor, whom Mr. Berlusconi is fond of teasing.Analysts wonder whether new allegations against the prime minister will emerge during the meeting of the Group of 8, representing major economies, just as they did in 1994, the year he first took office, when he was told that he was under investigation for questionable finances while he was holding a United Nations conference on crime.Mr. Berlusconi had originally planned to host the Group of 8 on La Maddalena, an island off the coast of Sardinia, where the delegations were to be housed on a luxury cruise ship. But when the earthquake struck here on April 6, he had a new idea — to move the meeting to L’Aquila in solidarity with residents and in keeping with the less luxe spirit of the financial crisis.Workmen have been laboring around the clock to transform a vast Finance Police school into the summit meeting headquarters from Wednesday through Friday. World leaders, including Mr. Obama, and their delegations are expected to be housed in apartments on the grounds. The local airport has been expanded and a press center built to accommodate more than 3,000 accredited journalists. The surrounding area has been turned into a “red zone,” patrolled by thousands of security officers.Since the recent quakes, authorities have assured expected guests that the venue is sound. But they have also devised an evacuation plan in case of quakes of more than a magnitude of 4, in which people would be sent to tents until the buildings were deemed safe to re-enter. If delegations choose to leave, they will get a police escort back to Rome.The choice of venue is “an important way to bring the most powerful in the world to the most weak,” said Guido Bertolaso, the head of Italy’s Civil Protection Agency, who is overseeing the rebuilding efforts and the Group of 8 meeting arrangements.Indeed, just a few miles from the meeting headquarters, thousands of homeless earthquake victims are still living in tents, awaiting housing that the government has pledged to build by fall. The area’s economy has been devastated, with businesses, city offices, schools and the university in ruins.Some residents are not thrilled that the Group of 8 is coming to town. “I don’t know how good a choice it was,” said Chiara di Crosta, 33, as she looked after her young daughter in a tent camp in downtown L’Aquila on a recent afternoon. “There are more fundamental questions, like houses.”Yet Italy hopes the venue will help bring in international financing. The Culture Ministry has singled out 45 monuments, including L’Aquila’s most notable churches, that it hopes different countries will “adopt” for restoration.Memories are still raw from the last time Italy hosted the Group of 8, in Genoa in 2001, when one 23-year-old was killed and dozens of people were injured when the police cracked down on protesters. This time, Group of 8 protesters are holding a series of rallies in other cities ahead of the meeting.Stefano Frezza, a spokesman for Epicentro Solidale, the L’Aquila-based group coordinating the protests, said the protests in L’Aquila should be peaceful. With thousands still living in tents, “Everyone understands the situation in L’Aquila,” he said. “No one wanted to add hardship to hardship.”'"
"'09-07-07,'0','“Twenty years ago, you would not have been able to do a 363 sale of an entire company,” said Mary Joanne Dowd, a partner in the financial and bankruptcy restructuring practice at Arent Fox in Washington.While the cases are not likely to bring about the end of old-style restructurings, the sheer scope of G.M. and Chrysler show a Section 363 sale can apply to companies of any size, lawyers say.For businesses that follow similar legal strategies, the G.M. and Chrysler cases could pave the way for a faster trip through court. For creditors, it could mean less time to reach a deal, especially in situations where companies face strict deadlines from lenders, as the two carmakers did with the government.In such cases where the government plays a major role, lawyers are likely to feel they have less control than in traditional bankruptcies.“I don’t think the government pressures judges as much as it pressures everybody,” said Professor White.In fact, a government-imposed deadline for concluding the G.M. case by the end of this week helped the court work through 850 objections in three days of hearings last week. Normally, such issues could take weeks.The haste drew skepticism from Michael P. Richman, a lawyer who represents three dissident G.M. bondholders.At last week’s hearings, he urged Judge Gerber to “call the bluff” of the government deadline and take a more deliberate pace. (On Monday, Mr. Richman said his clients would likely not challenge the sale approval, citing the “enormous costs” that an appeal would incur.)Obama administration officials say the legal community need not expect a wholesale shift in bankruptcy law. The G.M. and Chrysler cases were unique situations, they note, in which the president wanted to make sure that a crucial American industry survived.Under the terms of the deal, G.M. would sell its most desirable assets, including the Chevrolet and Cadillac brands, to a new company owned largely by the American and Canadian governments and a health care trust for the United Automobile Workers union.Over the last decade, Professor White said, companies already have been shifting toward a broader use of Section 363 sales as a quicker approach for restructuring than the usual Chapter 11 process.In his order approving the G.M. sale late Sunday night, Judge Gerber cited instances involving Lionel, the maker of toy trains, which emerged from bankruptcy last year; Trans World Airlines, which was absorbed by American Airlines in 2001, and other similar cases as justification for his decision.But none involved government financing, and thus moved far less quickly. The most recent Lionel case took three and half years; a case involving United Airlines took just over three years, and the case of the Delphi Corporation, G.M.’s former parts supplier, has been in court since 2005.By contrast, G.M. and Chrysler sales beat even the government’s aggressive timetable.The Treasury Department initially said it expected the Chrysler sale, which required 42 days, including an appeal to the Supreme Court, to be approved in 60 days. It said the G.M. sale would require 60 to 90 days of deliberations; as of Monday, the case has been in court for 36 days.The speed is even more remarkable given that as recently as mid-March, when the Treasury’s auto task force retained bankruptcy counsel, it was not clear the cases would wind up in bankruptcy court, a senior administration official said Monday.At that time, G.M. was still resisting a bankruptcy filing and a case did not seem likely at Chrysler, which had Fiat standing by, prepared to assume management control. Fiat officials eventually signed on to the need for a quick bankruptcy filing, which helped Chrysler shed plants, dealers and suppliers.By mid-April, G.M. came around to the idea of a conventional prepackaged bankruptcy case, which still could have taken months, the official said.Treasury officials pointedly told G.M. executives that the government, which was financing the company’s stay in bankruptcy, did not have the patience or resources for a long case, and would only provide financing under a Section 363 sale.The administration official also said that G.M.’s case moved so quickly in part because it had the benefit of an “icebreaker” from Chrysler’s quick tour through bankruptcy.In his 95-page opinion Sunday, for example, Judge Gerber repeatedly cited the discussion of issues from the opinion by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who approved the Chrysler sale last month.Professor White said the Supreme Court’s ruling against pensioners from Indiana, who sought to block the Chrysler sale, also was likely to deter similar actions in the G.M. case.In fact, so far only one lawyer has challenged Judge Gerber’s approval of the sale: Steve Jakubowski, who represents five accident victims. And even he will not ask to delay the closing of the G.M. sale, unlike the Indiana state funds that objected to Chrysler’s turnaround plan.“I personally didn’t have any problem with the speed of it,” he said of the two cases. “The fact is, the companies were dead.”'"

He is 29, healthy and in his prime, and is one of the best two-way players in the N.B.A. But Artest will make about $5.6 million with the Los Angeles Lakers next season, after earning a below-market $7.4 million with Houston.More jarring pay cuts are on the way. Allen Iverson and Stephon Marbury, two tarnished former stars, have drawn scant interest and may have to settle for the veteran’s minimum, $1.3 million. They each made $20.8 million last season, ranking them sixth in the league.Shawn Marion, whose $17.8 million salary ranked 13th, may make one-third that amount next season. Toronto has to renounce Marion’s rights in order to make room to sign Turkoglu to a five-year, $53 million deal.So Marion, a four-time All-Star, will probably settle for the midlevel exception, about $5.6 million — the same amount that Marcin Gortat, an unaccomplished backup center, will receive from the Mavericks.No one can remember a summer like this. In the past, even declining stars could find a huge payday. And a rising talent like Trevor Ariza — whose role grew in the Lakers’ championship drive — would have easily cashed in for $50 million. Ariza will be signing with Houston for the midlevel exception, earning about $33 million over five years.Several young stars are still waiting for big offers that may never come. That group includes the Knicks’ David Lee, Utah’s Paul Millsap, Atlanta’s Marvin Williams and Milwaukee’s Ramon Sessions. Some of them had figured to make $8 million to $10 million a season. Few teams have the cap space to make that sort of offer, leaving the players with no leverage.Several established stars are also still waiting for deals, including the Lakers’ Lamar Odom, Atlanta’s Mike Bibby and Philadelphia’s Andre Miller.The recession and a projected drop in the salary cap have made owners more conservative. Also, about a dozen teams are saving cap space for 2010, in order to chase LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and several other stars.So players from every point on the talent spectrum are signing for the midlevel exception, the equivalent of the average player salary. That, in turn, has allowed the rich teams to get richer.Because elite teams are usually over the salary cap, they rarely get the chance to sign marquee free agents. But already, the Lakers have added Artest and the Celtics — the 2008 champions — have added Wallace, for bargain prices.“Everyone’s getting squished to the midlevel, so now the top-level teams can play a little easier,” a Western Conference general manager said.Cost-cutting was also behind the trades of Vince Carter (to Orlando), Richard Jefferson (to San Antonio) and Shaquille O’Neal (to Cleveland). In every case, an elite team acquired a frontline player without giving up much.A few teams have been willing to spend. Detroit came to terms with Gordon (five years, about $55 million) and Charlie Villanueva (five years, $40 million). Portland is still trying to spend its $9 million in cap space after being spurned by Turkoglu.There is still the possibility for more weirdness. Consider Iverson’s plight.He is one of the most dazzling players of his era and a 10-time All-Star. He can still fill baskets and arena seats, even at 34. Last week, he was reportedly soliciting an offer from the Memphis Grizzlies, a dysfunctional franchise with no winning tradition and little talent.The Grizzlies cannot offer Iverson the chance to win a title, or even a playoff series. They can, however, offer about $9 million in cap space.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','Every team had its tricks to keep its riders from overheating Monday during a 196.5-kilometer, or 122-mile, ride from Marseille to La Grande-Motte. During the peloton’s third consecutive day of heavy air and searing sun, all the cyclists drank water, with some drinking 10 bottles or more. Some dumped the water on their heads.Mark Cavendish, a 24-year-old rider from Team Columbia-HTC, won the stage for his second consecutive victory on this Tour. Before the stage, his team’s doctor made sure he was ready for the long ride. Every morning before a stage, the doctor, Helge Riepenhof, measures the riders’ urine density to determine their level of hydration. He then figures out how much water each rider must drink to get through the stage and perform his best.“If you’re not hydrated on a day like this, it could be dangerous to exercise for so long in such heat, but these riders are used to it,” Riepenhof said. “But we still have to watch them closely. If they don’t have enough fluids, their performance could really drop.”Riders who are not hydrated may get a headache, lose clarity of their vision or even feel dizzy, he said.Those are extremes, however, because the riders on the Tour are monitored so closely.To help feel cooler, Team Columbia riders sometimes put gels in their helmets. Other times, they wear ice packs on their wrists or arms, which Riepenhof said was among the most effective ways to signal to the body that it was cool.Nearing the finish Monday, the air was particularly salty and humid amid the marshes.“We usually see this kind of heat in the last week of the Tour, not in the first week, because the race usually starts in the north,” said Frankie Andreu, a former Tour rider who is a reporter for Versus.“So the riders aren’t used to this, for sure. The heat can be a big factor in the race.”For Stage 4, a team time trial in Montpellier, cyclists must ride in yet another day of heat in the south of France. But Garmin is ready to prepare its riders.Lim weighed each one when Stage 3 ended to determine if any had lost weight. That, he said, is an indication of a rider’s hydration. Some can lose more than six pounds in a stage like that. Before time trials, Lim also has them wear ice vests before they compete, to cool their core, or he has them stick their hands in ice.Other teams, like the Belgian-based Silence-Lotto squad, favor an old-fashioned method of cooling down once the stage ends.“They can take a cold shower afterwards,” said Hendrik Redant, a team leader for Silence-Lotto. “Other than that, there’s not much else you could do.”'"
"'09-07-07,'0','Clearly, though, the passengers I heard from in such volume don’t think the airlines were doing enough to dissuade passengers from lugging onto planes carry-on bags that obviously exceed the size limits.But many of those responding said that shifting the carry-on policing duties to federal security officers would create more delays at checkpoints, divert officers from their main jobs and add more confusion and frustration for anyone whose bags was rejected. Those people would then need to skulk out of line, march back to an airline counter to check the bags and then get back in the security line.“Can you imagine the backup at security when the Clampett family tries to take the kitchen sink and cement pond with them to grandma’s?” wrote Bob Hatzo.Of course, many readers said that the airlines themselves created the overburdened overhead bin problem when they began charging $15 or more last year to check bags. While domestic airlines have raised more than $1.5 billion in extra bag fees from last year through the first quarter of this year, the charges have also resulted in passengers bringing stuff on board that they would have previously checked.I’ll try to give you a general idea of how people responded to last week’s column.First of all, there was a strong sense that some fellow travelers blatantly flout the rules, with no regard for others. “I saw a guy get on with a duffel bag that looked like a body bag, a backpack and a guitar,” Michael O’Malley wrote.As to the flight attendant I quoted last week who said that business travelers tended to follow the rules far better than leisure travelers, not everyone agrees.“Contrary to what you said in your column, I found business travelers even worse, filling the overheads not only with their oversized luggage, but with their computer cases, etc., instead of at least putting those under the seat,” Margaret Fridecky wrote of a recent trip between Los Angeles and New York.On the other hand, a former corporate travel consultant recalled a flight in which a woman returning from her honeymoon took up an entire overhead compartment to lay out her wedding dress full-length.Others said they missed or nearly missed flights because a bag that seemed to fit within the rules was arbitrarily flagged by an airline employee. Some complained about shopping bags, in excess of the standard allowance of one carry-on bag and one personal bag.Some female travelers indicated that they firmly believed a purse should not be counted in the two-item limit.Some readers think all carry-ons should be banned. And many frequent travelers wish that others would simply learn to pack efficiently and travel with less. Still, many people said they carried on certain bulky things like photographic equipment and musical instruments because they worried about damage and theft from checked bags.And if you board early, stash your carry-on in a forward bin and then trudge to your seat in the rear of the plane, here’s a news flash: People notice that and hate it.Meanwhile, one reader, David Ochoa, addressed the problem mentioned last week of items falling out of overtaxed overhead bins and possibly causing injury. “Helmets may be a safety requirement for passengers in aisle seats,” he wrote.Let’s not go there, David. I can imagine airlines busily acquiring stocks of bicycle helmets and slapping a $20 fee on each one.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','These days, Mr. Rincón and scores of other scientists are digging as fast as they can in the shadows of the really big dig that is the Panama canal expansion program, the most ambitious overhaul to the complex array of locks, channels, dams and bridges since the canal was built a century ago.The Panamanian government initiated the project for purely economic reasons. In its current configuration, the 51-mile shortcut between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans can grant passage only to boats carrying up to 65,000 tons of cargo. But many international shipping companies increasingly prefer to use mega-freighters that can haul up to 300,000 tons.As a result, the Panama Canal has been losing business to other transoceanic routes; and with canal tolls amounting to close to $100,000 per ship per one-way crossing, and potentially more for the giant freighters, the government decided it had no choice but to widen and straighten the canal to make room for the S.U.V.’s of the seas.For scientists, the massive engineering project promises spectacular spinoffs. The tropics are thought to be nature’s romper room, the habitat where the majority of the world’s life forms got their start and thus of great interest to evolutionary scholars. Yet the very conditions conducive to biological diversity and innovation end up obscuring life’s biography. The sun, the water, the greedily growing plants: nothing remains exposed for long, and fossil evidence is pushed ever deeper beneath successive pages of growth and decay.Tropical verdure also masks tropical geology, the underlying story of how the landscape came to be. This blurring is a particular shame in the case of the Panamanian isthmus, given its pivotal role as a bridge between two continents. Geologists have longed to understand how and when the isthmus arose, but the tropics aren’t Arizona and there is no Grand Canyon to serve as an open book.The five-year Panama canal expansion project, begun last year, offers scientists a kind of drive-by canyon experience, a brief yanking back of the chlorophyll cloak. Using dynamite, bulldozers, backhoes, excavators and many, many shovels, workers will be rearranging hundreds of millions of cubic meters of dirt and rock. “There’s nothing else like it, to get this much exposure in the tropics,” Dr. Montes said. “We cannot lose this scientific opportunity.”Carlos Jaramillo, also of the Smithsonian, said, “We know we’re just guests here, but at least they’re digging us a $5 billion hole.”At the canal there are neither slow boats nor rain checks. The moment workers blast open a new cut, researchers must move in immediately and gather what data they can. Not only is the jungle always ready to reclaim naked land, but the canal authorities are similarly devoted to quick forest restoration, and they will add topsoil where needed to spur a fresh round of stabilizing vegetation. They want no repeat of the many tragedies that accompanied the building of the original canal, when thousands died in landslides because the terrain had been too quickly stripped bare.“We’re in a race against time,” Dr. Jaramillo said.Speed dating for scientists has already borne fruit. Through analyzing more than 2,000 fossils, the stratigraphic record revealed by each new rock cut, paleomagnetic data, isotope ratios, carbon signatures and more, researchers are getting a sense of what an ancient tropical rain forest looked like.Some 15 million years ago, when Panama served as the southernmost outpost of the North American continent and the land bridge had yet to form, the forest was nevertheless a crossover dream. Its fauna, according to Dr. MacFadden of the Florida museum, was similar to the animals then living in Florida and Texas, which means leaping llamas and leaf-eating horses that looked like large tapirs, and mid-size tapirs that looked like tapirs, and forest rhinoceroses, and an especially fierce carnivore that was half-bear and half-dog. Yet the flora looked South American, the apparent result of seeds traversing the ocean on currents of water or wind and finding friendly soil in the Panamanian swelter.Starting around 10 million years ago, the isthmus of Panama began to form, and researchers are finding that the tiny country is one of the most geologically complex places on earth, part Caribbean, part North American, part a tiny piece from an island in the middle of the Pacific, part a tiny piece from an island arc. “Four tectonic plates are involved, and all of them are colliding in Panama,” Dr. Jaramillo said. “You won’t find that sort of tectonic plate configuration anywhere else in the world.”Moreover, while most of the world’s tectonic plates are rigid, now slamming together, now breaking apart, the plates of Panama are rubbery.“They seem to be bending, and we don’t know why,” Dr. Jaramillo said.Maybe they’re warming up for the day when, high over their head, the revamped locks are opened and the wide loads start coming through.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','Juilliard’s annual concerts in the Museum of Modern Art’s Sculpture Garden are staged against a glass wall that produces a reflection of the nearby buildings, a stylistic jumble of anonymous modern structures overlapping older, ornate facades. The reflected backdrop is an apt metaphor for the genre-blending, eclectic new music often performed at concerts here.Robert Xavier Rodríguez’s “Música, por un Tiempo” (“Music, for a While”) (2008) blends the ground bass from “Music, for a While” — a song by the 17th-century composer Henry Purcell — with the rumba. The work concluded a concert on Sunday evening (the first event in Juilliard’s annual Summergarden series) that featured members of the New Juilliard Ensemble playing five works in their New York premieres. There are only four concerts in the series this season, fewer than in previous years because of the recession.Polyphony and Latin dance rhythms gracefully overlap in Mr. Rodríguez’s deftly scored three-movement piece. The title also alludes to Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time,” which uses the same combination of instruments: piano, violin, cello and clarinet.In the contrapuntal Adagio espressivo, Purcell’s bass line played on the piano meshes with string trills and a dance-inflected clarinet melody, before the concluding “Vivace alla Rumba.”Dance rhythms — in this case a medieval, irregular Icelandic dance beat — also influenced Alti Heimir Sveinsson’s lighthearted “Swedish Rapp: Rondo Fantastico II” (1999). The composer has written stylistically contrasting melodies over a 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3, 1-2-3-4 pattern, which includes having the players shout out numbers and letters, blow whistles and perform music that, in Mr. Sveinsson’s words, “does not take itself or the audience too seriously.”Andy Vores’s “Often” (2003) was written to accompany a video created using television footage of the allied bombing of Baghdad and images of American soldiers giving bottled water to Iraqi civilians. Joel Sachs conducted the effective score, which featured a variety of soundscapes produced by six musicians, an electronic soundtrack, distorted voices and natural sounds like cicadas and seabirds. (The local sparrows vociferously added their own part.) The visceral music veered between fearful chaos and respite.The three movements of Eric Tanguy’s “Duo for Flute and Clarinet” (1994) — “Intense,” “Très Calme” and “Vif” — lived up to their titles. The flutist Nadia Kyne and the clarinetist Sean Rice played the work, which veers between tonal and dissonant idioms, with flair.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','MOSCOW — PepsiCo will invest $1 billion in Russia over the next three years and open its largest bottling plant in the world outside Moscow, the company said Monday, on the sidelines of a summit meeting of the Russian and American presidents.Pepsi’s announcement came as an echo of the company’s first appearance in this country, also on the sidelines of a political tête-à-tête in Moscow in 1959, known as the kitchen debate.It gained that nickname because Vice President Richard M. Nixon and the Soviet prime minister, Nikita S. Khrushchev, debated the merits of capitalism and Communism in a model American kitchen built at an exhibition center in Moscow. At that exhibit, Mr. Khrushchev also tried Pepsi. The company became an exclusive soft-drink supplier to the Soviet Union under a 1973 agreement that also allowed the Soviets to export Stolichnaya vodka to the United States.PepsiCo, the beverage and snack-food giant based in Purchase, N.Y., said its investment in Russia came during a wider push into developing markets.“Russia is a very attractive growth market,” said the chief executive of the Pepsi Bottling Group, Eric J. Foss. The bottling group, which is distinct from the brand owner, is joining PepsiCo in the investment.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','Is it possible that a product meant to protect against skin cancer might actually cause it?Several intriguing studies have investigated claims that zinc oxide and other compounds in some sunscreens might have harmful effects. Some laboratory studies, for example, have shown that zinc oxide and titanium oxide — intended to block ultraviolet rays — can create free radicals in the presence of sunlight, leading to cell damage. Others point to research showing a general rise in melanoma cases over the years, particularly in people who use sunscreen.But that may be misleading. For these compounds to cause harm, they must penetrate skin cells, and research by health officials in Australia, which has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, found that doesn’t happen. “The weight of current evidence is that they remain on the surface of the skin and in the outer dead layer (stratum corneum) of the skin,” they wrote in one report.In other studies, researchers followed thousands of people, looking for connections between melanoma and sunscreen. They found no evidence of greater risk. They also noted that people who sunbathe often or have greater sun sensitivity are more likely to use sunscreen, possibly explaining the associations in earlier studies.Studies suggest zinc oxide and other compounds in sunscreen do not damage cells or increase melanoma risk.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','I recently spoke with a friend who dropped out of medical school 20 years ago to pursue investment banking. Whenever we meet, he finds a way to congratulate me on what he considers my professional calling. He often wonders whether he should have stuck with medicine. Like many expatriates, he has idealistic notions of the world he left.At our most recent meeting, we talked about the tumult on Wall Street. Like many bankers, he was worried about the future. “It is a good time to be a doctor,” he said yet again, as I recall. “I’d love a job where I didn’t have to constantly think about money.”I didn’t bother to disillusion him, but the reality is that most doctors today, whether in academic or private practice, constantly have to think about money. Last January, Dr. Pamela Hartzband and Dr. Jerome Groopman, physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in The New England Journal of Medicine that “price tags are being applied to every aspect of a doctor’s day, creating an acute awareness of costs and reimbursement.” And they added, “Today’s medical students are being inducted into a culture in which their profession is seen increasingly in financial terms.”The rising commercialism, driven in part by increasing expenses and decreasing reimbursement, has obvious consequences for the public: ballooning costs, fraying of the traditional doctor-patient relationship. What is not so obvious is the harmful effects on doctors themselves. We were trained to think like caregivers, not businesspeople. The constant intrusion of the marketplace is creating serious and deepening anxiety in the profession.Not long ago, a cardiology fellow who had been interviewing for jobs came to my office, clearly disillusioned. “I was naïve,” he said. “I never thought of medicine as a business. I thought we were in it to take care of patients. But I guess it is.”I asked him how he felt about going into private practice. “I’ll be too busy vomiting for the first six months — I won’t have much time to think about it,” he replied.Of course, there has always been a profit motive in medicine. Doctors who own their own imaging machines order more imaging tests; to take an example from my moonlighting work, a doctor who owns a scanner is seven times as likely as other doctors to refer a patient for a scan. In regions where there are more doctors, there is more per capita use of doctors’ services and testing. Supply often dictates demand.But financial considerations have never been as prominent as they are today, probably because so many hospitals and doctors, especially in large metropolitan areas, are in financial trouble. More and more doctors are trying to sell their practices, or are negotiating with hospitals for jobs, equipment or financial aid.At hospitals, uncompensated care is increasing as patients suffering from the economic downturn lose health insurance. Admissions and elective procedures — big moneymakers — are declining. Hospitals are cutting administrative costs, staff and services.“More and more you’ll see people in medicine get M.B.A.’s,” a doctor told me at a seminar, in a prediction borne out in my experience. “We are in a total crisis, and I don’t know the answer.”I must admit that part of me wants to see doctors master the business side of our profession. When I hear about executives at health companies getting tens of millions of dollars in bonuses, I am nauseated by the blatant profiteering. As a loyal member of my guild, I want to see doctors exert more control over our financial house.And yet the consequences of this commercial consciousness are troubling. Among my colleagues I sense an emotional emptiness created by the relentless consideration of money. Most doctors went into medicine for intellectual stimulation or the desire to develop relationships with patients, not to maximize income. There is a palpable sense of grieving. We strove for so long, made so many sacrifices, and for what? In the end, for many, the job has become only that — a job.Until I went into practice, I never had an interest in the business side of medicine. I sometimes yearn to be a resident or fellow again, discussing the intricacies of a case rather than worrying about the bottom line. “You need to learn a little of the private-practice mind-set,” a doctor friend recently advised me. “You can’t survive with your head in the clouds.”But something fundamental is lost when doctors start thinking of medicine as a business. In their essay, Dr. Hartzband and Dr. Groopman talk about the erosion of collegiality, cooperation and teamwork when a marketplace environment takes hold in the hospital. “The balance has tipped toward market exchanges at the expense of medicine’s communal or social dimension,” they write.How this battle plays out will determine to a great extent what medicine will look like in 20 years. This is about much more than dollars and cents. It is a battle for the soul of medicine.'"
"'09-07-07,'0','Stocks ended mostly lower Monday as declines in the prices of oil and other commodities had investors worrying again that demand for basic materials might remain slack. The major market indexes closed mixed, but off of their lows for the day.The drop in oil to a five-week low pushed energy and commodities stocks lower and sent investors into safer parts of the market, like consumer goods producers. Occidental Petroleum slid 2.5 percent while Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide and Crest, rose 2 percent.Back-and-forth trading Monday followed conflicting signs about the economy. Oil skidded on fears of weak demand, while a trade group’s report found that activity in the services industry rose in June to its best level in nine months.Investors have become more cautious in recent weeks after a strong rally that began in March. Some traders feared they might have been too optimistic about how soon the economy might recover from a recession that began in December 2007.“The markets are becoming more realistic,” said Subodh Kumar, global investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. “We can’t snap our fingers and have recovery.”'"

"'09-07-08,'1','But many rules that even industry representatives call essential are years away. “We’ve got to move to mandatory regulatory standards, and this is a step along the way,” said Michael Taylor, a food specialist who is a senior adviser at the food and drug agency.Consumer advocates and industry representatives said they welcomed the administration’s commitment to food safety.“We are re-laying the foundation for our food safety system,” said Scott Faber, vice president of the Grocery Manufacturers Association. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved a bipartisan measure last month that would give the food and drug agency more money and authority to inspect food facilities and to force contaminated ingredients off the market. Food manufacturers would have to write and carry out safety plans, paying an annual registration fee to help finance inspections.The full House could take up the measure as soon as this week, said Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who has pushed for a safety overhaul for decades.Previous presidents have promised to make food safer only to find their efforts swamped by other priorities, bureaucratic turf battles and lethargy. The odyssey of the egg rule demonstrates the challenges.In 1988, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention discovered that thousands of people were being sickened after eating raw eggs that appeared clean and undamaged. Researchers discovered that chickens that are chronically infected with salmonella laid eggs laced with the bacteria, which can sicken and kill humans.Officials at the Agriculture Department and the F.D.A. bickered for years over who should oversee regulatory efforts.Agriculture officials set up a pilot program in Pennsylvania in 1992 to test regulatory efforts and found that one source of contamination was mouse and rat feces in chicken feed. Another problem was infected breeder hens. Pest controls, certified breeders, regular manure testing and other measures helped reduce the share of infected henhouses in the state to 7 percent from 39 percent, said Paul H. Patterson, a professor of poultry science at Pennsylvania State University.More than a dozen other states copied Pennsylvania’s program while federal regulators bickered. In 1999, President Bill Clinton announced that the F.D.A. would issue an egg rule. Nothing happened. In 2004, the agency issued a proposed egg rule. Nothing happened. The egg rule released Tuesday largely copied Pennsylvania’s voluntary program but made it mandatory.Howard Magwire, vice president of the United Egg Producers, said his industry supported the new rule. About 250 major egg producers in the United States account for 99 percent of fresh egg production, Mr. Magwire said, and most already abide by the rule. Since the rule applies only to producers with 3,000 or more laying hens, thousands of small producers are exempt.Federal researchers estimated that more than 130,000 people are sickened every year and 30 die as a result of contaminated eggs, and the government estimated that the new rule would cut illnesses by 60 percent and save $1.4 billion in health costs.The odyssey of the egg rule shows just how dysfunctional the government’s oversight of food safety has become, said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. “Even when everyone agrees on the policy direction, it takes forever,” she said.'"

"'09-07-08,'1','WASHINGTON — Obama administration lawyers said Tuesday at a Senate hearing that detainees prosecuted by military commissions should have some of the same constitutional rights as American citizens tried in civilian criminal courts.Republicans on the Armed Services Committee argued that foreigners now detained on terrorism charges at the American detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, did not deserve those constitutional protections.“So you are saying that these people who are in Guantánamo, who were part of 9/11 or committed acts of war against the United States are entitled to constitutional rights of the Constitution of the United States?” Senator John McCain of Arizona, the senior Republican on the panel, asked administration officials at one point.David Kris, the chief of the national security division at the Justice Department, said detainees would not be granted all the rights of American citizens, but added: “I think, within the framework I just described, the answer is yes. The due process clause guarantees and imposes some requirements. That’s the way I think I would put it.Later, Jeh C. Johnson, the Pentagon’s top lawyer, was more explicit: “I would say it’s our view that the detainees would not, whether in the United States or anyplace else, do not enjoy the full panoply of constitutional rights that an American citizen in this country would enjoy.”'"
"'09-07-08,'1','The Manhattan store — in the Manhattan Mall at Herald Square, 33rd Street and Avenue of the Americas — is the subject of a major, multimedia marketing campaign, a rarity for Penney, which usually promotes store openings with print and radio advertising.In addition to the special ads, there will be shopping bags designed for the store, highlighting the letters “NYC” inside the name “JCPenney,” along with other customized touches like a unique logo, celebrity events and tailored content on a Web site.“It will give them a real break in their pocketbook,” Mr. Boylson added — a good argument for shopping at a store during a recession.Still, arriving now in Manhattan, where many a retailer has foundered even in good times, is a risk for Penney, which had its headquarters in Manhattan before moving to Plano in 1988.“We’re seeing some businesses start to get stronger,” Mr. Boylson said of Penney’s merchandise offerings, but “our customer is obviously still feeling the pinch.”That is why a large part of the campaign for the Manhattan store is devoted to reaching out to shoppers who are not Penney customers, he added, as they are “opting for much more affordable price points.”To that end, the campaign takes a direct, even cheeky tack — New York style — to lure customers of other stores.“Our neighbors must be shaking in their overpriced boots,” an ad asserts. Another ad promises: “NYC style. JCP prices.”Other ads take a poke at the most prominent retailer in Herald Square, Macy’s.“We heard Herald Square needed a good department store,” an ad proclaims. Another ad declares, “The real miracle is now on 33rd Street” — a reference to the classic Christmas movie, “Miracle on 34th Street,” about a Santa Claus working for Macy’s who believes he is the real Kris Kringle.However many zingers Penney aims at Macy’s, that retailer, which has been in Herald Square since 1902, is forgoing a chance to respond.“I don’t think we’re going to comment on the record,” said Holly Thomas, a spokeswoman for Macy’s, part of Macy’s Inc.The idea for the campaign came from the Penney creative agency, Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, which produces the national ads for Penney carrying the theme “Every day matters.” The media agency is OMD in New York, part of the Omnicom Group.It was Saatchi & Saatchi that said, “ ‘You know, you have an “NYC” in your name,’ ” said Jim Francois, vice president and director for visual marketing at Penney, who oversees the internal work on the campaign with Lisa DeStefano, divisional vice president at Penney for brand communication and strategy.Ms. DeStefano said the campaign “had to be authentically J. C. Penney because we are who we are, but we also wanted to make a statement about coming to New York.”To that end, the campaign includes ads that address Penney attributes. For instance, one says, “Our brand-new store offers something not new at all: Trust.” Another states: “We’ve been around a long time, yet our style is impeccable. Kind of like you, Manhattan.” Because of the economy, said Steven Gilliatt, managing director at the New York office of the Partners, a strategy and design agency that is owned by WPP, brands and products “have to communicate a certain authenticity” to allay concerns of consumers who have lost faith in so many businesses.That is why “you see a lot of corporate reputations peeking out behind ads for products and services,” he added — as in the Penney campaign.Scott Davis, senior partner at the Chicago office of Prophet, a marketing and branding consultancy, said he understood why advertisers were “not willing to take on a lot of risk” during a severe recession.But “those that are stepping out, willing to roll the dice,” he added, are more likely “to come out ahead” when the economy recovers.After all, famous brands that got their start during the 1930s include Snickers, Monopoly and Fortune magazine. And Macy’s held its annual Thanksgiving Day parade — with Santa Claus as the finale — throughout the Great Depression.'"
"'09-07-08,'1','SAN FRANCISCO  What took Google so long?Like many software products, Google’s Gmail service was first released with a “beta” label on it  meaning that while it was polished enough for public use, it was still in a testing phase, so any glitches were to be excused. Beta versions, which are sandwiched between internal “alpha” versions and final “release” versions, typically have a lifespan of weeks or months.But Gmail was different. Released on April 1, 2004, it was still in beta five years and tens of millions of users later.That changed on Tuesday, when Gmail finally shed the beta label, signaling that Google considered the product to be fully baked. Google is also removing the beta label from Calendar, Docs and Talk, three other applications that are part of a package of online software called Google Apps.So why the wait? The official answer doesn’t entirely clarify things.“Obviously we haven’t had a consistent set of policies or definitions around beta,” Matthew Glotzbach, a director of product management at Google, said in an interview. Mr. Glotzbach said that different teams at Google had different criteria for what beta meant, and that Google felt a need to standardize those. “It was time to address the issue and bring the products out of beta,” he said.Practically speaking, the change will mean little to Gmail’s millions of users. But it could help the company’s efforts to get the paid version of Google Apps adopted inside big companies, where Google is trying to compete with rival offerings from Microsoft and others. Corporate technology managers tend to shy away from beta products, and Google wants to remove any barriers to adoption that it can.“For business customers, it is an important sign in terms of the maturity of our product offering and commitment to this business,” Mr. Glotzbach said. “I’ve had C.I.O.’s tell me that they would not consider a product labeled beta.”Google began marketing Apps to companies early in 2007, saying that its online software would be cheaper than competing systems like Microsoft Office and Exchange, which require customers to purchase costly software packages. Microsoft has since introduced its own online packages of business software, and Google’s forays into the market have proceeded in fits and starts.Mr. Glotzbach said Google Apps was being used by roughly 1.75 million businesses, though most have little more than a handful of users. In all, Google claims that about 15 million people are using the service and that several hundred thousand of those pay for it at a cost of $50 a year for each user. By comparison, Microsoft Office has more than 450 million paid customers.While Google says that a few dozen corporations, including Genentech and Fairchild Semiconductor, have adopted Google Apps, some analysts say the service has been largely confined to small businesses, universities and government agencies.“Once you get outside those areas, the successes have been few and far between, and the beta label has not helped,” said David M. Smith, an analyst with Gartner, a research firm. “Google needs to go beyond the beachhead they have. The fact that they made this change is an indication that they are getting a bit more serious about the enterprise business.”Mr. Smith said Google probably retained the beta label for so long because it had a coolness factor that appealed to the digerati. But he said that the company finally got rid of it because of pressure from its enterprise group, which is charged with selling Google Apps to businesses.Some businesses have shied away from online business software like Google Apps because of fears about security and reliability. Gmail and other online Google applications have recently suffered well-publicized outages. Of course traditional corporate e-mail systems are also susceptible to outages, which don’t rate a mention in the news media.Mr. Glotzbach readily admitted that Google Apps did not account for “an appreciable percentage” of the business software market. He took no issue with the description of Google’s market share as a “speck.” But he added: “We are a fast-growing speck.”'"
"'09-07-08,'1','DENVER  Three months after a jury ruled that Ward L. Churchill, a former University of Colorado professor, was wrongfully terminated for his political views, a judge on Tuesday refused to give him his job back.Chief Judge Larry J. Naves of Denver District Court ruled that the university’s regents were effectively acting as judicial officers when they voted to dismiss Mr. Churchill in 2007 after a faculty committee concluded that he had committed academic fraud. As a result, Judge Naves found, the regents were legally protected from Mr. Churchill’s effort to reverse their ruling.Mr. Churchill’s lawyer, David Lane, said he would appeal the decision.“To me, this is judicial activism in its worst form,” Mr. Lane said. “What is really a shame here is that a jury said Ward Churchill’s free speech was violated, and yet Judge Naves goes on for almost 50 pages, saying in so many words, ‘Too bad.’ ”Mr. Churchill, an ethnic studies professor, caused an uproar when he referred in an essay to some victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as “little Eichmanns,” and argued that that was the true reason he was terminated. He filed a wrongful-termination suit, and after a trial earlier this year, a jury found that his political views played a substantial role in his dismissal. But in his 42-page ruling, Judge Naves said the jury’s decision to award Mr. Churchill only $1 compelled him to deny reinstatement.“If I am required to enter an order that is ‘consistent with the jury’s findings,’ I cannot order a remedy that ‘disregards the jury’s implicit finding’ that Professor Churchill has suffered no actual damages that an award of reinstatement would prospectively remedy,” Judge Naves wrote.Judge Naves also said that Mr. Churchill’s rejection of the faculty committee’s conclusion that he had engaged in academic misconduct had made it difficult to return Mr. Churchill to campus.The ruling is a clear victory for the university, which also faced the prospect of having to pay Mr. Churchill for the years he might have taught there, an option Judge Naves also rejected.“At the moment, we feel very satisfied,” said Bronson Hilliard, a university spokesman. “There was an important principle at stake here, and that is academic integrity, which is at the heart of everything we do in research and teaching. We feel very gratified at the outcome.”The decision on Tuesday is at least a temporary conclusion to a tumultuous case that has lasted nearly five years.When Mr. Churchill’s controversial essay first appeared in 2001, it attracted little notice. In it, he described some workers at the World Trade Center as “little Eichmanns,” referring to Adolf Eichmann, who has been called the architect of the Holocaust.By 2005, however, the essay had spread over Web sites, provoking outrage. Shortly after, scholars came forward, accusing Mr. Churchill of plagiarism in his research on American Indians.In May 2006, a faculty committee at the university found serious problems with Mr. Churchill’s scholarship. A year later, the regents dismissed him and Mr. Churchill filed his lawsuit.After the jury’s verdict, Mr. Churchill’s lawyers asked Judge Naves to order reinstatement, and at a hearing last week, they argued that returning him to his job would be logical, based on the jury’s findings. Patrick O’Rourke, a lawyer for the university, countered that Mr. Churchill’s return would harm the institution.Faculty members and administrators testified for both sides, some arguing that Mr. Churchill was a critical voice on campus and others saying that his return would set a terrible precedent.After the initial controversy surrounding Mr. Churchill, faculty members leaped to defend his right to free speech, but that support eroded after the accusations of research misconduct.Scott Robinson, a Denver trial lawyer and analyst who has followed the trial, said he was not surprised at the ruling, given that courts have shied from interfering with university decisions. By the same token, Mr. Robinson said, it was difficult to equate regents with judges, as Judge Naves had, particularly when in this case the regents publicly denounced Mr. Churchill at the outset of the controversy.“This is an extraordinary case which is going to result in some sort of extraordinary final ruling,” Mr. Robinson said.'"
"'09-07-08,'1','Boeing is putting together the first 787s in Everett, Wash., where a strike by unionized machinists shut down work for eight weeks last fall.Jim Proulx, a Boeing spokesman, said the company had not made any decision about a second production line. Boeing’s union work force and political leaders in Washington State would want to add any additional work in Washington.The former Vought plant, based in North Charleston, S.C., makes parts of the 787’s rear fuselage, and it sits next to a facility that does other work on the fuselage.Boeing surprised investors on June 23 when it delayed the Dreamliner’s initial flight to fix a structural problem where the wings attach to the sides of the plane. The problem involved parts designed by Boeing and two Japanese suppliers. The companies are working together on fixes to the design.The company had promised a week earlier that it would make the flight by June 30. It has not yet announced a new test schedule.Boeing has about 850 orders for what will be its most sophisticated plane. The Dreamliner is made of lightweight carbon composites and is supposed to be more fuel-efficient than other aircraft.Over the last two weeks, Qantas Airways of Australia said it had canceled orders for 15 Dreamliners and delayed deliveries on 15 others. But All Nippon Airways of Japan, which is to take delivery of the first 787, said it would increase its order to 55 planes, from 50, to take advantage of the fuel efficiency.The Dreamliner is nearly two years behind schedule and the delays have hurt the company’s credibility. They are costing it millions of dollars in penalties and concessions to airline customers.David E. Strauss, an analyst at UBS, said there was “a laundry list of payments they’re going to have to make,” including penalties to suppliers who did their work on time. He declined to estimate the total, but he said, “It’s big at this point.”Vought had had problems earlier, and its chief executive, Elmer L. Doty, said Tuesday that the financial demands of the program were “clearly growing beyond what a company of our size can support.”Boeing said it would pay $580 million for the plant and forgive Vought from having to repay previous cash advances. Mr. Proulx said the advances totaled $422 million. Vought, based in Dallas, is owned by the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. Boeing, which is based in Chicago, assumed Vought’s interest in that facility last year.Mr. Doty told The Dallas Morning News that Vought, which will continue to work on components for the 787 and other planes, had invested twice as much as it thought it would need to handle its work on the Dreamliner.He said that with the credit crisis, the company was not able to find financing for the hundreds of millions of dollars more that it would probably have needed.Ms. Wood said in her note that Boeing’s decision to bring the work in-house would give it greater control over a “historically problematic process.”But Robert Spingarn, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said recently that the acquisition would increase Boeing’s fixed costs.After Boeing delayed the test flight last month, Mr. Springarn said he thought the first Dreamliner delivery would be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2010, compared with Boeing’s goal of next year’s first quarter.He said Boeing might be able to deliver only six planes next year, instead of what Credit Suisse had previously expected to be 33, and that the increase in production could be slower than expected in 2011 and 2012.The delays could provide more breathing room for Airbus, whose ultramodern A350 is years behind the 787 in development. But Airbus has also had other problems, including the recent crashes of two passenger planes in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The causes remain under investigation.'"

"'09-07-09,'1','Yes, you're right. Which is sort of what I was driving at when I wrote, ""Google also wins with maps and driving directions; it offers features like Street View (actual photos along your route) and the ability to drag the colored route line to alternative roadways with your mouse (to avoid a traffic jam or take a favorite shortcut).""Several of you wrote to say that Bing doesn't seem to return as *many* results as Google.I'd thought of mentioning that in the review. It's not always true, but it's often true.I guess my question is: is pure quantity the measure of a good search engine? How often, really, do you ever look at anything past the first 1 or 2 pages of results? How much more useful are 12.4 million results for ""bass fishing"" (Google) than 11.7 million (Bing)?Another reader wrote me that he had proof that Bing isn't as good as Google. At this site (http://bset.royans.net), someone conducted a blind ""rate these search results"" test with 400 Internet citizens, and found that the quality of Google's results are rated higher than Bing's.That's an interesting data point. However, the ""whose ratings are better"" test ignores the time-saving utility of Bing's best features, like being able to point to a result in the list--and read, in a pop-up bubble, the actual text of that Web page without having to go there. And it ignores the convenience of Bing's table of search refinements that appear with almost every search.The bottom line: both Bing and Google will get you the information you're looking for 99 percent of the time. Flights, medical information, shopping, historical facts, cultural trends, reviews, companies, people, how-to information, and on and on--both will give you essentially the same results, but Bing will save you time.There are definitely cases where one beats the other. Google wins on maps, directions, movie showtimes. Bing wins on traffic reports, company customer-service numbers and medical symptoms.Finally, one reader wrote to say that Microsoft installs many more cookie files (Website preference files) on your hard drive than Google does.Even if it's true, I can't believe the suggestion: that Microsoft is more likely to snoop on you than Google.Listen, *nobody* has more of your data than Google. It knows everything you're looking for online; it has all your e-mail (Gmail); it has all your phone calls, text messages and voicemails (Google Voice); and on and on. If you're going to start being paranoid, you may as well display equal-opportunity paranoia.None of this is to say that Microsoft is this wonderful, altruistic company; the huge irony is that I spend most of my time defending myself for what's perceived as *bashing* Microsoft. But they've really achieved something good with Bing, and it deserves credit for that.'"

"'09-07-09,'1','Three police officers were hit by bullet fragments that ricocheted after the police fired at a pit bull charging at them from an apartment in a housing project on the Upper East Side late Wednesday night, a police official said.A woman in the apartment who had opened the door, letting the pit bull out, was also hit. None of the injuries were serious, the police said.The Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said that a sergeant and five officers had been sent to the apartment at 1806 First Avenue, near East 93rd Street, after someone called 911 and reported an assault in Apt. 11-J. The caller said the assailant had a gun, Mr. Browne said.The officers, from the 19th Precinct and the Midtown North Task Force, rang the doorbell and the door opened wide enough for the pit bull to race out, Mr. Browne said. Three of the officers opened fire, Mr. Browne said. He said it was not immediately clear how many bullets they had discharged.The bullets richocheted in the close quarters of the hallway. One officer from the task force was hit by a bullet fragment under his right eye. Another fragment hit the hand of a second officer. An officer from the 19th Precinct was hit on the side of his nose.The woman who had opened the door, whose name was not immediately released, was hit in the arm.All the injured were taken to New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.The woman who let the dog out was arrested. The dog died in the shooting.Mr. Browne said the police found five other people in the apartment but no gun. He said all five were being questioned.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','AS President Obama will soon discover, erasing the nuclear weapons legacy of the cold war is like running the Snake River rapids in Wyoming — the first moments in the tranquil upstream waters offer little hint of the vortex ahead. Now that Mr. Obama has set a promising arms reduction agenda with President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia, he faces the greater challenge of getting his own government and the American nuclear weapons establishment to support his audacious plan to make deep weapons cuts and ultimately eliminate nuclear weapons.So far, Mr. Obama has effectively coupled an overarching vision of getting to a world without nuclear weapons, outlined in a speech in Prague earlier this year, with concrete first steps like the one-quarter reduction in operational strategic nuclear weapons promised in Moscow this week. Given his short time in office, and the looming December expiration of the treaty with Russia covering strategic nuclear arms reductions, the new limits are a good, realistic start. It is especially important to extend the monitoring and verification provisions of the expiring arms accord.But the overall Obama approach involves a balancing act that requires him to move boldly while reassuring opponents that he is not endangering our security. Put simply, he has to maintain a potent nuclear arsenal while slashing it.Mr. Obama might consider Ronald Reagan’s experience when he tried to set a similar course. The nuclear weapons crowd practically disowned Reagan when he proposed abolishing nuclear weapons during his 1986 summit meeting with Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland. After the meeting, when Reagan asked his generals to explore the ramifications of possibly sharply cutting warheads and eliminating nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles, they politely but firmly told their commander in chief it was a terrible idea.Mr. Obama’s moment of truth with his generals is coming later this year when the Pentagon completes its periodic Nuclear Posture Review. This, in the Pentagon’s words, “will establish U.S. nuclear deterrence policy, strategy and force posture for the next 5 to 10 years.” So it will be the American nuclear weapons bible for the remainder of Mr. Obama’s presidency, one term or two.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','“The circle of sensitive competitive information between Apple and Google seems to be widening,” said Andrew I. Gavil, an antitrust specialist and a professor at Howard University School of Law. “The more you have potential overlap in products and marketing strategy, the more the F.T.C. might get concerned about a violation of Section 8.”Steve Dowling, a spokesman for Apple, declined to comment on the matter.Matt Furman, a Google spokesman, also declined to comment. But during a meeting with reporters in May, Mr. Schmidt said, “From my perspective, I don’t think Google sees Apple as a primary competitor.”Apple and Google already compete in mobile phones (Apple’s iPhone vs. Google’s Android software), Web browsers (Safari vs. Chrome), online media (iTunes vs. YouTube) and other services, such as photo editing tools. Mr. Schmidt recuses himself from Apple board meetings when the discussion turns to the iPhone.But that does not satisfy critics.“Section 8 is there for a reason,” said James F. Rill, an antitrust lawyer with Howrey L.L.C. and a former assistant attorney general. “It’s an attempt to apply a prophylactic safeguard against possible collusive action. It’s an easy statute to comply with, and one may question why Google hasn’t complied with it.”Antitrust specialists say that antitrust actions under Section 8 are rare, because shared directors often resign from one board when a problem arises. Shared directors are not considered problematic if revenue from the products in which the companies compete is less than 2 percent of either company’s sales.Apple gets well more than 2 percent of its revenue from the iPhone and its Mac OS X operating system. But it may be hard to determine whether Google has crossed the 2 percent threshold.Google says it will offer the Chrome operating system free to netbook makers under an open-source license. That would be likely to push more people to Google’s lucrative search engine, and perhaps allow them to search the Web faster, but it would be difficult to determine the direct financial impact. Antitrust lawyers say the F.T.C. could also examine collaboration between the companies using a different standard, Section 5 of the F.T.C. Act, which prohibits “unfair methods of competition.”“The F.T.C. is going to have to be extra-sensitive to ensure there is nothing that interferes with the innovation that these two vigorously competitive companies have brought to consumers,” said David Turetsky, of the Washington law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf and a former antitrust lawyer at the Justice Department.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','LONDON — A British newspaper, The Guardian, reported on Wednesday that Rupert Murdoch’s British newspaper subsidiary paid about $1.6 million to settle court cases involving allegations that its reporters worked with private investigators to hack into the cellphone messages of numerous public figures. Among those whose cellphones were tapped or hacked into were the former deputy prime minister and at least one other cabinet minister, The Guardian reported.The Guardian’s report was denied by Mr. Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns the Fox Broadcasting Company in the United States as well as The Wall Street Journal and The New York Post. Bloomberg News quoted Mr. Murdoch as saying on Wednesday that he was not aware of any payments made to settle legal cases in which the company’s reporters in Britain might have been involved in criminal activity.“If that had happened, I would know about it,” he said.The Guardian report could not be independently verified. The newspaper cited an unnamed “senior source” at Scotland Yard as saying that staff members at News International, the Murdoch subsidiary that owns four major newspapers in Britain, including The Times of London, The Sunday Times and two tabloids, The News of the World and The Sun, had used private investigators to hack into “thousands” of cellphones to obtain confidential personal data, including tax records, social security files, bank statements and itemized telephone bills. It cited another source “with knowledge of the police findings” as saying that the investigators had tapped “two or three thousand” cellphones.The Guardian article, citing those sources, said that the targets of the hacking included John Prescott, who was deputy to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, and a cabinet member, Tessa Jowell, as well as lawmakers from all three of Britain’s major political parties. Accessing stored phone messages covertly is illegal in Britain, except for the police or intelligence agencies acting with a warrant.The Guardian said Scotland Yard files also showed that the newspapers had used private investigators to approach government agencies, banks, phone companies and other agencies that, the paper said, were conned into handing over confidential information on politicians, actors, athletes, musicians and television presenters, all of whom are named in the files. The Guardian said the files named 31 reporters working for The News of the World and The Sun in connection with the operation.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','Five of the seven players who sit on the L.P.G.A.’s 13-member board were in favor of removing Bivens, according to a report on Tuesday by Golf World magazine. Seven votes are needed to remove Bivens, who is also a board member.“We, as players, we want to be more involved in what is happening, and we want to see the tour going in a better direction,” Ochoa, the tour’s player of the year for the past three years, said Wednesday. Referring to the tour’s board, she added: “There’s not much we can do. I believe they will do the best for us. And hopefully things will start, you know, moving in a good direction, because we are worried that we’re losing tournaments and we want to get back on a good track.”It has been a difficult year for the L.P.G.A. Tour in general and for Bivens in particular.Last August, Bivens introduced a proposal that foreign-born players with two years’ experience on the tour be proficient in English or face suspension beginning in 2009. The language policy — believed at the time to be the only one of its kind in a major sport — was widely seen as aimed at the large group of Asian players on the tour. After receiving criticism from some players, civil rights groups and even lawmakers, Bivens and the tour reversed course and dropped plans to suspend players.Beyond that debate, however, concerns have grown in the past year about the tour’s overall health. When Bivens became commissioner in 2005, the L.P.G.A. had 35 tournaments. That number decreased to 28 before the tour announced that the Kapalua L.P.G.A. Classic would not be played this year.The tour has lost three events in Hawaii this year and will not play another event in the United States until the end of August. It has only 10 contracts with title sponsors for the 2010 tour, and the status of at least three other events is uncertain. The tour also lost important backing from McDonald’s, which was the title sponsor of the L.P.G.A. Championship for 16 years.Despite the weak economy, Bivens has asked tour sponsors to share a greater part of the costs of holding tournaments, according to multiple news accounts. For example, Bivens has asked sponsors to contribute more money to the tour’s electronic scoring system, which can cost up to $100,000 to maintain at a tournament.Fewer tournaments and fewer sponsors mean less prize money for the players. The prospect of losing even more tournaments has created an uneasy feeling among those on the tour.Representatives of sponsors that have contracts with the United States Golf Association, which runs the United States Women’s Open, said they were unconcerned with the controversy.Players like Creamer and Kerr said they did not want to comment publicly on the leadership issues because of the Open’s status as a U.S.G.A. event.“Our player organization is very focused on how these difficult economic times affect our tour,” Kerr said on Tuesday. “And we are actively working with our executive board of management to create the best product for our partners and fans, so let’s talk about the U.S. Open this week.”'"
"'09-07-09,'1','ST. LOUIS — The authorities seized more than 400 dogs on Wednesday and charged 26 people from seven states in what officials called one of the largest crackdowns on dogfighting in the United States.State and federal agents staged raids in several states, picking up individuals in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas.In Missouri, prosecutors said members of a multistate ring routinely destroyed injured dogs by shooting them “in the head, throwing the dogs into the river or burning the dogs in a barrel.”The arrests stem from the same investigation, but officials said the rings were not necessarily connected, and United States attorneys in four districts — the Eastern District of Missouri, the Western District of Missouri, the Southern District of Illinois and the Eastern District of Texas — will try the cases separately.“The allegation is not that this was one concentrated, organized conspiracy,” said Don Ledford, a spokesman for the acting United States attorney for the Western District of Missouri, Matt Whitworth. “This was not one big ring.”In Missouri, the authorities charged 12 people; in Texas federal prosecutors charged nine men; and in Illinois the authorities charged five men with, among other things, buying, selling and breeding animals for dogfighting.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','But about two years ago, with the rent escalating, the apartment slipped out of the Tea and Sympathy family. That’s when Ms. Biosic entered the picture. After seeing a tiny picture of the apartment in an online listing and spotting the tea shop’s awning, she went directly to the source, and Ms. Perry put her in touch with the broker.Now settled in, Ms. Biosic has noticed her apartment attracts a lot of attention. One friend, invited several months ago, remarked that he had always wondered who lived in the space, and found it strange to be sitting on its fire escape. “That’s happened with three people,” Ms. Biosic said.She was sitting at a wood table beside the windows on a recent morning, having given a reporter the grand tour, which took about a minute. As floor plans go, there isn’t much: one medium-size room; a galley kitchen tucked behind a wall; a bathroom; and, in lieu of a bedroom, a sleeping loft up a ladder from the living area, under the sloping roof.In all, the place is no more than 350 square feet. In Portland, Ms. Biosic said, she had triple the space for half the money, but the moment she saw the studio, she was sold.The apartment may be one room, but it is flooded with light and has high ceilings lined with exposed beams. The walls are painted a crisp white, creating what she aptly called a “light box” effect.There’s no shortage of nooks and crannies, either, which are to the city dweller what spare rooms are to the suburbanite. Walls intersect at odd angles, creating recesses in which Ms. Biosic has placed books and knickknacks. Even the fireplace houses a table and TV.Ms. Biosic left Portland, her hometown, seeking “the New York experience,” she said, and her rooftop spot affords her a bird’s-eye view. On nice days, she opens the hinged windows and sits on the fire escape. “My boyfriend and I refer to this place as the ‘perch,’ ” she said. “The other day I saw a parade with people dressed as vegetables. Sitting out here provides so much fodder.”Andrew Pope, an artist and filmmaker who lived in the studio for several years in the 1990s, fondly recalls his time there.“It was what I imagined having an apartment in New York would be like,” Mr. Pope said. “My first few apartments didn’t live up to that fantasy.”Like Ms. Biosic, he was relatively new to the city when he moved in, having come upon the apartment while helping an ex-girlfriend move. A real estate agent they were meeting told Mr. Pope about it, and he took it sight unseen. “It was cheap, maybe $850 a month,” he said. “I thought, ‘How bad could it be?’ ”At the time, many of the building’s residents were “relics,” he said, of an earlier West Village populated with artists and marginally employed eccentrics. Mr. Pope’s neighbor across the hall was a burly woman named Jane who had been a cook in the United States merchant marine.“She had at least one, maybe two parrots and a yappy dog named Sarge,” he said. “When she moved, she gave me this giant institutional cookbook for feeding sailors. The directions were, like, ‘Beef Stew: serves 400.’ ”Another neighbor, an elderly woman, told Mr. Pope his apartment was once occupied by the movie star James Cagney. “For all I know, it’s apocryphal, but that’s the legend,” he said.Mr. Pope now lives in Chelsea with his wife and young son, and although the rooftop space is incompatible with his current life, he said, a small part of him regrets giving the place up.Still, he cited two things he does not miss: the summers (the skylight created a kind of human greenhouse) and the lack of privacy (all those windows make for easy voyeurism). His solution to the latter problem was hanging bamboo shades from Pearl River, which, coincidentally, is exactly what Ms. Biosic has done.The shades are one of the few things she has bought for the apartment. Most of the furniture was shipped from her storage space in Portland, she said, after she had “puzzled out” what would fit in the confined space, selecting compact pieces like Philippe Starck Louis Ghost Chairs and a 1970s chrome lounge chair in the style of Milo Baughman. A curvy, antique Chippendale couch was bought from ABC Carpet and Home to soften the sharp angles. “I noticed all my furniture was linear,” Ms. Biosic said. “I needed something sinuous.”With an air-conditioner installed in the sleeping loft, she doesn’t suffer from the heat, and she seems to have settled comfortably into the rooftop apartment — and into life in Manhattan.“I feel lucky this is my first New York apartment,” she said.'"

"'09-07-09,'1','LOS ANGELES  When the schedule of events for the 40th Comic-Con International fan convention is announced on Thursday, it is expected to include something quite rare, even for a gathering that has pretty much seen it all: an appearance by Hayao Miyazaki.Mr. Miyazaki, regarded by many as the world’s greatest maker of animated films, does not seem to crave publicity. He was a no-show at the Oscars in 2003, when his “Spirited Away” won for best animated feature.And he has not been quick to visit this country. “I think he has an image of the United States as a culture that isn’t that helpful to the world,” offered Duncan Williams, chairman of the Center for Japanese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley.Yet the very private Mr. Miyazaki, in an extraordinary step, has agreed to address a room full of 6,500 admirers at the San Diego comics, fantasy and film convention on July 24. That is a prelude to his planned appearance the next day in Berkeley, where Mr. Williams’s center will present Mr. Miyazaki with its Japan Prize, awarded annually to a person who has brought the world closer to Japan.July 28, should find Mr. Miyazaki in Beverly Hills, Calif., to be honored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The night before, he will be in Hollywood for a screening of his “Ponyo,” about a 5-year-old boy and a goldfish princess in a world gone awry.In part Mr. Miyazaki’s surprise tour is a promotional event: already a hit in many countries, “Ponyo,” in an English-language version, with Tina Fey and Matt Damon among those providing the voices, is set for release by Walt Disney Studios on Aug. 14. (Disney handles his films in many territories worldwide.)But his arrival is also a cultural moment.At the age of 68, with almost 20 features to his credit, Mr. Miyazaki has become a beacon for those who believe that animation has a special power to tell stories with universal appeal.“He celebrates the quiet moments,” said John Lasseter, the chief creative officer of Pixar and Disney Animation Studios, in enumerating traits that make Mr. Miyazaki “one of the most original” filmmakers ever.Mr. Lasseter, a friend of Mr. Miyazaki for more than 20 years, said he routinely looked to the master’s work, which has often combined computer animation with traditional techniques, for inspiration in directing or producing computer-animated films like the “Toy Story” installments, “Cars” or “Up,” all from Pixar.Mr. Miyazaki visited the United States in 1999, when Disney’s unit Miramax Films released his “Princess Mononoke.” The film took in about $2.4 million at the domestic box office, but had $157 million in ticket sales in the rest of the world.According to Mr. Lasseter, Mr. Miyazaki has seldom traveled outside of Japan since, preferring to remain at the headquarters of Studio Ghibli, his production company, in suburban Tokyo.This time around Mr. Lasseter coaxed Mr. Miyazaki out with an assurance. “If you come over, I’ll be by your side the whole time,” Mr. Lasseter recalls telling him.An e-mailed query to a representative for Mr. Miyazaki in Japan drew no response.At Comic-Con Mr. Miyazaki and Mr. Lasseter are expected to appear as part of an animation presentation that will give a glimpse not only at “Ponyo,” but also at a series of coming Disney films, including “Toy Story 3,” “Beauty and the Beast 3-D” and “The Princess and the Frog.”Mr. Miyazaki will not be the only revered figure at this year’s convention. It is expected to include an appearance by James Cameron, who is scheduled for a July 23 presentation about 3-D filmmaking and his coming “Avatar,” for 20th Century Fox. Also on hand will be Peter Jackson. He was a producer of the forthcoming ""District 9"" for Sony Pictures; director of ""The Lovely Bones,"" to be released by Paramount Pictures; and has been working as a writer and producer of ""The Hobbit"" for New Line Cinema and MGM.Still, Mr. Miyazaki, with his roots in both manga and anime (comic books and animated films), may have unusually wide appeal among the 125,000 or so fans who often spend their time at Comic-Con burrowing into esoterica and personal obsessions like the state of steampunk (fantasy set in a steam-driven world) or what kind of action figures toymakers would make if nobody stopped them  both subjects of presentations last year.“Probably a third of the convention will care” intensely about Mr. Miyazaki’s presence, said Mark Evanier, an author and Hollywood writer-producer who plans to conduct a number of panel discussions at this year’s gathering. (Convention tickets have long been sold out.)Oddly, the cult around Mr. Miyazaki has yet to create a box office hit in the United States. His previous feature-length film, “Howl’s Moving Castle,” was nominated for an Oscar in 2006, but took in less than $5 million here, while selling more than $230 million in tickets abroad.Mark Zoradi, president of Disney’s motion picture group, said the company was trying to expand Mr. Miyazaki’s audience here by releasing “Ponyo” more widely than it has his past films, in 800 theaters, and by promoting it on the Disney Channel, Disney.com and elsewhere.Yet Mr. Miyazaki and his work, according to Mr. Williams of Berkeley, have become a primary portal for those who would learn more about Japan.New scholars, said Mr. Williams, whose center has already sold out its Miyazaki appearance, used to talk about studying an economic competitor.“Today, no student says that,” Mr. Williams said. “They talk about growing up with Japanese manga, Japanese anime.”'"
"'09-07-09,'1','ALBANY  Gov. David A. Paterson named Richard Ravitch, a Democratic lawyer with a career in government dating back a half century, as the state’s lieutenant governor on Wednesday.Mr. Paterson said Mr. Ravitch, 76, would bring stability to the capital and help him end what he called the “crisis in governance” that for more than a month has paralyzed the Senate during its 31-to-31 split. The governor wants Mr. Ravitch to preside over the Senate, cast tie-breaking votes on leadership and other procedural votes and succeed him should Mr. Paterson be unable to serve.Mr. Paterson’s move was intended to end the turmoil in the capital, but it seemed chiefly to intensify it, drawing threats of legal challenges even before the governor announced his decision on television at 5 p.m.The lieutenant governor’s office has been vacant since Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned last year and Mr. Paterson succeeded him; the State Constitution does not provide for filling the office in the event of a vacancy.Mr. Ravitch is best known in New York for serving as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from 1979 until 1983, and he also ran for mayor in 1989, losing in a primary to David N. Dinkins. He was chief labor negotiator for Major League Baseball from 1991-1994, and last year the governor called on him to develop a financial rescue plan for the transportation authority.Mr. Paterson’s aides said they expected him to take over the role as soon as Thursday. They also made it clear that he would not be a candidate for the office in 2010 and that Mr. Paterson planned to pick someone else to run with him next year.Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, the state’s top legal officer and a Democrat, like Mr. Paterson, said this week that naming a lieutenant governor would be unconstitutional and entangle the governor “in a political ploy that would wind through the courts for many months.”Leaders of the Republican-dominated Senate coalition said that the governor’s move would further complicate the fight for control of the Senate and that they were preparing a challenge.The governor had his own political calculus. He and his staff believe that he can rebuild his diminished standing in the polls if he is seen to be rising above the Senate fracas and acting boldly. His campaign began making automated calls across the state publicizing the Ravitch selection shortly after his speech.In picking Mr. Ravitch, Mr. Paterson is turning to one of the stewards of New York City’s financial rescue in the 1970s at a similar time of economic peril. Mr. Ravitch, who has agreed to forgo a salary, is a well-regarded public servant, who began his career working in Washington for the House Government Operations Committee in 1959.He was chairman of the state’s Urban Development Corporation under Gov. Hugh L. Carey before leading an overhaul of mass transit financing while he was chairman of the transportation authority.In his televised address Wednesday, Governor Paterson said, “This, I believe, is the right thing to do, I have no doubt of that,” and added, “At a time of unparalleled fiscal difficulty, the appointment of Richard Ravitch today will bring the governor a successor, the Senate a presiding officer and will help to alleviate this crisis.”Senator Dean G. Skelos, the leader of the Republican caucus, said in his own address, “Sadly, once again, the governor has put his political career ahead of you, the public.” He added: “Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has already said it’s unconstitutional for the governor to appoint a lieutenant governor, and I agree.”Senate Democrats welcomed the move. “Extraordinary times call for extraordinary action,” said the Senate Democratic leaders, John L. Sampson and Malcolm A. Smith, in a joint statement.The Senate has been deadlocked since June 8, when Senator Pedro Espada Jr., a Democrat, defected to the Senate’s 30 Republicans, leaving the 62-member chamber evenly divided.Whether Mr. Paterson can legally appoint a lieutenant governor has been a matter of much debate this week. One view, advanced by Democrats and government watchdog groups, is that a provision of state law allows the governor to fill an elected office on his own, if there is not otherwise a process laid out in law for filling the vacancy.The governor argued that the appointment could solve several problems, among them the state’s tangled line of succession. The combination of an empty lieutenant governor’s office and the Senate battle has created confusion about who would take over if the governor were incapacitated. The Senate president is next in line to succeed the governor after the lieutenant governor, but both the feuding Republican and Democratic factions are laying claim to the position.Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat, said, “It would guarantee a line of succession should something happen to the governor, and it would give the Senate a presiding officer to help get it out of the quagmire it’s been in for the last month.”The State Constitution speaks at some length about what is to happen if the office of lieutenant governor is left vacant, but it makes no mention of the possibility of appointing a replacement.Perhaps most important, the Senate’s rules indicate that the lieutenant governor cannot be counted as part of a quorum, a key issue since neither faction has the 32 votes needed to constitute a quorum.“If he can’t vote on that, then the rest becomes moot,” said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at New Paltz.There is also the lack of precedent. Before the stalemate, Mr. Paterson had not sought to fill the position, nor have previous governors done so in other instances when the office was empty.Even proponents conceded that the governor’s decision was not sure to make it through the courts.“This is not a slam-dunk,” said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, a watchdog group that has backed the proposal. But he added, “There needs to be some risk-taking in order for us to break the stalemate.”There is another unspoken rationale for the governor to appoint Mr. Ravitch. His aides believe that it may smooth the way for a power-sharing deal between Senate Democrats and Republicans by removing something Democrats have said they cannot abide: the idea of Mr. Espada being next in line to succeed Mr. Paterson.Mr. Espada claimed the title of Senate president on June 8, and were he to retain that title, the absence of a lieutenant governor would make him second in line to Mr. Paterson.The governor’s office considered whether to make the appointment for about three weeks. Mr. Paterson and his aides first began seriously weighing it after June 18, when both Democrats and Republicans submitted paperwork that the state requires for senators to be paid. That paperwork usually comes from the Senate majority.The governor has not traveled out of state since the dispute began to avoid any confusion about who is running the government.“If something happened to me, it is not known who would act as governor,” Mr. Paterson said Wednesday. “That would throw the entire state government into the chaos that is being experienced in the Senate now.”'"
"'09-07-09,'1','Mr. Berlusconi said that the summit meeting was the product of international teamwork and that the Italian point people had worked “elbow to elbow” with their counterparts. He added that the proposed joint declarations had been “negotiated and all shared by the other leaders.”On Wednesday, Mike Froman, a chief economic adviser to President Obama, told reporters in L’Aquila that he thought the Italians had done “a terrific job preparing the summit,” in terms of both facilities and agenda, which the Italians defined “early on and worked methodically through.”Mr. Froman denied a report that top aides had an emergency conference call because of concerns before the gathering.Beyond the heady agenda, which focuses on the economic crisis, climate change and Middle East politics, Italy hopes that holding the Group of 8 meeting in L’Aquila will help bring international attention and financing to the area, where the quake left 65,000 people homeless and flattened the economy.Two months after the earthquake, tens of thousands of L’Aquila residents are still living in tents. On Wednesday, representatives of local citizens groups lugged gigantic letters to a hilltop that read, “Yes we camp.”“We wanted the leaders to see it,” said Stefano Frezza of Epicentro Solidale, a citizens group based in L’Aquila. “We wanted them to know that while they’re sleeping comfortably, we’re still in tents.”According to the official Group of 8 Web site, the delegations were being hosted in “far from luxurious” accommodations on site, in keeping with the decision to hold an “austere” summit meeting, and “as close to the discomfort and inconvenience that the people of Abruzzo are having to put up with,” referring to the region where L’Aquila is located.On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Berlusconi showed Mr. Obama around downtown L’Aquila, pausing in the main town square in front of the church of the Anime Sante, whose cupola is cracked open like an Easter egg.The two leaders shook hands with recovery workers, and Mr. Obama told firefighters, “Nice job. Keep up the good work,"" according to a pool report. He added: “Our thoughts and prayers are with all the family members who lost loved ones.""Mr. Obama also shook his head in a modest gesture of disbelief in front of the collapsed facade of the main city government office.Earlier in the day, Mr. Berlusconi showed the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, around Onna, one of the towns hardest hit by the quake, where houses still lie in ruins. Flanked by advisers in suits and yellow hard hats, the two leaders stopped to thank rescue and recovery workers.Germany has pledged to help restore the town, a choice made in part because in 1944 Nazi soldiers killed 17 residents in Onna. Mrs. Merkel said she wanted her visit “to be a positive gesture for a town that in the past was struck by Germany,” the Italian news agency ANSA reported.“We hope that Onna becomes an example of sound building practices in the reconstruction,” said Marzia Masiello, a spokeswoman for the residents of Onna.'"
"'09-07-09,'1','Mr. Obama put climate change front and center by scheduling a meeting on the sidelines of the main talks on Thursday and inviting nine other nations that, along with the Group of 8, pump out 80 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases. American officials called the results a step forward in the arduous process intended to lead to a worldwide climate treaty at a conference in Copenhagen in December.But the impasse over the 2050 targets demonstrated again the most vexing problem in reaching a consensus on climate change: the longstanding divisions between developed countries like the United States, Europe and Japan on one side, and developing nations like China, India, Brazil and Mexico on the other.While the richest countries have produced the bulk of the pollution blamed for climate change, developing countries are producing increasing volumes of gases. But developing countries say their climb out of poverty should not be halted to fix damage done by industrial countries.As various sides tried to draft an agreement to sign Thursday, those tensions scuttled the specific goals sought by the United States and Europe. The proposed agreement called for worldwide emissions to be cut 50 percent by 2050, with industrial countries cutting theirs by 80 percent. But emerging powers refused to agree because they wanted industrial countries to commit to midterm goals in the next decade and to follow through on promises of financial and technological help for poorer nations.“They’re saying, ‘We just don’t trust you guys,’ ” said Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s the same gridlock we had last year when Bush was president.”Still, American officials said the agreement on Thursday would include important conceptual commitments by the developing nations to begin curbing emissions and to set a target date for gases to peak.Moreover, a separate statement approved by the Group of 8 nations embraced the 80 percent emission cut for industrial nations and said scientists believed that the increase in world temperature “ought not to exceed” 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.“There were a number of different steps that create a meaningful commitment on emissions control,” said Mike Froman, Mr. Obama’s chief Group of 8 negotiator, “and we’re still a fair ways away from Copenhagen, and we’ll be working with the developing countries between now and then to try and firm up commitments.”The complicated multidirectional negotiations reflect varying messages that the Obama administration is sending different audiences. It is telling the Europeans it agrees with their long-term goals but will not commit to their ambitious short-term targets. At the same time, it is not demanding that leading developing countries make comparable commitments, stoking suspicions in Europe that Mr. Obama is pursuing a separate diplomatic track with China that will result in less ambitious targets.Other Group of 8 leaders emphasized that any solution to climate change depended on the developing world’s joining the battle. Without China and India, said Arkady Dvorkovich, the chief Russian negotiator, any further discussions would not lead anywhere. Besides the United States, Russia and France, the Group of 8 includes Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan and Canada.Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, the meeting’s host, said it made little sense for Group of 8 countries to take on onerous commitments if “five billion people continue to behave as they have always behaved.”Any deal with developing nations became even more elusive after President Hu Jintao of China left for home to deal with unrest in the west of his country. Without agreement from the developing nations on specific targets, the Group of 8 nations watered down their commitment to the 2-degree benchmark.A recent draft of the Group of 8 agreement said emissions should be reduced “to limit the average increase in global temperature to 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.” The final version said the nations “recognize the broad scientific view” that it should not rise more than 2 degrees Celsius.Mr. Meyer said temperatures had already risen by 0.8 degree and would probably rise by another 0.6 degree based only on pollution already in the air, meaning that embracing that goal would require that major steps be taken almost immediately.President George W. Bush agreed to a 50 percent cut in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, but not to an 80 percent reduction in those produced by industrial countries. With Mr. Obama’s support, the House recently passed legislation to curb emissions, though not nearly as fast as the Europeans want.Jake Schmidt, the international climate policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that despite the rejection of the 2050 goals, it was heartening that the developing countries were committing to make reductions, and he added that the 2-degree benchmark would be an important yardstick.“Now,” he said, “every action that is put forward from any country is viewed through this lens — does it help to hold global temperatures below 2 degrees?”'"

"'09-07-10,'0','Because most bank shares have climbed sharply since last fall, the warrants already represent at least a potential profit for taxpayers. But their exact value is open to judgment, in part because the warrants do not trade publicly and have no market price. The banks have what amounts to a right of first refusal to buy back the warrants at “fair market value,” a term that was never defined in the loan agreements.So far, only 11 small banks have repurchased their stock warrants.But the Congressional oversight panel, headed by Elizabeth Warren of the Harvard Law School, analyzed the Treasury Department’s approach to valuation and said it undervalued those stock warrants by about one-third.The panel estimated that the undervaluation of the warrants cost taxpayers $10 million. But it said the approach would undervalue the combined total of all the government’s warrants by $2.1 billion.“In general, Treasury has been selling its warrants back to banks at below market value,” the panel said, in a report released on Friday.The Congressional panel acknowledged that valuing the warrants involved many assumptions about the volatility of stock prices and a company’s future dividend payments. Small changes in those assumptions can drastically change the estimated value of the warrants, which are good for 10 years.But the panel said its estimates were reviewed by three top experts in the field of valuing stock options, including Robert Merton of the Harvard Business School. It said it used a variation of the Black-Scholes approach, the most widely-used method for valuing stock options.The panel said one big reason for the Treasury’s undervaluation was that it included a liquidity discount based on the possibility that the owner of a warrant would face a cash squeeze and be under to pressure to sell. That discount was inappropriate, the panel said, because the government will never face such a cash crunch.It recommended that the government consider a public auction for the warrants, which would make it easier to establish a market price for them.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury, said the government’s approach went beyond simple models and included getting quotes from different market participants.“Treasury has laid out a clear and consistent approach,” Mr. Williams said. “We recognize that with non-traded securities, some will say that any price at which Treasury sells is too low, and some will say it is too high. The problem is that model valuations alone do not represent what someone will pay for a warrant.”'"

Mr. Shipley sold more than 50 weapons, the indictment said. Some were recovered after shootouts between the Mexican Army and drug dealers in Chihuahua on March 8 last year that left seven dead, officials said. Mr. Shipley, who was released on bond this week, has been suspended without pay since March 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','In 2008, Pressel lost distance on her drive. She was never a heavy hitter, but last year her driving average fell mysteriously, to 229.8 yards, from 241.8 in 2007.“That’s the $64,000 question,” her coach and grandfather, Herb Krickstein, said about the decrease. “Nobody’s been able to figure that out. She was longer even when she was younger.”This year, Pressel has brought her average drive back up to 241.6, thanks to a change in her swing. Krickstein said Pressel was learning not to fall back as she hits the ball and was trying to better synchronize her upper and lower body as she drives the ball. She has also changed her posture and where her club rests at the top of her swing.But the increase in distance has come at a cost. Pressel has had trouble keeping the ball in the fairway and has missed the cut three times in two months, including at the L.P.G.A. Championship in June.“She’s not there yet, about halfway there,” Krickstein said. “She’s still in between the old swing and the new swing.”Krickstein said that was evident in the first 10 holes Thursday. Saucon Valley is a 6,740-yard course, and if players like Pressel cannot hit it long, they have to hit it straight. She was able to do it last weekend at the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic, where she finished second in a playoff, but not on the early holes at Saucon Valley.Pressel bogeyed the second hole, then had consecutive bogeys at the sixth and seventh, as she battled to keep the ball in the fairway.Her frustration manifested itself at the par-4 10th hole. Pressel put her drive in a fairway bunker. After she hit her approach shot short of the green, she flung her club toward her bag, which was lying on the fairway. She missed the bag long. She retrieved the club, threw it at the bag again, and this time hit her target. She bogeyed that hole and was four over par.But Pressel played the final eight holes bogey free and made her lone birdie, though that did not mean her bag got away without further abuse. On the 16th, she put her drive in the rough, turned to her bag and, with clenched teeth, kicked it with her right foot. But she then put her approach within 15 feet of the hole and made her putt.“After the front nine, my chances didn’t look so good, but that’s kind of what the Open’s about, staying tough and trying to get out on very, very difficult golf courses,” Pressel said.To win this tournament, Pressel will have to surpass promising young players who have overshadowed her the last two years, with talent from all over the world.“There are so many more, better players than when she started,” Krickstein said. “To win, you would need a lot of luck.”“She’s just got to get better, train harder, get stronger,” Krickstein said. “And pick up some distance.”'"
"'09-07-10,'0','Police officers receive training to prepare for shootings in confined spaces like hallways, but there are no guidelines barring the use of deadly force in such situations, said Mr. Browne.Mr. Browne said dogs were “a continuous threat” to city officers. “People engaged in crime train them to be vicious,” he said. “They’ll use them as an intimidation factor against competitors, as personal protection or against the police. As a result, we come into contact with them frequently, pit bulls in particular.”The police shot 30 dogs last year and have shot 15 so far this year, he said; he could not say how many had been killed.Of the 126 times that officers fired their guns in 2006, they shot at dogs 30 times, said Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, who has analyzed the data in the department’s annual firearms discharge reports. A year earlier, he said, 32 of 123 shootings involved dogs, and in 2004, 26 of 114 did.In those three years, Mr. Dunn said, the shots hit the dogs 55 percent of the time; when officers fired shots at people in the same years, they hit 23.4 percent of the time.In the incident on Wednesday, a woman called 911 at 10:21 p.m. to report a “litany of complaints” about Apartment 11-J; she said two men were fighting with knives and guns, Mr. Browne said. Eight officers responded to the report. When they knocked on the door, Ms. Martinez looked through a peephole and said, “Give me a minute,” Mr. Browne said. Two minutes later, the door opened and the dog came out. He ran past five officers who were just outside the door, and charged at the three others down the hall.Two officers fired three shots each; a third officer fired once.Neighbors at the building, the 20-story Isaacs Houses, said on Thursday that they were familiar with the dog. One man, who declined to give his name, said Baby had been sweet.“He was a strong, big, dog,” the man said. “He might have looked aggressive, but he was playful.”Others said Apartment 11-J was always noisy.Ms. Martinez, the primary tenant of 11-J, was evicted on April 7 because she had not paid her rent, but a judge allowed her back into the apartment on April 24 after she paid what she owed, city officials said.The New York City Housing Authority is moving, in an internal proceeding, to evict her over issues that came to light when her husband was arrested in a 2008 drug-trafficking case, the officials said. The Housing Authority also took issue with her owning an unregistered pit bull and housing unauthorized occupants, said Howard Marder, a spokesman for the agency.“Our regulations have been that you have to register your pet” with the city, Mr. Marder said.On Thursday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the police had acted responsibly.“We had disagreed violently with the judge to let these people go back into their apartment, given their conduct before of behavior that was against the rules and illegal,” the mayor said.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey made a proposal this week that it said could break the long impasse at ground zero and allow the developer Larry A. Silverstein to build two skyscrapers on the 16-acre site, providing he can raise $625 million.But it does not appear that the proposal will lead to an immediate cessation of hostilities between the two sides or of the acrimony between the authority and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who is concerned that the dispute could eventually halt work on the World Trade Center site.For the first time, the authority, which owns the site, agreed to guarantee financing for both of Mr. Silverstein’s office towers, which are to be built along Church Street, at an estimated cost of $4.2 billion, according to a letter on Monday from the Port Authority to the Bloomberg administration and the office of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.But up to $1.2 billion in financing for the second tower would come only after Mr. Silverstein raised $625 million from investors or lenders, according to the proposal.The letter, from Christopher O. Ward, the authority’s executive director, was sent to City Hall on the same day that Mr. Silverstein sought to start an arbitration process, angrily claiming that the Port Authority had violated the development agreement at ground zero.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','United Aircraft changed its name to the United Technologies Corporation in 1975 to reflect its expanded business. By 1986, Mr. Gray had transformed a one-industry company with $2 billion in annual sales into a conglomerate pulling in $16 billion a year from many sectors. His competitors were other sprawling giants, like Lockheed and Honeywell.In his vision, Mr. Gray was a generalist. But he was single-minded and unrelenting when pursuing companies that he thought had strengths that complemented those of United Technologies.Mr. Gray reportedly compiled and memorized a list of 30 companies that he wanted to acquire, and few managed to resist when the “Grand Acquisitor,” as Mr. Gray was known in that heyday of strong-arm takeovers and boardroom intrigue, came swooping.“He was of an era that created some of the great diversified companies,” Martin Lipton, the mergers and acquisitions lawyer who advised Mr. Gray after founding the New York law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Kranz, said in a telephone interview. “Very significant companies were built, but they didn’t really last. His was one of the few that lasted, that became a real integrated company.”By the mid-1980s, some United Technologies executives were beginning to chafe under Mr. Gray’s domineering style and disinclination to involve himself in everyday operations.When he reluctantly ceded the chairmanship to Robert F. Daniell, an engineer who set out to trim the organization and take a more direct role in managing it, a Wall Street analyst said, “To say that the days of empire building are over is all but a truism.”Mr. Gray was born Harry Jack Grusin on Nov. 18, 1919, in a rural community called Milledgeville Crossroads, Ga. His mother died when he was 6, and his father, after going broke and moving the family to Chicago, abandoned him and his sister, who was 15 years his senior.His sister was at the steps of an orphanage where she had planned to leave him when she changed her mind, he told a New York Times reporter in 1982. From then until he left for college, Mr. Gray slept on a folding cot in her apartment.Despite this adversity, he later said, he saw a world wide in scope, rich in opportunity and defined by individual success.“I’m a self-starter, a self-charger,” Mr. Gray said in the interview. “By the age of 9, it was my sister and me against the world.”He entered the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1936, working as a waiter and dishwasher, and earned a degree in journalism.He soon left for the European battlefields of World War II. After fighting in the Army for four and a half years under Gen. George S. Patton, his hero, and receiving a Silver Star for actions in the Battle of the Bulge, Mr. Gray returned to Urbana and earned a master’s degree in 1947.He changed his name to Gray in 1951.In his early 30s, having worked as a truck salesman, Mr. Gray moved to California after reading about stock options in a magazine. Thinking that “an individual who didn’t have capital could begin to build an equity position” through stock options as a corporate employee, he took a pay cut, joined Litton and started his corporate career.His first marriage ended in divorce, as did his second, to Barbara Sander.He married Helen Buckley in 1978. She survives him, along with two daughters from one of his previous marriages, Pamela and Victoria, both of Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.; his stepdaughter, Janet Lewis of West Hartford, Conn.; two grandchildren; and two step-grandchildren.In retirement, the Grays contributed to many charities, mostly in Hartford, and in Illinois and Florida.In his later years Mr. Gray received an honorary doctorate from the University of Illinois, where he said he had once worked as a waiter in the house of a fraternity that he could not afford to join.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','So Mr. Aguado — who can by turns be Falstaffian or fierce — set up programs to nurture, showcase and reward the borough’s artists, arguing for their needs with private donors and public officials. In an abandoned public school on Longwood Avenue, he created a groundbreaking gallery and studio that has produced two MacArthur grant winners. In an area where outsiders thought the Yankees were the only attraction, he created a cultural corridor; today, that stretch of the Grand Concourse is a destination for music, art and theater lovers.Yet the reaction Mr. Aguado first encountered when people learned he was promoting Bronx artists was puzzlement, if not derision. People asked if he carried a switchblade. He did not, but his comebacks were equally cutting.“There was no respect for what we were trying to do here in the 1980s,” he said. “The image they had was there was no local culture. They saw me as a social worker who had to educate people about the beauty of the major cultural institutions downtown. My belief was the art from our communities had to be recognized, and not just as folklore.”Originally an educator, he arrived at the council in 1978 after running several alternative schools. He had been raised on activism, he said, but took the council job as a grants administrator once he realized “the revolution was never going to happen.”Three years later, he was tapped to head the council, which had been formed in 1962. He said he would stay until the board found a suitable replacement. But the longer he worked with the borough’s diverse artists, the more he took to his job.Many of those artists found a home in the gallery he carved from Public School 39, a vacant building that civic boosters feared would succumb to the destruction that had devastated the surrounding blocks. He turned it into the Longwood Art Gallery and converted a dozen classrooms into art studios. The theater troupe Pregones, after outgrowing its space in East Harlem, took up residence. Some artists did, too, literally.“I had the head of the National Endowment for the Arts visiting Longwood one day,” Mr. Aguado said. “I had just told him how nobody lives here but it was open 24 hours. Right then comes this artist, Ted, in his bathrobe carrying an empty coffee pot. He looks at me and says ‘Hi, Boss!’ and keeps on walking.”The gallery’s life spanned the neighborhood’s rebirth, as local housing groups rebuilt the area. About six years ago the city put three new schools into the building. The gallery found a new home at the Hostos Center, which had thrived with the council’s support.As in other once-blighted neighborhoods, there has been speculation that the South Bronx will become an artists’ haven. Some have gone so far as to call it SoBro, a term that rankles a few locals.Mr. Aguado shrugs off the suggestion, noting how the parts of Port Morris that have been rezoned in anticipation of an artistic invasion are too isolated from mass transit and lack stores and supermarkets. He also resents the efforts of one landlord who, he said, has been squeezing out longtime artists.“The landlord told the artists they could always go to B.C.A. for help with the rent,” Mr. Aguado said. “But I am not about to use our funds to subsidize a landlord. And I’ll tell that to foundations who ask me about this guy. We do not want the South Bronx to become another Dumbo.”The Bronx cultural scene over which he has presided includes an opera company, a chamber music group, a Hunts Point dance troupe and a gallery in a Mott Haven apartment.In one recent collaboration of local musicians, an African kora player was paired with a musician playing a traditional Chinese stringed instrument. “It was the most incredible minute and a half of music between two people that I had ever heard in my life,” he said. “A lot of our communities are hybrids, and our cultural expression is hybrid.”Although he is retiring, he is staying on as a consultant to his successor, Deirdre Scott, who has worked at the Studio Museum in Harlem and been on the council’s board. And he won’t stay away from the places he has sustained over the years.During a visit to Pregones Theater, which now occupies a renovated building off the Grand Concourse, Alvan Colon Lespier, the company’s associate artistic director, greeted him with a warm embrace. An upright piano sat in a spotlight on the otherwise empty stage.“We just finished our season this afternoon,” said Mr. Colon Lespier. “We put on a musical revue for senior citizens. A few standards, some Latin music, some Rafaél Hernández.”It was the kind of program that Mr. Aguado liked — giving some of the borough’s older residents the kind of music that they had cherished from their youth. A few times, he noted, he even brought the music of Hernández, Puerto Rico’s most famous composer, to spots in Riverdale or Kingsbridge more used to klezmer or Celtic.“The one thing about Bill and the B.C.A. is that it’s like being at art school,” Mr. Colon Lespier said. “He takes all these folks to school and they learn about the importance of art for a community. Some get it quickly. Some are slow learners. But eventually they get it.”Mr. Aguado corrected him slightly: “Or they say yes, so I’ll keep my mouth shut.”'"
"'09-07-10,'0','Quietly, modestly — but also heroically — Ghana’s going about the business of rebranding a continent. New face of , meet the new face of Africa.Ghana is well governed. After a close election, power changed hands peacefully. Civil society is becoming stronger. The country’s economy was growing at a good clip even before oil was found off the coast a few years ago. Though it has been a little battered by the global economic meltdown, Ghana appears to be weathering the storm. I don’t normally give tips — sound the alarm at Times headquarters — but here is one: buy Ghanaian.So it’s not a coincidence that Ghana’s making steady progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Right now it’s one of the few African nations that has a shot at getting there by 2015.No one’s leaked me a copy of the president’s speech in Ghana, but it’s pretty clear he’s going to focus not on the problems that afflict the continent but on the opportunities of an Africa on the rise. If that’s what he does, the biggest cheers will come from members of the growing African middle class, who are fed up with being patronized and hearing the song of their majestic continent in a minor key.I’ve played that tune. I’ve talked of tragedy, of emergency. And it is an emergency when almost 2,000 children in Africa a day die of a mosquito bite; this kind of hemorrhaging of human capital is not something we can accept as normal.But as the example of Ghana makes clear, that’s only one chord. Amid poverty and disease are opportunities for investment and growth — investment and growth that won’t eliminate overnight the need for assistance, much as we and Africans yearn for it to end, but that in time can build roads, schools and power grids and propel commerce to the point where aid is replaced by trade pacts, business deals and home-grown income.President Obama can hasten that day. He knows change won’t come easily. Corruption stalks Africa’s reformers. “If you fight corruption, it fights you back,” a former Nigerian anti-corruption official has said.From his bully pulpit, the president can take aim at the bullies. Without accountability — no opportunity. If that’s not a maxim, it ought to be. It’s a truism, anyway. The work of the American government’s is founded on that principle, even if it doesn’t put it that bluntly. aid dollars increasingly go to countries that use them and don’t blow them. Ghana is one. There’s a growing number of others.That’s thanks to Africans like John Githongo, the former anticorruption chief of Kenya — a hero of mine who is pioneering a new brand of bottom-up accountability. Efforts like his, which are taking place across the continent, deserve more support. The presidential kind. Then there’s ’s moral and financial fist — Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a managing director of the and the country’s former finance minister — who is on a quest to help African countries recover stolen assets looted by corrupt officials. And the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which is helping countries like Ghana clean up the oil, gas and mining business, to make sure that profits don’t wind up in the hands of kleptocrats.Presidential attention would be a shot in the arm for these efforts — an infusion of moral and political amino acids that, by the way, will make aid dollars go further. That should be welcome news to the leaders gathered in to whom Mr. Obama bids a -via- -inflected “arrivederci,” as he leaves for Africa.This week’s summit meeting looks as if it will yield some welcome new G-8 promises on agriculture. (So far, new money: America. Old money: everyone else.) This is the good news that President Obama will bring from to Ghana.The not-so-good news — that countries like Italy and are not meeting their Africa commitments — makes the president’s visit all the more essential. The United States is one of the countries on track to keep its promises, and Mr. Obama has already said he’ll more than build on the impressive Bush legacy.President Obama plans to return to Africa for the World Cup in 2010. Between now and then he’s got the chance to lead others in building — from the bottom up — on the successes of recent efforts within Africa and to learn from the failures. There’s been plenty of both. We’ve witnessed the good, the bad and the ugly in our fraught relationship with this dynamic continent.The president can facilitate the new, the fresh and the different. Many existing promises are expiring in 2010, some of old age and others of chronic neglect. New promises from usual and unusual partners, from the G-8 to the , need to be made — and this time kept. If more African nations (not just Ghana) are going to meet the millennium goals, they are going to need smart partners in business and development. That’s Smart as in sustainable, measurable, accountable, responsive and transparent.Africa is not just ’s homeland. It’s ours, too. The birthplace of humanity. Wherever our journeys have taken us, they all began there. The word uses is “ubuntu”: I am because we are. As he says, until we accept and appreciate this we cannot be fully whole.Could it be that all Americans are, in that sense, African-Americans?'"
"'09-07-10,'0','“If you’re going to have readmission policies or payment incentives, you have to contemplate adjusting the readmission rates for socioeconomic status,” Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospitals Association, a trade and lobbying group, said after the data were released. “If you use raw data, then you’re going to get a situation where every community which has a high density of poverty is going to get punished. That’s going to be New York, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami.”But a number of health care experts pointed out that some hospitals that treat poor patients, like Harlem Hospital Center, a city-run institution, managed to do well on readmissions, while others, like Montefiore Medical Center, a large academic institution in the Bronx, did not, suggesting that there was more to the equation than demographics.“Most people don’t want to come to the hospital, don’t want to come to the emergency department,” Dr. Eric A. Coleman, a professor of medicine and director of the care transitions program at the University of Colorado at Denver, said on Thursday. “We’re signaling that there’s a failure going on when people are leaving without adequate plans to get their needs met.”Across the country, about one in five Medicare patients end up back in the hospital within 30 days after being discharged, according to a recent article in The New England Journal of Medicine.An analysis published in The Journal in April estimated that unplanned hospital readmissions accounted for $17.4 billion of the $102.6 billion that Medicare paid to hospitals in 2004. It found that half of the nonsurgical patients readmitted within a month had not seen a doctor for follow-up care after they were discharged.The new data were posted on Medicare’s Hospital Compare Web site. The information looks at how many Medicare patients had to be readmitted to hospitals within a month of being discharged after treatment for heart attack, heart failure or pneumonia between July 2005 and June 2008.In all three categories, New York hospitals, when measured against the national rate, fared poorly.Dr. Gary Kalkut, senior vice president and chief medical officer of Montefiore Medical Center, said on Thursday that the data failed to recognize the disparity between how affluent and poorer patients care for themselves after discharge.“There are people we discharge who don’t have a primary-care doctor,” he said. In contrast, he said, hospitals with more affluent patients could rely on them to take care of their own health.Peter Ashkenaz, a spokesman for Medicare, said that the data were adjusted based on medical risk factors that often correlate with socioeconomic status. But he added in an e-mail message on Thursday, “Hospitals are expected to meet the needs of their patient populations and provide a high level of health care services without regard to the diverse socioeconomic characteristics of the patients.”Readmission rates were mixed among the city’s 11 public hospitals. But Ana Marengo, a spokeswoman for the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation, credited the good results at some city hospitals to practices like connecting patients to home health services, providing a month’s supply of medicine when patients are discharged and having translation services available.N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, which serve many affluent patients, along with some less affluent ones, had readmissions rates on a par with the national rate.Dr. Robert Press, chief medical officer at N.Y.U., credited measures like a partnership with the Visiting Nurse Service of New York and giving written discharge instructions to patients.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','WASHINGTON — Judge Sonia Sotomayor carries a small black travel pouch, not much larger than a wallet. It contains the implements she needs — a blood sugar testing kit, a needle and insulin — to manage diabetes, a disease she has had for 46 years. Friends say she is not shy about using it.“She’ll be eating Chinese dumplings,” said Xavier Romeu Matta, a former law clerk to the judge, “and she’ll say, ‘Excuse me sweetie,’ and pull out the kit and inject her insulin.”That no-nonsense attitude, combined with the attention to detail that characterizes her legal opinions, has been a hallmark of Judge Sotomayor’s approach to Type 1 diabetes, according to friends, colleagues and her longtime doctor, Andrew Jay Drexler. An endocrinologist in Los Angeles, Dr. Drexler pronounced her “in very good health” in a letter provided by the White House.In Type 1 diabetes, typically diagnosed in childhood, the body fails to produce insulin, necessary to regulate blood sugar. Experts say “tight control” of blood sugar, through careful monitoring, is essential to preventing complications, which can include blindness, kidney disease and nerve damage. Today, many patients wear pumps to deliver a steady metered dose of insulin, but Judge Sotomayor does not; her friends say she prefers to inject insulin the old-fashioned way.In his letter, Dr. Drexler, who practiced in New York until two years ago, wrote that Judge Sotomayor has maintained “excellent control” over her blood sugar in the more than 20 years he has cared for her. She is free from eye, kidney and nerve complications and not expected to develop any, he wrote, adding that her blood sugar levels, as measured by the standard A1C hemoglobin test, have consistently been “better than 98 percent of diabetics.”'"

"'09-07-10,'0','So I sharpened my pencil and took the test.THE SURVEY Each question had five responses, from strongly agree to strongly disagree. I resolved not to try to outsmart the test, even though I could tell from the start that it was set up to ask essentially the same question several times, presumably to keep people honest. Greg Davies, a behavioral economist and director in the investment and product office at Barclays Wealth, designed the test and admitted as much.Question 11, for example, was: “In order to achieve high returns, I am willing to choose high-risk investments”, while question 16 was “Compared to holding cash, buying stocks and shares is too risky.” You cannot strongly agree with both of them.The theory underlying the assessment is predicated on the research into behavioral economics that won Daniel Kahneman the Nobel in economic science. That research, called prospect theory, looked at how people make choices when risk is involved.Where the Barclays team looks to take this further is through applying the results to your portfolio.“It’s not a mechanistic process,” Mr. Davies said. “It’s a guidance system. This gets you to a high level very quickly.”ANALYSIS My financial personality profile was split into six categories — risk tolerance; composure in the face of financial uncertainty; market engagement, which was my comfort level with investing in securities; perceived financial expertise; and two that measured the value I felt financial advisers provided, delegation and belief in skill.The first four, Mr. Davies said, remain relatively constant regardless of wealth, age or investment returns and have been stable through the downturn. The last two fluctuate. Recently, they have been going down since investors have lost their faith in the ability of financial advisers and money managers to protect their wealth.What surprised me was that the results confirmed that I was pretty much the investor I thought I was. I have a “medium-low risk tolerance” and a “greater market benchmark focus.”What does this mean? Put simply, I want to have slightly better than average performance and I can’t stomach major losses. If an index is up 7 percent, I want to be up at least that amount. But I don’t need to be up 25 percent because I understand the level of risk I would have to accept to achieve that: anything that can go up 25 percent can go down 25 percent.Likewise, I understand that markets go down, but I don’t want to lose as much as everybody else when I’m paying someone to invest my money. I could lose it on my own and save the management fee.SURPRISES The two big surprises were that my trust in delegation and belief in skill were much higher than Mr. Davies would have thought and my risk tolerance was lower. Without saying it directly, he hinted that most business journalists were generally cynical when it comes to the skills of financial advisers, but I was less so.It was a fair point. And since these are the variables that fluctuate the most, I had a good sense as to why. My wife and I had been with a Smith Barney broker for years. He got us modest gains in the good times but seemingly all possible losses when the market went south. Had I answered this survey before we moved to our new, registered investment adviser, my score in those categories would probably have been much lower.As for my comparatively low risk tolerance, I told him that came from recent losses. Regardless of how good our new adviser is, I’m sure it will take him years to get us back to where we were at the beginning of last year.I also noticed I gave myself particularly high marks on perceived financial expertise. I have written about business for nearly 15 years but still wondered if I was being arrogant. Mr. Davies said I had scored myself slightly below the top, where most senior bankers scored themselves. Young bankers fresh out of school were the ones who scored themselves at the very top. The reason, Mr. Davies said, is that “there is an increase in humility with age.”SIGNIFICANCE Once Barclays knew who I was as an investor, it could then put that knowledge to work. With either $5 million or $50 million, the two fictitious sums, my portfolio would be 60 percent in traditional securities — split roughly evenly between fixed income and equities, and with 12 percent of that in hedge funds and commodities. The remaining amount would be divided 10 percent into cash, 20 percent into private equity that I would help to select and 10 percent into “guided trading opportunities” — those tips I got from playing golf like Tiger Woods.The difference between the portfolios was in how the money would be invested and diversified. With $50 million, for example, the money would go straight into private equity funds. With $5 million, it would go into funds that pooled their money to make investments in private equity funds.More significant, Barclays was able to provide statistics of how my money would have preformed over the last five years. The portfolio was designed to capture 120 percent of the gains of its various benchmarks and half the losses. (See asset breakdown of 60 percent of the portfolio.) What this meant was if the return on the index was 10 percent, my portfolio would go up 12 percent. If it went down 10 percent, my portfolio would decrease by only 5 percent.That, after last year, would be just fine for me.'"
"'09-07-10,'0','BECKETT, Mass. — During a brief speech before the premiere of “Orbo Novo” on Wednesday night Ella Baff, the executive director of Jacob’s Pillow, recounted how she jumped at the chance to present a new dance by the Belgian choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, performed by Cedar Lake Contemporary Ballet.It’s hard to imagine a festival director, particularly an American one, who wouldn’t share Ms. Baff’s excitement. Mr. Cherkaoui is an exceedingly hot commodity, one whose fluid, sensual works have been almost entirely absent from the United States dance circuit. The fittingly titled “Orbo Novo” (“The New World”) is the first piece he has created for an American company. (Cedar Lake, from New York, will perform it at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan in October.)But expectation and fulfillment can make uneasy bedfellows: “Orbo Novo” is not, unfortunately, a dazzler. Hints that it wouldn’t be, at least for the cynically inclined, could be found in the overly stuffed program notes, which reveal a welter of rather vague, faux-poetic constructs and concepts meant to simmer within the roughly 75-minute work. Many of these ideas stem from the neuroanatomist Jill Bolte Taylor’s book “My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist’s Personal Journey,” documenting her own stroke. The experience eventually led her to believe that “the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right brain hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world.”We hear Dr. Taylor’s absorbing account of her stroke from the 18 dancers, who narrate it in shifting groups, their physical vocabulary alternating between sharp, decisive gestures and flowing, expansive phrases suggesting the doctor’s dislocated hemispheres.It’s a neat, if predictable device. What follows feels far less disciplined, and irritatingly atmospheric, more in keeping with Dr. Taylor’s conclusion about world peace. (Perhaps this belief sounds less kumbaya in the book’s context.) Much of the action centers around several imposing, red latticed set pieces, designed by Alexander Dodge, which the dancers roll around the stage of the Ted Shawn Theater and lock together to form various walls, mazes and enclosures. It is often difficult to get a clear sense of the shifting architectural space, or of the dance that unfurls within it, because of Jim French’s murky lighting, which obscures the dancers and set without revealing any psychological insights of its own (as opposed to a masterly lighting designer like William Forsythe, who uses shadow and darkness to powerful effect).Worse, what there is to see isn’t particularly interesting, despite Mr. Cherkaoui’s voluptuously physical style, with its hints of influences both classical and street. Crisply extended, pointed feet morph into hinging, buckling phrases suggesting b-boy power moves, and the Cedar Lake dancers handle these shifts with ease, even when dressed in some of Isabelle Lhoas’s more fabric-heavy costumes. (These are handsome and intriguingly formal, involving full skirts and long jackets.)'"
"'09-07-10,'0','The furor had political ramifications, too, since one of the figures caught in the spotlight, Andy Coulson, who was editor of The News of the World when many of the privacy breaches uncovered by the Guardian took place, is now an important member of the opposition Conservative Party’s strategy team for Britain’s coming general election.Some people saw politics, too, in the decision not to reopen the police investigation, because the newspapers, with millions of readers, wield enormous power, including the potential to sway general elections.On Wednesday, Mr. Murdoch denied that payments had been made to settle lawsuits. On Thursday, News International, the British subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation, declined to comment on payments to settle lawsuits, saying in a statement that it “is prevented by confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in The Guardian newspaper today.”News International also said that since February 2007, The News of the World has been enforcing a code of conduct for reporters that prohibits using private investigators.The outcry prompted by The Guardian’s disclosures was not directed against the Murdoch papers alone. The Guardian said confidential files compiled by Britain’s official information commissioner showed that one private investigator tracked down by the police had received a total of 13,343 requests, from 305 reporters, for information that typically required hacking into confidential databases, including tax returns, phone records, social security data, bank statements, records of drivers’ licenses and information on police computers.Mr. Yates, named in April as the chief of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard, said the practices reported by The Guardian had been subject to “careful investigation by senior detectives” and by the Crown Prosecution Service, which is responsible for filing criminal charges, during a wide-ranging investigation in 2006. The inquiry was prompted by a case involving a News of the World reporter, Clive Goodman, who received a four-month jail term in 2007 for hacking into more than 600 messages left on cellphones belonging to three members of Britain’s royal family.“No additional evidence has come to light since this case has concluded,” Mr. Yates said. He said that his checks on Thursday indicated that many of the cellphone-hacking cases cited by The Guardian in its chronicle of breaches by The News of the World, including the case of John Prescott, a former deputy prime minister who was embroiled in a scandal involving an affair with an office assistant, never actually resulted in the tapping of the cellphones that were targets of hacking.Britain’s scrappy tabloids are notorious for employing aggressive and often ethically dubious tactics, misrepresenting themselves and using hidden cameras and microphones, among others techniques, in their pursuit of scoops. They routinely pay their sources, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars.According to The Guardian, many of those whose privacy had been breached complained that they had never been informed that hackers had obtained their cellphone messages or other confidential information. Mr. Yates said that Scotland Yard had informed those affected only in cases that included evidence showing conclusively that such breaches had occurred.Although Scotland Yard’s involvement in the matter appeared to have been ended, that has not precluded other possibilities of legal action against the Murdoch newspapers. Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, said Thursday that he would review all the files held by his office to determine whether a criminal case was warranted. A review was also promised by the information commissioner, Mick Gorrill, who confirmed in a statement on Thursday that his office had responded to a court order in 2008 demanding that it provide information in its files on “the buying and selling of personal information” to lawyers representing Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, whom The Guardian named as the recipient of a $1.1-million settlement by News International.Mr. Gorrill said the information showed that 31 journalists working for The News of the World and The Sun “had acquired people’s personal information through blagging,” a term used to describe illicit hacking into confidential databases.Britain’s lawmakers focused attention Thursday on Mr. Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World, who is now the Conservative Party’s communications director. According to the Guardian, Mr. Coulson’s time as editor covered the period when the paper’s reporters were working with private investigators on projects that involved cellphone hacking.Several lawmakers for the governing Labour Party demanded on Thursday that David Cameron, the Conservative leader, dismiss Mr. Coulson from the team he assembled for a general election to be held by next June. But Mr. Cameron, to the surprise of some Conservatives, went quickly before the television cameras to say that Mr. Coulson’s job was safe. “I believe in giving people second chances,” he said.John Whittingham, the chairman of a parliamentary committee that held hearings on the breach of privacy by newspapers in 2007, said the committee would reopen its inquiry. He said he planned to recall Mr. Coulson and ask whether he wished to change the statement he made two years ago, when he said no editor or executive of The News of the World had knownabout the practices for which Mr. Goodman went to jail.'"

"'09-07-11,'0','While it’s safe to assume that Mr. Sanford’s muddled mea culpa may be a career-ender, the Alaska governor’s peroration had all the hallmarks of an audition.The writer is a television critic for United Features Syndicate.David Brooks’s search for dignity is misplaced. Dignity, as a social device, didn’t survive World War II.Yet, while the criteria may be different, there are people who possess that hard-to-define quality called “class,” which is a practical manifestation of kindness, respect for others, proper upbringing and the everyday application of the Golden Rule.In his day, some derided the joke-telling Lincoln as undignified, yet no president had more class.What should concern Mr. Brooks is the vanishing of personal honor, in government, business and family, which frees powerful men to cheat on their wives and their taxes, exploit workers, lie to voters and cheat stockholders and consumers with impunity.My children, who are in their 40s, still use Mr. and Mrs. to address my contemporaries. My son rises from the table when a woman arrives or leaves, removes his hat indoors and never wears a T-shirt in a restaurant at dinnertime.Their father, now gone, would be proud. I hope they pass his lessons on to my grandchildren.As David Brooks makes clear, George Washington’s achievements were indeed remarkable. And his personal manner, which some said was icy cold, was impressive, especially in command.But one “indignity“ stands above all for him and his “Revolutionary Generation.” They were at home buying, selling and keeping other human beings. Washington published notices offering rewards if they escaped.To write of Washington’s spotless character and not address the stain of slavery seems specious at best.And a small historical note: No biographer, including Richard Brookhiser, is certain that the “Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation that young Washington wrote out in his copy book weren’t just his assigned penmanship practice.The writer is the author of “Don’t Know Much About History.”David Brooks presents a too limited depiction of the concept of dignity. Dignity is so much more than proper manners, which have cultural and class-based contours. A person need not be a George Washington, Joe DiMaggio or Martin Luther King Jr. to possess — and convey — dignity.Dignity can be either the superficial conduct or bearing of a person, or the inherent worthiness of a person. Not everyone has the social training or the same Western conception of proper behavior that would lead to the kind of persona held up by Mr. Brooks. Moreover, many people who are “dignified” in their outward manner are quite base in their motivations or covert dealings.I cannot agree with David Brooks’s inclusion of Ronald Reagan in his list of “dignified” celebrities. For example, Mr. Brooks lists capitalism as one cause of the demise of dignity. Has there ever been anyone who was a greater torchbearer for cutthroat capitalism?Mr. Reagan has been widely recognized as the father of the greed generation, which has humbled our economy. And his deliberate attack on welfare recipients is the direct antithesis of “dignity.”I was particularly struck by the last word of David Brooks’s column — “self-mastery” — because it evoked memories of my 70-year-old report cards from elementary and junior high school when that was one of the many things evaluated by one’s teacher. It was then considered important, but along with others like penmanship it seems to have fallen by the wayside.Maybe self-mastery should be reintroduced as of equal importance to the usual subjects on modern-day report cards.'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Immediately, Francoeur should relieve the pressure on David Wright and Gary Sheffield, right-handed hitters who Manager Jerry Manuel indicated would receive more rest in the second half. Looking ahead, Francoeur is signed through 2011, diminishing the possibility that the Mets will add another outfielder to team up with Beltran and Fernando Martinez.“This is a trade that’s not only for now, but for next year and beyond, because of the youth of the player and that what he does fits the ballpark,” Minaya said.When Francoeur, 25, was slugging a swath through the N.L. in his rookie season of 2005, his impatience at the plate was partly overlooked. A native of suburban Atlanta, Francoeur was adored by his hometown fans, and he had a career-high 29 homers in 2006 and batted .293 in 2007.But he struggled so much in 2008, when he hit .239, that last July the Braves demoted him to their Class AA affiliate. When he returned after three days, Francoeur told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he felt “betrayed” by the organization’s treatment.It has not gotten easier for him since. He was benched for three games earlier this month, and is hitting .250 with 5 homers and 35 runs batted in. His .282 on-base percentage is the fifth-lowest among 168 players qualifying for batting titles.The Braves had been shopping Francoeur for a while, and the Mets were willing to surrender Church, who was treated curiously by Manuel for reasons that were never clear. Although Manuel stressed nearly two months ago in Los Angeles that there was no rift between them, his actions — proclaiming Daniel Murphy a superior hitter, suggesting a platoon with Fernando Tatis, cutting Church’s playing time in favor of Sheffield — created a different perception. The Mets also mismanaged their handling of his second concussion last year, which was sustained in, of all places, Atlanta.Calling the trade a “shocker,” Church, who was acquired from Washington before the 2008 season, acknowledged that his medical situation probably could have been dealt with better initially but said he harbored no regrets toward the team or from his one and a half seasons with the Mets.“I don’t think they doubted me,” said Church, who was batting .280 with 2 home runs and 22 runs batted in. “I think they just didn’t know what kind of player I was going to be.”The Mets, to a degree, feel the same way about Francoeur. They hope that he will not strike out as much, that he will walk more and that he will infuse right-handed power into a lineup seeking it in any form. What they know is that Francoeur’s arrival jolts a sagging team. According to Minaya, more deals may be coming.“We’re just not going to say, ‘O.K., this is it,’ ” Minaya said. “As a front office, we’re going to try to do things to shake it up and not be complacent and say, ‘This is it.’ ”'"
"'09-07-11,'0','At first, the public seemed delighted with the strange addition to the concrete plaza under the elevated tracks of the No. 7 line at the 33rd Street-Rawson station in Long Island City, Queens. The huge, translucent plastic globe had a pregnant, mysterious presence, like an alien spacecraft. Inside was a tree, made of old branches and green construction-paper leaves.Construction workers gazed at the installation, “100 Degrees,” as they ate lunch. Commuters stopped to stare. Local business leaders were delighted that an unfancy, utilitarian space at a Queens transportation hub could become a place for public art.Six days into the sculpture’s monthlong installation in June, Chin Chih Yang, one of the artwork’s two creators, stopped to check on it. The other artist, Hector Canonge, had stopped by late the night before and found that all was well. But what Mr. Yang found was the aftermath of violence. He called his partner and said, “You won’t believe what happened.”The globe had been stabbed. Not just slit neatly, but ripped open, leaving a foot-wide gap and several other smaller holes. The globe had deflated, and now it hung limply around the tree that the artists had placed inside to provoke thoughts about global warming.“Whoever was there was so full of rage,” Mr. Canonge said.He was so upset that for several days he could not even talk to Mr. Yang. “Queens is not ready for this work,” he thought at first. But gradually he softened.“Maybe it was just one person,” he conceded. A drunk? A teenager?In the days after the discovery, passers-by mourned the bedraggled sculpture. Wind blew into the hole in the plastic, and the ball, printed with a map of the world, would partly reinflate, as if struggling to breathe. The artists came to think of it as a new, if darker, artwork  “a reflection of people’s basic attitudes toward the planet and their attitudes about art,” Mr. Canonge said.The artists wanted to leave it there until Friday, when it was to have been taken down anyway. But the city’s Department of Transportation, which sponsored the work as part of a fledgling public art program and owns the right-of-way in the center of Queens Boulevard where it stood, told them to remove it  it looked abandoned and might invite more vandalism.So the artists made the best of it. They spent the day of June 17 slowly dismantling the structure  an act of performance art that they felt echoed the day they had put the tree together, inviting passers-by to write their thoughts about the environment on the green paper leaves before they sealed the globe. This time, they passed out fliers inviting people to think about what had happened.“Is this a reflection of our borough? Is Queens ready for this type of work? Should public art be always behind a fence?” the flier asked. “Do we care enough to protect our planet? Do we walk around blinded by our desires to consume and consume? Do we reflect on what we have and how much damage we can cause with our pollution?”Mr. Canonge said he hoped the installation’s untimely end would not discourage the Transportation Department’s foray into art. He recalled that in a long series of meetings to win approval for the installation, an official had asked him and Mr. Yang what would happen if someone stabbed the globe.“Well,” he answered, “it will be cut.” It had seemed to him at the time like a silly, bureaucratic question, and he had reasoned that whatever happened would add to the art’s meaning. After all, the naked, unfenced globe was a symbol of the earth’s fragility and vulnerability.He found that idea harder to embrace in reality. “We talked about it,” he said. “But I never thought it would really happen.”'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Frederic Bourke, a founder of the handbag maker Dooney & Bourke, was convicted Friday of conspiring to pay bribes to government leaders in Azerbaijan in a 1998 oil deal.The federal jury in Manhattan returned its verdict after a monthlong trial.Jurors found that Mr. Bourke conspired with a Czech expatriate, Viktor Kozeny, to pay bribes to the former president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, and other leaders.The verdict is a victory for federal prosecutors as they step up enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars payments to foreign officials. Few criminal cases under the law ever go to trial.“By bringing and winning the case, the government has expanded the F.C.P.A.’s coverage,” said Richard L. Cassin, the founder of the firm Cassin Law in Singapore, who also writes the FCPA blog. “This was probably the hardest F.C.P.A. prosecution the government has ever brought. Bourke didn’t pay the bribes himself, he only knew about them.”Mr. Bourke, 63, was on trial for investing with Mr. Kozeny knowing that he gave Azeri leaders millions of dollars in cash and a secret two-thirds interest in a venture formed to buy the state oil company, known as Socar.A lawyer for Mr. Bourke, Harold Haddon, declined to comment after the verdict.Prosecutors said that Mr. Bourke, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., faces 10 years in prison, though Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court indicated that she would not impose a sentence that long .Mr. Bourke denied knowing about the bribes. His lawyers argued that Mr. Kozeny stole more than $180 million from Mr. Bourke and other investors, including the hedge fund Omega Advisors and the insurance giant American International Group.

She carded a three-under 68 and was alone in second at two-under 140.Creamer is coming off a thumb injury that forced her to miss the last two tournaments, but there was no sign the sore thumb was affecting her play here.She started the day one over and moved under par after back-to-back birdies at the 9th and 10th.The Futures Tour player Jean Reynolds was third after a 72 for a one-under 141.

"'09-07-11,'0','G.M. has issued statements telling investors not to buy the shares because they are destined to become worthless.The shares represent ownership in the old G.M., now known as the Motors Liquidation Company, which will be wound down in bankruptcy court. It contains unwanted factories and equipment, and billions of dollars in unsecured claims related to asbestos litigation and product liability lawsuits. Proceeds from the wind-down will go toward repaying secured and unsecured creditors.The new G.M., formally the General Motors Company, is privately held and will not seek a public listing until next year at the earliest.In a letter sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, lawyers for Motors Liquidation said they had gone to great lengths to discourage trading in the stock. The company said it “strongly believes that stockholders will receive no value in the bankruptcy liquidation process” and has cited the bankruptcy court’s decision, which calls the company “hopelessly insolvent,” several times in press releases and on its Web site.For decades, G.M. traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker GM. But after the company filed for bankruptcy on June 1, its listing moved to the over-the-counter bulletin board, becoming GMGMQ.Finra decided to halt trading in the stock after concluding that investors thought they were buying shares of the new G.M. Over recent weeks, the regulator received numerous calls from brokerage firms and investors asking which company the securities represented, officials said.Trading in GMGMQ shares can be halted for the next 10 trading days, and Finra officials are expected to release an official notice to investors next week explaining exactly what the securities represent. The regulator also plans to change the stock’s ticker symbol before allowing investors to resume trading, officials said.Between June 3 and June 24, an average of 60.6 million GMGMQ shares traded every day on the over-the-counter market. Regulators say some investors may have been encouraged to buy the shares after receiving e-mail messages from several publications that provide tips on penny stocks.For example, a company called Penny Stock Chaser, which runs a Web site that gives stock tips, issued a news release on Friday saying it expected GMGMQ shares to rise after surging 39 percent “as the company emerged from the remains of bankrupt General Motors Corporation by taking over the best assets of the biggest U.S. automaker.” The release noted that the “new GM” currently has no publicly traded securities and shares of the “old GM” will not become securities of the General Motors Company. The company did not respond to phone calls or e-mail messages seeking comment.It is not uncommon for public companies that have filed for Chapter 11 protection to maintain stock listings, and a small market remains for shares in Lehman Brothers, Delphi and others. For some companies, those shares could regain real value some day. Some companies are able to retain enough value in their reorganizations that equity holders, who are last in line for repayment under the federal bankruptcy code, can gain some recovery when they emerge from bankruptcy.That is not expected to be the case with Motors Liquidation. As part of G.M.’s reorganization, bondholders — the next rung up from shareholders — were asked to take a large cut to their investments’ value, all but ensuring stockholders would receive nothing.“Management continues to remind investors of its strong belief that there will be no value for the common stockholders of Motors Liquidation Company in the bankruptcy liquidation process, even under the most optimistic of scenarios,” Motors Liquidation said Friday.'"

"'09-07-11,'0','Bivens has been commissioner since 2005, when the tour had 35 events. Her contract expires in 2010, and she is said to make about $500,000 a year. A report by Sports Business Daily suggested she would agree to a buyout.She is not attending this week’s Open, and she has so far declined to comment.“As we’ve said throughout the week, we want all of those interested in women’s professional golf to focus on the play here at the U.S. Women’s Open,” David Higdon, the L.P.G.A.’s chief communications officer, said in a statement. “Out of respect to the U.S.G.A. and the amazing work that they’ve done and continue to do in producing and hosting this great event, we will not respond to media reports on internal matters related to the L.P.G.A. business.”The person with knowledge of the matter said several names of possible successors had been floated, including Donna Orender, the W.N.B.A. commissioner; the retired Hall of Fame golfers Nancy Lopez and Judy Rankin; and Cindy Davis, the president of Nike Golf.Bivens has been criticized for her unwillingness to negotiate with sponsors on purse sizes and the cost of tournaments. She asked sponsors to contribute more to defray the cost of the tour’s electronic scoring system, which can require up to $100,000 to maintain at an event.Unable to meet Bivens’s demands, some sponsors have backed away from the tour.“I felt like we’ve lost events over the last four years because people didn’t work with the tournaments,” said Caryn Wilson, a former tour member playing at the Open. “And I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having a tournament having a $1 million purse instead of $1.5 million. They lost some of the best tournaments.”Bivens also caused a stir when she introduced a proposal that foreign-born players be proficient in English or face possible suspension. The policy, which immediately drew sharp criticism from players, civil rights groups and lawmakers, was soon dropped.Some of the tour’s leading players decided to take action last week when they met during the Jamie Farr Owens Corning Classic in Toledo, Ohio. Their meeting came after it was announced that the Kapalua Classic in Hawaii would not be held this year because it could not find a title sponsor.Five of the seven players who sit on the 13-member board were in favor of removing Bivens, according to a report on Tuesday by Golf World magazine. Seven votes are needed to remove Bivens, who is also a board member.Earlier in the week, Ochoa said players simply wanted to be more involved in the tour’s direction. Referring to the tour’s board, she said: “There’s not much we can do. I believe they will do the best for us. And hopefully things will start, you know, moving in a good direction, because we are worried that we’re losing tournaments and we want to get back on a good track.”'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Brokers and bankers say that in past decades, the credit markets would almost certainly have accommodated many of these people.“The credit pendulum is stuck at ‘stupid,’” said Lou S. Barnes, an owner of West Financial Services, a mortgage bank. “I am turning down loans every day that my grandfather in his Ponca City, Okla., in 1935 would have been happy to make. And he was tough.”The denials are occurring for a wide array of reasons: the buyers’ incomes are adequate but irregular; they are self-employed and take many deductions, reducing the taxable income on which lenders focus; their are below the cut-off point, which has been raised drastically; their down payments are less than 20 percent.Housing usually leads the country into a recession, which certainly happened this time, and also leads it out — which will not happen in 2010, the real estate industry contends, without stronger efforts to thaw the market.No one is advocating a return to the lax lending standards of 2006, when buyers with no income or documentation could get loans. But many people say they believe lenders and the government, in correcting the excesses of that era, have gone too far in the other direction., the government-controlled company that buys mortgages, is so dominant in the lending market that its rules set the standard. It recently toughened its policies, saying it would count only 70 percent of the value of and when calculating a buyer’s assets. Previously, that figure was 100 percent.A Fannie spokesman, Brian Faith, said tighter regulations screened out those unprepared to be owners.“One of the important lessons learned in the past few years is that it is not enough to help a borrower own a home,” Mr. Faith said. “We must also help ensure that they will be able to stay in the home over the long term.”Mortgage brokers say those who are being rejected for loans are often entrepreneurs who are used to taking risks. “They are chomping at the bit to get into this market, but are forced to the sidelines,” said Stuart Fraass of Guaranteed Rate Inc. “If you’re self-employed, you have virtually no chance of getting a mortgage now.”Mr. Fraass was unable to help Raghbir Singh, a real estate investor who owns a gas station in Dover, N.H. Mr. Singh tried to buy a $301,000 house for himself and his family with 10 percent down and excellent credit, but was rejected. “It was unfair,” Mr. Singh said. “I’m a good risk, but I’m forced to rent.”Lately, the continued deep-freeze in the traditional market has to some extent been veiled by the brisk sale of foreclosed houses. In April, distressed transactions made up nearly half of all existing house and condo sales, the said. In May, they were a third.That means traditional or so-called move-up sales, where the parties at both ends of the transaction are individuals instead of banks, are limping along at an annual rate of about three million, the lowest figure in a quarter-century.“Without further action, we’re not going to stabilize,” said Steve Murray of Real Trends, a research group. “The real estate recovery will take 10 or 12 years.”There are plenty of plans to unlock the market.Members of Congress are proposing to extend and enlarge an $8,000 credit for first-time buyers, which is due to expire in December. One bill would extend the credit to all buyers through next June. Another would extend it to all buyers through 2010. A third bill would expand it to $15,000 for all buyers.Some economists, noting that tax incentives helped stoke the boom, say these proposals should be shunned. “When do you decide enough is enough?” said the housing consultant Ivy Zelman. “I don’t want to feed the drug addict with more drugs.”The continuing deterioration in traditional real estate can be seen in the market in , where the economy, as measured by the unemployment rate, is better than in the nation as a whole.Yet sales of single-family homes in Massachusetts in May were tied for the lowest level for the month in the 22 years since reliable statistics were first assembled, according to Timothy M. Warren Jr. of the Warren Group, which collects real estate data. Condo sales were only marginally better.As bleak as those numbers may be, they do not fully convey the troubles here in the upper half of the market. In towns where the median home price is above $500,000, sales during the first five months of the year were 21 percent below the level of 1990, when the state’s population was smaller and the local economy equally in crisis.Real estate agents, always optimistic, had looked for some recovery this spring, the strongest season in the Northeast. Mr. Warren said he was more pessimistic, but was disappointed anyway. “There’s a lot of pent-up demand, but it takes nerves of steel to buy,” he said.Dr. Komarovskaya, the rejected dentist, tries to be philosophical about missing out on that two-bedroom condo she wanted in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. She understands that after years of mortgage abuse and fraud, the rules had to be tightened.But what might be an inevitable process in the larger economy is a burden on her personal finances. “Renting is a waste of money,” she said. Having no choice, she has dropped plans to buy and signed a new apartment lease.'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Mr. Lee said that his opposition to Proposition 8 had “created tension in my life I had never experienced with black clergy.”“But it was clear to me,” he added, “that any time you deny one group of people the same right that other groups have, that is a clear violation of civil rights and I have to speak up on that.”In April, Mr. Lee attended a board meeting of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in Kansas City, Mo., and found himself once again in the minority position among his colleagues on the issue of same-sex marriage, but he was told, he said, by the group’s interim president, Byron Clay, that the organization publicly had a neutral position on the issue.So a month later, Mr. Lee said, he was surprised to receive a call from the National Board of Directors summoning him immediately to Atlanta to explain why he had taken a position on same-sex marriage without the authority of the national board.Explaining that he was unable to come to Atlanta on such short notice, Mr. Lee then received two letters from the organization’s lawyer, Dexter M. Wimbish, threatening him with suspension or removal as president of the Los Angeles chapter if he did not come soon to explain himself.Mr. Wimbish did not return calls to his office, nor did the Rev. Raleigh Trammell, chairman of the organization’s national board. A woman who identified herself as Renee Richardson left a voice-mail message for a reporter, saying the organization did not “discuss internal matters.” She did not return follow-up calls.The issue attracted the attention of the president of the Los Angeles City Council, Eric Garcetti, who wrote to the board in support of Mr. Lee.Because chapters of the leadership conference operate autonomously and presidents are picked by local boards, it is not clear that the national organization has the authority to remove Mr. Lee from his post, which he has held for two years.“It’s been our position that the local board hired him,” said Reginald Byron Jones-Sawyer, chairman of the local board and secretary of the California Democratic Party. “And, in fact, we are also the ones that approved his stance on the position of marriage equality. We have asked the national board if we have violated any procedures, and we have not gotten an answer.”Mr. Lee, the former pastor of In His Steps, an African-American Wesleyan church in Los Angeles that he described as “very conservative,” said he saw failures both in the leadership of the conference (“Dr. King would be turning over in his grave right now,” he said) and the largely white anti-Proposition 8 movement that did not more actively seek the support of church-going African-Americans.“The black church played a significant role in Proposition 8 passing,” Mr. Lee said. “The failure of the campaign was to presume that African-Americans would see this as a civil rights issue.”'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Oil prices slipped below $60 a barrel on Friday as traders focused on recent signs of economic weakness, even as a report by the International Energy Agency forecast that global oil demand would rebound.Traders appeared, however, to be focusing on speculation that the global recession and rising unemployment would keep constraining demand, while stocks in the United States have been plentiful.“Crude oil prices have dropped along with sentiment concerning the speed of the global economic recovery,” Deutsche Bank said in a commodities market report released Friday.Prices fell 52 cents Friday to settle at $59.89 a barrel in New York trading. In its monthly Oil Market Report, the agency said that global demand would increase in 2010 by 1.7 percent on a year earlier, or by 1.4 million barrels a day, to 85.2 million barrels.The outlook for global demand in 2009 remained unchanged, it said, decreasing 2.9 percent, or 2.5 million barrels a day.'"
"'09-07-11,'0','The case also seems likely to turn into a larger dispute between China and Australia about the nature of the Chinese state secrets law and whether it should apply to foreigners doing business with China’s state-owned companies.Although China has accused Rio’s executive, Mr. Hu, of spying on the country, there is growing evidence the case is centered on his role as lead negotiator for Rio Tinto in its dealing with Chinese steel companies.This week, Rio Tinto and Australian officials said they were shocked by the accusations. In a statement issued Friday, Rio Tinto said, “We are not aware of any evidence that would support these allegations.”Rio Tinto officials say that they have not been informed by China of any charges and that they have had no contact with their four employees since they were detained.The Australian government on Friday questioned whether China’s state security law was being invoked too broadly to cover business dealings.At a news conference, the Australian foreign affairs minister, Stephen Smith, said, “Frankly, it’s difficult for a nation like Australia to see a relationship between espionage or national security and what appear to be suggestions about commercial or economic negotiations.”The investigation comes at a particularly thorny time, because China is still in tense negotiations with some of the world’s biggest iron ore producers, including Rio Tinto, over the price of iron ore imports. Those negotiations could determine the value of tens of billions of dollars’ worth of iron ore imports into China this year and next year and also could affect global prices.Iron ore prices are negotiated on a yearly basis, to give the market participants a degree of certainty in a business that demands major outlays to underwrite the extraction of the ore. In a down economy, some of the major steel-producing nations, like Japan and South Korea, have already accepted a price 33 percent lower than last year’s.China, which imports about half the world’s supply of iron ore each year, has dug in its heels and is holding out for an even larger reduction, of as much as 45 percent. For Australia, which sends about 80 percent of its ore to China every year, that price differential is of paramount importance.Allegations of spying are also threatening to create more friction between China and Australia since Rio Tinto’s decision last month to scrap a planned $19.5 billion deal with Chinalco, a Chinese state-owned company. Some Australians see the arrests of the Rio Tinto employees as retaliation.Relations had begun to fray earlier in the year because many Australians had grown worried about the prospect of China taking a big stake in Rio Tinto and other Australian companies and gaining control over some of the country’s most valuable resources.Chinese officials have also grown angry because of what they see as protectionist or anti-Chinese sentiment behind efforts to block Chinese companies from securing long-term supplies of raw materials.“The message this sends to any Australian or international business executive is that you can lose more than your business deal if you cross these people,” Michael Danby, a federal minister with the Australian Labor Party, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Friday.'"
"'09-07-11,'0','Stocks fell slightly on Friday and the broad market closed lower for the fourth consecutive week as negative consumer confidence data and mixed earnings reports continued to thwart hopes that the spring rally — and broader recovery — would be sustained. Now the question is whether the economy is stabilizing or losing ground again.The Dow Jones industrial average shed 36.65 points, or 0.45 percent, to close at 8,146.52. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.55 points, or 0.40 percent, to 879.13. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,756.03 after posting a gain of 3.48 points, or 0.20 percent.A 2.66 percent fall in shares of the energy giant Chevron weighed down the Dow at the end of a week when oil markets foundered. The company warned investors on Friday to expect much weaker second-quarter results compared with 2008 because of the slide of the dollar. Foreign currency losses totaled more than $400 million in April and May.Slack energy demand worldwide exacerbated the situation for American oil producers. Crude oil settled at $59.89 a barrel Friday, down 52 cents.Separately, a Reuters/University of Michigan survey that showed consumer sentiment at its lowest since March spoiled the possibility that a jolt of spending could restart the recovery. Consumers said they would hold off on buying cars and appliances, according to the survey.“Now you need a rapid improvement in the job market to give consumer spending a chance,” said Aaron Smith, a senior economist at Moodys.com. But Mr. Smith was pessimistic. He cautioned that consumers could remain tight-fisted. “If spending breaks lower you’re going to unwind a lot of the loosening in the financial market,” he said.'"
"'09-07-11,'0','HONG KONG — The controversial trial of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi resumed Friday in Myanmar, but there was no indication when a verdict might come.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, went on trial May 18, charged with violating the terms of her house arrest. She faces a prison term of up to five years. At the end of Friday’s session, the court set July 24 for final arguments but a verdict is not expected that day, The Associated Press reported.The case has drawn international outrage, and many analysts believe the ruling military junta is intent on keeping Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s most prominent pro-democracy activist, under detention until after national elections scheduled for next year.The trial was delayed last week during a visit to Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, by the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Mr. Ban met twice with Senior Gen. Than Shwe, the leader of the junta, but the general denied Mr. Ban’s requests to see her.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been under house arrest for almost 14 of the last 20 years, and Mr. Ban has called her further detention “unacceptable.”State prosecutors say Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi broke the law by allowing an American man to spend the night in her house after he swam across a lake in central Yangon, sneaked past security officers and entered her waterfront home. Her lawyers have said she merely took pity on the man, John William Yettaw, after he complained of exhaustion and pleaded with her to stay.Mr. Yettaw, 53, of Falcon, Mo., also is on trial, for trespassing, and two women who share Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi’s house have been charged with helping to harbor him.'"

"'09-07-12,'0','WASHINGTON — Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. is considering assigning a prosecutor to investigate whether government personnel tortured terrorism suspects after the attacks of Sept. 11, a Justice Department official said Saturday.The official, who spoke anonymously because the decision had not yet been made, confirmed accounts by Newsweek and The Washington Post, posted on their Web sites on Saturday, adding that while President Obama had said he wanted to look ahead rather than back at past interrogation practices in the campaign against terrorism, he had also said that his administration would adhere strictly to legal standards in addressing the questions that have continued to arise about how prisoners were treated by the Central Intelligence Agency.“The Department of Justice will follow the facts and the law with respect to any matter,” the department said in a statement released Saturday. “We have made no decisions on investigations or prosecutions, including whether to appoint a prosecutor to conduct further inquiry. As the attorney general has made clear, it would be unfair to prosecute any official who acted in good faith based on legal guidance from the Justice Department.”The department is expected to complete an ethics report about Bush administration officials who drafted memos, since discredited, granting leeway for harsh interrogation standards. Mr. Holder’s decision on a possible criminal inquiry could come around the same time.The Justice Department official who confirmed the likelihood of an inquiry said it was not likely to focus on those legal opinions, the lawyers who wrote them or anyone who acted within the boundaries they set, even though the ground rules for interrogations have shifted.If an inquiry moves forward, it will attempt mainly to determine whether any interrogators acted outside the rules that were in place, and if so, whether they should be prosecuted. Some such excesses are thought to have occurred.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','It takes skill to win the biggest open tournament in the United States, but to win it twice might require a bit of luck, too.Last weekend, Evgeniy Najer of Russia won the World Open in Philadelphia. The tournament attracts top players from all over the world because it has the biggest prize fund of any open competition.Najer, ranked No. 67 in the world, won last year’s open in a playoff. This year, Najer won by default after tying for first with Hikaru Nakamura, the reigning United States champion. There was no playoff because Nakamura had to leave early for an elite invitational in Spain.If there had been a playoff, it would have been an Armageddon game, which relies on speed. And Nakamura is one of the best speed chess players in the world.Najer had lost to Nakamura in Round 7, leaving him a point behind. But Nakamura, by leaving early, was forced to take byes in the last two rounds, which counted as a half-point each. That allowed Najer, who won his last two games, to catch up.Those final two victories came over the grandmasters Alexander Shabalov and Jaan Ehlvest.Najer was Black against Ehlvest, but be took the initiative after Ehlvest played too passively. Ehlvest adopted the King’s Indian Attack in the Reti Opening. White’s usual plan is to push his pawn to e5 and bring his queen knight around to the kingside, via f1 and h2 and g4.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','Thompson, who qualified for her first United States Open at age 12, had every intention of competing for a championship. She is a veteran now, playing in her third Open.“I wasn’t just looking to make the cut,” Thompson said Friday. “I know I can contend if my game’s on out there.”Thompson had nine bogeys and two birdies in her third round.Morgan Pressel, who shot a two-under-par 69 and is tied for 11th, said: “I mean, there’s certainly something to be said for aggressiveness and for the way you played as a youngster, but there’s a reason people with experience usually prevail in these kinds of events.”Pressel would know. Before Thompson broke her record, Pressel was the youngest person to qualify for a United States Open.At 5-foot-9, Thompson looks and plays older than 14. This is the second time this year she has made the cut in a major. At the Kraft Nabisco Championship, Thompson finished two-over par, tied for 21st.Although her round Saturday ended in disappointment, she did hit shots that wowed the gallery and showcased her potential.On the 453-yard, par-4 seventh hole, Thompson pulled out an iron for her long approach to the green. Into a stiff wind, she put the ball within 10 feet of the hole on the front of the green.“That’s just disgusting,” one spectator said.Shots like that are why Thompson has been compared to Michelle Wie, the teenage phenomenon who has struggled with injuries. Wie did not qualify for this year’s United States Open.“I know she was really good when she was young, too,” Thompson said. “So, I mean, I’m just going to try and keep on going the way I’m going, just take Junior Golf, and whenever I can go pro, I mean I don’t really know yet.”Thompson exhibits a lot of emotion on the course. After a bad shot, she will walk with her head down and sometimes mumble to herself. But if she wanted to stay mad at herself Saturday, the crowd would not let her.“It just helps you out, they’re like, ‘Keep it going, you’re doing great,’ ” Thompson said.It appeared there was no consoling Paula Creamer on the 10th hole. Creamer was two-under for the tournament after 36 holes, one shot back of Kerr. She was hoping this year would erase 2008, when Creamer entered the final round of the Open in second place, but fired a 78.However, on No. 10, a short par-4, Creamer pulled out her driver, hoping to get it on the green to try for an eagle. She landed in a bunker that guarded the green and pitched over and around it before finally making a triple bogey.When the hole was over, it appeared that Creamer was in tears.“No, I was standing there and, you know, looking at the hole and thinking, ‘How did you just hit it seven times on this hole?’ ” she said. She finished with a 79 and is tied for 17th.Kerr, the 2007 Open winner, did not take such risks. She laid up and scored par. While others around her crumbled, Kerr remained steady. She was the only player under par after three days.“I’m sure there’s going to be some nerves in the morning,” Kerr said. “But I’ve been there. I know I can handle it.”'"

"'09-07-12,'0','Investors trying to fathom the enormous run-up in emerging markets should have their minds on something else, as one portfolio manager sees it.“The question to ask is: Why did they fall last year?” said Giles Conway-Gordon, co-chief investment officer at Cogo Wolf Asset Management in San Francisco. “That was the exceptional event, and now we’re seeing a return to normality in emerging markets.”Many developing economies are enduring the global recession and financial crisis in relatively solid shape, and their stock markets suffered more than others through little fault of their own, international fund managers say. One factor was a sudden scarcity of credit that forced many Western investors to sell assets to raise cash.“You had to sell what you owned, and that’s what everybody owned,” said John Maxwell, manager of the Ivy International Core fund.One reason markets like those of India, China and Brazil were so popular until the bear market is that sound government policy had become commonplace in the developing world. Officials “have learned from past mistakes,” said Kirk Brown, who runs foreign portfolios in the American Beacon fund family. “Many of these markets are running surpluses, and inflation is under control.”By contrast, fiscal and trade surpluses and other signs of sound economic management are hard to spot in many mature countries.“We think there are serious question marks” about the long-term prospects of developed economies, Mr. Conway-Gordon said. “Growth is going to be uninspiring. Japan is a country in decline. Europe has not faced facts about its financial system and is overbureaucratized.”Mr. Maxwell cited some uninspiring details of his own. Industrial production in Germany and Japan is running at 60 percent to 80 percent of prerecession levels, declines “that would have been unfathomable in the past” and are well below previous troughs, he said.Stock markets in mature countries have risen in the hope that their economies will stabilize, but he contends that the weakness is so severe that stability won’t do.“Things can’t stay that way without skyrocketing unemployment,” Mr. Maxwell said. “Stabilization isn’t good enough at this level. They have to see improvement, not a plateauing.”The ability to conduct business unfettered by the lingering effects of financial and economic imbalances should help emerging markets recover faster and keep a competitive edge, said Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at Research Affiliates, an asset management firm in Pasadena, Calif.“Economies that won’t have to deleverage will consume more and employ more capital,” Mr. Hsu said. “That’s a definite positive. Those economies are going to be in positions of relative strength, and you’re going to see investment flow reacting to that.”But doesn’t the rally mean that the reaction has already occurred? It’s possible that the choices open to international investors have been greatly curtailed — and that the low-hanging fruit, as well as a lot of the produce much higher up, has already been picked in emerging markets.“When you see a great run like you’ve seen in emerging markets, you’ve got to ask whether you want to keep riding the ride,” Mr. Maxwell said. “You’ve got to be sure you’re going to come out of this in good shape” before buying at these levels, he advised. “I’m not 100 percent ready to bet on that at this point.”The growth prospects he perceives for mature international economies, as well as the less dramatic yet sizeable rally they have already experienced, mean that they may not offer much of an alternative.One approach that Mr. Maxwell favors is buying companies in mature countries that do a lot of business in developing ones, like Nestlé, the Swiss food producer; Total, the French oil company; and Nissin Kogyo, a Japanese company that makes car parts.Others find emerging-market stocks tempting, if pricey. Mr. Brown at American Beacon acknowledges that valuations appear somewhat stretched, but says he expects higher long-term earnings growth to remedy the condition. His largest holdings lately have included PetroChina, HDFC Bank in India and Itaú Unibanco Holding, a Brazilian bank.HARRY HARTFORD, president of Causeway Capital Management in Los Angeles, likewise foresees stronger earnings growth, although he would not be surprised by a pullback in the short run.“I would argue that if you have anything other than a three-month investment horizon, you need to have emerging markets in your portfolio,” Mr. Hartford said. “It’s naïve to think that a number of these markets will not continue to do well and that companies don’t have the wherewithal to continue growing.”Mr. Hsu expressed similar sentiments. “After they’ve gone up this far, we’re more than likely to see a larger correction,” he said. “But it’s hard not to argue that over a longer horizon they offer more opportunity and fewer problems to deal with.”'"
"'09-07-12,'0','WASHINGTON — For a few hours each day for more than a week, Judge Sonia Sotomayor has sat in a small conference room in a building adjacent to the White House, fielding questions from lawyers helping her prepare for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on her nomination to the Supreme Court.In one respect, it has been a painful experience for both her and those who have had to watch. Judge Sotomayor recently broke her ankle and has had to sit with her right leg propped up on a chair to deal with significant discomfort, said a senior Obama administration official who has taken part in the sessions. She has been taking over-the-counter medicines occasionally for the pain, White House officials said.Judge Sotomayor will require the same kind of leg support during the hearings, officials said, though her injured leg will be largely concealed under the baize-covered table.The process of helping acclimate a nominee to the blast of lights, public attention and senatorial inquisition has been an important part of the confirmation process since 1987, when Judge Robert H. Bork declined to submit to practice sessions. Judge Bork contended that as a federal appeals court judge and former longtime law professor, he had no need to rehearse, but he did not perform optimally at the hearing and his refusal to practice was viewed as misguided.In Judge Sotomayor’s case, she and her helpers have been “going over questions she would expect to be asked,” based on her record and what she has discussed in visits with senators over the last few weeks, one official said.She has met with 89 of the 100 senators, including all 19 members of the Judiciary Committee. There were scheduling difficulties with 10 senators, officials said, and the remaining senator, James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said he was so certain of his opposition to her nomination that he did not want to waste her time.The visits have been more extensive than in the past, officials said, and they provide a reliable guide to the questions committee members will ask when the hearing begins on Monday. Judge Sotomayor also has been going over the cases in which she has been involved in her 17 years on the bench.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','In addition, for covert action programs, a particularly secret category in which the role of the United States is hidden, the law says that briefings can be limited to the so-called Gang of Eight, consisting of the Republican and Democratic leaders of both houses of Congress and of their intelligence committees.The disclosure about Mr. Cheney’s role in the unidentified C.I.A. program comes a day after an inspector general’s report underscored the central role of the former vice president’s office in restricting to a small circle of officials knowledge of the ’s program of eavesdropping without warrants, a degree of secrecy that the report concluded had hurt the effectiveness of the counterterrorism surveillance effort.An intelligence agency spokesman, Paul Gimigliano, declined on Saturday to comment on the report of Mr. Cheney’s role.“It’s not agency practice to discuss what may or may not have been said in a classified briefing,” Mr. Gimigliano said. “When a C.I.A. unit brought this matter to Director Panetta’s attention, it was with the recommendation that it be shared appropriately with Congress. That was also his view, and he took swift, decisive action to put it into effect.”Members of Congress have differed on the significance of the program, whose details remained secret and which even some Democrats have said was properly classified. Most of those interviewed, however, have said that it was an important activity that should have been disclosed to the intelligence committees.Intelligence and Congressional officials have said the unidentified program did not involve the and did not involve domestic intelligence activities. They have said the program was started by the counterterrorism center at the C.I.A. shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but never became fully operational, involving planning and some training that took place off and on from 2001 until this year.In the tense months after Sept. 11, when Bush administration officials believed new Qaeda attacks could occur at any moment, intelligence officials brainstormed about radical countermeasures. It was in that atmosphere that the unidentified program was devised and deliberately concealed from Congress, officials said.Representative Peter Hoekstra of , the top Republican on the House intelligence committee, said last week that he believed Congress would have approved of the program only in the angry and panicky days after 9/11, on 9/12, he said, but not later, after fears and tempers had begun to cool.One intelligence official, who would speak about the classified program only on condition of anonymity, said there was no resistance inside the C.I.A. to Mr. Panetta’s decision to end the program last month.“Because this program never went fully operational and hadn’t been briefed as Panetta thought it should have been, his decision to kill it was neither difficult nor controversial,” the official said. “That’s worth remembering amid all the drama.”Bill Harlow, a spokesman for , who was the C.I.A. director when the unidentified program began, declined to comment on Saturday, noting that the program remained classified.In the eight years of his vice presidency, Mr. Cheney was the Bush administration’s most vehement defender of the secrecy of government activities, particularly in the intelligence arena. He went to the to keep secret the advisers to his task force on energy, and won.A report released on Friday by the inspectors general of five agencies about the National Security Agency’s domestic surveillance program makes clear that Mr. Cheney’s legal adviser, , had to approve personally every government official who was told about the program. The report said “the exceptionally compartmented nature of the program” frustrated agents who were assigned to follow up on tips it had turned up.Mr. Addington could not be reached for comment on Saturday.Questions over the adequacy and the truthfulness of the C.I.A.’s briefings for Congress date to the creation of the intelligence oversight committees in the 1970s after disclosures of agency assassination and mind-control programs and other abuses. But complaints increased in the Bush years, when the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies took the major role in pursuing .The use of harsh , including waterboarding, for instance, was first described to a handful of lawmakers for the first time in September 2002. Ms. Pelosi and the C.I.A. have disagreed about what she was told, but in any case, the briefing occurred only after a terrorism suspect, , had been waterboarded 83 times.Democrats in Congress, who contend that the Bush administration improperly limited Congressional briefings on intelligence, are seeking to change the National Security Act to permit the full intelligence committees to be briefed on more matters. , however, has threatened to veto the intelligence authorization bill if the changes go too far, and the proposal is now being negotiated by the White House and the intelligence committees.Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat of on the House committee, wrote on Friday to the chairman, Representative Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat of , to demand an investigation of the unidentified program and why Congress was not told of it. Aides said Mr. Reyes was reviewing the matter.“There’s been a history of difficulty in getting the C.I.A. to tell us what they should,” said Representative Adam Smith, a Democrat of Washington. “We will absolutely be held accountable for anything the agency does.”Mr. Hoekstra, the intelligence committee’s ranking Republican, said he would not judge the agency harshly in the case of the unidentified program, because it was not fully operational. But he said that in general, the agency had not been as forthcoming as the law required.“We have to pull the information out of them to get what we need,” Mr. Hoekstra said.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','In other cases, however, traits that help individuals are harmful to larger groups. For instance, a mutation for larger antlers served the reproductive interests of an individual male elk, because it helped him prevail in battles with other males for access to mates. But as this mutation spread, it started an arms race that made life more hazardous for male elk over all. The antlers of male elk can now span five feet or more. And despite their utility in battle, they often become a fatal handicap when predators pursue males into dense woods.In Darwin’s framework, then, Adam Smith’s invisible hand survives as an interesting special case. Competition, to be sure, sometimes guides individual behavior in ways that benefit society as a whole. But not always.Individual and group interests are almost always in conflict when rewards to individuals depend on relative performance, as in the antlers arms race. In the marketplace, such reward structures are the rule, not the exception. The income of investment managers, for example, depends mainly on the amount of money they manage, which in turn depends largely on their funds’ relative performance.Relative performance affects many other rewards in contemporary life. For example, it determines which parents can send their children to good public schools. Because such schools are typically in more expensive neighborhoods, parents who want to send their children to them must outbid others for houses in those neighborhoods.In cases like these, relative incentive structures undermine the invisible hand. To make their funds more attractive to investors, money managers create complex securities that impose serious, if often well-camouflaged, risks on society. But when all managers take such steps, they are mutually offsetting. No one benefits, yet the risk of financial crises rises sharply.Similarly, to earn extra money for houses in better school districts, parents often work longer hours or accept jobs entailing greater safety risks. Such steps may seem compelling to an individual family, but when all families take them, they serve only to bid up housing prices. As before, only half of all children will attend top-half schools.It’s the same with athletes who take anabolic steroids. Individual athletes who take them may perform better in absolute terms. But these drugs also entail serious long-term health risks, and when everyone takes them, no one gains an edge.If male elk could vote to scale back their antlers by half, they would have compelling reasons for doing so, because only relative antler size matters. Of course, they have no means to enact such regulations.But humans can and do. By calling our attention to the conflict between individual and group interest, Darwin has identified the rationale for much of the regulation we observe in modern societies — including steroid bans in sports, safety and hours regulation in the workplace, product safety standards and the myriad restrictions typically imposed on the financial sector.Ideas have consequences. The uncritical celebration of the invisible hand by Smith’s disciples has undermined regulatory efforts to reconcile conflicts between individual and collective interests in recent decades, causing considerable harm to us all. If, as Darwin suggested, many important aspects of life are graded on the curve, his insights may help us avoid stumbling down that grim path once again.The competitive forces that mold business behavior are like the forces of natural selection that molded elk. In each case, we see instances of socially benign conduct. But in neither can we safely presume that individual and social interests coincide.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','In 2005, Redboxes were in 600 locations and rented 24,000 movies a week. Today, they’re in more than 15,600 locations, renting 7.5 million movies weekly, Redbox says, not far below the 10 million-plus weekly rentals claimed by Netflix.Netflix offers more than 100,000 unique titles. Each Redbox kiosk has slots for 600 discs, but the average number of titles is just 200, accommodating multiple copies of the most popular.Mitch Lowe, the president of Redbox, said his company’s service drew predominantly from lower-income households with large families — the opposite of the profile of the typical customer at Netflix, where Mr. Lowe worked for six years before joining Redbox in 2003. He said the typical Redbox customer “doesn’t want to wade through titles they won’t be interested in.”At Redbox, “Paul Blart: Mall Cop,” featuring physical comedy and no end of fat jokes, is its record-holding rental title. “Probably not what you’d find at Netflix,” Mr. Lowe said. (He was right: “Crash” is Netflix’s top rental; “Paul Blart” doesn’t appear anywhere in its Top 100.)Tom Adams, president of Adams Media Research, a consulting company based in Monterey, Calif., views the very process of going to a kiosk and returning home triumphantly with popular videos as a durable source of entertainment itself.“We’re only 10,000 years out of the caves,” he said. “Humans like to go out and get stuff and bring it home — we’re just wired that way.”He may well be right. But many Americans seem to have developed an aversion to the video store as a self-contained entertainment destination. Mr. Adams predicts that in 2013, spending at video stores in the United States will be $3.8 billion, down 30 percent from 2008. (Video store sales peaked in 2001, at $10.3 billion.)One of the beneficiaries, he says, will be subscription services like Netflix, whose revenue he projects will grow by 42 percent, to $3.1 billion. But kiosk revenue will increase the most, more than 200 percent, to $1.5 billion, Mr. Adams says.In the mid-1980s, before Blockbuster and the chains took over, videocassettes were rented almost everywhere one turned, including many of the grocery stores and convenience stores that Redbox is invading. Vending machines were used in many places then, too. Mr. Adams said that there were 100,000 rental outlets in the United States at the peak, but that poor inventory management proved to be the undoing of most.Redbox, he said, faces the same challenge of getting the mix of titles just right. “Can they stock enough copies of the hits on Friday and Saturday night and still make money?” he asked.Mr. Lowe, of Redbox, says his company aims to keep the kiosk inventory fresh; 40 percent of rentals are supposed to come from titles released within the previous two weeks. Customers can use the Redbox Web site to check the inventory of a particular machine and reserve a copy of any title. But the physical kiosk has an inherent limitation that the Web can’t address: only one customer can be served at a time.Over the last two weeks, I’ve kept a close eye on the inventory of the two kiosks closest to my house. Whether looking for titles that had been released within the past two weeks or others that were in high demand nationally, I found that few were in stock, even on weekday nights.IF Redbox is concerned about its long-term prospects in a future where our online video options will get better and better, it isn’t letting on. Paul Davis, Coinstar’s chief executive, said in a quarterly earnings call in May that bandwidth limitations would deter most customers from bothering to download even a low-resolution movie. He also placed faith in Redbox’s $1 rental price as the company’s primary bulwark, which he says “will be very difficult for any digital distribution player to approach.”Redbox’s low price, however, is less a reflection of a permanently superior distribution technology than of Hollywood’s reluctance to fully embrace alternatives to discs, like video-on-demand. But until they do, hitching-post companies are free to enjoy some good years.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','A. What I’ve learned over time is to make sure that you’re focusing on action versus activity. A lot of times there are certain things you do almost out of ritual, like creating a report that everybody looks at. But when you really step away from it, it’s more activity than action. What I’ve learned is to make sure I spend time on the action that’s going to drive results.I’ve worked very hard to get my calendar filled with things that will really move the needle versus activity that might make you feel good. I think experience gives you the ability to put more process and discipline around what really matters in your business.Q. You talked earlier about the importance of taking an interest in people who work for you. Tell me more about that.A. What I think a great leader does, a great coach does, is understand what kind of talent you have and then you help people leverage that talent so that people can achieve what they never thought they were capable of. The only way you can do that is to care about the people who work for you. No one’s going to care about you unless you care about them. But if you care about someone, genuinely, then they’re going to care about you because you’re making a commitment and an investment in them.You show you care by really taking an active interest in the people working for you, and you care enough to give them direct feedback. People are starved for direct feedback. People want to hear how they can do better. Too many leaders don’t provide that feedback. So if you take an active interest in someone, you take an active interest in sharing with them your perspective on what they can do to improve.Q. Do you have thoughts on the art of giving that kind of feedback?A. The best way to give feedback is to start out with, “This is what I appreciate about you.” They might have great strategy, good vision, they’re good at execution, or whatever you think they’re really doing well. When you start out by talking to people about what they’re doing well, that makes them very receptive for feedback because at least you’re giving them credit for what they’ve done.Then I say, “And you can be even more effective if you do this.” I think that really works.Q. It sounds as if there’s an important distinction between the words “and” and “but.”A. I think “but” can be a killer word. “And” really recognizes the appreciation part. If you say “but,” it throws all the appreciation stuff out the window.Q. What feedback do you get from your employees about your leadership?A. I continually get feedback about being even more visible. People want to see more and more of you. Even though I’m out in the marketplace all the time, you can’t underestimate how important it is to be visible. When you’re the leader, people want to see you. They want to touch you. They want to know that you’re in tune with them.One of the things I do when I travel is blog. I talk about what I’m seeing, what we’re doing well. I try to do everything I can to stay in touch with the organization.I have a “Talk to David” conference call that’s global after our earnings call every quarter where I take questions from people around the world for an hour and a half. No matter how much I do, people want more because they really like you being visible as a leader. The other feedback I get is people want me to be even more focused on growth.Q. What are some of the rules of the road at Yum Brands?A. Our culture is based on the fact that people have an innate need for well-deserved recognition. Using recognition is the best way to build a high-energy, fun culture and reinforce the behaviors that drive results.When I became president of KFC, I wanted to break through the clutter on recognition, so I gave away these rubber chickens. They were called floppy chickens. I’d go into a restaurant and I would see a cook who’d been there for 25 years and the product was great, so I’d give him a floppy chicken. I’d write on it and tell him his “Original Recipe” was fantastic, and take a picture of him with me. And then I’d give him $100 because you couldn’t eat a floppy chicken. I now give away these big sets of smiling teeth with legs on them for people walking the talk on behalf of our customer.A. One, it needs to be deserved. And, two, it needs to come from the heart. So I think what leaders have to do is recognize the people who are getting it done. For the people who are getting it done, it can’t be done too much. Why be selfish on the thing that matters most to people?People leave companies for two reasons. One, they don’t feel appreciated. And, two, they don’t get along with their boss. We try to recognize the people who are really getting it done any time they happen to get it done, and we try to develop coaches instead of bosses. To me, with recognition, if you’ve got to err on the side of anything, recognize more than you should.Q. Is there anything that has surprised you about having the top job?A. I think the fact that people put the C.E.O. on such a high pedestal. You get more credit than you deserve for being friendly and approachable. If you treat everybody like they should be treated, there’s a high degree of appreciation for that. Also, the thing that humbles me every day is that I realize how quickly you can fall.Q. Let’s talk a bit about hiring. How do you do it?A. Everybody is looking for ambition, passion, the ability to inspire. I think the thing that I have found in the highest-potential people, and the people who can have the most impact in your organization, is that they’re avid learners. Are they continually trying to better themselves? Are they continuing to look outside for ideas that will help them grow the business? The other question I ask myself is, would I want my daughter to work for this person?If I couldn’t convince myself that I could learn from this person or be inspired by them, then I won’t hire them.A. “How do you stay on top of your game?”Q. Are there skills or qualifications you’re looking for now more than you used to?A. In the best of all worlds, you want someone who’s whole-brained, someone who is analytical but is also creative enough to come up with the ideas and galvanize the organization around a new direction. I think it’s easier to find left-brained people than it is to find truly creative people.Q. How do you get a sense of that?A. Well, you ask people what’s the most creative thing they’ve done. You ask them: “Are you left-brained or are you right-brained? And give me an example of that.”A. Some people say “both.” Some people will say, “I’m more analytical.” People will answer that question differently. I really want to get a handle on their ability to conceptualize, which requires some right-brain skills.Q. Let’s talk about meetings. Is there anything unusual about the way you run them?A. I hate Monday-morning quarterbacks. So I try to focus my meetings on building and sharing know-how that will help us win going forward. I focus my meetings on beating last year. Why is this program that you’re talking about going to be better than what we did last year? What do we have in the pipeline that’s going to keep us successful?’With every meeting I try to focus on what’s the “so what” of what you just told me. And then, what’s the “now what?” What are we going to do now so that we can get better results? I like to learn from what happened, but I want the focus of my meetings to be forward-looking. I’d much rather help people make sure they have a customer insight before we do a marketing program than wait until the marketing program’s been done and then say, “We don’t have a customer insight.”Q. What advice do you give your daughter and other young people?A. I tell people that once you get a job you should act like you run the place. Not in terms of ego, but in terms of how you think about the business. Don’t just think about your piece of the business. Think about your piece of the business and the total business. This way you’ll always represent a broader perspective.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','Certainly the demand is there. People like to watch videos, and, in a bad economy, the ranks of do-it-yourselfers and would-be MacGyvers are swelling.Already, Howcast has 100,000 videos in its library, some that it has produced itself and many more from others like Playboy, Popular Science, Home Depot and the Ford modeling agency that share in the ad revenue.The site offers instruction on a range of topics, from everyday issues — fixing a leaky faucet, creating a living will — to the more obscure, like how to survive a bear attack or how to have sex in a car. (Nothing on Howcast is particularly graphic. Plenty of other sites, of course, already offer that sort of stuff.)Given the ease of posting on sites like YouTube, where 20 hours of video are uploaded each minute, it takes more than a bunch of short clips to succeed. Part of the trick to winning on the Web is having a distinct personality.Some industry executives give Howcast credit for finding a way to stand out.“They understand that video is an incredible medium to share and instruct,” says David Eun, a Google executive who oversees strategic partnerships. “But they also realize that they can use video to provide instruction in an environment that is entertaining, not dry.”One of the biggest challenges for a site like Howcast, though, is the same one that has vexed old-school media giants and survivors of the dot-com boom: How can content creators turn a profit on the Web?Howcast’s solution is to partner with advertisers and create instructional videos for their specific products or services.Blurring the lines between editorial and advertising is a tricky endeavor, of course. Companies that try to be too stealthy or clever risk seeing their brand roasted on Facebook, Twitter and beyond.“Users are sensitive to brands trying to muscle into what appears to be an organic social media environment,” says Nick Thomas, an analyst at Forrester Research. “Yes, I want to learn how to cook something, but do I necessarily want to be taught by someone who makes the ingredients?”Howcast’s team of young executives argue that they can tap-dance along that fine line by making sure that any branding effort is in a supporting role, rather than a starring one, in its instructional videos.They are even forging relationships with the State Department as it looks for ways to use social networks and other media to communicate directly with people around the world. Among the videos they’ve produced for it are “How to Protest Without Violence” and “How to Launch a Human Rights Blog.”Howcast executives are also quickly signing deals with the likes of Google, Facebook and Hulu to spread their videos across the Internet.“Being a media company today means you can’t exist inside a walled garden, just driving traffic to your own site,” says Jason Liebman, 33, Howcast’s chief executive. “You have to produce the content, distribute it all over the Web, develop the technology — all of which is hard to do. But you need to do everything in order to be successful today.”SITTING in a stifling office loft in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, with a couple of air-conditioners chugging away in vain, Jeffrey Kaufman runs through the topics that are particularly popular on search engines these days. The list includes werewolves. And manboobs.Mr. Kaufman is the head of programming at Howcast, and is supposed to have his fingertips on the nation’s pulse through proprietary data-mining tools and information gathered from search engines.Mr. Kaufman chalks up the werewolf craze to the coming movie “New Moon,” the second installment of the popular “Twilight” vampire series, based on the books by Stephenie Meyer.Why manboobs? Everyone in the small room shrugs.Then they have to figure out a how-to video spin on the topics (How to make a werewolf costume? How to get rid of manboobs?). The final consideration is whether the subject will attract advertisers or, better yet, a corporation would pay to have its product or service appear in the video.The how-to category is big and growing, but extremely fragmented. And while Howcast, whose Web site is just 17 months old, is watching its traffic soar, it lags far behind eHow and About.com (owned by The New York Times Company), according to Hitwise, a research firm.Howcast says its videos were played more than 20 million times last month across all of its distribution network, including YouTube and Apple’s iPhone. What may give Howcast a leg up on its competitors is the fact that the company is creating a library of high-quality content that could command higher ad rates, says Allen Weiner, an analyst at Gartner, the tech research firm.To help viewers navigate through the 100,000 videos on its site, Howcast divides them into 25 broad categories — such as technology, travel and food and drink — and then slices and dices those into smaller segments.Viewers can rate the videos (a video teaching how to pick a lock rates disturbingly high). Videos on sex and relationships are among the most watched at the Howcast site. No. 1 is “How to Have Sex in a Car,” followed by “How to Use Twitter” and “How to Kiss Like Angelina Jolie.” (Ms. Jolie is not in the video; it features two women in their underwear kissing on a bed.)Mr. Liebman, the executive overseeing this start-up, seems somewhat embarrassed about this playlist. He prefers to talk about the Howcast videos that are the most popular across all the sites that distribute the company’s content, including “How to Quit Smoking” and “How to Do the Moonwalk.”Mr. Liebman was bitten by the start-up bug when he was 16 and started a newspaper — “it was profitable,” he says — for New York prep school students. In a 1992 article in The Daily News, he was described as the “picture-perfect model of the Privileged Prepster.”After graduating from Duke with a degree in political science, Mr. Liebman migrated to Wall Street, where he spent some time as an investment banker in leveraged finance. Watching the dot-com run-up on the West Coast, however, he wanted to join the party. He packed his bags and took up residence on his twin sister’s couch in Los Angeles.A couple of months later, he landed at a software start-up called Applied Semantics. There, he worked in sales and capital-raising while also overseeing a team of engineers that developed AdSense, software that matched advertisements to related content or text on a Web page. AdSense had been on the market for only a few months when, in 2003, Google acquired the company in a deal valued at $102.4 million. Mr. Liebman returned to New York to work from Google’s offices there.Much of his time at Google, particularly after the 2006 acquisition of YouTube, was spent persuading sometimes stubborn media companies to post clips of their shows or movies on its site.Other members of the Google video team included Daniel Blackman, a sales and business development executive with a broad background in digital media, and Sanjay Raman, an M.I.T. graduate who started his first software company in college and later was an analyst at Morgan Stanley.Over time, the group noticed a surge in search traffic for instructional videos at Google and YouTube.“We were seeing user-generated content getting millions and millions of hits,” Mr. Blackman says, “and it would be nothing more than a guy in his dorm room showing you how to tie a tie with a simple Webcam.”The growing interest in how-to videos parallels what happened in the early days of video, says Mr. Weiner, the Gartner analyst.“Things like the Jane Fonda video that showed people how to exercise was a big blockbuster,” he notes.Other sites were building business models around simple instructional homemade videos, but Mr. Blackman and his team saw flaws in their strategy.The quality of footage and content was uneven. The pedigree of the individual “experts” was unclear. And advertisers sometimes balk at homemade videos, citing concerns about who owns the rights to the content, Mr. Blackman says.The three friends left the comfortable confines of Google in May 2007 and set off on their own.Most large venture capital firms are loath to back start-ups without seeing some content or a mockup of the site. So Howcast’s founders bankrolled the company’s first batch of videos, producing them on the cheap.For that, Mr. Liebman invited his twin sister, Darlene Liebman, to come on board as another co-founder. Ms. Liebman had spent a decade in television and film, working on shows like “Nash Bridges,” “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” and video clips for Nickelodeon.Ms. Liebman’s marching orders were to create 400 how-to videos in two months.“That’s like boiling the ocean; I thought he was absolutely insane,” Ms. Liebman said. They set up a small studio in the back of their office and called on family, friends and even employees to appear in some of the early videos.Another one of Mr. Liebman’s sisters, a dermatologist, was enlisted for a video on how to spot skin cancer. The company also sought out local experts, bringing in the head chef from the restaurant Sushi Samba for a video on how to make sushi.To build its library even faster, Howcast started offering aspiring filmmakers $50 to shoot two- to three-minute videos. The practice continues: Besides getting a chance to show off their skills to a large audience, they also get a percentage of the ad revenue if their video is a hit.The videos produced by Howcast follow a set format, using quirky music, graphics and voiceovers, which make the videos easier to translate into different languages. Howcast even built its own media player with slow-motion and zoom-in features.With the company’s beta site running, Mr. Liebman started hunting for venture capital last fall. Thanks in part to the résumés of the Howcast founders, they quickly raised $10 million from the Tudor Investment Corporation and tech insiders like Tim Armstrong, who was recently named chief executive of AOL, and Jason Hirschhorn, recently named chief product officer at MySpace.“What we liked was the fact that there’s endless content,” notes Kevin Law, a former music executive who is now an investment consultant to Tudor and serves on Howcast’s board. “There’s a how-to that can go along with any service, any product.”Building up a library of content is relatively easy, says Rupert Ashe, the chief financial officer of Videojug in Britain, which went live in 2006 and now has 100,000 how-to videos.“The thing that is difficult to get and takes many, many years to build up is a following and traffic to the site and a place in the search-engine constellation,” Mr. Ashe says.The space hasn’t yet seen a “mega-breakout site,” says Mr. Thomas of Forrester Research. But over time, he says, one or two sites will inevitably emerge as dominant players, and many others will fade away.IN the middle of last year, the food company Nestlé noticed a peculiar spike in complaints from consumers in a Middle Eastern country about the taste of one of its products, the instant coffee Nescafé Gold.After some sleuthing, the company discovered that people in that country — Nescafé wouldn’t say which one — didn’t understand how to make its instant coffee. They were making it like traditional ground coffee, said Rakan Brahedni, a new-media relationship specialist for Nestlé in Dubai.Mr. Brahedni, who says he had “fallen in love” with Howcast’s site, particularly its cooking videos, was already in discussions with the start-up to add videos to Nestlé’s Web site.So Howcast quickly produced a video showing how to make Nescafé Gold. The graphics, subtitles and voiceover were done in both English and Arabic.“This was very much out-of-the-box for us, and now we’re seeing a lot of excitement from other brands” inside the company, Mr. Brahedni says. The video will soon appear on a Nescafé Web site, and Howcast will distribute it to some of its partners.In this light, Howcast may look like more of an advertising agency than a media company. Unlike pricey ad agencies, however, that can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars for a 30-second advertising spot, Howcast produces videos for corporate customers at a fraction of that cost. Its executives say this is its entree into big corporate ad budgets.And they argue that they are still sticking with their primary focus: to create instructional content.When JetBlue Airways planned its inaugural flight from Kennedy Airport in New York to Los Angeles International earlier this year, it turned to Howcast to create videos for the occasion.The result was a series of clips, including “How to Stay Fabulous When You Fly Coast to Coast,” featuring Delphine, a leggy Ford model with her own YouTube following. The video can be found on numerous sites, including Yahoo, AOL, MySpace and Metacafe.JetBlue executives say they are thrilled with the response from the spots and plan to work with Howcast again. “What Howcast offers is something that is very cost-effective and very targeted,” said Morgan Johnston, a JetBlue spokesman.Howcast executives see opportunities beyond corporate America. They’re hoping to get more work from the federal government.So far, they’ve worked mostly with the State Department in its “Public Diplomacy 2.0” initiative to use new media to communicate, says James K. Glassman, a former under secretary of state for public diplomacy.“What we saw in Iran is that the private sector played a very important role in disseminating information there,” Mr. Glassman says. “Companies like Twitter and Facebook facilitated a lot of the activity in Iran.”In April, Mr. Liebman traveled to Iraq with a delegation from several tech companies on a trip arranged by the State Department to offer guidance on how new technologies could be used in the country. Howcast is also working on a project for the Defense Department.Mr. Liebman says the company is willing to “turn over lots of different stones” in its search for profits.HOWCAST enjoyed a break-out moment earlier this year, thanks to a five-second cameo appearance as one of the featured applications in a television ad for the iPhone. Downloads for Howcast’s iPhone application jumped from around 1,000 a day to 24,000 at its peak.People who download Howcast.com onto their iPhone spend an average of 12 minutes on the site each time they visit, twice the amount of time spent watching from their computers, says Mr. Raman, Howcast’s head of product development. “That tells me that this is going to be a huge platform for us,” he says.In the meantime, Howcast is exploring ways to distribute its content on other mobile devices and developing features so customers can buy items they see in the clips.The company will probably need to do another round of financing in coming months. But Mr. Liebman is projecting that Howcast could be profitable by late next year.If he’s right, the company could become the star of a new instructional video: “How to Create a Profitable Start-Up.”'"
"'09-07-12,'0','Wilson, of Rancho Mirage, Calif., played this weekend in her second golf Open at Saucon Valley Country Club. She grew up in Scottsdale, Ariz., the member of a “friendly, competitive family,” who helped instill a persistent need for a challenge, whether she played Monopoly or tennis.In college, when she was Caryn Copeland, Wilson was a three-time all-American, and led Stanford to an N.C.A.A. national title in 1982. After graduating in 1983, she played professionally until she was about 26, she said.“The highest I got was only 124th in the world, which, I guess, is better than 125,” Wilson said.But she was good enough to play Grand Slam events, including the Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing, N.Y.“U.S. Open in tennis, the atmosphere is very different,” Wilson said. “New York crowds and New York events are very different than other tennis events much less golf. Even though people cheer in golf, it’s still a little more sedate.”When her tennis career was over, Wilson went into coaching. First she was an assistant at Stanford, then a traveling coach on the national team and finally a head coach at Santa Monica Junior College. It was at Santa Monica that Wilson forgot her previous nightmarish golf outings and gave the sport another try. Now that she no longer played tennis, she needed something to satisfy her craving for competition.“I think it’s in the blood,” Wilson said. “I couldn’t run around a tennis court with people anymore, but golf I could do.”Soon, she was winning local tournaments and began playing as an amateur at L.P.G.A. events. She turned pro in 1999 and qualified for the Open.“The biggest difference I think that golf has over tennis, even though there are qualifying rounds in tennis, they’re still based on rankings,” said Wilson, who added, “Golf is truly an Open.”She failed to make the cut and hit a spectator’s hat with an errant shot. The spectator was O.K., said Wilson, who went on to birdie her final hole.But those were the last holes she would play at an Open until this year. She took part in events as a tour member over the next six years, but she never qualified for the Open. This year, she played only sparingly before attempting to qualify for the Open.To her surprise, she qualified, and at 48, she was one of the oldest qualifiers.“I really had a goal to play on the weekend,” Wilson said.But Wilson missed the cut with a 14-over-par 156 in two rounds. Like many others here, she succumbed to the undulating greens and the length of the course. On Thursday, she shot 77. On Friday, she shot 79. Lorena Ochoa, the L.P.G.A. player of the year for three years running, also shot 79.Wilson used her time here to see if she should go back to qualifying school and resume playing on the tour. She said she was going back to Q-School.“Even though I didn’t succeed in playing all four days, it was still nice to feel like I could and that I belonged out here,” she said.'"
"'09-07-12,'0','On the 17th hole, a par 5, what it was all about began to happen. After Watson’s 3-iron stopped about 20 feet from the cup, assuring a two-putt birdie, Nicklaus missed the green with a 4-iron, then finessed his tricky chip to about five feet. Watson got his birdie, but when Nicklaus missed his birdie putt, Watson led by one.At the 18th, a par 4, Watson’s 1-iron off the tee split the fairway, then he spun a 7-iron two feet from the cup. Nicklaus’s drive faded into thick rough, but he somehow slashed his ball onto the edge of the green, about 40 feet away.Not that Nicklaus was about to concede, and not that Watson, with a tap-in birdie, thought it was over. Watson whispered to his caddie that Nicklaus would make that 40-footer. And he did. With the gallery still buzzing about Nicklaus’s birdie, Watson quickly sank his 2-footer to settle what it was all about.“I have the greatest admiration for how Jack reacted,” Watson said recently. “As we came off the green, he grabbed me so hard, I thought he might’ve broken my shoulder, and he said: ‘I gave you my best shot but it wasn’t enough. Congratulations.’ ”That’s a gracious loser. Then again, Nicklaus, who finished second or tied for second in 19 majors, has been perhaps sport’s most gracious loser. Reflecting on the Turnberry duel about a year ago, he said: “I missed a 5- or 6-foot putt on 17 and Tom played better than I did. I don’t have any issue with that. Never did.”Looking back, Watson remembered his “ultimate joy” in having edged “the best player in the world” in golf’s oldest major championship, but he wouldn’t label it his finest moment. “Just one of them,” he said.Watson thrived at the British Open, winning five to go with two Masters and the 1982 United States Open at Pebble Beach, where he nipped Nicklaus again with one of history’s most celebrated shots. Instead of a looming bogey that would have dropped him out of the lead, Watson holed a wedge from the thick rough off the 17th green for a birdie 2 and a one-shot lead that he expanded to two with a birdie on the 18th.Watson is a Champions Tour golfer looking to the Senior British Open at Sunningdale in England in two weeks. At 59, he knows he can’t win the 138th British Open when he tees off on Thursday at Turnberry, but that won’t stop him from remembering how he did win there.“I felt I had my best game when I went there in 1977,” he said. “I had just won the Western Open and a small tournament in Barcelona, where I shot 61 in the final round. I was hitting the ball solidly with a fade; it was easy to put the ball in the fairway. My irons were good, I was putting well. And I played the wind well. You had to play the break of the wind like you had to play the break of the putt.”That is a lesson for Tiger Woods and all the other pros this week. Don’t forget to play the break of the wind.'"

"'09-07-12,'0','What happened is this: two of Ms. Bigos’s clients — a couple with a child and a condominium in Greenwich Village, and a family with a home listed at around $2 million in Short Hills — bought each other’s homes.“I had one seller, in Short Hills, that wanted to try this,” Ms. Bigos said. “They knew what they wanted — a New York apartment — and said they might consider swapping. I advertised it as a ‘swap option,’ in print and on a dozen different Web sites.”After the New York couple were shown the Short Hills house by Ms. Bigos, and decided they wanted it, the Short Hills couple visited the condo. “I knew the moment they called from the condo with happy voices that this was going to happen,” the agent said. The closing is set for next month; both parties declined to be interviewed before the deal is completed.It is complicated to negotiate sales agreements, financing and simultaneous closings for two homes and in the process make up any difference in price, Ms. Bigos acknowledged, but added, “All sales are complicated.”Ms. Zapata had noticed the “swap option” ads, and immediately told Ms. Bigos she wanted to add that option for potential buyers of her home, too.“It’s a wonderful concept, innovative,” said Perri K. Feldman, an agent with Keller Williams in Short Hills. “I know I have quite a few people who aren’t buying here because they are not selling places they have in the city — all priced around $1 million.”In Bernardsville, the head of Coldwell Banker’s branch, Cathy Ullman said one of her agents who owned a own home in Far Hills — listed at more than $2 million — changed places with the owner of an $800,000 home in Morristown, which was also listed by her office. “Another one of my smart agents just recently proposed making a campaign out of the idea of swapping,” said Ms. Ullman. “I think it is a really intriguing possibility.”The notion is not unprecedented in New Jersey, or elsewhere. In the last two years, a number of Internet sites have sprung up around the country, with names like onlinehousetrading.com and pad4pad.com. And some house-trade ads also appear on general trading sites like craigslist.com.“I want out, you want in” was the headline on one Craigslist post last week advertising a remodeled condo in Hudson County with “breathtaking (really) NYC skyline views, easy walk to train, stainless steel appliances, bamboo floors, marble bath, pool, parking and gym.” The poster proposed a “permanent trade” for a place in Florida, California, Hawaii, Costa Rica “or pretty much anywhere there is sun and beach!”Michael McGoey, a seller in Montclair, is also interested in a possible property exchange, but he said he thought the quality of home-swap sites he looked at is “poor.”Mr. McGoey is an investment banker — his company is Stonehouse Capital Inc. — and he said he was ready to talk with potential property-swappers about a deal, including the possibility of helping a buyer finance a mortgage or even setting up a multiparty exchange or one involving different types of property.The McGoey home at 112 Upper Mountain Avenue has been listed at $2.295 million with Linda Grotenstein, an agent with Coldwell Banker Real Estate, since early May. It is a restored and renovated turn-of-the-last century Tudor with seven bedrooms and seven fireplaces, four full baths, three half baths and a large carriage-house apartment.“We’d like to stay in Montclair, and swap with somebody who would like to move up,” Mr. McGoey said. “Our second choice would be to stay relatively close in New Jersey, someplace with an equal or better school system. Third choice: further out in New Jersey, and in fourth place, anywhere in the United States.”Mr. McGoey said Ms. Grotenstein had been frank with him about the slow market for “showcase” homes — and that got him to thinking about the kinds of deals that might be possible.“Let’s say, someone who needed to be in Montclair came to me, and they had a house in Chicago,” Mr. McGoey said. “Let’s say they also had a winter home in Florida — where the values stink right now. O.K., so maybe I would take the Chicago house, the vacation home and a car.”Or perhaps, he continued, someone in the New York metropolitan area who had bought open land with plans to build a subdivision, but needed to bail on that deal, could trade the property as partial payment on the Montclair house.“There are endless possibilities,” Mr. McGoey said, “and it is pretty clear that this is a really good time to be creative.”'"
"'09-07-12,'0','FOR all the usual flirting glances, headlong swooning, breaking up, reuniting, kissing, crying, pained longing and drunken karaoke that take place in “(500) Days of Summer,” it is still being marketed as an unconventional date movie. But recently at an echoey sound stage here the film’s director, Marc Webb, and its two young stars, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel, were in the throes of a different kind of affair. In this particular love story a young filmmaker and a pair of busy actors offered to make a promotional music video for their movie free of charge just because they enjoy one another’s company. Besides, Mr. Webb said, there was a blunder of his that needed to be corrected.“I made the horrible mistake of doing a dance sequence in ‘(500) Days of Summer’ without Zooey,” the rumpled, blue-jeaned Mr. Webb said. “This is an error I will never make again.” He was referring to an exuberant scene in which Mr. Gordon-Levitt’s character begins dancing outdoors to express his giddy, post-tryst emotions and is soon joined by a marching band, a chirping animated bluebird and a flotilla of toe-tapping strangers.Since childhood Ms. Deschanel has been a fan of old-school movie musicals like “Gigi,” “The Band Wagon” and “Meet Me in St. Louis,” with big, splashy production numbers. “I love to dance,” explained Ms. Deschanel, who then imitated her behavior on the day that a big crowd of extras stood behind Mr. Gordon-Levitt and duplicated his every jubilant hip shake and elbow fling. “I kept going, ‘What’s happening with the dance?’ ” she said, recreating a very sad, very tiny voice.While “(500) Days of Summer” might not have fulfilled Ms. Deschanel’s Vincente Minnelliesque fantasies  an oversight corrected in the promotional video  it offered the ethereal-looking 29-year-old actress other opportunities. There is something refreshing, for example, about her being shyly courted on screen by Mr. Gordon-Levitt, 28, rather than the much older leading men  Will Ferrell in “Elf,” Jim Carrey in “Yes Man”  she has been paired with lately.“It’s one of the strange things about being a woman,” Ms. Deschanel admitted, then said to Mr. Gordon-Levitt, with whom she’s been friends since 2000, when they worked together in the low-budget movie “Manic”: “If you were paired up with Demi Moore, it would be a thing. But with a girl, it is different.”Written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, “(500) Days of Summer” is the story of Tom Hansen (Mr. Gordon-Levitt), a sensitive but emotionally unformed greeting card writer who is bedazzled by Summer Finn (Ms. Deschanel), a pale, radiant dream girl who works as a secretary at his office. The movie opens at the end of their relationship, rewinds to the beginning, then ricochets among various points in the year and a half that Tom’s every waking thought is of Summer.In a way the film’s fluctuating timeline seemed like less of a hurdle than a conceit that’s proposed early on: that Los Angeles  where Tom and Summer live  is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. Lush cinematography and charming locations in historic downtown Los Angeles help back up this claim. But it doesn’t hurt that Ms. Deschanel and Mr. Gordon-Levitt are both native Angelenos who know every inch of their sprawling hometown, from the ugly, gray areas to the neighborhoods that are postcard scenic.“I think there are so many films that romanticize New York in that way, but it’s not like a perfect city,” Ms. Deschanel said. “It’s dirty, and if you blow your nose, there’s dirt coming out.”Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who is best known for his role as an adolescent extraterrestrial on “3rd Rock From the Sun,” said: “I didn’t really start to appreciate what was beautiful or aesthetically pleasing about L.A. until I moved to New York when I was 19. I’d come back to visit, and I’d be like: ‘You know what? There’s something really nice about driving through the canyons and singing as loud as I want, alone in my car.’ ”Mr. Webb suggested, “You can do that in the subway.”Ms. Deschanel said, “People do,” then threw back her head and laughed.In this moment, as the three joked easily with one another, it’s not hard to see why Mr. Webb knew immediately that Ms. Deschanel, who exudes a deadpan, off-kilter confidence, and Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who is subdued and earnest, would have a quiet, screwball chemistry. “To me the theme of this movie is that happiness lies not in the big, blue eyes of the beautiful girl,” Mr. Webb said.Picking up his director’s thought, Mr. Gordon-Levitt said: “Tom is somebody who expects the world to work the way he’s been told, that he and Summer will end up together and live happily ever after, and that that will solve everything. In one of the first meetings I had with Marc he said, ‘This is a coming-of-age story masquerading as a romantic comedy.’ ”And what lesson would a more conventional Hollywood relationship movie convey? Mr. Webb replied, “If you wax your back and learn to dance, you’ll date a model.”When “(500) Days of Summer” opens on Friday, it will mark the feature directorial debut of Mr. Webb, who made his name in the world of commercials and music videos. In one of them  “Goodnight Goodnight” by Maroon 5  he employed a split screen to show how a man and woman interact during their romance and after it falls apart.In “(500) Days” he uses this same technique, wringing emotion from a rooftop party scene in which a dejected Tom hopes to reunite with Summer. Mr. Webb divides the screen in half to show how Tom’s evening plays out, juxtaposing the way he imagines it (labeled “Expectation”) with how it goes horribly awry (marked “Reality”).“It was sort of like a Beta, like a test,” Mr. Webb said of the Maroon 5 video, “so that when I shot it I had a better idea of how it worked.” He added, “But don’t tell them that.”Of course making a movie is one thing; dealing with the responses to it is another. Ms. Deschanel still doesn’t know what to think about the reactions of some interviewers to the seeming reversal of gender roles in “(500) Days of Summer”: Summer is uninterested in romantic commitment, and Tom can’t wait to start nesting. Some male journalists have asked her, “Why is Summer such a bitch?”“I sort of take it personally,” Ms. Deschanel said, looking distressed, “because she was upfront with Tom at the beginning, and because I think we did a good job of not making her seem like that.” Trying to console her, Mr. Webb explained why a man just might react like that. “Zooey,” he said, “they’re just not used to a movie where they don’t win.”'"

"'09-07-12,'0','“A lot of theaters set up shop in a community but don’t really involve or reflect the community,” Ms. Munafo said. “Integrating the community into the playhouse has been an essential goal of mine.”Summer theater on the Vineyard has been produced on and off since at least the early 1900s, when the Rice Playhouse in Oak Bluffs put on shows for both adults and children. In addition to the Playhouse, a performing arts center called the Yard produces dance, opera and some theater.The island’s roots are clearly entwined in the playhouse’s programming. Mr. Khan, a writer of “Fly,” has been coming here for years. The next production, “Walking the Volcano,” an experimental “short play progression” about relationships from the 1960s onward, which begins performances on Wednesday, is by a year-round Vineyard resident, Jon Lipsky.Mr. Lipsky, who teaches playwriting and acting at Boston University, said he chose to leave the Boston area and move here 14 years ago in large part because of the playhouse. “There’s something special when your audience is not an anonymous crowd but instead your dentist, your kid’s soccer coach, the guy who built your house, other artists in the community,” he said. “People talk about having a wonderful theater community in Boston, but that word is misused. A community is people who are different from one another and who come together, as we have at the playhouse — not a theater clique or a theater gang.”Ms. Munafo is hardly a product of the theater establishment. After graduating from high school in New Jersey in 1974 and arriving on the Vineyard a year later, she worked as a waitress and a delivery truck driver, among other jobs, while also becoming active in community theater. She landed a role in the playhouse’s production of “Bus Stop” in 1984 and soon after became the business manager for the theater while also directing plays there. She studied theater at Harvard Extension School in the 1990s and became artistic director in 1995; she is now both producer and artistic director, overseeing an annual budget of $500,000 and earning a $47,500 salary.Located in Vineyard Haven, the playhouse was built in 1833 as a Methodist meeting house. It also served, for many decades, as a Masonic lodge.The theater was established in 1982, and its history is conspicuously well documented in the large ground-floor lobby where production photos of actors, well known and otherwise, cover the walls. Mia Farrow, James Lapine and Amy Brenneman are among those who have worked at the Playhouse and live on or visit the Vineyard. Mr. Lapine and Ms. Brenneman serve on its honorary board, along with the Academy Award-winning actress Patricia Neal and the director and critic Robert Brustein, among others.Earned income accounts for about half of the playhouse’s budget; the rest comes from donors and grants from the Liman Foundation, the Shubert Foundation and other foundations and from local corporate sponsors like Cronig’s Market. Tickets range from $25 to $37.50, while an annual summer Shakespeare production, at a nearby outdoor amphitheater, costs about half that. (This summer’s production is “The Taming of the Shrew,” beginning July 22; the third production at the playhouse is Kathleen Tolan’s “Memory House.”)Ms. Munafo is attempting to raise a few million dollars to renovate and expand the playhouse, which has one cramped dressing room for the actors and nooks that are packed with props and equipment.In May the playhouse held its first New York City fund-raiser to support the expansion. Mr. Feiffer, one of the main speakers, used the moment to amplify Ms. Munafo’s fund-raising pitch with a bit of visually rich cartoonist humor.“I noted that she was talking about raising millions of dollars to renovate the theater, even though we are in the middle of the greatest depression since 1929, and that it all made a thought balloon appear over my head: ‘Oy vey,’ ” Mr. Feiffer recalled. “But she and her team have great drive, and if anyone can pull it off, they can.”'"

"'09-07-13,'1','On her own, my mother raised my brother and me. She taught us that the key to success in America is a good education. And she set the example, studying alongside my brother and me at our kitchen table so that she could become a registered nurse. We worked hard. I poured myself into my studies at Cardinal Spellman High School, earning scholarships to Princeton University and then Yale Law School, while my brother went to medical school. Our achievements are due to the values that we learned as children, and they have continued to guide my life’s endeavors. I try to pass on this legacy by serving as a mentor and friend to my many godchildren and students of all backgrounds.Over the past three decades, I have seen our judicial system from a number of different perspectives – as a big-city prosecutor, a corporate litigator, a trial judge and an appellate judge. My first job after law school was as an assistant District Attorney in New York. There, I saw children exploited and abused. I felt the suffering of victims’ families torn apart by a loved one’s needless death. And I learned the tough job law enforcement has protecting the public safety. In my next legal job, I focused on commercial, instead of criminal, matters. I litigated issues on behalf of national and international businesses and advised them on matters ranging from contracts to trademarks.My career as an advocate ended—and my career as a judge began—when I was appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. As a trial judge, I decided over four hundred and fifty cases, and presided over dozens of trials, with perhaps my best known case involving the Major League Baseball strike in 1995.After six extraordinary years on the district court, I was appointed by President William Jefferson Clinton to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On that Court, I have enjoyed the benefit of sharing ideas and perspectives with wonderful colleagues as we have worked together to resolve the issues before us. I have now served as an appellate judge for over a decade, deciding a wide range of Constitutional, statutory, and other legal questions.Throughout my seventeen years on the bench, I have witnessed the human consequences of my decisions. Those decisions have been made not to serve the interests of any one litigant, but always to serve the larger interest of impartial justice.In the past month, many Senators have asked me about my judicial philosophy. It is simple: fidelity to the law. The task of a judge is not to make the law – it is to apply the law. And it is clear, I believe, that my record in two courts reflects my rigorous commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to its terms; interpreting statutes according to their terms and Congress’s intent; and hewing faithfully to precedents established by the Supreme Court and my Circuit Court. In each case I have heard, I have applied the law to the facts at hand.The process of judging is enhanced when the arguments and concerns of the parties to the litigation are understood and acknowledged. That is why I generally structure my opinions by setting out what the law requires and then by explaining why a contrary position, sympathetic or not, is accepted or rejected. That is how I seek to strengthen both the rule of law and faith in the impartiality of our justice system. My personal and professional experiences help me listen and understand, with the law always commanding the result in every case.Since President Obama announced my nomination in May, I have received letters from people all over this country. Many tell a unique story of hope in spite of struggles. Each letter has deeply touched me. Each reflects a belief in the dream that led my parents to come to New York all those years ago. It is our Constitution that makes that Dream possible, and I now seek the honor of upholding the Constitution as a Justice on the Supreme Court.I look forward in the next few days to answering your questions, to having the American people learn more about me, and to being part of a process that reflects the greatness of our Constitution and of our nation. Thank you.'"

"'09-07-13,'1','“I did not want to see more people out of work,” State Senator Frank A. Ciccone III, the bill’s sponsor, said. “My compassion is with the poor people who are trying to make a living than with the multimillionaires who overinvested and tried to take more money out.”The move bucks a national trend away from greyhound racing. In the last year alone, Massachusetts voters passed a ballot question banning greyhound racing amid allegations that the dogs were mistreated; a racing group wants to contest that referendum.New Hampshire’s two remaining greyhound tracks won state permission last month to end live racing because of waning interest from bettors. The state ended a requirement that the tracks host 50 days of racing to complement simulcast wagering — a law that a spokesman for one facility, the Lodge at Belmont, likened to forcing a “Cadillac dealer to have a horse-and-buggy division.”About 30 greyhound tracks remain nationwide, down from a peak of about 55 in the early 1990s, said Gary Guccione, executive director of the National Greyhound Association in Abilene, Kan.“There has been a downsizing,” he said. “It started when the lotteries really started expanding and when the casinos were getting a foothold in different parts of the country.”UTGR Inc., the owners of Twin River — which opened as a horse racing track in the 1940s — filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last month, unable to repay more than a half-billion dollars in debt.Governor Carcieri wants to end live racing, saying wagering at Twin River has declined to $13 million from $150 million in 1990. Twin River moved earlier this year to suspend greyhound racing, which the facility says costs more than $10 million a year, and sought legislative permission to get rid of the sport as part of a structured bankruptcy deal.“The governor has said all along, ‘Get rid of the dogs. It doesn’t make financial sense to continue dog racing,’ ” a Carcieri spokeswoman, Amy Kempe, said.Instead, lawmakers voted to expand the required number of annual racing days, although the track usually operates about 200 days on its own, said Jennifer Bramley, a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Greyhound Owners Association.Though Guccione said tracks are still busy in states like Florida and Arkansas, there has been ongoing upheaval in New England.In New Hampshire, the Lodge at Belmont and Seabrook Greyhound Park suspended live racing, but will continue to simulcast races from tracks around the country, which typically draw a bigger betting pool and a chance for higher payouts.Wagers on live racing at the Lodge at Belmont accounted for only $180,000 of the $45 million in overall pari-mutuel wagers at the facility last year, a spokesman Rick Newman, said.'"
"'09-07-13,'1','Marin Cilic defeated James Blake in the first reverse-singles match Sunday to clinch a victory for host Croatia in the Davis Cup quarterfinals and eliminate the United States.Cilic won, 6-3, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, on the indoor clay court in Porec to clinch Croatia’s first berth in the semifinals since 2005, when it won the Cup championship. Croatia will host the Czech Republic from Sept. 18 to 20.The United States, which won the Cup in 2007, was trying to reach the semifinals for the fourth straight year.“I think I played a perfect match against Blake,” the 20-year-old Cilic said. “This is one of the most important victories in my career.”Croatia won the best-of-five series against the United States, 3-2, after Bob Bryan, a doubles specialist, beat Roko Karanusic in the final match, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (4).'"
"'09-07-13,'1','For Ji, 23, the Open title was her first major championship and second title since she joined the L.P.G.A. Tour in 2007. She entered Sunday in second place, two shots behind Cristie Kerr, who finished tied for third at two shots back after a final-round 75.“This golf course is pretty much all I can handle, and I just didn’t play well,” Kerr said. “And there were a couple of people having a good day out there, and you just never know at an Open.”Unlike some golfers, Ji has a habit of checking the leader board after every hole. Before her tee shot on No. 18, she was tied with Kung, who made a charge by shooting a 69, though she relinquished the outright lead with a bogey on No. 17.If Ji was nervous after looking at the leader board, she did not show it. She placed her drive in the fairway and hit her approach onto the green.“On the second shot, I just wanted to make sure I saved the par,” Ji said. “But the distance was perfect and spin was just ideal.“On the green, I knew the worst possible scenario was the playoff, so I cleared my mind of that thought.”Few putts were easy during the week on the fast, undulating greens at Saucon Valley. Ji’s 20-foot putt broke left to right, but she hit it dead center to win the Open and avoid a playoff with Kung.“Right before hitting the putt, I was nervous to the point where my hands were shaking,” Ji said, “but you know, once again, I told myself to make sure I saved par.”Ji also had birdies on the 13th and 14th holes. Oddly enough, those birdies might not have come if Ji had not fired a double bogey on No. 10.This week, the United States Golf Association moved the tee box on the par-4 10th to a position that tempts golfers to go for the green with their drives. But two bunkers guard the green. Paula Creamer’s title dream ended on No. 10 on Saturday, after she hit into one of the bunkers and made a triple bogey.Ji’s hopes seemed destined to crash the same way Sunday. She went for the green and hit her tee shot into the same bunker that Creamer did. Ji then blasted out of the bunker — and into another one — before making a double bogey.At that point, Ji, who was three shots behind Kerr, figured she had no chance of winning. All the pressure she felt earlier in the round faded, and she was able to avoid any more bogeys.“Up until that point, Cristie Kerr was so far ahead, and I just didn’t think anyone was going to be able to catch up with her,” Ji said.The pressure was mounting for Kerr, the 2007 United States Open winner. She was alone in the lead at par through 12 holes before bogeying Nos. 13 and 16.When she reached the 17th tee, Kerr kicked her bag — multiple times.“Obviously, today wasn’t my day,” Kerr said. “Nothing went in. Even the good putts I hit did not go in.”For Ji, however, that was not the case.'"
"'09-07-13,'1','The Swiss postal service has started redirecting some mail from the letter box to the in-box.A program introduced by the Swiss Post in June allows subscribers to receive scans of their unopened envelopes by e-mail message and then decide which ones they want opened and scanned in their entirety, to be read online.Subscribers can also ask to have the contents archived, send unopened letters to another address or have them shredded and recycled.The success of the program, called Swiss Post Box, will depend on how widely digital mail is accepted, said Mark Levitt, a former analyst at the International Data Corporation in Washington, a research firm.“Even people who warmly embraced digital tools stopped short of giving up on paper,” he said. “In fact, the electronic age has generated even greater demand for printers, paper and ink because people have even more information that they feel the need to print out on paper to read.”The program uses technology provided by Earth Class Mail, a company based in Seattle that has tens of thousands of individual subscribers worldwide, mostly in Britain, the United States, Canada and Mexico.

"'09-07-13,'1','Mr. Froomkin, a contract employee who worked from home, wrote more than 1,000 columns for The Post’s Web site, beginning in 2004. He filtered the news media’s coverage of Mr. Bush through a critical lens, writing in his farewell column that when he thinks of the Bush years, “I think of the lies. There were so many.”He regularly criticized the news media’s handling of the president, saying in a final column last month that “mainstream-media journalism missed the real Bush story for way too long.”Mr. Froomkin’s dismissal raised a remarkable amount of ire among many liberal bloggers, some of whom wondered whether there were ideological motives for The Post’s decision. His fans sense that he will be more valued at Arianna Huffington’s Post, where he will write regular dispatches and manage four reporters in Washington.Like Ms. Huffington, Mr. Froomkin speaks supportively of a “call it like you see it, let the chips fall where they may” style of journalism, a tacit rejection of the “triangulation” style that he says is too common in Washington.In his discussions with The Post about his dismissal, “I was never entirely clear on what their reasoning was,” Mr. Froomkin said in an interview, adding that traffic was “one of the things they mentioned.” He does not think that traffic was “the major factor.”Similarly, news media critics like Mark Glaser, the executive editor of the PBS blog MediaShift, have suggested that Mr. Froomkin’s dismissal was a consequence of the difficult merger of the print and Web sides of The Post. He noted that the company could be hiding other reasons for the decision, “but I’m not sure if we’ll ever know that for sure.”Mr. Froomkin said that executives told him that they were reviewing all contracts for the Web site. The two sides had clashed in the past over the column, including over Mr. Froomkin’s tendency to criticize the news media. Mr. Rosen said he believed The Post cited traffic declines to feed its narrative that “the column had run its course.”The paper’s ombudsman, Andrew Alexander, said in a blog post that “reduced traffic played a big role” in the decision. Fred Hiatt, the editorial page editor of The Post, told The City Paper that “his traffic had gone way down.”Mr. Hiatt referred an interview request to the paper’s spokeswoman, who refused to comment. Detailed Web traffic data of newspapers is not normally shared with the public, and it is unclear how often traffic is a factor in personnel decisions.More broadly, journalists are adjusting, sometimes awkwardly, to the assessments of popularity made possible by the Web. Gone are the days where reader letters and telephone surveys were the best gauges of a newspaper section’s popularity.Making decisions based on user preferences makes sense, to a point, and the careers of television journalists are certainly measured in part by TV ratings. Mr. Rosen said he was sure The Post had “dropped features that were not very popular with the users of WashingtonPost.com.”At online publications, “there are some things you do whether or not people click on them, and there are some things you do because you’re hoping to get clicks,” Mr. Froomkin said.If those in the second category are not popular, it is perfectly reasonable to phase them out, he added, but he placed his column squarely in the first category. “It was a very appropriate thing for The Post to do even if not a lot of people were reading it,” he said.Mr. Glaser said he was wary of some applications of Web data, like the blog network Gawker Media’s trials of pay bonuses based on traffic.“Raw traffic numbers should not be the only gauge of a writer’s work,” Mr. Glaser said in an e-mail message. “I would also look at the quality of the work, whether they’ve broken important news, whether they provide a certain voice for the publication, whether they have a loyal audience that returns often and comments more, whether they are the start of other conversations on other blogs and forums.”Page views and visitor counts can be misleading if viewed out of context. Mr. Froomkin said his traffic suffered when White House Watch switched to a blog format, requiring fewer clicks for readers reach it and fewer page views for the feature. The columnist had also pushed for more links from The Post’s home page, generally the most important promotional place on any Web site.By no means had White House Watch lost all its influence. Mr. Rosen observed, “If The Post thought Froomkin was valuable, and they wanted to maintain that asset, they would have expected a drop in traffic after Bush left,” and would have helped to rebuild the franchise.Instead, he will rebuild it at The Huffington Post beginning at the end of July. Ms. Huffington is happy to have the traffic.It’s clear from the reaction to Mr. Froomkin’s dismissal, she said, that The Washington Post “underestimated how strong Dan’s following is.”“As for traffic,” she added, “I have no doubt that Dan, both as an editor and as a writer, will be a traffic magnet for us.”'"
"'09-07-13,'1','And over the years, with depressing frequency, bodies have been dumped and tossed into the river or suicides have chosen it as their dreary last stop. Twice in the last 10 years, in June 2000 and in April 2009, adults drowned children in the river.Its history includes malice and mystery and just bad luck — the 27-year-old man from Stanhope who drowned in 2006 after his canoe overturned; the 26-year-old man from Paterson who in July 2007 jumped into the river to retrieve an errant soccer ball and never came back.Most recently, there was Friday’s banner headline in The Clifton Journal — “How Did Body End Up in River?” — about a 2-year-old child, Imani Joyner, whose body was removed from a cemetery in Connecticut and found in a sealed plastic bag on July 5 by two fishermen near an underpass where the homeless sleep on battered mattresses. One theory was that it was part of a ritualistic ceremony, like those performed by followers of Santeria, but officials are not sure. After all, there are too many chicken bones and goat’s heads along the river to know if they played a role in this event.The same day, two boaters found the body of Beverly T. Spano, a public relations executive and mother of three from Waldwick. Her body was discovered three days after a relative found her gold Ford Windstar minivan parked at the Elmwood Park marina.The police believe her death was a suicide.Of course, bodies turn up in rivers elsewhere. And, however dank the water, life goes on around and even on it.There are riverside parks and war memorials under enveloping oaks. On Friday, three Russian immigrants from Brooklyn were fishing for carp and catfish, using Dunkin’ Donuts bagels for bait. One of them, Michael Ivanov, said he wouldn’t eat what he caught. Another, Michael Levitskiy, said he would. “How do you know the water anywhere is clean?” he said.Recreation along the river has increased, particularly the sculls of high school rowing teams and local clubs. On Friday, you could find Sue Sadik, a k a the “Sopranos” expert Soprano Sue, sitting at the very table at the Stewart’s Root Beer stand in Kearny where, transformed into Napoleon’s Diner, Tony ate with Jack Massarone, whose cap was bugged by the F.B.I.Mr. Tittel said that thanks to the federal Clean Water Act, the river, however foul, is cleaner than it was when, like the Cuyahoga in Cleveland, it could catch fire. And advocates like the Passaic River Coalition are still fighting to redeem a river they describe as “beset with every conceivable environmental problem.”What frustrates and angers Ella Filippone, the coalition’s executive director, is how insanely slow and bureaucratic the cleanup process remains, with studies on top of studies to prove what everyone knows: The river is a toxic disgrace that needs to be cleaned up. “It’s government at its worst,” she said.So purging the Passaic of its sins, establishing a peaceable kingdom where no more lost souls end up in its chocolate bisque, may be too much to ask. But making it a river reborn with a future as well as a past is not. Just don’t hold your breath waiting for it to happen.'"
"'09-07-13,'1','Oddly, CIT’s application to take part in the guarantee program has been pending since January. Yet, CIT and GE Capital look like birds of a feather — arguably CIT looks like the prettier of the two ugly ducklings of finance. In the first quarter, CIT had shareholders’ equity equal to 10 percent of its $76 billion of assets — higher than GE Capital’s 9.6 percent.Moreover, CIT appears less dependent on short-term financing. GE Capital, which had $636 billion of assets, qualified $176 billion of liabilities, or 28 percent of its book, as short-term financing. CIT said $17 billion of its funds were due to be repaid within 12 months, equal to 22.5 percent of its total assets.CIT may yet gain access to Uncle Sam’s lending guarantee program before it has to pay back $1 billion next month, and manage through its short-term refinancing needs. But the smaller lender’s travails should make a compelling case for G.E. to begin winding down, and getting out, of the financial business for the longer-term good of its shareholders.Insurers have been battered by the financial crisis. That makes it a good time for MetLife to go shopping. The American International Group’s sale of its international life insurance business, Alico, seems to be an ideal target.MetLife had $38 billion of cash and short-term investments in the first quarter. And cash continues to pour in as risk-averse customers flock to insurers with the strongest balance sheets — its annuity sales in the first quarter were $7.4 billion, more than double the amount in the same period last year.True, much of MetLife’s cash has to be set aside for paying claims. But MetLife estimates it has excess capital of around $5 billion. And garnering more shouldn’t be hard. Since mid-May, insurers have raised about $15 billion in capital, according to JPMorganChase.MetLife is spoiled for choice. Insurers traded at about 1.5 times book value, or assets minus liabilities, before the crisis. Now, they trade at book. While nobody should expect a return to the headier days of the past, valuing these businesses at replacement cost seems too conservative over the long run.Enter Alico. MetLife needs to expand internationally. Foreign operations currently represent just about 15 percent of earnings. Overseas margins are higher, and life insurance in countries like India and China — unlike that in the mature United States market — is growing quickly.The sticking point in previous talks to buy Alico was price. Alico earned $1.3 billion in 2008 before capital losses. A.I.G. reportedly demanded $20 billion. It’s understandable why MetLife scoffed. Put the earnings on a multiple of 10 — which assumes earnings are stable — and add a 30 percent control premium, and $17 billion would seem a fairer value.But MetLife should be able to negotiate a lower price. Alico’s business has clearly been damaged. Widespread anxiety last year in Asia over A.I.G.’s weaknesses hurt business. And A.I.G. is under intense pressure to sell — while MetLife could always walk away. If MetLife wants Alico, it shouldn’t be a struggle to ensure a deal gets done.'"
"'09-07-13,'1','Despite the best efforts of Universal Pictures and Sacha Baron Cohen to will their gay-themed “Brüno” into a cultural and financial juggernaut akin to Mr. Baron Cohen’s “Borat,” the new film’s so-so opening over the weekend indicates it will fall short of the goal.The results look impressive on the surface. The R-rated “Brüno” was No. 1 in North American theaters over the weekend with estimated ticket sales of $30.4 million, according to box office tracking services. “Borat,” which carried the formal subtitle “Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,” opened to $26.5 million in 2006 (or about $28 million when adjusted for inflation) and went on to gross $128.5 million domestically.The problem is that “Brüno” was released in 2,756 theaters in North America — over three times as many as the number of theaters in which “Borat” played initially — but failed to increase its opening tally accordingly. Put another way, “Brüno” had a per-theater average of $11,040; “Borat’s” average was $31,607 its opening weekend. So interest in “Brüno” was comparatively soft.Universal urgently needs “Brüno” to become a substantial hit. The studio, part of NBC Universal, which is owned by General Electric, has stumbled at the summer box office, something that Hollywood expects from time to time but that corporate owners do not.After disastrous results for its “Land of the Lost” and an arduous road to profitability for its “Public Enemies,” Universal has become a hot subject of speculation in the movie capital. (The studio considers “Public Enemies” a hit, as it is performing on par with expectations domestically and outperforming overseas.) Does a management shake-up lie ahead? Spokeswomen for the company have brushed such chatter aside as rubbish.'"
"'09-07-13,'1','The Manchester festival rescued the project and brought in Opera North, an English company in Leeds, as co-producer. The attractively gothic production, with sliding walls and eerie lighting effects, was directed by Daniel Kramer.Mr. Wainwright has described his opera as unabashedly Romantic, and when the orchestral introduction begins, that description seems apt. The strings play gently lapping, thickly lush chords. There is a hint of Ravel, but also of Mascagni and maybe Stephen Sondheim.Finally we meet the prima donna, Régine, Madame Saint Laurent, a demanding role performed here with intensity and stamina by the British soprano Janis Kelly. It is early morning in Paris on Bastille Day 1970. Marie, an efficient young maid (the pert lyric soprano Rebecca Bottone) is worried by her mistress’s disheveled appearance.Régine last sang in public six years ago, we learn, a performance of her signature role in “Aliénor d’Aquitaine.” But something traumatized her that night. She is convinced that her voice is gone.Philippe, Régine’s foppish and devoted butler (the baritone Jonathan Summers plays him as flamboyant and volatile) has persuaded Madame to return to the stage. A journalist, André (the hardy if vocally shaky tenor William Joyner) is arriving soon for an interview. “Prima Donna” becomes an operatic mystery tale about what happened that night.In Régine’s revealing first aria, ruminative vocal lines emerge from ethereal orchestral harmonies. But what are we to make of the overt melodrama? In his songs Mr. Wainwright will evoke Hollywood strings, a hint of “Carmen” or a brass band, and the listener goes along for the stylistic ride. But in an opera of some two and a half hours the extended passages in sundry styles make you wonder what is going on. Is it ironic? Cavalier? Intentionally maudlin?Some of the most captivating moments are the simplest musically. When Philippe talks of his deep affection for Madame, the orchestra supports his wistful lines with bare chords, mostly winds, that recall Poulenc in his sacred music mode but with fresh harmonic twists. The scene in which Régine and the journalist André, a frustrated tenor and her huge fan, sing excerpts from “Aliénor” as Régine plays the piano is beautifully done.The music is impressionistic yet neo-medieval, tinged with modal harmonies. André reminds Régine eerily of the tenor with whom she appeared in that opera. She soon feels stirrings for this smitten critic.Yet there are places where Mr. Wainwright’s compositional skills seem lacking. Contrapuntal passages, as when Marie tells of home life with her handsome but bullying husband, are awkwardly written. The Opera North orchestra, conducted by Pierre-André Valade, brought luminous sound and undulant pacing to much of the score but struggled in the more intricate music. And while Mr. Wainwright has always orchestrated his songs, scoring an opera is another matter.Finally, in the last 20 minutes or so, his attitude toward the story and the musical sources came together in music of enticing ambiguity. Régine’s trauma turns out to be nothing much: She had a thing going with the lead tenor and found him after the performance hotly embracing a young woman from the chorus.As André arrives for a final interview, he is accompanied by a young Asian woman with whom he is involved. Mr. Wainwright impishly evokes famous operatic scenes of revelation. “Who is this woman?” Régine asks, recalling a question Suzuki, Madama Butterfly’s servant, posed to Pinkerton about his wife, although here the intruder is the one dressed in a kimono. The final trio of “Der Rosenkavalier” peeks through too, complete with soaring Marschallin-like melodic lines for Régine, who is resigned to her maturity and the end of her career, as Mr. Wainwright both honors and gently kids his sources.During an agitated orchestral interlude Régine, left alone, contemplates leaping from her balcony. But seeing the Bastille Day fireworks, she decides to go on, watching life from her window. The opera ends with a tender aria for Régine, a long-spun melody with a gentle accompaniment riff: in other words, a Wainwright song. Would that there had been more of them.'"

"'09-07-14,'1','That defeat forced Microsoft to redouble its homegrown efforts, leading to the release of Bing. The new service received favorable write-ups from influential reviewers and technology bloggers for the quality of its results, as well as its features and design. Studies showed that many people preferred its look and feel to Google’s. And marketing experts said the Bing brand was a good choice that resonated with users.“They have achieved a degree of respect they haven’t had,” said Danny Sullivan, a veteran search analyst and editor of the industry news site SearchEngineLand. With a tone that suggested surprise, Mr. Sullivan added: “They’ve rolled out a product that is good. When people spend time on it, they do like it.”Anna Patterson, who helped design and build some of the foundations of Google’s search engine and later co-founded Cuil, a search start-up that has yet to attract much of an audience, said: “I think they put together something that is really compelling. They made significant progress.”That is music to the ears of Microsoft’s long-maligned search team, which has watched the company’s market share in search fall by half, to about 8 percent in May, since it introduced its first search engine in 2005.“We have had a great start and some good buzz,” said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president for Microsoft’s online audience business group. “We’re settling in for a big long run.”But if succeeding in search is Microsoft’s Mount Everest, as some executives there have suggested, Bing’s success so far has merely put the company at base camp.Reports from more than half a dozen companies that measure search and search advertising all point to upticks in Microsoft’s business since the release of Bing. Microsoft said on Monday that its internal numbers showed its search traffic growing 8 percent in June. (ComScore, whose reports are closely watched, is expected to release figures for June on Tuesday.)Still, Bing remains a distant third in the search race. It would have to triple its audience to catch Yahoo — and grow eightfold to tie Google, which accounts for 65 percent of searches in the United States.Sustaining Bing’s early momentum will be harder for Microsoft after the intense marketing campaign fades.“It is going to be a difficult and long-term challenge,” said Scott Garell, president of Ask Networks, a subsidiary of IAC that includes the Ask.com search engine. Ask has long been praised for its innovations, and it too spent more than $100 million to market its search engine in 2006 and 2007, yet the company’s small market share has barely budged in recent years.But analysts say that Bing’s solid start gives Microsoft a chance to finally sharpen its assault on the search business. No one suggests that Google faces any immediate threat. With many people using more than one search engine, however, some believe that Bing has a shot at dislodging Yahoo as the logical alternative to Google. (Google declined to comment for this article, other than to say in a statement that it takes all competitors seriously.)“Yahoo doesn’t seem as aggressive as it has been in the past,” said Mark Mahaney, an analyst with Citigroup. Mr. Mahaney cautioned that whatever gains Bing achieves in coming months, he still expected Bing to trail Yahoo a year from now.Yahoo disputed Mr. Mahaney’s characterization. Larry Cornett, the company’s vice president for consumer products for search, said that in the last year alone, Yahoo had unveiled technologies that allow publishers to better showcase their sites in search results and tools that make it easier to conduct extensive research. He said other companies were using an innovative Yahoo technology allowing them to build their own search services, which collectively garner nearly as many queries a day as Microsoft.“What we have accomplished in the last year shows an incredible commitment and focus,” Mr. Cornett said.Other analysts say that if Bing can sustain its early gains, it could have another important effect on the industry: Yahoo and Microsoft could be pushed into a search partnership. Since Microsoft dropped its takeover attempt more than a year ago, the two companies have discussed a more limited alliance to take on Google but have been unable to reach an agreement. The talks continue apace, according to a person briefed on them.“If Bing can have some momentum, I think it makes a deal more likely,” said Benjamin Schachter, an analyst with Broadpoint AmTech. Mr. Schachter said continued momentum would make Bing a bigger threat and a more attractive partner for Yahoo.For now, Microsoft continues to fight alone, but with more vigor than in years past, analysts said. Less than a month after Bing’s release, Microsoft beat Google and Yahoo to a hot new area in search: It became the first major search engine to index new postings from popular Twitter users almost immediately. The move helped amplify the buzz around Bing.“I feel like they are a little more daring,” Mr. Sullivan said. “They popped this thing out in a few weeks. That’s very Googley.”'"
"'09-07-14,'1','DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Carolyn Bivens resigned Monday as the commissioner of the L.P.G.A. Tour, bowing to pressure from players who were upset about the L.P.G.A.’s economic situation and her leadership.Marsha Evans, a retired rear admiral in the Navy who also has led the American Red Cross, will be the interim commissioner. She will serve until the L.P.G.A. board finds a replacement, which it expects to do by the end of the year. Bivens’s departure seemed increasingly likely after a group of players wrote a letter last week to the tour’s board calling for her to quit.“We reached a point which made it difficult for Carolyn herself to see herself going forward and being able to lead in this environment,” said Dawn Hudson, the board chairwoman.Hudson said the resignation was a mutual decision between Bivens and the board. She praised Bivens for helping the tour “think big” even as the economy worsened.The tour has lost seven tournaments since 2007, and Bivens was criticized last year when she proposed a policy requiring tour players to speak English. It was never instituted.“I love the L.P.G.A. and have been proud to serve as its commissioner for the last four years,” Bivens said in a statement, adding, “It is time to turn this organization over to someone who can build on the solid foundation we’ve established.”Evans has limited experience in professional golf. She began serving on the L.P.G.A. board this year. She was also on an L.P.G.A. commissioner’s advisory council in 2007 and 2008.'"

"'09-07-14,'1','Recent surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business also show that small-business owners are reporting lower profits and fewer plans to add inventory or spend capital than at any time since the group began asking such questions in 1973.Bill Dunkelberg, the federation’s chief economist, says the market is being “cleansed” of unneeded goods and services, but other researchers emphasize that this ignores the broader civic and social role that companies like H.A. Peterson and Sons have played since Paul Revere took over his father’s silversmith business in 1754.“Outside looking in, people don’t understand that business has often been an organizing point for the family,” said Blaine McCormick, a professor at the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor University, who worked in his family’s oil business growing up. “Everyone works in it; it’s our livelihood and it’s a meeting place where we form our identities and the stories that carry us through life.”The Petersons’ company began in New Jersey with Harry Hagan, a German immigrant who learned rigging at sea and taught his stepson, Harold A. Peterson Sr., how to use ropes to lift objects or himself. They opened the business together when Mr. Peterson was just 16.Flags were initially just a sideline. “Most of it was repairing steeples, smokestacks, water tanks, and painting them,” said Harold Peterson Jr., 80, who said his father brought him into the business before he could shave, too. The elder Mr. Peterson made Junior, at age 14, scale a 125-foot wooden flagpole at a local school to fix a broken rope; later, the pair worked as a team, installing flags and building radio towers.“We traveled not like father and son,” Mr. Peterson said. “We were more like brothers.”The family moved to Florida in 1964. By the time Scott and his two older brothers reached high school a decade later, the steeplejack business had mostly petered out. Mr. Peterson went to work for Eastern Airlines — until at a family picnic, Scott and his brothers asked him to teach them how to climb.Learning for the first time was tough. Walking up a vertical cylinder that narrows to a diameter of a few inches requires the balance of a dancer. The canvas slings are as narrow as toilet paper, lashed to the pole with rope, then placed under the left thigh and right foot. Stepping up is possible through leverage and friction, but a little wind or the slightest lean means spinning around, flipping or crashing to the ground.“Climbing a flagpole and doing the work we do, being out in the middle of the air, over hundreds of feet off the ground, it’s a rush,” Scott Peterson said.He and his older brother Mark persuaded their father to leave Eastern and revive the business. This time, they named it H.A. Peterson and Sons, and focused exclusively on flag installation and repair.They did pretty well in the 1980s and ’90s by piggybacking on the construction boom. Working together — at its peak, the company had six employees, all related — they installed flagpoles at the Miami Dolphins’ new stadium, in countless new condominium developments and at the homes of Sylvester Stallone and the boxing promoter Don King. During its best years, the company brought in $500,000 in annual revenues.Like many owners of family businesses, the Petersons also sewed themselves into their community. They signed on to maintain flags at local schools, worked with the Boy Scouts, teaching children the ceremony for burning used flags, and even now, they give some of their poorer, patriotic residential customers new flags for free.Mr. Peterson Sr., who stopped climbing only a few months ago to take care of his ailing wife, said he would be heartbroken and ashamed if the company closed. He said he wanted to see the company’s $120,000 in debt repaid.“We’ve established ourselves as people of integrity,” he said. “That integrity would be shot to hell if we said, ‘O.K., it’s bankruptcy. Goodbye.’ ”Scott Peterson, 50, said that at this point he was just trying to make their monthly overhead of $15,000. He applied this spring for a loan backed by the Small Business Administration, but he said it was rejected because his credit score was too low — after several credit card issuers cut his credit limits despite on-time payments.Flag maintenance, an anachronism even before the recession, has now become his main income source. On one recent workday, he drove his 1993 GMC van with 250,000 miles to jobs at three separate flagpoles, and each earned him around $160.“It’s not enough monthly to keep it even,” he said, sweat pouring off his bald head after descending the last pole of the day. “We’re just going down and down.”The stress has already taken a toll. His wife, Arelis, is now the company’s only other employee, and when asked what she made of their predicament, she started crying. Their two daughters, 8 and 11, are struggling to understand why their mother can no longer afford lunch at McDonald’s, and their father no longer sleeps through the night.Seeing businesses like his disappear all around his office in a small industrial park does not help.

"'09-07-14,'1','“It would be great, you know, to play well,” he said. “But there are a lot of U.K. guys that could do well. You’ve obviously got Paul Casey, who’s very high up in the world rankings. You’ve got Luke Donald, myself, Ross Fisher, Padraig Harrington, you’ve got a lot of guys who could do well this week.”Harrington, who has won the last two British Opens, believes McIlroy might just have a chance this week. He told Karl MacGinty of The Irish Independent, “I actually do believe Rory could win the Open. He’s got the physical ability to do it. If Rory turned up and had a good week on the greens, which he has had many times in his career, yes, I think he is well capable of winning a major.”Even in the face of comments like those and expectations that match anything Sergio García ever had, McIlroy has remained almost entirely unaffected by the spotlight’s glare. He is amiable, engaging and has not shown up on any cheeky celebrity blogs, or on Page Six of The New York Post or on tmz.com.Yet he seems not the least bit naïve. Next to the practice range on Monday, he demonstrated just how adept his off-course game is by fending off some questions from tabloid journalists looking to stir up a little controversy in a controversy-averse sport.The draw for the Thursday-Friday rounds had just been released and two wily Fleet Streeters, noting that Anthony Kim would be playing with McIlroy, were trying to elicit something juicy and headline-worthy. What about Kim, a 24-year-old American who had been a major thorn in the sides of European Ryder Cup players during the United States’ victory in September?Tabloid questioner: “He was brilliant in Ryder Cup, wasn’t he? He sort of wound up the crowds a little bit, sort of wound up a few of the lads, Ian Poulter included. You think maybe the crowds might remember that and react toward you guys?”McIlroy, blue eyes laughing: “No, no, not at all. Ryder Cup stuff’s just heat of the moment, you know, and whatever happens, happens. It’s sort of the same as what happened in ’99 at Brookline when the Americans ran on the green. They were obviously very sorry they’d done it and I’m sure Anthony feels the same. You know, he was just so focused, you could see it. When he holed the putt to beat Sergio, he didn’t know. He just went straight to the next tee. He didn’t know that he’d won.”This from a golfer who has yet to be on a Ryder Cup team but who knows he will be, a young player who really gets it. And he is unafraid of candor. When asked last week at the Barclays Scottish Open whether he would like to play a practice round with Woods, his boyhood hero, McIlroy replied without hesitation: “Not really, because I haven’t done it before. The idea of having so many people around wouldn’t appeal to me. I know Tiger would rather get on with his own business and so would I.”McIlroy does recognize that picking up some pointers from Woods, the world’s No. 1-ranked golfer, is in his best interests, though. Take his practice round on Monday. It was a page right out of the Woods “Dawn Patrol” practice manual.“I played 18 holes this morning just before 7,” he said. “And I played twice in the last four weeks. I think next couple of days I’m just going to take things easy, just conserve all my energy and try to put that into the four days of the tournament.”During his two previous practice rounds at Turnberry, McIlroy faced differing wind conditions, which could prove advantageous starting Thursday when he is plotting his way around the course for real.Talented, self-assured and as confident as players twice his age, McIlroy may or may not be ready to take the next big step this week. He has heard all the talk about García, including the comparisons of the pressures he himself faces and how they parallel those faced by García, who has still not won a major. He is realistic.“I mean, winning a major championship is very, very difficult,” he said. “It’s not as easy as Tiger makes it look. It’s very difficult. Sergio’s had a lot of chances and has just not been able to do it. Even just to win a normal tour event is very difficult. Sergio’s time will come, and when he wins one then that will give him the confidence to go on and win others.”And without predicting anything specifically for himself this week, McIlroy is not shrinking from the challenge.“You’ve got to drive it very well,” he said. “If you drive it well, it gives you opportunities to make birdies. As long as I can keep it on the fairways, I think I’ll have a good chance.”'"

"'09-07-14,'1','With business publications suffering from scarce advertising, McGraw-Hill has hired Evercore Partners to sell its BusinessWeek, a person briefed on the plans said on Monday, but analysts questioned how much interest there would be.The plan to sell, rumored for months, was reported on Monday by Bloomberg News and confirmed by a person briefed on it who was not authorized to discuss the matter and insisted on anonymity. The McGraw-Hill Companies and Evercore, a boutique investment banking firm, declined to comment.In a memo to employees Monday, Keith Fox, president of BusinessWeek wrote: “Given the current market environment, the corporation has decided to explore strategic options for BusinessWeek.”Since founding BusinessWeek in 1929, McGraw-Hill has been a mass-market player in the magazine business, but has sold most of its periodicals (it still has Aviation Week). Its Standard & Poor’s segment accounts for most of the company’s revenue, and the second-biggest part is the educational publishing business.“It certainly makes all the sense in the world for them to sell it, even though in my view there is likely to be minimal proceeds, if any,” said Peter F. Appert, an analyst at the Piper Jaffray Companies. “There could be buyers, if the definition of a buyer is someone who’s willing to take it off their hands.”'"

"'09-07-14,'1','Another ad for Mighty Putty — recorded shortly before Mr. Mays’s death — will have its premiere next week.Is it creepy to see Mr. Mays still shilling? Remy Stern, the author of a book about the infomercial industry titled “But, Wait ... There’s More!,” thinks so. But is it surprising? Not at all.“For the infomercial guys, any press is good press,” Mr. Stern said.And already there are indications that the products Mr. Mays sold so convincingly are receiving a lift in sales.“People are ordering,” said Bill McAlister, the president of Media Enterprises, in an interview on Monday. He said that the Web site for the Superpack had been viewed 14 million times since the infomercial’s premiere online on Saturday. He cited an increase in sales “between 20 and 30 percent compared to before he died.”Any viewer who has ever heard of the stain remover OxiClean — and who hasn’t? — probably has Mr. Mays to thank. He had “reached the very pinnacle of the pitchman industry in the last year,” Mr. Stern said. He starred in a Discovery Channel series, “Pitchmen,” which documented his search for the next big as-seen-on-TV product. He started his own company and invested in some of the products he was pitching.Many of Mr. Mays’s infomercials were taken off TV after his death. His relatives, who will receive royalties from the infomercials, announced last week that they would permit his clients to continue running his spots and using his likeness on products.In a statement, Mr. Mays’s widow, Deborah, said, “Billy believed in every product he sold, and he loved nothing more than bringing helpful products to people at a great savings.”Mr. Mays’s lawyer, Roger Pliakas, said the announcement was necessary to signal to television networks that they could resume running the ads.“The networks weren’t going to run anything until the family signed off,” Mr. Pliakas said in an interview Monday. The networks that covered Mr. Mays’s death as a news story were particularly resistant about the commercials, he added, so the family’s statement sought to “tell the networks what our position was.”Mr. Pliakas said there was no debate among the family members about the resumption. “This is what we really feel Billy would have wanted to do,” he said, adding, “We felt we could let the public decide whether it was appropriate or not.”Among Mr. Mays’s clients, the decision to keep playing his ads was not a unanimous one. Church & Dwight, the makers of OxiClean and the cleaning solution Orange Glo, has yet to put Mr. Mays’s commercials back in rotation. The home page of the OxiClean Web site continues to pay tribute to Mr. Mays, with a photo of the pitchman in his trademark blue shirt.On Monday, though, the company hinted that viewers may hear “Billy Mays here for OxiClean” sometime soon. Bruce F. Fleming, its chief marketing officer, said in a statement that “while it is too early to make any specific plans, Church & Dwight will try to strike a balance between honoring the man and advancing the brand, since he had established such a solid foundation for us.”It is unclear how long Mr. Mays’s clients will be able to use his likeness. Mr. Pliakas said that each agreement would run for a different length of time.“Going forward, even though Billy’s not with us, we still want Billy to be the face of our brand,” Mr. McAlister of Media Enterprises said.Mr. McAlister, who spoke of Mr. Mays in the present tense in an interview and called him a close friend, spent Monday morning editing the pitchman’s final commercial, for a product called Mighty Tape (an offshoot of the Mighty Putty brand).In explaining the decision to run the ads, he talked passionately about keeping the phone operators who take orders and truckers who deliver products employed, and said Mr. Mays used to talk the same way. Mr. McAlister said Mr. Mays “helped legitimize our business,” echoing the sentiments of others. Due in part to the recession, infomercials are running more often on TV networks in prime time, further enhancing their status.Mark Biglow, vice president for sales and marketing at Mercury Media in New York, said that Mr. Mays “defined the ‘As seen on TV’ industry.”“His biggest contribution to the industry,” Mr. Biglow said in a statement, “was his effort to show marketers that ‘As seen on TV’ advertising is an effective genre for a number of products, not just gadgets and gizmos.”'"
"'09-07-14,'1','WASHINGTON — The Obama administration announced Monday that it would seek to ban many routine uses of antibiotics in farm animals in hopes of reducing the spread of dangerous bacteria in humans.In written testimony to the House Rules Committee, Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, principal deputy commissioner of food and drugs, said feeding antibiotics to healthy chickens, pigs and cattle — done to encourage rapid growth — should cease. And Dr. Sharfstein said farmers should no longer be able to use antibiotics in animals without the supervision of a veterinarian.Both practices lead to the development of bacteria that are immune to many treatments, he said.The hearing was held to discuss a measure proposed by Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York and chairwoman of the Rules Committee. It would ban seven classes of antibiotics important to human health from being used in animals, and would restrict other antibiotics to therapeutic and some preventive uses.The legislation is supported by the American Medical Association, among other groups, but opposed by farm organizations like the National Pork Producers Council. The farm lobby’s opposition makes its passage unlikely, but advocates are hoping to include the measure in the legislation to revamp the health care system.The Union of Concerned Scientists has estimated that as much as 70 percent of antibiotics used in the United States is given to healthy chickens, pigs and cattle to encourage their growth or to prevent illnesses.'"
"'09-07-14,'1','CIT and government officials on Monday explored the possibility of federal assistance to the beleaguered company, but had made no decision by early evening.The situation was described as fluid, and the government could still decide to provide aid, said administration officials briefed on the situation.The outcome could affect hundreds of thousands of small- and midsize businesses across the country that depend on CIT for access to loans to run their businesses.Unlike retail banks, which are largely financed by customer deposits, CIT raises money in the capital markets to lend. When the credit crisis hit, CIT was hobbled, and sharply reduced the credit it offered.A decision to allow the company to file for bankruptcy would create a potentially awkward situation for the Obama administration. In December, at the height of the crisis, the Treasury Department rushed through an application by CIT to become a bank holding company and flooded it with billions of taxpayer dollars through the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program.Then there is the issue of appearances if the administration allows a lender that services smaller companies to collapse, after stepping in to provide multiple lifelines to Citigroup, Bank of America and other troubled large financial institutions considered too important to let die.“You’d have an issue of the first firm that they would make an example out of by allowing to fail is one that fills a niche and helps the little guy out,” said Vincent R. Reinhart, a former Federal Reserve official who is now a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. At this point in the recession, small- and midsize businesses need access to critical funds as well, he said.Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Monday in London that it was in the government’s interest to ensure stability in the financial system.“I’m actually pretty confident in that context we have the authority and the ability to make sensible choices,” Mr. Geithner said in response to a question at a news conference. “We have a significant interest generally in trying to make sure the financial system gets through this, adjusts where it needs to adjust and emerges stronger.”But investors interpreted Mr. Geithner’s comments as suggesting that the government might not be inclined to help. Still, in a sign of how resilient the financial system has become since credit markets started working again, the broad stock market rose, as did shares of other financial firms, even as CIT’s stock fell 12 percent, to $1.35. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s slashed CIT’s credit ratings on Monday.For much of the last century, CIT engaged in the meat-and-potatoes business of providing loans and leases for heavy machinery, technology equipment and other staples of the manufacturing economy.But under its current chief executive, Jeffrey M. Peek, a well-liked Wall Street veteran who lost out several years ago in a race to run Merrill Lynch, CIT made an ill-timed expansion into subprime mortgage and student lending.Those two moves — carried out at nearly the top of the frothy markets before they collapsed — led to great losses beginning in 2007.CIT has $59 billion of long-term debt, including $10 billion that matures in the next year.The company has also remained severely strained during the credit crisis. While it is registered as a bank holding company and has about $3 billion in deposits in a Utah-based bank, CIT has historically relied on bonds and its ability to tap into the short-term debt market for the money it lends to other companies. It has been trying to raise more money through its bank.And while the Federal Reserve has been extending credit directly to securities firms to stabilize the capital markets since last fall, commercial lenders like CIT are not permitted to borrow from the Fed. In a statement on Sunday evening, CIT said it was also pursing the possibility of obtaining assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through a program that has allowed Goldman Sachs and other banks to issue their debt cheaply with the backing of the agency.CIT has applied for access to the program, which provided guarantees for about $334 billion in loans as of July 9.But Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., does not view the program as a bailout solution for banks and financial institutions, according to a government official briefed on the situation. Ms. Bair has said repeatedly that she views the program a tool for providing liquidity only to healthy banks.Perhaps more important, the program, which was set to expire this month but was recently extended until October, has plenty of other midsize banks that may need to tap it, said Kathleen Shanley, an analyst with GimmeCredit.“The government still has limited resources,” Ms. Shanley said. “Now that a certain level of stability has been restored to the market, it may be time to signal that we can’t support everyone all of the time.”'"
"'09-07-14,'1','Ms. Whitney has gained a reputation in recent years as a generally bearish but keen observer of bank stocks. Throughout the day, her comments were parsed and scrutinized on trading desks, and analysts said that beyond Goldman, she withheld a positive outlook on the broader banking sector.The market rally came so suddenly that some traders wondered if it was justified.“She wasn’t exactly bullish on the market,” said Joseph Saluzzi of Themis Trading. “I think people got a little ahead of themselves. This could’ve been a one-day wonder.”Still, investors sought any cause for optimism after several weeks of losses threatened to dash Wall Street’s hopes that the Obama administration’s $787 billion stimulus plan would be adequate to revive the economy. A slew of strong earnings reported in the coming days would deflect some of those doubts.Among the major banks announcing their results this week, Goldman Sachs is set to report on Tuesday and JPMorgan Chase on Thursday. Bank of America and Citigroup wrap up the week on Friday.And while Goldman may clearly emerge to be Wall Street’s best performer in the last quarter, analysts sense a good week ahead for financial companies.“The bar has been set pretty low, so it would seem there’s a better chance of an upside surprise,” said Alan Gayle of Ridgeworth Capital Management. “But a lot of focus is going to be in the details.”Meanwhile, shares of the CIT Group fell 11.8 percent, or 18 cents, to $1.35. The New York-based lender urged regulators over the weekend to allow it to issue federally backed debt to stave off a looming liquidity crisis, but the government appeared unconvinced that CIT’s possible collapse would widely damage the economy. The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, told reporters in London that he was monitoring the situation and that the federal government had “the authority and the ability” to confront the issue.Bond prices fell on Monday afternoon. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 98 4/32, and the yield rose to 3.35 percent, from 3.30 percent late Friday.In the commodity markets, crude oil futures for August delivery fell 20 cents, to $59.69 a barrel.'"
"'09-07-14,'1','The Liberal Democrats have governed Japan for most of its postwar history, but recently the party has appeared unable to adapt to a changing era. Disgruntled voters increasingly blame them for failing to outgrow traditional pork-barrel politics and find an end to the nation’s seemingly intractable political and economic decline.“The Tokyo assembly vote pushed Prime Minister Aso into a position where he either had to dissolve the Parliament or resign,” said Ichita Yamamoto, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker. “The feeling inside the party is that he couldn’t put off the decision any longer.”Emboldened by Sunday’s vote, the Democratic Party and its allies, which won control of Parliament’s upper house two years ago, submitted a no-confidence motion against Mr. Aso and his cabinet on Monday. Opinion polls show that the Democrats now have a commanding lead in public support, though they have their own problems, including a lack of clarity on policy and a finance scandal involving the party’s leader, a Stanford-trained engineer, Yukio Hatoyama.On Monday, Mr. Aso tried to play down any connection between the vote on Sunday and his party’s national political fortunes, although he apologized for the poor showing. The setback was the latest in a string of regional electoral defeats this year for the once-dominant Liberal Democrats.Many political analysts said they were baffled by Mr. Aso’s decision to thrust the party into an election, which by law had to be held by Sept. 10. On Monday, the prime minister said it was time for voters to make a choice.“It’s time to seek the public’s mandate,” he said. “The issue here is which party can really protect the people’s lives and the country.”Some analysts said the decision showed that the Liberal Democrats seem resigned to defeat — and that they were willing to wait on the sidelines for the inexperienced Democrats to fail, giving them a chance to return to power. Others likened the decision to a political “banzai charge.”“This is a sign that even Liberal Democratic lawmakers themselves are giving up on the old style of L.D.P. politics,” said Harumi Arima, an independent political commentator. “Sacrificing themselves is the only way for Japan to break out of its political logjam.”Mr. Aso and others have thus far fended off calls for his removal, saying the party cannot afford to alienate voters with another change of leadership. When he took office last September, Mr. Aso was the fourth prime minister in two years, a rapid turnover that reinforced the popular perception that the Liberal Democrats had lost their way.The question of when he would call the election has loomed over Mr. Aso’s government since he became prime minister. He said he wanted to wait to give economic stimulus measures time to take effect, and possibly revive his party’s flagging popularity.'"

"'09-07-15,'1','Reggie Fleming, one of the National Hockey League’s toughest players in the 1960s, died Saturday in a suburban Chicago hospital. He was 73.Fleming had been in declining health after having a stroke and heart attack five years ago, his son, Chris Fleming, said.Fleming spent 12 full seasons in the N.H.L. from 1960 to 1971, playing 749 games, scoring 108 goals and compiling 1,468 penalty minutes. During his stint with the Rangers from 1966 through 1970, he spent so much time in the Madison Square Garden penalty box, he told John Halligan, the team’s longtime public-relations director, that “I got my mail delivered there.”He was a fan favorite in the cities where he played, including six in the N.H.L. Although renowned for his willingness and ability to fight, Fleming was also versatile enough to be used as a defenseman and as a forward, shutting down star players on the other team.With the Chicago Blackhawks in 1960-61, his first full season in the N.H.L., he scored one of the most important goals in club history. The Blackhawks were leading the Stanley Cup finals against Detroit, three games to two, but trailing in Game 6, 1-0. Fleming, assigned to check Gordie Howe, stole the puck in the Red Wings’ end and scored. That goal changed the momentum, enabling the Blackhawks to win the game and the series  the third and most recent Stanley Cup title in team history.“The one that I really see clearly in my mind is Reggie Fleming, who scored the first goal in the game that we beat Detroit for the Cup,” a teammate, Pierre Pilote, said this year about his memories from that game. “I can still see him celebrating.”Fleming was born in the east end of Montreal where, as an only child, he lived with his parents, grandparents and nine uncles and aunts. Growing up English in a mostly French neighborhood, he frequently got into fights. As a teenager playing with the Montreal Junior Canadiens, his coach, Sam Pollock, asked Fleming to fight often.“I was going to tell Pollock to stop using my child this way,” Fleming’s mother, Julie, said in a 1975 article in The Canadian magazine, “but Reggie told me: ‘Mother, don’t. It’s my job, what I’m supposed to do, it’s the only way I’ll make it.’ ”Fleming told Earl McRae, who wrote the article, about his start with the Blackhawks.“My first game in Chicago, there was a brawl and I just sort of watched,” Fleming said. “In the dressing room, Rudy Pilous, he was our coach, he said: ‘Fleming, if your buddies are in trouble, don’t just stand there. Your job is to help them out, fight for them. If you don’t, you might as well pack your bag, you’re no use to us.’ So I went out and fought. That was always my job, eh? I didn’t do it to be cruel; I was just following orders.”Fleming also played forMontreal, Boston, Philadelphia and Buffalo in the N.H.L., for Chicago in the World Hockey Association and for several minor league teams before retiring at 41.In addition to his son, Fleming is survived by a daughter, Kelly, according to The Chicago Tribune.Fleming, who was nicknamed Mr. Clean for his muscular build and severe crew cut, was confined to bed during the last five years because of complications arising from a stroke. His son posted several videos on YouTube in which his father reminisced about his life from his hospital bed.In one, Fleming told his son why, after his hockey career was over, he settled in Chicago. Was it because he had won his only Stanley Cup there?“The people, their friendliness,” Fleming said. “Their comfort. They made it easy for me to make a living.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','After more than a month of bickering and paralysis, the New York State Senate has a lot of work to do. It can start on Wednesday by passing the Assembly’s carefully balanced bill restoring control of New York City schools to the mayor’s office.The legal authority for Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s mostly successful experiment expired on June 30. The Senate’s stalemate forced Mr. Bloomberg and borough presidents to hastily create a similar version of the bad, old Board of Education to keep the city’s 1,100 schools going. Senators who now want to dilute the mayor’s authority — mainly Senator John Sampson, the new Democratic conference leader, and his allies — must recognize that this is not the time to meddle with something that works.The Assembly bill skillfully addresses their main complaint, that parents do not have enough access to educators. The bill would, for instance, create 32 district superintendent jobs designed to focus on parents’ issues. The Senate should avoid tinkering with the Assembly version since the Assembly adjourned long ago and would have to be called back into session to pass a modified bill.The senators have neglected other important matters. The Assembly’s bill authorizing same-sex marriages deserves passage soon. If they have any hope of redeeming themselves in voters’ eyes, the senators must also press forward with desperately needed political reforms. The state needs a nonpartisan redistricting commission, as well as campaign finance reform and ethics reform. On both issues, the Assembly has passed useful measures.Democrats, who appear to still hold a shaky majority, would also be wise to enact some of the procedural changes endorsed in April by a few reform-minded colleagues, including strengthening the role of committees and encouraging floor debates, which are now a rarity.After passing a stack of routine bills last week, some Senate leaders have begun thumping their chests. The nerve. It is impossible to claim victory with so much business unfinished — and with no firm commitment to fix Albany’s corrupt and incompetent system.'"

"'09-07-15,'1','CHICAGO (Reuters) — Women who took hormone replacement therapy after menopause had a sharply increased risk of ovarian cancer, researchers in Denmark are reporting.In a study of more than 900,000 Danish women ages 50 to 79, the scientists found 140 extra cases of ovarian cancer linked to hormone treatment over eight years. That translated to a 38 percent greater risk of contracting the disease, compared with women who did not receive the therapy.Hormone therapy accounted for 5 percent of the cases of ovarian cancer in the study period, the researchers reported in The Journal of the American Medical Association.“Even though this share seems low, ovarian cancer remains highly fatal, so accordingly this risk warrants consideration,” wrote the researchers, led by Lina Steinrud Morch of Copenhagen University.The findings were similar to those in the 2002 Women’s Health Initiative study, which was stopped early because it found an increased risk of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, strokes and other health problems from hormone therapy.'"

From this position, he is free to clear his hips, fire his weight and unleash his power.A couple of things are very much in focus. Woods will be hitting 3-wood tee shots fairly often on par-4 holes to keep his ball in the fairways and clear of the many pot bunkers. And the swing that he had working at Congressional Country Club in his AT&T National victory two weeks ago has made the trip across the Atlantic.As he attempts to win his 15th major championship in the quest to match and surpass Jack Nicklaus’s record of 18, Woods is in the best physical condition of his career and has answered all the questions about his surgically repaired knee. And he is ahead of schedule.He said that when he and his close circle sat down last winter to evaluate his progress and set expectations for 2009, neither he nor anyone in his support group thought that he would be where he is now.“To sit here and say I was going to have three wins halfway through the year, if anyone would have looked at my situation, they would have said you probably might be reaching a little bit,” Woods said. “To have three wins, I wouldn’t have thought that.”Three victories have made this a bit of a teaser season for Woods. The first two seemed to presage a major win because each came at Woods’s lead-in to a major. The first, at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill in April, came before the Masters. The second, at the Memorial in June, came before the United States Open.Although Woods positioned himself to be a final-round factor at the Masters and the United States Open, he finished tied for sixth each time. Now he comes into the British Open after having won the AT&T NationalWoods had never been to Turnberry before Sunday, which should not be a factor in whether he finds a way to win his first major since last year’s dramatic United States Open victory at Torrey Pines in San Diego.He had never seen or played Royal Liverpool in 2006 before he shot 18 under par and won the British Open by two strokes. In 72 holes, he hit a driver once. The plan was to use the driver “four or five” times per round, Woods said. But he adjusted.“As the ground got faster and faster and faster, my 2-iron and 3-wood were going over 300 yards,” he said.That is unlikely to happen at Turnberry, with as much rain as the course has had in the past week and more showers in the forecast. But what will happen here is that the best ball strikers will be in contention on Sunday, because Turnberry’s history is to identify the best ball striker — Tom Watson in 1977, Greg Norman in 1986 and Nick Price in 1994.Woods has been the best ball striker and putter on the PGA Tour for almost 13 years. If history holds, and it often does in the land where golf was invented, that would make him the man to beat once again.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','For more than three hours on Saturday, Mr. Zengel crisscrossed the surrounding streets in his car and on foot, going back and forth along East 86th Street, back to the church, through Central Park, and back to the church yet again. Still no sign of his mother.In years past, Ms. Zengel was more at home on those streets than anywhere else. For decades, she ran her own business a few blocks from the apartment — Betty’s Trade Shop — where she sewed custom draperies. She raised Mr. Zengel, her only child, in that same apartment at Second Avenue and 86th Street.“She was probably one of the most ideal mothers. Always there when you need her,” Mr. Zengel said.But now, Mr. Zengel said, their roles had been reversed.“She’s like a child. That’s the mentality that she has,” Mr. Zengel said.Mr. Zengel kept calm. His mother had done this before, and had always turned up. In February, Ms. Zengel boarded a bus that took her some 80 blocks south, where she was found wandering around the East Village by a police officer. Mr. Zengel hoped it would not be long before someone else came to his mother’s aid.Just in case, he filed a missing person’s report. The report stated that Ms. Zengel speaks only German and broken English. She was born in Germany, and moved to the United States after the war.Mr. Zengel went home to New Jersey to wait for a detective to call.As night fell Saturday, so did a thunderstorm. All day, there had been no leads. Then, after 10 p.m., several miles away in a dimly lighted industrial section of Chelsea, someone reported seeing Ms. Zengel.She turned up under the awning of M2 Ultralounge, a nightclub on 28th Street near 10th Avenue. It was pouring rain.“She looked like someone’s little old grandma, dressed up to go to church. She was soaked, soaking wet,” said Joey Morrissey, the owner of the club.Scott Rice, the nightclub’s head of security, saw her teeter from the curb to the entrance of the club.“This older woman walks up to us. She was very well dressed — not a homeless person. She had on a light overcoat, jewelry, a diamond ring. Very old school. And she was soaking wet,” said Mr. Rice. “She would start a sentence in English, then she would switch over to German. She looks like she’s looking for somebody.”The police were notified, and an officer escorted the woman away from the club.Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Tuesday that Ms. Zengel had told the officer that she was “from the neighborhood.”She was spotted again a few minutes later by Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Rice, wandering a block away as they returned from a parking lot.Mr. Rice went back to the police, and he said he was more insistent that the officers help the woman. She was eventually taken to the Midtown South precinct station house, where it was discovered that she had been reported missing.Mr. Zengel got the call at 1 a.m. on Sunday that his mother was safe. Her disappearance and discovery were reported Monday in The New York Post.At Mr. Zengel’s home in New Jersey on Monday, Ms. Zengel was in good spirits, walking outside with her granddaughter, Renee Frey.Though where she was during those 12 hours she was missing remains a mystery.“She told me absolutely nothing. She didn’t have a clue,” Mr. Zengel said. “How did she go to the bathroom? How did she eat? Those are things I wonder myself.”But after a day of recuperation, Ms. Zengel was back to her tenacious self, the same woman who only a year ago fired the caretaker hired by her son to watch over her.“Even yesterday, she said to me, ‘Will you take me home now?’ ” Mr. Zengel said.The answer was no. Mr. Zengel plans to watch over his mother a little more now that he has her back safely.“She used to be happy-go-lucky, generous,” he said. “But now, she doesn’t have a clue anymore.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','They were blamed for the near collapse of the American International Group, the insurance company that was a crucial trading partner with Wall Street firms in one widely used form of derivatives.Over the last several months, lawmakers and regulators have stepped up their efforts to get a handle on these complex instruments. Some watchdog groups say the regulatory proposals do not go far enough.At the same time, the financial industry is waging an aggressive campaign against more stringent regulation of derivatives. The Justice Department inquiry, however, may reflect an effort to rein in the products without legislation.It is unclear exactly what the investigators are looking for, but it appears they are examining whether Markit’s bank shareholders received an advantage as owners and providers of trading data for one type of derivatives known as credit-default swaps. Some market participants also believe that federal officials may also be requesting information from Markit to gather evidence of possible dealer involvement in manipulating prices.Markit is the dominant provider of pricing information in the derivatives industry, providing the data to more than 300 financial firms that use it to determine the prices of similar contracts on their own books.The data provider is majority-owned by several Wall Street firms, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Representatives of JPMorgan and Bank of America declined to comment.In a statement released Tuesday, Markit said that it was working “to enhance transparency and efficiency in the credit derivatives market.” The investigation may also fit into the changing political environment in Washington. The Obama administration has made bolstering oversight of derivatives a central part of its plan to reform the financial industry and rein in excessive risk-taking, and has called for requiring certain kinds of credit-default swaps to be traded through a central clearinghouse and possibly one or more exchanges.Wall Street banks are extremely worried about the impact of additional government scrutiny, and have proposed their own set of voluntary rules.Even so, most Wall Street executives expect that regulators will more aggressively police the market in the future.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','“The message was ‘I want a safe place for my money,’ and they persuaded me to put it into A.I.G. bonds,” Mr. Mills said. “I’ve made and lost money before and I’ve invested in hedge funds. But this was an instruction to protect my capital, and that’s not what they did.”A spokeswoman for Coutts said the bank denied all of Mr. Mills’s allegations and declined to comment on the advertising campaign.Mr. Mills said he was especially angry because when he had doubts about the safety of his investment three months later and told Coutts that he was contemplating moving the money into gilt-edged securities issued by the Bank of England, he said he was told that Coutts was not “concerned with any risk to investors such as yourself.”The black-and-white posters, which Mr. Mills has paid to have put up at underground stations near Coutts’s headquarters in London’s theater district, have appeared in tandem with similar advertisements in British newspapers that he said would run for the next two weeks.The ads show media headlines from last year about A.I.G.’s record fourth-quarter loss and the company’s warning of subprime write-downs and then ask: “Why did Coutts carry on recommending A.I.G. Life Enhanced Fund Bonds?”Mr. Mills said the legal effort and media campaign had cost him several hundred thousand pounds so far.Mr. Mills said he became a client of Coutts, the 317-year-old private bank, about 15 years ago when he was invited to a bank reception to discuss using his expertise in loyalty programs to create a Coutts credit card that would allow customers to collect air miles.Crispin Money-Coutts, the last family heir to head the bank before it was sold to Royal Bank of Scotland in 2000, persuaded Mr. Mills to become a client. The bank then advised Mr. Mills when he sold his company, Airmiles Travel Promotions, to British Airways in 1994, and more recently when he set up Team Origin, the British team to compete at the America’s Cup sailing regatta.Now, Mr. Mills, the son of a factory worker who was raised in Brentwood, England, says he is eager to sever his ties with the bank.Mr. Mills said he first heard of the A.I.G. Life bonds at the end of 2007 shortly after he sold his second customer-loyalty product, the Nectar card, to the Canadian company Aeroplan for about £380 million and was looking for a haven for the money as the global financial turmoil gathered pace.But in September 2008, the A.I.G. enhanced fund was frozen after too many clients tried to withdraw their money. For Mr. Mills, this was evidence that the investment was not as sound as Coutts had promised.For Coutts, it was the “unprecedented run” on the fund and not its underlying assets that led to its closing. “Coutts remains confident that the A.I.G. Life product was sold with the appropriate advice,” the bank said. “It was sold as a low-risk, not no-risk, product.”Coutts said it repaid half of the £6 billion left in the fund to investors and put the remainder into a new fund aimed at recouping as much of the investment losses as possible by July 2012, at which time A.I.G. Life had guaranteed to cover any shortfalls.Unsatisfied with a guarantee from A.I.G. and by the fact that Coutts refused to also guarantee the investment, Mr. Mills sent a “letter of claim” to Coutts, a legal step before filing a lawsuit. Coutts has until the middle of September to offer Mr. Mills a settlement or face a court case.Mr. Mills said his advertising campaign had the backing of several wealthy individuals who were also clients of Coutts, but he declined to identify them, adding that “the queen has not signed up yet.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','It would be easy for Goldman Sachs employees to forget there’s a financial crisis still going on. The Wall Street firm posted stunning second-quarter earnings and set aside a record amount to pay staff. But Goldman’s minions would be wise to tip their hats to the contributory role of taxpayers. Markets may still be rough, but one big remaining risk to Goldman’s franchise could be a political and public reaction against the group’s profits — and particularly its pay.That’s because the compensation numbers are staggering from almost every perspective. During one of the worst six-month periods in the history of finance, Goldman squirreled away $11.36 billion in compensation and benefits — more than it put aside in the first half of 2006 and 2007, both boom years. True, the pay is mostly just accrued, rather than paid, at this stage. And even during the better years, the firm failed to replicate its first-half performance in the second six months.On a per capita basis, Goldman’s numbers look a little less gilded than during the credit bubble. The first-half figures work out to around $386,000 for six months’ work averaged across every banker, trader, mailroom clerk and janitor at the firm. Since Goldman has 29,400 employees today, compensation per staff member is actually below its peak of $433,000 in the first half of 2006.Goldman’s corporate tax rate is running at a defensible 31 percent compared with last year’s single-digit rate. On top of that, its employees should be poised to hand over income taxes of some $4 billion should their first-half accruals turn into hard cash. And with competition for people heating up again, even from banks in much worse shape than Goldman, the firm does have to pay to keep the best and the brightest.But it would be foolhardy to believe these arguments will placate a restive public and politicians. And although Goldman showed a steely willingness to extend and manage risk through turbulent markets, even while many rivals did not or could not, it’s hard to imagine the firm doing so well without the extraordinary lifelines extended by governments, at taxpayers’ expense, to financial markets at large.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','A freelance photographer who took the picture of Barack Obama that became the basis for Shepard Fairey’s well-known “Hope” poster, left, has filed court papers arguing that The Associated Press, for whom he was working temporarily at the time, does not own the copyright to the picture. The photographer, Mannie Garcia, said he had worked for The A.P. for five weeks in spring 2006, when he took the picture of Mr. Obama listening intently at an event about Darfur at the National Press Club in Washington, far left. Mr. Garcia contends in his papers, filed July 8 in federal court in Manhattan, that he received no benefits or vacation from The Associated Press during his time working for it and “never agreed to assign his copyright rights” to any photographs he took, so that he owns them and should benefit from any profits made from them. Mr. Fairey and The Associated Press have been locked in a court battle for several months over the Obama image. The Associated Press contends that it owns the copyright to the picture and that Mr. Fairey misappropriated it. Mr. Fairey says his borrowing is protected under fair-use exceptions to copyright law. George F. Carpinello, Mr. Garcia’s lawyer, said his client was saying “neither one of you should win this case — I should win this case.” A spokesman for The Associated Press said it was “evaluating Mannie Garcia’s position, but remains confident in A.P.’s ownership of the copyright because Mr. Garcia was an employee of A.P. when he took the photo in 2006.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday that its second-quarter profit fell 3.6 percent as the global recession, weak dollar and generic competition took their toll on sales, particularly for prescription drugs.Still, the company beat Wall Street’s expectations, as the firm reduced spending on sales, administration and research by about 13 percent and production costs by 6 percent.Johnson & Johnson, whose products include baby shampoo, Tylenol, contraceptives and biotech drugs, earned $3.21 billion, or $1.15 a share, down from $3.33 billion, or $1.17 a share, a year ago.Revenue fell 7.4 percent, to $15.24 billion, from $16.45 billion a year ago. The decline was partly because of a combined drop of nearly $1 billion for two medicines that recently lost patent protection, allowing generic competitors to be introduced — Risperdal, an antipsychotic drug, and Topamax, an epilepsy treatment.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, on average, were looking for earnings of $1.11 a share and revenue of $15 billion.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','In April, Mr. Otellini declared that he thought the PC slump had reached bottom, and the company’s recent financial results appear to confirm this.As the world’s largest chip maker, Intel helps set the pace for the computing industry. For that reason, analysts keep a close eye on the company’s take on the overall market. Increases in the sales of Intel’s chips tend to translate into higher computer sales for H.P., Dell and others down the road.Intel has warned that businesses remain cautious about buying new PCs given the still-limping global economy. Consumers have been the ones who are proving more willing to buy new computers, particularly laptops and their diminutive low-cost cousins, netbooks.“We saw strengthening through June,” said Stacy J. Smith, the chief financial officer at Intel, during an interview. Intel expects the rising demand to carry over into the second half of this year.Mr. Smith added that sales in Asia had picked up, particularly in China, and that sales in the United States were solid. Over all, however, the immediate fiscal conditions remain sobering for Intel.During its second quarter, Intel’s net income fell to $1.0 billion from the $1.6 billion it reported during the same period last year. Intel earned 18 cents a share, down from 28 cents, beating analyst estimates by 10 cents.Those figures exclude charges tied to a $1.45 billion fine levied against Intel by the European Commission for anticompetitive practices in the PC market. With the fine included, Intel posted a loss of $398 million, or 7 cents a share.Still, Intel reported higher-than-expected gross margins and a quarter-to-quarter rise in sales of chips, lifted by healthier sales of laptop chips.“I would say the worst is behind us,” said Srini Pajjuri, an analyst at Calyon Securities. But he warned that Intel’s strong results appeared to have come on the back of retailers and other sellers restocking in anticipation of higher demand in the coming months. For there to be a true PC recovery, those products will actually have to make their way into consumers’ hands.“That’s the part we don’t know about,” Mr. Pajjuri said.All of the major PC companies maintain hope that the release of Microsoft’s new version of its Windows software will coax businesses and consumers to upgrade their computers. The software, Windows 7, should reach the market in October.“Hopefully, Windows 7 will be part of a catalyst,” said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, during a speech Tuesday. “Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t.”The PC doldrums have put intense pressure on some of the industry’s largest players. Dell, in particular, has had a steeper decline in sales than its main rivals, H.P. and Acer, because it is more dependent on PC shipments to business customers.To bring its costs more in line with those of H.P. and Acer, Dell has spent much of the recession increasing its use of contract manufacturers to build its computers. That strategy runs counter to Dell’s traditional approach of producing PCs at its own factories.“That stuff is behind us, and we have made those decisions,” said Brian T. Gladden, the chief financial officer at Dell, during a meeting Tuesday with analysts. “I think we have a path to do better here.”Dell believes large businesses will begin upgrading their computers in the months to come. “Frankly, this PC refresh that we expect to happen will give us a nice path,” Mr. Gladden said.Shares of Intel rose 2 percent to $16.83 ahead of the company’s earnings announcement. In after-hours trading, Intel’s stock jumped more than 7 percent to just above $18.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','I.E.D.’s have been even more deadly for Afghan police officers and soldiers. At the current rate, I.E.D. attacks on Afghan forces could reach 6,000 this year, up from 81 in 2003, an American military official said. In early July alone, nine Afghan police officers were killed in two bomb attacks in Logar Province, south of Kabul.With few paved roads, Afghanistan is even more fertile territory for I.E.D.’s. than Iraq, where hard pavement often forced insurgents to leave bombs in the open. Not so in Afghanistan, where it is relatively easy to bury a device in a dirt road and cover the tracks.Even when I.E.D.’s do not wound or kill troops, the threat restricts and complicates the movements of coalition forces.American convoys often must wait for bomb-detection teams that move at three miles per hour. Helicopters are limited, and most troops travel in mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles known as MRAPs, which are lumbering and hard to maneuver. Though heavily armored MRAPs are effective in shielding soldiers from explosions, two turret gunners died recently when one flipped over after hitting I.E.D.’s.Acknowledging that the I.E.D. has become perhaps its central military problem in Afghanistan, the Pentagon is sending thousands of MRAPs to Afghanistan and is developing a lighter, more maneuverable version. It has deployed robots, dogs and drones to detect and dispose of bombs.It has also begun a campaign to attack the bomb-making networks that operate in small cells around the country.At the heart of that effort are teams like Lieutenant Brown’s that, with the help of explosives experts and criminal investigators, compile and analyze forensic information on almost every bomb encountered and every suspect detained.“I’m not interested in the triggerman,” said Lieutenant Brown, whose team is with the Third Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment based here. “He’s usually some poor schlep just trying to feed his family. It’s the networks we’re after.”American officials say those Taliban-guided networks are surprisingly layered, involving financiers, logistical experts, bomb designers and trainers. At the bottom are the bomb planters, often villagers or nomadic herdsmen paid $10 or less to dig holes and serve as spotters.The bombs are often made with fertilizer and diesel fuel, but some use mortar shells or old mines that litter the countryside. Some bombs are set off when vehicles pass over pressure plates. Others require remote control, like a cellphone. Still others detonate with a button or a wire touched to a battery.Though many bombs remain crude, American officers say the insurgents are cunning and relentlessly adaptive. In some cases, I.E.D.’s are used as lures to draw soldiers into booby traps.“It’s not like Iraq,” said Tech Sgt. Richard Gibbons of the Air Force, the team expert in disarming and disposing of explosives, recalling complex situations involving four or more bombs in Baghdad. “But I do think they are getting better.”Like a police forensic unit and a bomb squad rolled into one, Lieutenant Brown’s 25-member team not only disarms I.E.D.’s but also scours sites — more than 50 this year — for telltale signatures of a bomb. Soil samples, electrical parts, fingerprints and photographs are sent for analysis, and detailed reports are compiled in a central database.American officials say the work has helped dismantle at least one network, pinpointed others and improved safety for convoys. But as the death of Mr. Alam underscores, the effort is one step forward, one step back.The American strategy calls for using the Afghan police to gather intelligence, arrest people suspected of being bombers and project a sense of government competence. So far, many Afghan police units have not risen to the challenge, American officers complain.Mr. Alam was different. A father in his late 30s, he was known as an ebullient, bold, sometimes reckless fighter. He once tried to dismantle an I.E.D. made from an old mine with his bare hands.“Not proper procedure, but it showed initiative,” Lieutenant Brown said.Mr. Alam was the commander of a checkpoint near the border of the Charkh and Baraki Barak districts, a stronghold of Taliban supporters. When more than 1,200 soldiers with the Third Combat Brigade, 10th Mountain Division flowed into the province early this year, there were scattered firefights, but the insurgents mostly melted into the landscape.And then the I.E.D. attacks multiplied. After seeing two bombs in the area in May, American forces found or exploded 17 I.E.D.’s in June, most along an important connector they call Route New York.Still, Lieutenant Brown’s team felt it was making headway. In recent weeks, American forces killed two men planting a bomb, detained one suspected of being a triggerman and uncovered a cache of weapons and bomb-making materials.Mr. Alam helped, and so became a target. Following a weekly routine, he spent a recent Saturday with his family at home north of Kabul and was returning to his checkpoint that afternoon when the bomb exploded under his truck, dead center.After the explosion, Lieutenant Brown, 31, gathered his team in their office, its plywood walls decorated with handmade farming tools found at bomb sites. Bowing his head, he asked for a moment of silence for Mr. Alam.“The guy was never in a bad mood,” Lieutenant Brown recalled later. “I don’t know how that is possible given his job.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','”While the business is not recession-proof, it’s recession-resistant, and doing well, given the marketplace,” said Mike Friedman, a senior vice president of CB Richard Ellis, a real estate services firm that is helping 7-Eleven identify potential store sites.According to Kenneth Barnes, manager of real estate for 7-Eleven’s Northeast division, there are 15 sites in the metropolitan area that “the company has had its eyes on for years that have become available for us to pursue in the last year.” And he said the leases it was currently negotiating carried rents more than 30 percent below the level of six months ago.Founded in Dallas in 1927, 7-Eleven is now a subsidiary of the Seven & i Holdings Company, based in Japan.Of the 7-Eleven stores in the United States, about 1,300 are owned and operated by the company itself and about 4,400 are franchises. Under its franchise system, 7-Eleven owns or leases a store’s space and provides equipment, accounting and other services, while the franchisee who runs the store gives 7-Eleven an average of 50 percent of the sales of goods minus their actual cost.Alternatively, under 7-Eleven’s business conversion program, the owner of an existing convenience store retains the space and converts it into a 7-Eleven. Current 7-Eleven franchisees and prospective franchisees who are able to find suitable new locations can also participate in the program. The company in turn invests an average of $280,000 in the store — for new equipment, furnishings, technology that helps run the store and other modifications — and it receives 25 percent of the sales of goods minus their actual cost.According to Mr. Barnes, 20 of the new stores in the metropolitan area this year will open under the business conversion program. In New Jersey, southern Connecticut and Long Island, new stores will mostly be in strip malls, while in the five boroughs they will be in walk-up locations.Factors determining the suitability of sites include pedestrian or vehicular traffic, proximity to public transportation and the existence of zoning laws that permit a 24-hour operation and the sale of beer and wine.Paul Kandhari, a 7-Eleven franchisee who operates a store in the Bronx and two stores in Manhattan — one on the Upper East Side and another at 140 Church Street — is opening a fourth later this summer: a 2,500-square-foot store at 103 West 14th Street in Manhattan.Mr. Kandhari, who also owns two Hallmark Gold Crown card stores in Manhattan, calls 7-Eleven a “recession-proof business.” He said sales at his Hallmark stores were down 15 to 20 percent in the first five months of 2009, compared with the same period in 2008, while sales at his 7-Eleven stores on the Upper East Side and in the Bronx were up 7 to 10 percent in the same period.Mr. Kandhari is renting space for his new store under the business conversion program; his landlord is Stonehenge Partners, a New York company that owns apartment buildings as well as the Brill Building, which is on Broadway near 49th Street. The new store is in a six-story rental apartment building whose entrance is at 108 West 15th Street.This new site appealed to Mr. Kandhari because it was near the subway and heavy foot traffic. He said the annual rent was $91 per square foot — reduced from an asking price of $140 — on a 15-year lease.Jonathan Fishman, director of business development for Stonehenge Partners, said 7-Eleven was an attractive tenant because the company was “seen to be well capitalized. We’re comfortable it can build out the space.” He declined to discuss terms of the lease.Another franchisee in an expansion mode is Sunil Sharma, who opened a 2,500-square-foot 7-Eleven at 557 Grand Concourse in the Bronx in December 2007 under the business conversion program, and franchised a 7-Eleven store in Brooklyn in May. His Bronx store is in a complex that also holds a Burger King, Popeyes Chicken, a PostNet shipping and printing shop and a law firm, and it is near a post office, several schools and a hospital. Mr. Sharma said his annual rent was $45 per square feet under a 10-year lease.His landlord, Adam Wolf, is vice president of Bill Wolf Petroleum, a real estate holding and gasoline distribution company in Jericho, Long Island, which leases space to three other 7-Elevens. He said the retailer was an appealing tenant because of its 24-hour operation, “which we like because it keeps crime down.” He said his company also preferred doing business with “nationally branded stores if we can.”Steven Gillman, a vice president of Northwest Atlantic Real Estate Services, a real estate brokerage firm in White Plains, predicted the business conversion program would help 7-Eleven grow. “This could be a chance for the owner of a deli or small grocery store to sell or get additional capital from 7-Eleven,” he said.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','Duch has taken responsibility for the torture and killings at the camp, and he expressed “heartfelt sorrow” when he took the stand. But he has also placed himself within a chain of command where disobedience often meant death.In vivid testimony, the court has heard a description of the ripping out of toenails — and viewed the scarred toes of the victim — and has listened to the sobs of a man who said he drank his own urine to survive.It has heard from a man who said he crawled out alive from a pit in a killing field, and from a woman who said she saw a child thrown into the air and speared on a bayonet.Most of this testimony is uncorroborated, and some has faced vigorous challenges from the defense and skepticism from the judges. In particular, the judges have called into question the testimony of witnesses who also are designated as “civil parties” — an innovation in international tribunals that allows alleged victims to join the case and to seek reparations from any defendants who are convicted.The testimony of these witnesses has not been vetted by prosecutors, and most have arrived poorly prepared by overburdened lawyers. Their testimony has often deviated from their sworn depositions, leaving the judges to decide which version, if any, to credit.Duch’s trial opened at the end of March; testimony has been heard not just from the defendant himself, but also from expert witnesses. It has been slowed by procedural delays and challenged by accusations of corruption and of political manipulation by the Cambodian government. The tribunal, an experimental hybrid of local and international legal systems, has been criticized by human rights groups and some legal scholars who say it compromises on international standards of justice.Duch’s most intense display of emotion to date came in a video that was shown publicly for the first time of his escorted visit in February 2008 to Tuol Sleng prison, which is now a museum in Phnom Penh.With survivors standing nearby, Duch, surrounded in the video by his lawyers and security officers, began to read a statement of apology to the victims. Suddenly he stopped, wiped his forearm across his eyes and let out a cry that sounded like the bark of a seal, before turning away in tears.But apart from such moments of emotion, Duch has maintained a confident, didactic tone in the courtroom, prefacing his answers with phrases like “based on my analysis and assumption” and “according to the surviving documents.”The five-person panel of Cambodian and international judges has often addressed him more as a disinterested authority than as a defendant. He seemed to have the final word in the courtroom on the authenticity of prison documents and on the long, painstaking lists that he compiled of prisoners sent to die in a killing field.In challenging the story of one witness who said he had been a prisoner at Tuol Sleng, Duch presented the curious defense that this could not be the person in question because, according to Duch’s records, he had already had him killed.Using a similar argument, he questioned the account of a man who said he had survived the camp, where he was imprisoned as an 8-year-old child; Duch asserted confidently that he had made sure all children who entered the prison with their parents were killed.That witness, Norng Chan Phal, now 39, whose authenticity was later confirmed by prison documents, presented a horrifying picture of loss that could resonate with millions of those who survived the rule of the Khmer Rouge.He testified that he and four other children were left alone in the empty prison when Duch and his staff fled the Vietnamese invasion that ended Khmer Rouge rule in February 1979. Mr. Norng Chan Phal said he ran through empty corridors among corpses and flies, searching for his mother, who had been imprisoned with him.“There was blood, and I was scared,” he said. “I kept running and crying for my mother, searching for my mother.” Like almost everyone else who was imprisoned there, she had been killed.Duch has claimed that he had not visited the prison’s cells and torture chambers, asserting that he was a coward, and that he did not participate in, or even know in detail about, the abuse of the prisoners.“I shut my eyes and ears,” he said. “I did not want to see the reality that did not reconcile with my feelings. I did not allow myself to see or hear.”This testimony, which seemed at odds with his hands-on administrative style, was challenged Monday by a witness who said she had worked for him as a medic and had lost several family members in Tuol Sleng.The witness, Nam Man, 48, said she had seen Duch, standing under a coconut tree, beat two of her uncles to death with a metal rod.“Are you going to deny the facts and the truth that I have just told the chamber?” she said, addressing him directly.Duch said that he had found no records of her family in his files and that no women had worked as medics there. He denied everything.Asked later about this response, Ms. Nam Man said, “Now I have to find the records to prove I am telling the truth.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','For days afterward, Han mobs with sticks and knives attacked and killed Uighurs.The government says at least 184 people were killed and 1,680 injured, the vast majority being Han. But many Uighurs in Urumqi say that count does not include hundreds of Uighurs killed by security forces or by Han vigilantes. The state news agency reported Monday that police officers shot dead two armed Uighurs and wounded a third.On July 6, Nur Bekri, the governor of Xinjiang, said in a speech that Uighur Online had helped instigate the rioting by spreading rumors.Chinese officials insist that Uighurs abroad and some inside China were responsible for starting the violence. The officials avoid any discussion of systemic problems in Xinjiang that have led to deep-rooted resentment among many Uighurs: the large numbers of Han migrating to Xinjiang in the past decades and taking jobs, for example, or the restrictions on religious practice.Mr. Tohti had been increasingly critical of the lack of jobs for Uighurs and policies that encouraged the influx of Han settlers.“Unemployment among Uighurs is among the highest in the world,” he said in an interview in March with Radio Free Asia, which is supported by the United States government. While doing research for the Chinese government at one point in the 1990s, Mr. Tohti said, he discovered that there were 1.5 million unemployed workers in Xinjiang.The petition to free Mr. Tohti was started by Wang Lixiong, one of China’s leading experts on ethnic minority issues and the husband of Woeser, a well-known Tibetan blogger. The petition had 158 signatures early Wednesday. The signers are mostly ethnic Han and are from all over China.One of the signers, Ran Yunfei, a well-known magazine editor and blogger who is of Monguor, or Tu, ethnicity, said in a telephone interview: “Even if we don’t have democracy, we should have freedom of speech. And they should not detain someone for his remarks. As far as I know, Professor Ilham’s Web site is a very gentle and rational one.”In the radio interview in March, Mr. Tohti said he was concerned about being imprisoned for his writings.“Of course I worry, but what I have said doesn’t conflict with Chinese law,” he said. “If they put me in jail, I am ready. I’ve sat in front of a computer for so many years — jail would give me a chance to exercise and lose weight.”'"
"'09-07-15,'1','Retail sales have “clearly improved since the winter, but they’re not as good as you might hope given the amount of government stimulus that’s gone to people’s wallets,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR Consultants. “There are considerable headwinds that fiscal policy is going up against. Household balance sheets are a wreck and the labor market is still extremely weak.”But consumers kept their pocketbooks zipped for nonessential items. Clothing and food spending largely stabilized, while expenses for building materials, health care goods and general merchandise continued to fall.Excluding sales of cars and gasoline, overall sales fell 0.2 percent, continuing a downward slide that began in February.Separately, the Labor Department reported a 1.8 percent increase in the Producer Price Index, a measure of prices paid by retailers to factories and farmers. That increase caught economists by surprise as the index rose only 0.2 percent in May, and surveys before the government release indicated a 0.9 percent rise in June.The jump in producer prices will probably revive the debate over whether the economy is headed toward inflation.High unemployment and weak wages have largely constrained retailers’ pricing power, but June proved that higher energy prices beyond the retailers’ control could be significant. On the horizon, the consequences of the large financial sector bailout and stimulus package remain unclear, as the Treasury Department said Monday that the federal deficit reached nearly $1.1 trillion in June.On Wednesday, the government will release its Consumer Price Index reading, a measure similar to the Producer Price Index but for the prices that consumers see on the shelf.Many economists, however, say fears of an inflationary resurgence are as of now premature. The June figure was swayed by energy prices.“We’re experiencing deflation still,” Bernard Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, said. “That’s largely because U.S. and international economies are so very weak.”Excluding food and energy prices, the so-called core Producer Price Index rose 0.5 percent in June, the most since October and also more than expected. In contrast, core prices dipped 0.1 percent in May.Over the last month, the cost of gasoline surged 18.5 percent and home heating oil rose 15.4 percent. Jet fuel also soared, rising 26.7 percent after a 1 percent dip in May, to further pinch the bottom line at struggling airlines. But after a mid-June high of more than $70 a barrel, crude oil has been trending downward.Crude oil futures were trading around $60 a barrel on Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. “Whatever influence energy has had, I think that is going to have a diminishing effect in the months ahead,” Mr. Baumohl said.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','The stock market posted modest gains on Tuesday after better-than-expected earnings from Goldman Sachs, counteracting reports of weakness in discretionary consumer spending.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.81 points, or 0.33 percent, to 8,359.49. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 4.79 points, or 0.53 percent, to 905.84, while the Nasdaq composite index climbed 6.52 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,799.73.The markets had already posted strong gains on Monday in anticipation of solid Goldman earnings.“Goldman was center focus today,” said Andrew M. Brooks, head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price.The news from Goldman, which well-exceeded analysts’ forecasts with second-quarter profits of $3.44 billion, or $4.93 a share, gave the market a slight bounce before 10 a.m. and lifted market sentiment throughout the day, traders said.Shares of Goldman, which jumped 5.3 percent on Monday in anticipation of the strong earnings, rose 22 cents Tuesday, to $149.66.'"
"'09-07-15,'1','“It’s not an attempt to fly in the face of the Anglican Communion,” said Bonnie Anderson, who as president of the House of Deputies, which represents laypeople and clergy members, is one of the church’s two top officers. “It’s an attempt to deepen relationships with the rest of the communion, because real relationships are built on authenticity.”But some at the convention warned that the Episcopal Church could pay a price for snubbing its global partners.The Rev. Shannon S. Johnston, coadjutor bishop of the Diocese of , who will take office as bishop on Oct. 1, said in an interview that he voted against it because “I thought we would be seen as uncooperative and not a team player in the Anglican Communion.”Zack Brown, a youth delegate from the Diocese of Upper , begged the House of Deputies just before their final vote, “Please don’t vote in a way that makes more conservatives feel the way I do now: like I’m the only one left.”The vote in the Houses of Bishops and Deputies was more than two-thirds in favor and one-third opposed or abstaining.The House of Bishops also took up a measure that would create a liturgy to bless same-sex couples. Such blessings are already being done in many dioceses, without official sanction. “It is time for our church to be liberated from the hypocrisy under which it has been laboring,” Bishop Stacy Sauls of Lexington, Ky., told his fellow bishops on Tuesday.The Episcopal Church acted despite a personal address at the start of the convention from the Archbishop of Canterbury, , who as head of the Church of England is considered “first among equals” among the communion’s archbishops. “Along with many in the communion,” the archbishop said, “I hope and pray that there won’t be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart.”The resolution passed Tuesday was written in a way that would allow dioceses to consider gay candidates to the episcopacy, but does not mandate that all dioceses do so. It also emphasizes that the Episcopal Church has “an abiding commitment” to the Anglican Communion.It says that many gay men and lesbians are already ministering in the church and that “God has called and may call such individuals, to any ordained ministry in the Episcopal Church, and that God’s call to the ordained ministry in the Episcopal Church is a mystery which the church attempts to discern for all people through our discernment processes acting in accordance with the constitution and canons of the Episcopal Church.”Pamela Reamer Williams, a spokeswoman for Integrity USA, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender members of the church, said: “The church has stated very clearly that all levels of the ministry in the Episcopal Church are open to the L.G.B.T. baptized. It is a change in the sense that it supersedes the effective moratorium.”Conservative provinces in the Anglican Communion, especially some in , broke their ties with the Episcopal Church after it consecrated Bishop Robinson.The moratorium adopted three years ago urged Episcopal dioceses to restrain from consecrating bishops whose “manner of life” posed a challenge to the rest of the Anglican Communion. In fact, a few openly gay candidates were considered for election in the last three years, but none won sufficient support, and the moratorium was never tested.In the end, the moratorium pleased no one: neither conservatives who observed that some in the church did not really intend to abide by it, nor liberals who saw it as a codification of discrimination and injustice to gay clergy members who otherwise were qualified to be considered as bishops. The moratorium also did little to forestall the fracturing both within the Episcopal Church and in the Anglican Communion. Conservatives in both bodies have formed their own alliances in the last three years, asserting that they represent the true Anglican tradition.In the , four dioceses — ; ; Quincy, Ill.; and San Joaquin, Calif. — have voted to split from the Episcopal Church (although some parishes within those dioceses elected to remain).Last year, they joined with other disaffected parishes and groups that had splintered from the Episcopal Church over many years to form the Anglican Church in . That group held its first convention, in , last month. They claim 100,000 members.The new group says that Scripture clearly prohibits homosexual relationships. Church liberals, meanwhile, insist that the Anglican tent is large enough to tolerate multiple approaches.The debates at the convention in Anaheim over the last few days have made it clear that the liberals increasingly have the upper hand within the Episcopal Church. At a debate over whether to develop formal rites for same-sex weddings, 50 people testified in favor and 6 against.“It’s a clean sweep for the liberal agenda in the Episcopal Church,” said David Virtue, editor of , a conservative Web site. “The orthodox are finished.”'"

"'09-07-16,'1','In , researchers found that female rats given phthalates gave birth to males with a penis deformity called (in which the urethra exits the side or base of the penis, not the tip). Many other animal studies around the world have found similar results.Some endocrinologists refer to the “phthalate syndrome,” including hypospadias and undescended testicles.“Accumulating human epidemiological data point to a relationship between adverse fetal development and phthalate exposure,” concluded an article this spring in the journal Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism. Just last month, the Endocrine Society — composed of thousands of doctors in the field — issued a powerful warning that endocrine disruptors including phthalates are “a significant concern to public health.”One of the conundrums for scientists and journalists alike is how to call prudent attention to murky and uncertain risks, without sensationalizing dangers that may not exist? Increasingly, endocrinologists are concluding that the mounting evidence is enough to raise alarms.Indeed, there has also been a flurry of scientific articles questioning whether endocrine disruptors are tied to obesity, and , although the evidence there is less firm than with genital abnormalities and depressed sperm count.The American Chemistry Council argues that phthalates are not a problem, that they do not migrate out of products easily and that they quickly break down in the body. The chemical industry has noted an apparently reassuring study in the Journal of Urology finding that hypospadias does not seem to be increasing in (although different studies showed increases both in the and in ).James Yager, a professor of toxicology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, agrees that there are huge uncertainties but says that pregnant women and children should be cautious. “When my wife was pregnant, we worried about drinking or ,” Professor Yager said. Now, he said, he would be more focused on exposure to chemicals such as phthalates in baby bottles.Dr. Theo Colborn, the founder of the Endocrine Disruption Exchange, goes further. She tells researchers working with her to toss out plastic water bottles and use stainless steel instead. “I don’t have plastic food containers in my house,” she added. “I use glass.”Certain phthalates have been banned from new toys sold in the United States, but kids continue to be exposed to these chemicals from the moment they are conceived. Dr. Ted Schettler of the Science and Environmental Health Network says that the way regulators examine risks — studying the impact of one chemical at a time — is bankrupt, for we’re exposed to a cocktail of them daily. Regulation is so pathetic that there’s not even disclosure when products contain phthalates.If terrorists were putting phthalates in our drinking water, we would be galvanized to defend ourselves and to spend billions of dollars to ensure our safety. But the risks are just as serious if we’re poisoning ourselves, and it’s time for the Obama administration and Congress to show leadership in this area.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','An unlikely alliance of senators — led by Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and including Edward Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut — is backing an indefensible defense budget boondoggle: the wasting of $1.75 billion on seven additional F-22 fighter jets that the Pentagon says it neither wants nor needs.The plane, the most expensive jet fighter ever built, was designed for cold war aerial combat. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has repeatedly argued that the Pentagon needs to phase out such high-cost, outdated programs so it can buy the kinds of weapons that American troops desperately need to complete their mission in Iraq and defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.The F-22 has not been used in either war. Buying more would only make it harder for the Air Force to shift money into aircraft like unmanned intelligence drones and the more adaptable, cheaper-to-fly F-35 fighter, which is set to begin production in 2012.The F-22’s main contractor, Lockheed Martin, and its multiple subcontracting suppliers, have spread its 25,000 jobs across 44 states. And a majority of the members of the Armed Services Committee proved unable to resist that lure. Senator Chambliss, whose state is home to Lockheed Martin’s primary manufacturing plant for the F-22, sponsored the committee amendment adding the seven planes, which was approved by a 13-to-11 vote. Senator Kerry, who is not on the committee, has since said that he also supports the purchase.President Obama is right to stand up for the nation’s military priorities and sound fiscal discipline in threatening to veto next year’s military spending bill if the extra F-22s remain. He has the full support of the Armed Services Committee chairman, Carl Levin, and its ranking Republican, John McCain, who plan to offer an amendment to remove the seven F-22s.Providing for America’s real defense needs is expensive enough without making the military budget double as a make-work jobs program. Capping the F-22 program at 187, as the Pentagon wants, would keep production lines intact for years to come, well beyond the immediate need for stimulus-related job creation.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Reggie Fleming, one of the National Hockey League’s toughest players in the 1960s, died Saturday in a suburban Chicago hospital. He was 73.Fleming had been in declining health after a stroke and heart attack five years ago, his son, Chris Fleming, said in confirming the death. Fleming spent 12 full seasons in the N.H.L. from 1960 to 1971, playing 749 games, scoring 108 goals and compiling 1,468 penalty minutes. During his stint with the Rangers, from 1966 through 1970, he spent so much time in the Madison Square Garden penalty box, he told John Halligan, the team’s longtime public-relations director, that “I got my mail delivered there.”He was a fan favorite in the cities where he played, including six in the N.H.L., and was nicknamed Mr. Clean for his muscular build and severe crew cut. Although renowned for his willingness and ability to fight, Fleming was also versatile enough to be used as a defenseman and as a forward, shutting down star players on the other team.With the Chicago Blackhawks in 1960-61, his first full season in the N.H.L., he scored one of the most important goals in club history. The Blackhawks were leading the Stanley Cup finals against Detroit, three games to two, but trailing in Game 6, 1-0. Fleming, assigned to check Gordie Howe, stole the puck in the Red Wings’ end and scored. That goal changed the momentum, enabling the Blackhawks to win the game and the series — the third and most recent Stanley Cup title in team history.“The one that I really see clearly in my mind is Reggie Fleming, who scored the first goal in the game that we beat Detroit for the Cup,” a teammate, Pierre Pilote, said this year about his memories from that game. “I can still see him celebrating.”'"

"'09-07-16,'1','WASHINGTON — Federal antitrust officials have opened a broad inquiry into the practices of the companies that serve as clearinghouses for trades of derivative instruments and are looking in particular at whether any companies have improperly used inside information about trades to profit, officials said on Wednesday.Markit Group Holdings, a data warehouse controlled by several big banks, disclosed on Tuesday that it had been notified by antitrust officials of an inquiry into the “credit derivatives markets and related markets” and that it would “provide any information requested.”On Wednesday the Justice Department issued a statement confirming the investigation and said that it would be looking to see whether any improper practices had occurred on an industrywide basis.“The antitrust division is investigating the possibility of anticompetitive practices in the credit derivatives clearing, trading and information services industries,” said Laura E. Sweeney, a Justice Department spokeswoman.Credit-default swaps, derivative instruments that are used as a kind of insurance against the possible default of a mortgage-backed securities, were a central cause of the near collapse of the American International Group, an issuer and heavy trader of such instruments. The instruments were marketed as a way to limit and shift risk. But instead they wound up spreading the crisis like a virus.Congress is considering a proposal by the Obama administration and regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to more tightly regulate the dealers who trade such derivatives, along with the underlying instruments themselves. Concerned about closer scrutiny from regulators, the industry has proposed its own set of voluntary rules.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','A judge in New Jersey dismissed on Wednesday a $5 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald J. Trump against an author whose book placed Mr. Trump’s personal wealth far below his public estimates.Superior Court Judge Michele M. Fox in Camden, N.J., found there was insufficient evidence to allow the case to go to trial.Mr. Trump sued the author, Timothy L. O’Brien, in 2006 after his book “Trump Nation: The Art of Being the Donald” placed Mr. Trump’s wealth at $150 million to $250 million, citing three confidential sources. Mr. Trump argued it was in the billions.Mr. Trump failed to demonstrate “clear and convincing evidence to establish malice,” Judge Fox ruled, according to Bloomberg News.Mr. Trump vowed to press further legal claims, insisting that his wealth was more than $5 billion when the book was released in 2005 and is more than $6 billion now.“The libel laws in this country have never been fair,” he said. “We proved our case 100 percent. We’ll appeal and see what happens. Unfortunately, the court’s decision today condones the gross negligence, and lack of professionalism and bias on the part of a reporter.”'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Profit at Abbott Laboratories fell 2.6 percent as sales missed estimates, hurt by the rising dollar and growing generic competition to the company’s anti-seizure medicine Depakote.Second-quarter net income dropped to $1.29 billion, or 83 cents a share, from $1.32 billion or 85 cents a share from a year ago, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Profit was also pulled down by expenses for an acquisition and cost-cutting moves. Sales increased 2.5 percent to $7.5 billion, from $7.3 billion in the same quarter a year ago. That was below the $7.57 billion average estimate of 10 analysts.Abbott also faces the prospect that sales of Humira — the company’s biggest product, with $4.5 billion in revenue last year — may slow as consumers reduce spending, said Rick Wise, an analyst at Leerink Swann & Company in New York.Sales of Depakote tumbled 75 percent to $102 million, partly as a result of competition from generics. The drug had sales of $1.58 billion in 2007 before losing exclusivity in July 2008, and revenue slipped to $1.36 billion last year.Abbott forecast third-quarter profit of 88 to 90 cents a share, excluding certain items. Based on that measure, analysts had expected 90 cents a share.Abbott fell $1.21, or 2.6 percent, to $45.28 Wednesday in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Six weeks after test results were given, all of the subjects filled out standardized surveys for anxiety, depression and distress related to the test. They also filled them out six months later, and one year later. There were no major differences between the people who found out their test results and those who did not.“We did not find significant psychiatric distress,” Dr. Green said.In the study, people who found out they did not have the risky gene were relieved, even though they understood that they were still not in the clear. Those who learned they had the gene were more likely than those who did not, or who did not know, to regard their risk of Alzheimer’s as higher and to express negative feelings about receiving the results. But those feelings did not translate into distress. And those who had the gene were no less likely than the others to say they would have the test all over again, the researchers said.The information concerns a gene called APOE, for apolipoprotein E. It is not a yes/no gene that absolutely determines a person’s fate. But APOE does influence the risk for Alzheimer’s.People inherit two copies of APOE, and each copy comes in one of three types, e2, e3 or e4. E4 is unlucky. People with one copy have three to five times the risk of someone who has no e4, and those with two copies of e4 have 15 times the risk, Dr. Green said. (In the general population, the average lifetime risk of ever developing Alzheimer’s is about 10 percent.) Compared to people with no e4, those who have it also tend to decline more on memory tests as they age, even without obvious symptoms of Alzheimer’s.But APOE is not definitive. Many people with e4 never become demented, and many Alzheimer’s patients have no e4. That uncertainty helped turn the medical profession against testing.In the past, the Alzheimer’s Association discouraged testing, but it has relaxed its stance in the past few years, largely because of reports from the Reveal study. Even so, William Thies, the association’s chief medical and scientific officer, said that so far there had not been much demand for the test, and that a direct-to-consumer company specializing in it had gone out of business. Two authors of the study, but not Dr. Green, provided consulting services to a company that was marketing APOE testing.Two study participants, among a half dozen whose telephone numbers were given to reporters by Boston University, said they were pleased that they had joined the study. Amy Sumner, 45, a social worker in Simsbury, Conn., said she had sought out the research because there were several cases of Alzheimer’s in her grandmother’s generation on her mother’s side. Ms. Sumner thought her test results might help her mother and aunts (who do not have dementia) decide whether to be tested. She turned out to have no copies of e4, a relief for her but not much help for her relatives, who could still carry the gene.She said her mother and aunts were concerned about their risk but did not dwell on it, adding, “All four are very strong, spiritual women and have a lot of peace about it even though they’re concerned.”Another participant, Robert McKersie, 79, said he wanted the test because his mother died of Alzheimer’s. Dr. McKersie said he thought the test results might help him and his wife decide whether to stay in their house or consider moving to an assisted-living facility, just in case. He learned that he did have a copy of e4 — but given his high scores on mental tests and the fact that he has reached 79 with no intellectual decline, the researchers estimated his risk as fairly low. Although is retired, Dr. McKersie is still teaching business courses at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Despite the study’s reassuring results, Dr. Green said it did not mean that APOE testing was right for everybody. Some people who initially wanted to participate changed their minds after they learned more about the test. Dr. Green also cautioned that the study was small, participants were given extensive talks by genetic counselors and they were followed for only one year. It is too soon to tell whether the knowledge will begin to haunt them later in life. It is also not clear whether being positive for e4 could hurt people financially. Although a law enacted last year forbids health insurers and employers to discriminate based on genetic tests, it does not apply to insurance for long-term care or disabilities.Some study participants have already bought long-term care insurance specifically because they learned they had an e4 gene, Dr. Green said, adding that this scares long-term-care insurance companies. He said that when he mentioned those purchases in a presentation to insurance executives, whom he described as a staid group, some leapt to their feet and shouted that there would be no more long-term-care insurance if too many people with risky genes started buying policies.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Following are some of Judge Sonia Sotomayor’s statements in her confirmation hearings this week on major legal issues that are likely to confront her if she is confirmed for the Supreme Court:“The issue for me with respect to the death penalty is that the Supreme Court, since Gregg, has determined that the death penalty is constitutional under certain situations. I have rejected challenges to the federal law and its application in the one case I handled as a District Court judge, but it’s a reflection of what my views are on the law.”“The Supreme Court did hold that there is in the Second Amendment an individual right to bear arms. And that is its holding, and that is the court’s decision. I fully accept that.”“The court’s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the core holding of Roe. That is the precedent of the court and settled in terms of the holding of the court.” A constitutional requirement for a health exception to abortion restrictions “has been a part of the court’s jurisprudence and a part of its precedents. Those precedents must be given deference in any situation that arises before the court.”“American law does not permit the use of foreign law or international law to interpret the Constitution. That’s a given, and my speech explained that, as you noted, explicitly. There is no debate on that question. There’s no issue about that question. ... The question of use of foreign law, then, is different than considering the ideas that it may, on an academic level, provide.”The Kelo v. New London case, in which the Supreme Court decided that the government can take property for private development rather than a traditional public use like schools and roads “is now a precedent of the court. I must follow it. I am bound by a circuit — a Supreme Court decision, as a Second Circuit judge. As a Supreme Court judge, I must give it the deference that the doctrine of stare decisis would suggest. The question of the reach of Kelo has to be examined in the context of each situation. And the court did in Kelo note that there was a role for the courts to play in ensuring that takings by a state did in fact intend to serve the public — a public purpose and public use.”“In all of the situations, once you’ve looked at what Congress has done or not done, you then are directed to look at what the president’s powers may be under the Constitution minus whatever powers Congress has in that area. So the whole exercise is really, in terms of Congress and the executive, an exercise of the two working together. And in fact, that’s the basic structure of our system of government. That’s why the Congress makes the laws; the president can veto them, but he can’t make them.”In United States v. Lopez, “and in some of its subsequent cases, the court was examining, as I mentioned, a wide variety of factors. They included whether the activity that the government was attempting to regulate was economic or non-economic; whether it was an area in which states traditionally regulated; whether the statute at issue had an interstate commerce provision as an element of the crime; and then considered whether there was a substantial effect on commerce. It looked at the Congressional findings on that last element, the court did, and determined that there weren’t enough in the confluence of factors that it was looking at to find that that particular statute was within Congress’s powers. That’s the basic approach it has used to other statutes it has looked at.”'"
"'09-07-16,'1','LOS ANGELES  And the Oscar for the best animated short film goes to ... an Internet community?That teaser, posted last fall on Facebook by the upstart company Mass Animation, kicked off a project many people in Hollywood thought was laughable: making a five-minute animated film using the Wikipedia model, with animators from around the world contributing shots, and Facebook users voting on their favorites.But it worked. The completed short, “Live Music,” has been deemed of high enough quality by Sony Pictures Entertainment to warrant a theatrical run. Sony will bring the tale of star-crossed love involving an electric guitar and a violin to the multiplex masses on Nov. 20 as an opener for its “Planet 51” animated feature. “Social networks can operate like automated talent scouts, helping the cream rise more quickly to the top, and that’s what happened with ‘Live Music,’ ” said Michael Lynton, chairman and chief executive of Sony’s entertainment division. “While creativity has been pretty evenly distributed in society, it hasn’t always been easy to tap into.”Few actually expect “Live Music” to win an Academy Award or even be nominated for one. But even Pixar started somewhere, and Sony’s enthusiasm for the short underscores the potential power of social networking in creating high-quality content.The marketplace  advertising, gaming and, of course, Hollywood  is hungry for content, animated in particular, that is done in a faster, cheaper way. “Live Music” was made for about $1 million and took about six months to complete. Intel, hoping to peddle its new Core i7 processor to animation geeks, was the principal backer. The finished film is made up of scenes submitted by 51 people, who received $500 per scene and a film credit for their efforts.Yair Landau, the founder of Mass Animation (and a former digital and animation executive at Sony, where he oversaw production of the movie “Surf’s Up”), said he hoped “Live Music” was just the tip of this iceberg. His goal is to produce a feature-length film in the same manner, essentially pushing the heavy lifting off on a crowd.“I certainly see this as a step in the democratization of creative storytelling in Hollywood,” Mr. Landau said. “But my aim was primarily to prove that you could bring a group of people together on the Internet and create good work.”Mass Animation is just one of several entertainment companies working the “crowdsourcing” angle. Perhaps the largest is Aniboom, which was founded in 2006 by the Israeli media mogul Uri Shinar and bills itself as a Web-based animation studio. Aniboom has built a global team of nearly 8,000 animators who have uploaded more than 13,000 clips into Aniboom’s library.Mr. Shinar plans to pitch the best submissions to television networks as potential series and movie studios as possible features. (The creators retain some ownership rights.) Aniboom is showing big potential, signing a flurry of deals in recent months. Aniboom and the Fox television network, for instance, recently announced a project similar to “Live Music” that involves animators competing to create a new holiday special.“We’re proving in small steps that without any physical studio you can create professional content,” Mr. Shinar said. Aniboom ran the “Live Music” competition for Mass Animation and provided technology infrastructure.Mr. Landau, a former investment banker whom Sony credits with securing the film rights to “Spider-Man,” has always been an early adopter. At Sony he was an advocate for multiplayer online games before they broke into the public consciousness, and developed a downloadable movie service before online piracy became entrenched.He left Sony in spring 2008, partly because of a desire to move on after two decades at the studio but also because of an internal shakeup. To create the “Live Music” project, he first approached Matt Jacobson, a friend at Facebook who works on market development, who in turn introduced him to executives at Intel. (“We seized the opportunity to be involved with a project on the cutting edge of social media,” said John Cooney, Intel’s online programs manager.)Using Facebook, Mass Animation invited animation enthusiasts  from total amateurs to professionals working in their spare time  to compete to create individual shots for the short. Mass Animation provided downloadable Maya software, the story and a soundtrack. The company also rendered the first scene to set the style and look. Mr. Landau then worked with the winners to smooth their creations into a cohesive whole.In the end 57,000 people from 101 countries became “fans” of the Mass Animation page on Facebook and about 17,000 downloaded the software application, Mr. Landau said. The 51 winning animators hail from 17 countries, including Kazakhstan and Colombia. Eleven are women  the Hollywood animation mines are staffed almost entirely by men  and the group ranges in age from 14 to 48.Mr. Jacobson called aspects of the project “fiendishly complicated” but said Facebook now wanted to work with Mass Animation on more ambitious ideas, perhaps even the dream of a full-blown feature film. “We didn’t know if we could do it, but we decided to take the chance and couldn’t be more pleased with how it turned out,” he said.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Bello Nock, the star clown with the vertical red hair who left the Big Apple Circus in 2000 to become the big-top headliner at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus for eight years, will return to the one-ring Big Apple tent at Lincoln Center on Oct. 24 for a yearlong tour. Mr. Nock, below, the 40-year-old daredevil who was last seen in New York two years ago in a Ringling show bouncing off the Wheel of Death in his trademark 8-inch-high flattop, tuxedo, white gloves and spats, promises “high falls, bungee-ing and trampolining,” he said. Mr. Nock previously starred at Big Apple during the 1998, 1999 and 2000 seasons.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','But more on that lost club later. Players leave the eighth green and walk on a narrow gravel path, which ascends toward what appears to be the edge of something steep.A crescent of beach appears on the left along with a piece of driftwood shaped like a massive, prehistoric antler. At the top of the rise, there is, surprisingly, no abyss. Instead, there is only the round’s best view yet of the lighthouse and of Ailsa Craig, the helmet-shaped island that is the rough Scottish equivalent of Uluru, Australia’s massive red rock, in its monolithic presence on the horizon.Beyond the gravel and the sponsors’ clock sits the isolated rectangle of the ninth tee box and one of the best panoramas in sports.It is the place for all those whose idea of a golf course relies heavily on Pebble Beach. The place where it is easy for a golfer to forget, just for a moment, about the challenge at hand as the eyes track the Isle of Arran, the rugged coastline, the tide pools and the whitewash and mustard yellow of the lighthouse tower.In truth, this tee — perched on its rocky ledge — feels a bit flashy for a British Open, but it is not as if they have added any cliffs or dyed the ocean blue. In fact, No. 9 is one of the few holes not altered in some way for this championship. It remains authentic, scenic Scotland, and if this great walk is not to be spoiled, the tee shot on this par 4 will eventually have to be struck.According to Brown, it is about 200 yards uphill to safety and precisely 228 yards to the marker stone that stands on immovable watch in the elevated fairway. But with no ability from the tee to see beyond that and no prayer of seeing the distant target of the green, the marker looks quite a bit farther away than 228 yards.Brown recalls playing the hole in the 1990s with a friend who had spent much of the front nine extolling the virtues of the fancy new driver he had just brought back from the United States.“It started to rain, and we had a really strong southerly wind, and the club slipped in his hand as he swung and went into the air, twirled around and went into the ocean,” Brown said. “It was high tide, and all you saw was the shaft going down. He’d been raving about the driver for seven or eight holes. He was almost in tears, and you’re trying really hard not to laugh.”Regular club members get to use the championship tee box only once a year, during their annual medal competition. “The average hotel guest, with the wind blowing, it’s too much; they could end up losing two or three balls,” Brown said. “If we have scratch handicappers or pros, we’ll let them have a go. If you get a headwind, even a very good golfer has a job getting to the fairway.”But if there is no headwind, the scenic drive on this 449-yard hole should not be a problem for men good enough to play in the Open. “If there’s a backwind, it’s a 3-wood and a 9-iron for most of them,” Brown said. “Some of the boys are only 50 to 70 yards from the green after their tee shots.”Even so, it is best not to miss the fairway right, because the rough is particularly thick and high this year. But the Open competitors do have it easier than Turnberry’s regular customers in one respect. For the tournament, the granite marker in the middle of the fairway has been wrapped in foam padding and covered with dark green fabric.“I tell our American visitors, it gets cold in Scotland, and we have to cover it up at night,” Brown said with a chuckle, explaining that the real reason is to avert an unfair ricochet after a straight and true tee shot.“So we get the rough deal, and the pros get the wonderful, soft stuff,” said Campbell Cook, a member of Turnberry Golf Club, pushing his fingers into the foam.Cook, a gregarious 68-year-old who lives in nearby Ayr, was walking the Ailsa course with his camera last week, snapping photographs from the elevated vantage points provided by the temporary grandstands.It is a mixed blessing for a familiar playground to become an international focal point. It is a thrill to see it in pristine condition, and it should be pristine considering that the course has been essentially closed for ameliorations and preparations since November.Yet it is a concern to know that golfers from all over, inspired by television images of the ninth and the rest of Turnberry’s coastal stretch, will be making the pilgrimage here over the months to come and that they may drive up the costs of membership.“It’s a nuisance really,” Cook said. “I’d be happy if the Open hadn’t come. I know a lot of the members think it’s wonderful, but it will be so busy next year, and we’ve also lost eight months. But that said, there’s a nice buzz about it, and it’s quite interesting to see how Tiger Woods plays it and others, too.”The ninth is the only hole on this newly fortified course that still does not contain a bunker. But the fairway, known as a hog’s back because of its slightly rounded shape, still has some protection, as does the green with its runoffs and nasty rough to the right.Despite all the beauty and the quirks on the ninth, Brown, who will retire after the Open, actually prefers the redesigned 10th hole. It now has a dogleg and a new tee that provides an opportunity to see not only the sea but also the distant green.“I like to think the 10th will become our new signature hole,” Brown said.Either way, Turnberry has been a fine place to work for 23 years. “Quite an office,” he said.Quite an ocean view, too.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Weeks after his death Michael Jackson’s record sales continue to soar.From July 6 to 12, the second full week of sales since Mr. Jackson died, his solo albums sold 1.1 million copies in the United States, a 37 percent jump from the week before, Nielsen SoundScan reported. Almost 1.9 million tracks, separate from albums, were sold as digital downloads.Sales were spurred by the Jackson memorial service in Los Angeles on July 7, which had a television audience of more than 31 million. Still, the numbers are extraordinary. In the two and a half weeks following Mr. Jackson’s death on June 25 his fans snapped up 2.3 million albums — 17 percent more than in 2007 and 2008 combined.For the third week Mr. Jackson’s “Number Ones” (Epic) was the best-selling album in the country, moving 349,000 copies. “Thriller” (Epic) sales rose 144 percent last week, to 264,000. But most Jackson titles are ineligible for the Billboard 200, the standard album chart, since they are more than 18 months old. Instead they dominate that magazine’s catalog chart, where the Top 12 slots this week are all Jackson-related. (Last week Motown released a new collection of early Jackson tunes, “The Stripped Mixes”; it reached No. 95 on the Billboard 200, with a little less than 5,000 in sales.)In the last few weeks the purchasing habits of Mr. Jackson’s fans have shifted from downloads to physical CDs. In the week that ended June 28, 57 percent of Mr. Jackson’s album sales were downloads, an extremely high proportion. The next week the ratio was 18 percent, and last week it fell to 10 percent; so far in 2009 downloads account for about 23 percent of album sales for all artists.The fans’ move to CDs might partly be attributed to retailers’ supply of physical product. J&R Music World in Manhattan typically has a six- to eight-week stock of Jackson albums, but that was exhausted less than 24 hours after his death, said Sue Bryan, the manager of the store’s music and video division.But Mr. Jackson’s record companies — mainly Sony Music Entertainment, which issues the bulk of his solo material — rushed to replenish the supply, and most stores now carry a wide selection of titles, satisfying demand not just for music but for tangible mementos, too.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','PARIS — The French lower house narrowly approved draft legislation on Wednesday that would further loosen rules — cherished by many traditionalists — that restrict commercial activity on Sundays.The bill would allow stores to open Sundays in commercial hubs in Paris, Lille and Marseille, as well as in about 500 tourist areas elsewhere.The center-right government of President Nicolas Sarkozy hopes that shedding the restrictions will help to stimulate spending, lift earnings and create jobs. One of his campaign slogans in 2007 was to allow French people to work more to earn more.The lower house approved the law 282 to 238. Mr. Sarkozy’s governing coalition voted broadly in favor, with Socialists and Greens opposed. It will be debated in the Senate next week.If it passes, it still may have to go before the Constitutional Council because of possible implications for the equality of employees.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Mr. Kadyrov released a statement on Wednesday night saying he would “spare no expense” to find her killers. He said he believed that the murder aimed to divert law enforcement attention from counterterrorism operations and was carried out by “forces that are incapable of coming to terms with the fact that in the Chechen Republic, military actions have ended and peace has arrived,” according to the Ria Novosti news agency.The killing presents a double challenge to the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who took office last year promising to restore the rule of law. Brazen attacks on journalists and human rights workers have continued, and no killer has yet been brought to justice, even in celebrated cases, notably that of Anna Politkovskaya, the Russian investigative journalist, who also worked to uncover abuses in Chechnya before she was shot to death in October 2006. The following year, Ms. Estemirova won an award named for Ms. Politkovskaya.He also faces a rising tide of violence in the north Caucasus, where the Kremlin has relied on Mr. Kadyrov to stamp out separatist violence. Mr. Kadyrov has virtually eliminated the insurgency, but advocates like Ms. Estemirova have said his regime uses brutal tactics, among them abduction and torture.Thomas Hammarberg, human rights commissioner for the Council of Europe, said her killing “begs for a very determined and effective response” from Russian authorities.“If this case is not clarified, it will have a detrimental effect on human rights work in Russia,” he said. “It is imperative that this is given the highest priority by the prosecutor, and that the investigation starts immediately.”Mr. Medvedev released a statement through his press secretary condemning the murder, and saying that “unfortunately, it is apparent that this premeditated murder may be related to Natalya Estemirova’s human rights activities.”Ms. Estemirova stood out, in the small circle of human rights activists focusing on Chechnya, because she chose to remain in her hometown of Grozny, living in a two-room apartment that was never fully repaired after the war. Her home — beset by cutoffs of water and electricity — became a sort of guest house for visiting human rights workers and journalists, said Shakhman A. Akhbulatov, who worked with her at Memorial.“She was a very strict, direct, open person,” Mr. Akhbulatov said. “She didn’t know any compromises. If she felt she was right, she stood on her position. That was her character.”Especially in recent years, when the threats became graver and more frequent, she was torn because of one concern: her daughter, Lana, now 15, whom she was raising alone, he said.“She put everything into her daughter,” Mr. Akhbulatov said, who spoke by telephone from Grozny, where people could be heard crying in the background. “On the other hand, she could not quit this work. She was burning up with this work.”Grozny had become increasingly forbidding for Ms. Estemirova. Three months ago, she was interrogated for hours at the Chechnya Interior Ministry, an experience that worried her so much that her organization, Memorial, reported it to the Council of Europe, Mr. Hammarberg said.“It was a case when at least she herself was feeling that she was under threat,” Mr. Hammarberg said. “She interpreted this as meaning some groups had their eyes on her.”This month, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechnya’s government-backed human rights ombudsman, railed publicly against Western and Russian human rights groups, including Memorial, calling them tools of Russia’s enemies.“There is a perception that they need an unstable and violent Chechnya like they need air,” Mr. Nukhaziyev said, in a posting on his Web site.Ms. Estemirova’s is the latest violent death within the close-knit community of activists in Chechnya. She had collaborated with Ms. Politkovskaya and Stanislav Markelov, a young lawyer who often represented the victims in Ms. Politkovskaya’s investigations. Mr. Markelov was killed in January as he left a news conference in Moscow.Officials in Moscow announced this spring an end to Russia’s counterterrorism operation in Chechnya, saying stability had returned after nearly two decades of war and internecine fighting. But violence remains commonplace, with frequent shootouts between the police and a weakened, but still potent, separatist movement. Kidnappings, too, are common.Memorial has documented 50 kidnappings in Chechnya since January, said Usam Baisayev, a colleague of Ms. Estemirova’s. At least four of the victims have been found dead.Mr. Baisayev said that separatist fighters were to blame for some of the kidnappings, but that he believed that government-backed agents of the police and the armed forces were responsible for most of them.Ms. Estemirova described the mechanics of disappearances during an interview with the New York Times in April 2008. She was chain-smoking, with dark rings under her eyes, but also boisterous and funny, eager to get the story out. She said abductions had become a pervasive tactic as the insurgency waned and the Russian Army handed the brunt of the security work over to local militias.“Armed people come, in uniforms, and put them in cars,” she said, describing a typical abduction. “People never understand they are the security forces. These people come back beaten, but are quiet and never speak out.“We know people disappeared,” she said. “We know people were killed. And we know we need to look for them with a shovel.”'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Coming on the heels of the huge profit reported at Goldman Sachs, the Intel announcement sent a strong signal to investors, who had greeted the week of heavyweight earnings with caution after a month of market losses and ambiguous economic indicators.Shares of Intel rose 7.3 percent, while its rival Advanced Micro Devices gained 8.7 percent on the positive signs for computer demand. Among other technology companies, Alcatel-Lucent rose 13.4 percent.“In Goldman Sachs and Intel, you’ve got the 600-pound gorillas in the room,” said Tim Smalls, head of United States stock trading at Execution in Greenwich, Conn.Strong performances from the sterling names during difficult circumstances will not necessarily reassure investors, who for weeks have been questioning whether the overall economy is improving, Mr. Smalls said. “We have to watch to see if there is this trickle-down effect,” he said. “If the financials coming up this week and next can show some positive earnings growth and put a positive spin on it, I think that will lessen some of the fears.”The stock market mostly shrugged off a report from the Labor Department that showed the Consumer Price Index rising 0.7 percent in June as a result of higher gasoline prices. Oil prices have been trending downward, and economists expect that consumer prices this month will not be affected nearly as much by energy costs.Oil prices rose Wednesday after falling sharply earlier in the month. Crude oil for August delivery rose $2.02, to settle at $61.54 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but that price was still more than $10 below the levels reached last month. Analysts said businesses had shed fuel inventories to the point that demand was expected to pick up again, and a report on Wednesday showed a bigger-than-expected drop in inventories.Market sentiment was similarly upbeat in Europe and Asia.In Britain, the FTSE 100 index gained 2.6 percent, while Germany’s DAX index rose 3.1 percent. The CAC-40 in France picked up 2.9 percent.The Japanese Nikkei 225 stock average and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index both showed gains.'"
"'09-07-16,'1','Consumer prices rose in June at their quickest rate since last summer as gasoline claimed a larger portion of family budgets while real incomes fell. The trend poses a challenge to Washington policy makers who are hoping for household spending to lead an economic rebound.The Labor Department said Wednesday that its Consumer Price Index climbed 0.7 percent last month from May, slightly more than the 0.6 percent increase expected by economists. The index’s core rate, which excludes energy and food prices, also accelerated quicker than expected, to 0.2 percent.A separate Labor Department report released Wednesday said that American wages, adjusted for inflation, fell 1.2 percent in June, a period when unemployment rose to 9.5 percent.From the larger economic perspective, analysts say the price figures are not alarming. Fears of broad-based inflation are not likely to be set off now, after economists anticipated that a month of roller-coaster trading in the oil markets might skew the June index.“The C.P.I. is not much of a story this month,” said Mickey Levy, the Bank of America’s chief economist. “The core is just moving sideways, and then you have the upward pressure on energy and gas prices.”But for families across the country that have cut back spending, a 17.3 percent jump in gasoline prices in June further pinched pocketbooks. A retail sales report on Tuesday said that clothing and food spending stayed mostly flat last month.'"

"'09-07-17,'1','The only objection we have to Pet Airways, the new airline devoted just to pets, is the fact that we can’t book space on it ourselves.Think of it: separate compartments — dog crates, that is — with plenty of room to stretch out, flight attendants, a pet lounge, escort from check-in to the plane and preboarding walks. We wouldn’t recommend it for business travelers. The trip from New York to Los Angeles — $250 one way — does take about 24 hours. But that includes dinner, play time and a sleepover in Chicago. No security hassles, no in-flight movies, just the luxury of one’s doggie dreams in one’s private cabin.Yes, Pet Airways is yet another stage in the humanizing of our pets, a process that has resulted in, among other things, Rachael Ray pet food and animal health care and lifestyles beyond the means of most of the humans on this planet.We worry, too, that as the transportation needs of pets increase — quite separately from our own — it will mean, of course, a new load of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. On the other hand, would business and diplomacy be handled so much worse if we sent our dogs as proxies to negotiate on our behalf?The immediate overbooked success of Pet Airways suggests a growing intolerance for the sometimes haphazard care of pets on the national airlines. If Pet Airways succeeds, there may be an economic lesson as well for the foundering human airlines. If we had less stress at the airport and dinner on board, we, too, would feel a lot happier about flying.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Delphi, the long-struggling auto parts maker, has reached a deal with its lenders and onetime parent General Motors over a new plan that would lift the company out of bankruptcy, people briefed on the matter say.The accord was struck early Thursday, ahead of a Friday deadline for a bid from the lenders. It supersedes a deal that Delphi and G.M. had reached with Platinum Equity, a private equity firm that had agreed to take over the bulk of the supplier’s business. It would also conclude a bruising legal battle between the company and its lenders.If approved by the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, the agreement would bring an end to Delphi’s nearly four years of Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Even as G.M. and Chrysler completed their government-sponsored restructuring plans ahead of schedule, Delphi, which still counts G.M. as a major customer, continued to languish in Chapter 11.Under the terms of the deal, Delphi’s debtors-in-possession lenders — whose financing let Delphi operate while in Chapter 11 — would forgive the $3.5 billion they are owed in exchange for taking over the majority of the company, one of these people said. G.M. would pay about $3.5 billion to take back four North American factories and Delphi’s steering business, including $1.75 billion to finance Delphi's ongoing operations. The lenders would bring in a team of turnaround professionals and former Delphi executives to oversee the supplier’s restructuring and operations.The lenders and G.M. would share distributions from asset sales or a public offering of stock, with the lenders expected to reinvest most of the money they would receive in Delphi.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','BEFORE my arrival in the White House in April, I was not well known to the American people. Perhaps understandably, I was greeted with some suspicion. “Portuguese water dog” has a foreign sound to it. My hair covers my eyes, which can create the impression that I am not trustworthy. From the first, I took it upon myself not only to illustrate my own belief in clear thinking and accountability, but to give the American people a sense of what their lives would be like during my time in the White House. As I approach the milestone of my first 100 days in office, I want to reiterate some of my basic convictions.Historically, my breed is used to herd fish in shallows or carry messages from ships to the nearby shore, and I have tried to show the American people that I will continue that tradition, both leading (the fish) and communicating (the messages). I have succeeded more than I have failed, but there have been lapses. Remember when I bit that reporter’s microphone? I had a sudden urge to get that thing. I thought it was a fish. Even thinking about it now makes me jumpy. Another time the president almost tripped over my leash, and even though that wasn’t technically my fault, I take full responsibility.My time in the White House thus far has had one driving theme: we all share the same world. There have been those who have criticized my willingness to sniff in an exploratory manner around hostile breeds from foreign lands. But remember, we are all one species, from the tiniest Chihuahua to the mightiest mastiff. I have tried to practice this openness closer to home as well, by spending more time with Joe Biden’s German shepherd puppy, despite our considerable difference in temperament and bite force.The press likes to play a game where it compares my record with that of other presidential pets. I find that premature and unhelpful. Other presidential pets came to power in different times, and faced different challenges.Still, I would like to remark briefly upon the pet to whom I am most often compared. Fala came to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in November 1940, and quickly captured the national imagination. But Fala lived in a time when there was an understanding between the press and politicians, and many of his peccadilloes (his habit of eating garbage, his eye for the ladies) were simply overlooked.By comparison, consider the way that the news media scrutinized Buddy, the Clintons’ Labrador. Before his untimely death by car accident in 2002, Buddy was persistently maligned by rumors that he did not get along with Socks the cat, as if that were his fault. (Cats, need I remind you, are jerks.)'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Russia’s new nuclear-capable Bulava missile has failed again, the Defense Ministry said Thursday, the Ria Novosti news agency reported. The missile, which Russian officials have said would be among the world’s most advanced weapons, was test-launched from a submarine in the White Sea on Wednesday and blew up after a first-stage malfunction, the ministry was quoted as saying. Out of 11 tests, fewer than half have been at least partly successful. The ministry said it would create a panel to investigate the new failure.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Indeed, Judge Sotomayor exposed little of her thought processes about interpreting the Constitution and statutes, and avoided saying what she really thought about the most pressing issues likely to come before the Supreme Court.Instead, she parried questions by describing precedents while declining to weigh in on unsettled legal questions, by saying she had to keep an open mind about potential future cases, and by almost mechanically reciting basic propositions with a controlled and deliberate delivery.“By an open mind, I mean a judge who looks at the facts of each case, listens and understands the arguments of the parties, and applies the law as the law commands,” she said. “It’s a refrain I keep repeating because that is my philosophy of judging: applying the law to the facts at hand.”Some observers thought they detected her tipping her hand on abortion rights when she said Supreme Court precedents required abortion restrictions to make exceptions for a woman’s health. That proposition was called into question by a 2007 ruling that upheld a ban on a late-term procedure even though it had no health exception.But that glimpse, if it was one, was the exception. On most issues — gun rights, the death penalty, campaign finance restrictions, the scope of presidential and Congressional power, property rights and affirmative action — she simply described precedents until she had talked for a while, and then stopped and waited for the next question.The performance left some observers seeking meaning in the hearing’s absence of meaning. Sanford Levinson, a law professor at the University of Texas, said her approach might carry over into how she would behave as a Supreme Court justice.“Frankly,” Professor Levinson said, “I’d be more than a bit surprised if she became one of its intellectual leaders on the court inasmuch as she’s been revealed as a basically cautious person.”Indeed, if anything emerged about Judge Sotomayor from the hearing, it was about her personality. In May, an article in The New Republic quoted anonymous lawyers who described her manner on the bench as hot-tempered, and similar articles followed.But that characterization was called into question by Judge Sotomayor’s performance. Despite being questioned aggressively at times, she never got flustered or upset, remaining polite throughout three days of questioning.“She was disciplined and good humored,” said Jeffrey Rosen, the author of The New Republic piece.Supreme Court hearings have not always been so unremarkable. But nominees began to shut down after 1987, when Democrats rejected the nomination of Judge Robert Bork after he engaged in an assertive defense of his conservative legal philosophy rather than denying that he had one.By 1993, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — while expressing explicit support for abortion rights — vowed to make “no hints, no forecasts, no previews” in her hearing about how she might approach future cases. That approach was increasingly adopted by the nominees who followed her — all of whom, like Justice Ginsburg, faced a Senate controlled by the same party as the president who had picked them. A dozen years later, in an increasingly polarized political climate, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was even more cautious — pledging humility while evading questions about abortion rights by describing precedents and calling them worthy of respect under the doctrine of stare decisis.Now, Judge Sotomayor, too, has followed that script: avoiding saying concrete things, while soothingly telling Republican senators what they wanted to hear on more ephemeral matters.She distanced herself from President Obama’s claim that judicial “empathy” plays a role in deciding tough cases. She rejected the idea that the Constitution is a living document, saying instead that it was “immutable” except through amendment.“I think I’m listening to Judge Roberts,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina. “I’m, you know, listening to a strict constructionist here.”And, when Republicans raised a 2001 speech in which she suggested that the law was sometimes indeterminate and so judges’ life experiences inevitably shaped legal outcomes — and that a “wise Latina” judge would more often than not render better decisions than a white male — she disavowed her words.The “wise Latina” line was a “rhetorical flourish that fell flat,” she said. And, pointing to her judicial record, she asserted that she based her rulings on the law and the facts, and never “my personal experiences or my feelings or my biases.”Mr. Tribe said it had now become a ritual for nominees “to say as much as you can without revealing anything.”“It’s not a criticism of Sotomayor,” he said. “I have found her, within that constrained model, very impressive, and I’m not at all doubtful about the wisdom of her nomination. But that’s only because I have a sense of her from her speeches, her biography and her long judicial record — and certainly not at all because of the well-rehearsed dance that senators and the nominee are now forced to perform.”'"
"'09-07-17,'1','CHICAGO — Two weeks into a new fiscal year, Illinois has settled on a budget, but many state officials acknowledged Thursday that it merely delays dealing with much of the state’s $9.2 billion deficit until later in the year.“It was a way to avoid a state shutdown and chaos,” said State Representative Tom Cross, a Republican. “But is it a good budget? No. It just delays the inevitable.”Gov. Patrick J. Quinn signed the $26 billion spending plan late Wednesday night after lawmakers agreed to solve part of the state’s expected shortfall by borrowing $3.5 billion to pay state worker pensions.The budget also cuts $1 billion in expenses, including laying off up to 2,600 state workers, and classifies another $1 billion as what state officials describe as a reserve fund, which will come from state agencies not spending some of their allocated money.The agreement was a rebuff to Mr. Quinn, a Democrat. He had wished to solve the shortfall by raising state income taxes by 50 percent, a notion that garnered some support from State Senate Democrats in the spring but was rejected by members of the State House. Democrats have majorities in both chambers.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','As the study got under way, conservators set about cleaning the painting. Once they had removed the varnish, they were able to examine tiny cross sections of paint. They could see outlines of figures beneath the painting’s surface that they then compared with photographs taken at different times in 1913 showing how the painting was changing.Scientists, conservators and curators could also see that beneath the painting’s top layer there was a palette similar to that of the two paintings at the Hermitage and “Dance” at MoMA. And by using infrared technology and X-rays they discovered different palettes under the surface. “Once the varnish came off ‘Bathers’ we could see bright reds and blues,” Mr. Elderfield said. “So we encouraged other museums to take the varnish off their Matisses too, so that it would be clearer what the surface color of these paintings really were.”“The popular view of Matisse is still that he is an artist of color and light and hedonism,” Mr. Elderfield said. “And this Matisse, the one between 1913 and 1917, is a different artist. He’s more austere, more anxious, more radical in many ways than the artist he popularly became. It was during this amazing five-year period that he became the artist of geometry and synthesis.”Not only has this new study of “Bathers” revealed much about the artist’s methods — how he painted and repainted a canvas — but Ms. D’Alessandro and Mr. Elderfield also found unexpected connections between that work and several others, particularly two in MoMA’s collection, “The Moroccans,” from 1915-16, and “The Piano Lesson” from 1916.In the case of “The Moroccans” Mr. Elderfield said that it was long thought to have been painted in 1915-16, but during a recent trip to Issy-les-Moulineaux, a Paris suburb where Matisse’s family archives are stored, Ms. D’Alessandro and Mr. Elderfield unearthed letters indicating he first conceived of the painting in 1912 on one of two visits to Morocco, where he made sketches for it. But he didn’t start painting it until years later.Because there is a connection in style and technique to “Bathers” and “The Moroccans” and because a letter about “The Moroccans” refers to a beach, for a while historians thought that perhaps the two canvases had been one, or that maybe Matisse had started “Bathers” and changed it into the painting we know as “The Moroccans” today.“But in fact he hadn’t,” Mr. Elderfield said, adding later: “The discovery of the photographs of Matisse working on ‘Bathers” in early 1913 at the same time as him writing about having frustrations about ‘The Moroccans’ made it clear the two projects were separate.” And while much has been learned from this recent study, there are still many unanswered questions, like whether Matisse made more paintings in 1915 than we know about or whether some are wrongly dated.“It’s like a continuing detective story without an ending,” Mr. Elderfield said.In 1874, when Mussorgsky wrote his piano suite “Pictures at an Exhibition,” he took his inspiration from a show in St. Petersburg, Russia, of drawings and watercolors by a friend, the artist and architect Victor Hartmann, who had died a year earlier.Now Mussorgsky’s music is inspiring a collaboration involving art. Robin Rhode, the South African-born artist, and Leif Ove Andsnes, the Norwegian pianist, have joined forces, pairing this beloved composition with a visual component that includes a video and six abstract paintings. The result — “Pictures Reframed” — will be performed at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center on Nov. 13 and 14 before going on tour.“The music can stand on its own,” Mr. Andsnes said. “I’ve played it a lot, but I wanted to explore different ways of presenting a recital.” So he approached Jane Moss, vice president for programming at Lincoln Center, about the possibility of working with a video artist.After some research Ms. Moss suggested that Mr. Andsnes contact Mr. Rhode because she knew the artist was open to different kinds of collaborations.Mr. Rhode and Mr. Andsnes began meeting in September 2007 in different places: a derelict factory in Berlin, where Mr. Rhode started to draw on a bare wall, and in Norway, where Mr. Andsnes performed the piece in an abandoned shipyard with water flooding the piano as part of the narrative (a theme explored in Mr. Rhode’s video projection).Mr. Rhode ended up creating a 35-minute video that unfolds in chapters, similar to the structure of the composition and the works in the St. Petersburg show.“Each drawing that inspired Mussorgsky was my starting point,” Mr. Rhode said. After research, he said, he learned that a lot of Hartmann’s works were actually reflections on his social consciousness. One drawing, “Bydlo,” which is also the title of a movement in Mussorgsky’s suite, shows a Polish ox cart in a Jewish slum. “It’s a symbol of the struggling of Polish people in 19th-century Russia,” he said.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','LAS VEGAS — Like buzzards circling a dying animal, Nevada business leaders gleefully mocked the California budget crisis on Thursday and crowed about the opportunities it offered their state to poach companies from its ailing neighbor.The president of the nonprofit Nevada Development Authority, A. Somer Hollingsworth, donned a tinfoil hat for part of a speech in which he told local business executives and politicians that California’s excessive government had led to its near-bankruptcy.“Nobody’s really working there — everybody’s a recipient of some kind of state program,” said Mr. Hollingsworth, whose organization’s mission is recruiting companies to the Las Vegas area and whose talk was entitled, “California Has Lost Its Mind and Las Vegas Is Providing Psychoanalysis.”After reciting Nevada’s favorable attributes — no personal or corporate income tax, lower sales taxes than in California — he asked, “Why would you not move?”California faces a $26.3 billion budget shortfall for which lawmakers have no solution, so the state has been forced to issue more than 91,000 i.o.u.’s worth more than $350 million to its employees in lieu of paychecks. Banks there have said they will not honor them after Friday.Mr. Hollingsworth made fun of several fees and taxes proposed by California lawmakers, like a $50-an-ounce tariff for recreational marijuana. “Whatever happened to a nickel bag, huh?” he said to laughter.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Georgeson, a proxy solicitation firm, issued a report to clients this week advising that they plan for what they will do if no one wins a director’s election.The rule that will take effect on Jan. 1 says that brokers holding customers’ shares may no longer vote those shares in director elections without instructions from the actual shareholder. In the past, such broker discretionary votes sometimes made the difference in allowing directors to win re-election.Brokers can still cast votes on other matters, such as approving the choice of auditors, so a quorum may be present for a shareholder meeting even if there are few votes cast in a board election. In such cases, the voting power of those who do bother to vote would be amplified.It used to be that such votes were irrelevant, since it did not matter how many votes were cast for a director running unopposed.But most major companies now provide that a director must win the votes of at least half the shares voted. If a majority of votes are withheld from a nominee, he or she is expected to leave the board.The commission also is expected to approve, in time for next spring’s proxy season, a rule that would allow a substantial shareholder to propose nominees to run for a minority of board seats. Anyone can do that now, but proxy fights are expensive, requiring dissidents to send out their own ballots. This proposal would allow a shareholder, or group of shareholders, who had owned 1 percent of a company’s stock for at least one year, to propose candidates that would appear on the ballots sent out by the company.Companies opposed to such a rule — and there are many — voice fears that shareholders with interests contrary to those of other shareholders will abuse the process, and say the prospect of a contested election could keep some qualified people from agreeing to join boards. Those companies are now asking for a delay in commission consideration of the rule, by extending the time for public comments past the current Aug. 17 deadline.The details could be changed, perhaps to require a longer stock holding period, but it appears the S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary Schapiro, and the other two Democrats on the commission will vote for such a rule.One reason proxy access is likely to pass now is widespread discontent with the jobs done by many corporate boards. But there is no guarantee that institutional shareholders will always propose wise courses of action, nor that all of them will show integrity. Some institutions were vocal proponents of share buybacks at companies that, in retrospect, would have been better off using the money to pay down debt. The New York attorney general is investigating payments made by money managers to win some of that state’s pension business.“A big stockholder with interests at odds with that of the other stockholders will privately inform board members what it wants,” said Brian Cartwright, who was general counsel of the S.E.C. under the previous chairman, Christopher Cox. “The board will understand that to stiff the stockholder risks a proxy fight, perhaps ostensibly based on concerns not at all related to the stockholder’s demands. Directors who don’t want a proxy fight will quietly go along.”Mr. Cartwright said he still favored proxy access, but “the S.E.C. should require full and fair disclosure when such conflicted behind-the-scenes deals take place.”Even if you agree, devising such a rule is not easy. When Mr. Cartwright was at the S.E.C. in 2007, one proxy proposal considered by the commission said that if a shareholder sought proxy access, disclosure of communications between the company and that shareholder over the last year would need to be disclosed. That proposal was never acted on, and the current S.E.C. proposal has no similar provision.In any case, the greatest threat will not come from contested director elections, where an obviously conflicted candidate would presumably have little chance of winning, but from deals made by companies to avoid such a fight. It might be easy to evade a rule requiring companies to disclose actions taken to ward off a contested election, but such a rule could keep some such deals from being made behind closed doors.Such private deals already take place, as companies compromise on some issues to avoid shareholder resolutions being proposed. “The elimination of the broker discretionary vote magnifies the already considerable pressure on boards,” Georgeson said in its report. “Therefore, it is critical for companies to re-evaluate their position on a wide array of governance issues and practices” in order to “avoid either a failed director election or a high opposition vote that creates credibility and public relations problems at a time when strong corporate leadership is crucial.”It may be that companies are wise to make those changes, but other shareholders, who may not agree with the activist investors, should be able to understand what is going on.The S.E.C. should also look for ways to encourage individual investors to vote in corporate elections.Under Mr. Cox, the commission approved rules allowing companies to stop sending voluminous proxy materials to all shareholders, but instead to send out a notice telling how the materials could be found on the Internet, and offering to mail them if a shareholder called with such a request. That saved companies money, but it seems to have made it even easier for investors to ignore proxy materials, and voting by individual investors has declined at many companies. The commission has been quietly looking at ways to tweak that rule to increase voting.Raising the power of institutional shareholders may provide a welcome counterweight to entrenched managements and boards at some companies. But no one should assume such investors are always interested solely in the company’s welfare. Increased disclosure should go hand in hand with increased power.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Throughout the recession, New York City has appeared to be holding up better than the rest of the country. But by one important measure  the official unemployment rate  that is no longer true.In June, the city’s unemployment rate jumped to 9.5 percent, matching the national rate and suggesting that the city’s economy is still weakening a year and a half after the national recession began. The rate of joblessness in the city had not been as high in almost 12 years.In May, it was 8.9 percent, significantly lower than the national rate of 9.4 percent for that month.More than 380,000 people in the city were unable to find work last month, an increase of about 170,000 from a year before, according to data released by the State Department of Labor on Thursday. The last time so many city residents were unemployed was in the early 1990s, in the wake of the long, deep recession after the 1987 stock market crash, said James Brown, a Labor Department economist.The city’s unemployment rate was higher in 1997 than it is now, he said, but the overall job market was stronger then. Mr. Brown said that mounting job losses in financial services and other professional fields “suggest that the city’s economy will remain weak for the immediate future.”He said hiring was weak in June in construction and retailing, but it continued to rebound in leisure and hospitality businesses, in part because those have been attracting tourists by discounting heavily.Statewide, 854,000 people were unemployed in June, the highest number in the state since the department began keeping records 33 years ago. The state has now lost 235,900 jobs in the private sector since August, more than half of the 400,000 jobs that were added during the expansion that preceded this recession, said M. Patricia Smith, the state’s labor commissioner.The state’s unemployment rate remained below the national rate, but jumped to 8.7 percent in June from 8.2 percent in May. The Labor Department adjusts the rates for seasonal fluctuations.As usual, the recession is taking its greatest toll on less educated workers who were earning lower wages, Ms. Smith said at a news conference in Manhattan, where she and other officials announced $12.7 million in grants to train low-income workers for jobs in energy-saving construction techniques and health care.“Nearly half of all unemployed New Yorkers were earning less than $23,000,” Ms. Smith said.One trainee, Derek Wyatt, a single father from Harlem, exemplifies how tenuous the grip on a better-paying job can be. Mr. Wyatt, 31, said he had been earning high wages selling cars at a Dodge dealership in Brooklyn until it closed last fall. He has spent this year learning how to weatherize buildings through a state-funded Career Pathways program. Now, while waiting for his first construction job, he is making $10 an hour as a customer service representative at the Chelsea Piers recreational complex in Manhattan, he said.“You have to just cut back on your lifestyle,” Mr. Wyatt said.Rising unemployment is continuing to put a strain on the state’s unemployment insurance trust fund, which Ms. Smith described as “broke.” She said the state expected to borrow about $3 billion from the federal government this year to pay unemployment benefits, which have repeatedly been extended as the recession has worn on.The rise in New York’s unemployment rate in June prompted an additional extension of seven weeks of benefits for the long-term unemployed. Standard benefits last for 26 weeks, but New Yorkers can now collect for as long as 79 weeks.While the number of new claims for unemployment benefits has been falling nationally in recent weeks, it has risen sharply in New York in each of the last two weeks. More people filed new claims for unemployment benefits in New York last week than in any other state except California, according to data released on Thursday by the federal Department of Labor.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Q: Many conservatives I’ve talked to say they are feeling very isolated at this convention, and even railroaded.A: Progressives stayed around and in the Episcopal Church for 30, 40 years when we were the minority, and our voices weren’t heard, and we were pushed out. I think a lot of them have never felt what it felt like to be in the minority. A bunch of straight white guys are now sitting there and having that experience, which is something I think could be valuable for anyone to experience.Q: But conservatives have been saying for years that the Episcopal Church has been taken over by the liberals.A: The General Convention in 2003 might have looked like that to people, when there was the vote for my consent (to be consecrated as a bishop). The difference there is they were voting on a person. I had been so active in the church, it was really hard for them to say no. What happened yesterday (with the vote to move ahead on blessings for same-sex marriages) is they opened the way for people they don’t know, and that’s a new and significant thing. It felt much more theological and philosophical than being about an individual.Q: Going into this convention you said you had a lot of trepidation because you had recently been feeling a cold shoulder from your fellow bishops, and you anticipated that they were prepared to vote against the gay-related legislation. But on both key resolutions, your side prevailed. What happened?A: The most significant thing that happened was on Tuesday, after the House of Bishops stopped the debate on same-sex blessings and decided to have a smaller group of bishops meet to discuss it further. They said anyone could come, and it turned out it wasn’t a small group at all. There were 25 to 30 of us, and it turned out to be the most significant interaction I’ve had with the bishops since I’ve been elected.It was profound and it was inspiring. People stood up and spoke their own truth, both the pain and the joy. Everyone spoke honestly about what they needed to go home with, what they could live with and what they couldn’t.Q: So how do you explain the vote counts? The bishops passed both of these measures resoundingly, and we are starting to hear of many moderate-to-conservative bishops who voted “yes” on both ordinations and gay blessings.A: Everyone acknowledges they know where this is going, that gay marriage is becoming a reality. But we’re trying to bring our people along. One bishop said to me he voted “no” so he could go home and do this work, as he explained it, “so I can bring my people along.” He used the Nixon in China analogy. This was a bishop who voted “no” on my consent in 2003.Another bishop said that in his diocese he will never have to deal with gay marriage. I told him, you don’t know where this is going. Gay marriage could go to the Supreme Court, it could become the law of the land. Maybe part of your responsibility is to get your people ready for where the country is going.Also among the bishops, there was a real sympathy for those of us in jurisdictions who are faced with this new reality (ie. legalization of gay marriages or same-sex unions).Q: Do you think there will now be an exodus from the church.A: I think it will hold. Now that we’ve done the, quote, unthinkable, the church won’t look much different than before. Opponents of marriage equality predict the end of Western civilization as we know it if gay couples are allowed to marry. And then when it comes, there’s no big whoop.Q: I heard Bishop Bill Love of Albany yesterday saying how pained he was at these actions the church has taken, and the reporters at this news conference really pressed him on whether he would take his diocese out of the Episcopal Church and he said no — that that was not where he felt that God was leading them.A: Bill Love is a faithful Episcopalian, a man of integrity, and I respect him deeply. (Bishop) Edward Little (also a conservative), I would trust my life to him. He is the one I asked to intervene with (Archbishop of Canterbury) Rowan Williams when Rowan told me I could not go to Lambeth (the convention of Anglican bishops held last year in England).I think maybe that’s what people don’t get about the House of Bishops. We have longstanding relationships. We meet several times each year, at length, and relationships build over time. We have a commitment to hang in there with one another, though we have disagreements. The ones that did not have that commitment are gone. The conversation has been a lot less shrill this year because a lot of those shrill voices are gone. It’s given people permission to listen better.Q: So where do you expect to see the next openly gay bishop?A: There are two dioceses that are electing bishops soon, who I think are capable of electing a gay bishop. Minnesota is electing a diocesan bishop, and Los Angeles is electing two suffragan bishops (assistant bishops). But no diocese is going to elect someone because they are gay. Who your bishop is matters too much, affects too many people. Nobody is going to not take the best person. But there’s no question it will happen, because there are just great people out there who would make great bishops.Q: Will Susan Russell (a priest who is the president of Integrity, a church advocacy group for gay people) run in Los Angeles?A: I don’t think so. I think she’s not interested. I think she understands there is a need for people who do what she does, who can have a prophetic voice outside of the episcopate. And there are lots of people who think she’s strident.Q: What has been the fallout of all of this on your own diocese, in New Hampshire? Have you lost many church members?A: Except for one parish in Rochester early on, no. That left about 15 people in that congregation, they met for about a year, and then asked me to close them down because there weren’t enough people to sustain a continued parish. That’s all. That’s it. There’s no one, no priests or parishes associated with the breakaway groups. Our diocese grew by 3 percent last year.Q: And that makes how many church members?A: There are 15,000 people in the diocese of New Hampshire.Q: Who are you pulling in?A: We have received so many Roman Catholics and young families, particularly families who are saying, “We don’t want to raise our daughters in a church that doesn’t value young people in our church.”Q: Which vote that you’ve taken here do you think will have more impact, the one on bishops, or the one on same-sex blessings?A: Blessings. There are a lot of gay and lesbian people out there who are looking for affirmation, who have no desire to be a bishop. I’ve been saying to them, give the Episcopal Church a try, give church another try, and this is the one I wanted to go home with. Were you there after the vote?Q: I had to run off and file my story — it was late and I was missing my deadlines.A: It was amazing. We took the vote, there were closing prayers, and usually somebody says amen and we’re up and out of there. But last night not a person moved, for 10 minutes. There was absolute silence. I think we realized the momentousness of what we’d done. People just sat their quietly praying. It was amazing. It was almost as if we didn’t want to leave each other.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','Ms. Bassman did not need a prepackaged sexual freedom movement; she’d lived her own version years earlier. Born in 1917, the child of Russian émigrés who moved from to to Greenwich Village, she was given ample rein over her romantic life at an early age.Ms. Bassman first met Mr. Himmel splashing about at Coney Island; she was 6, and he was 9. When she saw him again a several years later, she fell incurably in love, and after a brief resistance her father permitted her to live with her suitor when she was 15. The couple divided their week between her family’s apartment on 13th Street and his parents’ place two blocks away. They married when Ms. Bassman was 25, and were together until Mr. Himmel’s death in February at 94, their relationship having spanned 77 years. “He never bored me,” Ms. Bassman explained.As teenagers they spent every weekend at the , where Ms. Bassman was drawn to the attenuated limbs of El Greco. She skipped a good deal of school, reading whatever Mr. Himmel and his friends were picking up when he was at City College. “When I’d get up in class and talk about Aldous Huxley, the teachers were astounded,” she said. “I’d hoodwinked everyone into thinking I knew something when I didn’t know anything.”By the ’40s Ms. Bassman was working as a graphic designer, but , a friend of the couple’s, encouraged her in her career as a photographer. During a trip he made to a few years after the war, he lent her both his studio and his assistant.In the period dominated by Avedon and , Ms. Bassman was one of the few female photographers in the fashion business, and her work had a distinctly different cast from the outset, one less distancing. In most of the lingerie pictures, for example, the faces are averted or obscured, the result of the Ford agency’s insistence that its models not be identifiable in such provocative advertising. The effect of this constraint is not cold anonymity but an unusual intimacy that leaves the images feeling almost entirely divorced from commodity, as if they were the visual entries in the personal journals of the women photographed.Being a woman advantaged her, Ms. Bassman felt. “The models thought about this a lot,” she said. “It was a sexually very different thing when they worked with men. They felt a charge. They were posing for men. I caught them when they were relaxed, natural, and I spent a lot of time talking to them about their husbands, their lovers, their babies.”Ms. Bassman’s interests were not conducive to having babies of her own however. She did not want a family, but her husband did, so she sought psychotherapy to resolve the issue. After six weeks, she said, she was inspired to motherhood. The couple had two children, Eric, a book editor, and Lizzie, a photographer and archivist of her parents’ work.Mr. Himmel’s passion for photography predated his wife’s, whose introduction to the field began when she was assigned the job of washing his prints in the bathtub. He produced both fashion and documentary images; several of his pictures were included in ’s “Family of Man” exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955. But when he turned 57, he set his camera aside indefinitely — and then permanently — to return to school for a master’s degree in social work. For much of the rest of his life he worked first as psychiatric caregiver, treating schizophrenics in the city’s public and later seeing patients in private practice.Ms. Bassman, though, ultimately returned to fashion photography, in the early ’90s, after her friend the painter , who had been renting studio space from her, found the bag of negatives that had been sequestered in the carriage house. Ms. Bassman, who had always been drawn to the manipulation of images, began altering the pictures, bleaching out backgrounds, for instance, to produce dramatic contrasts. As a result they now seem even more ethereal than they did in their original form, and immune to the beholder’s efforts to carbon-date them.Five years ago, at 87, Ms. Bassman discovered the glories of Photoshop and so began a new chapter in digital photography. She works every day in her studio, toying and reconfiguring from about 11 in the morning until dinnertime, and claims a proud proficiency with her computer. It is a skill however that does not extend to the use of e-mail or . “I’m not interested,” she said, “in any of that.”'"
"'09-07-17,'1','BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Iranian opposition leader, Mir Hussein Moussavi, will attend Friday Prayer at Tehran University, his Web site said, in a widely anticipated event that will be his first official appearance since last month’s disputed presidential election.The service on Friday is expected to draw a large number of opposition supporters hoping to make a show of strength. But their pro-government rivals are likely to show up in force, too, and on Thursday, the Iranian authorities were already warning about the possibility of renewed conflict in the streets.The prayers are to be led by Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president who is the opposition’s most powerful clerical backer and a bitter rival of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. There has been intense speculation about what sort of political signal, if any, he might send.The large public protests that followed the election have subsided, but opposition leaders have not abandoned their claim that the election was rigged in favor of the declared winner, Mr. Ahmadinejad.As word of Mr. Moussavi’s planned appearance spread, opposition supporters vowed to show up in large numbers to the vast prayer hall where Friday’s sermon and prayers will take place. There were reports that green prayer mats — the color of Islam and of Mr. Moussavi’s election campaign — were sold out across the city.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','PARIS — Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Thursday that financial markets were sending “important signs of recovery,” as he also sought to play down concerns about a new wave of bonuses on Wall Street.The comments were in part a reaction to the quick resurgence in earnings at two of the largest United States investment banks this week. JPMorgan Chase announced a $2.7 billion second-quarter profit from stellar trading and investment banking results on Thursday, while Goldman Sachs announced a $3.4 billion quarterly profit on Monday.Goldman has earmarked $11.4 billion so far this year to compensate its workers, raising the prospect that high bonus incentives might prompt another period of excessive risk-taking.“We are seeing some very important signs of recovery and repair in U.S. markets, which is essential for recovery,” Mr. Geithner told an online forum moderated by the French financial publication Les Echos. “The best signs of this are in the amount of new capital that has come into the U.S. financial system, the improvement in risk premia and credit spreads, and the beginnings of improvement in consumer and business confidence.”At the same time, he said, the Obama administration will “work with the Congress to put in place comprehensive reform of the financial system.”'"
"'09-07-17,'1','After coming to CIT’s aid seven months ago, by rushing through its application to become a traditional bank holding company and providing a $2.33 billion bailout, federal officials apparently concluded that CIT was too troubled to save a second time.“They finally said, ‘We’re not going to throw good money after bad,’  ” said Bert Ely, a banking analyst.It may take some time before the fallout of a potential collapse becomes clear. It is unknown, for instance, how many small businesses that now rely on CIT might be unable to find alternative financing and could slide into bankruptcy themselves. It is also unknown how much — if anything — taxpayers will recoup from the $2.33 billion bailout.What is clear is that CIT’s management, including Mr. Peek, miscalculated. CIT, analysts said, clearly believed it would get additional government support. As many banks rushed to raise capital this spring, CIT did not. Neither did it sell businesses to raise money.More critical, however, some analysts wondered why Mr. Peek had not tried to address CIT’s Achilles’ heel: It relies on money that it borrows in the capital markets to make loans to its customers. Once the credit markets froze over, the company was in peril.“They’ve been struggling and getting slowly strangled for two years,” Mr. Ely said.It is a stunning turn of events for Mr. Peek, whose grand visions of building a financial empire are now in ruins. A longtime Wall Street executive who lost out on the top job years ago at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Peek saw CIT in late 2003 as his ticket to chief executive-land.An under-the-radar finance company that had its roots in the stable, but decidedly hum-drum business of providing loans and leases for heavy machinery, technology equipment and other staples of the manufacturing economy, CIT was a diamond in the rough in the eyes of Mr. Peek. With some polish, he believed it could sparkle.Throughout CIT’s long history, however, the company had a habit of getting into trouble whenever it veered from its well-worn path.The company was battered in the mid-1990s by a trip into manufactured houses and boats. Later, after buying a technology leasing company at the height of the dot-com bubble, CIT sought refuge from its steep losses in the arms of Tyco International.When Tyco started getting squeezed by an emerging accounting scandal, it quickly spun off CIT, getting about half of what it had paid just a year earlier.A friendly executive with Midwestern roots but refined Manhattan tastes, Mr. Peek had spent decades on Wall Street and was gazing at the corner suite.Mr. Peek denied that he had lofty ambitions to turn CIT into the type of bank that would have competed with the likes of Merrill Lynch. But he did pursue multiple acquisitions, including a costly deal for a student-lending company, and aggressively pushed CIT’s existing home-lending activities near the peak of the frothy housing market.Seeking a brighter spotlight, Mr. Peek moved CIT’s headquarters from Livingston, N.J., to Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where CIT’s new building featured a lobby adorned with dark stone floors and moody purple lighting.Mr. Peek also pumped up CIT’s giving to various New York City nonprofit organizations and cultural centers.Mr. Peek and his wife, Liz, a business commentator, were longtime fixtures on the social circuit, holding fashionable soirees at their Upper East Side apartment.As the subprime mortgage market began to collapse, however, in 2007, so did Mr. Peek’s strategy. Starting in the second quarter of that year, CIT’s losses began mounting and it quickly became more difficult and more expensive for it to borrow in the markets.And while Mr. Peek’s critics say he was depending too much on federal regulators to save the company again, others say he had little choice.“That was their one and only option. They needed to have outside support and the only game in town right now is the government,” said David Havens, a credit analyst at Hexagon Securities.'"
"'09-07-17,'1','“I have to say there was something spiritual about today,” said Watson, who had received a text message from Nicklaus’s wife, Barbara, encouraging him to play well. “I feel inspired playing here. A lot of it has to do with just the — being in the presence here at Turnberry again, just a culmination of a lot of things that have gone on already. I feel that I’m playing well enough to win the golf tournament.”So there is a little message to Curtis, who rode an eagle at the seventh hole and four birdies for a 32 on the back nine to fashion his 65. And to Kuboya, who is playing in only his second Open at age 37, but who played the last four holes in four under par. And to Steve Stricker, fresh off his victory at the John Deere Classic, and Camilo Villegas of , to mention some prominent players among the group of five golfers at four-under-par 66.Watson’s play already had convinced his playing partner that the old man might really have a chance.“If he plays like he played today,” García said, “he can beat and everyone else. Today, the only thing he lacked was a little bit of length, but the quality of the shots he hit was awesome to watch.”Woods opened with a one-over-par 71 and was beaten by three shots by Ryo Ishikawa, the 17-year-old sensation from . Playing alongside Woods and Lee Westwood, Ishikawa demonstrated abandon and insouciance, shooting a 68 to match Westwood’s score and easily outpace Woods, who finished in a tie for 68th, right near the cut line.Woods twice hit his driver poorly, and he left the headcover on it for the rest of the round. After birdieing the second hole with a 12-footer, he followed with a pulled driver into the base of a TV scaffold in the deep rough to the left, hit his second shot through the green and could not get up and down.In all, Woods hit 8 of 14 greens and 12 of 18 fairways. He had 30 putts, including a three-putt at the 10th hole from 15 feet, missing a 5-foot comebacker.As Woods headed to the practice range to “get it squared away for tomorrow,” Watson got the attention of the other 40- and 50-somethings among the top 10. , 52, shot 67 and is tied for ninth. He won the Open in 1998 and knows the value of having been there. So does , 49, who also shot 67. He was the 1989 Open champion.“Experience counts for a lot around these links courses,” O’Meara said. “Tom Watson is nearly 60, and look at what he’s doing. The juices get flowing.”For Watson, they have been flowing all week, and he had a feeling Thursday.“Sometimes, when you’re my age, you don’t know how you’re going to wake up,” Watson said. “That golf swing might not be there. But fortunately, it was there. It just continued on. I played a lot of quality shots.”Like the 7-iron he hit from the right rough at the 18th, bouncing it into the green at the end of its 200-yard journey and then two-putting for par. It was a bravura performance, and afterward, a smiling Watson was asked if he was really hitting the ball as well as it appeared.“It’s fun to hit the ball solid,” Watson said. “The reason I’m out here is to hit quality shots when the pressure is on.”They all counted on Thursday, and they will count more with each passing day. For a man just two months shy of his 60th birthday to continue on through the weekend might be asking a bit much. Watson realizes it, and he is realistic.“The golf course, it fits me,” he said. “There’s certain shots on the golf course that I remember how to play. And I see some of the kids, they’re not playing the shot the way I would play it.“So, how am I going to do? That’s what you all want to know. How am I going to do the next three rounds? Well, I don’t know. I don’t have a clue what I’m going to do. I wish I could tell you that I’m going to break the Open record and shoot 262, but we’ll just see where it comes to.”'"
"'09-07-17,'1','In Germany for trade talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Dmitri A. Medvedev explicitly shot down theories that implicated Mr. Kadyrov, calling them “primitive.” And Mr. Kadyrov himself felt obliged to answer, placing a personal call to Oleg P. Orlov, the director of Memorial, the Russian human rights group where Ms. Estemirova worked, telling him the accusations must stop.“We had a conversation, man to man,” Mr. Orlov said. “There was a reproach. He said that the accusations I have been making against him were baseless. He said he had no need to kill Natasha Estemirova, that she did not represent a threat to anyone.” Hours after her body was found, Mr. Kadyrov called her killing a “monstrous crime” and promised to personally oversee the investigation.At a news conference in Germany, Mr. Medvedev, who faced a series of comments from foreign leaders appalled by the crime, praised Ms. Estemirova’s work and promised a swift investigation. His remarks were in marked contrast to those of his predecessor, Vladimir V. Putin, who kept silent for days after the 2006 killing of Anna Politkovskaya, and then spoke dismissively of her work.“Estemirova was doing a very useful thing — she was telling the truth, she was making open, at times perhaps harsh, assessments of some of the processes that are under way in the country,” Mr. Medvedev said. “That is why human rights activists are valuable, even if those in authority find them inconvenient and unpleasant.”Mr. Kadyrov and his security services had been Ms. Estemirova’s main subject for years. Much of her work documented abductions and intimidation of relatives of insurgents, a tactic used to force surrenders. In February 2008, he appointed her to an unpaid position as chairwoman of a committee advising the government on human rights, said her friend and collaborator Tanya Lokshina, the deputy director of the Moscow office of Human Rights Watch.But that arrangement ended disastrously. In March 2008, Mr. Kadyrov dismissed her after she gave a television interview criticizing a new law requiring women in Chechnya to wear head scarves. He called her to a meeting, telling her that she could not hold public meetings on the advisory committee with her hair uncovered, Ms. Lokshina said. Colleagues in Grozny said that during that meeting, Mr. Kadyrov had asked her about her relatives and her teenage daughter, something she interpreted as a threat.She left the country for several months, worried for her safety, but then returned to her work.Three months ago, Ms. Estemirova was called in for questioning by the police, an incident that so worried her co-workers at Memorial that they reported it to the Council of Europe. Then, last Friday, Nurdi Nukhazhiyev, Chechnya’s government-backed human rights ombudsman, called in the head of Memorial’s Grozny office for a meeting, in which he warned that high-ranking officials were “extremely dissatisfied” with Memorial’s most recent publications, Mr. Orlov said.In Chechnya, Mr. Orlov said, “when someone says that high-ranking officials are extremely dissatisfied, it is clear who they mean.”Over the last week, Ms. Estemirova had been documenting what she said was the public execution in a mountain village of a man accused of giving a sheep to a rebel band, said Ms. Lokshina.Ms. Lokshina said it would be premature to link this case to her killing; Ms. Estemirova had investigated any number of cases of abuse by law enforcement groups under the de facto control of Mr. Kadyrov, she said. “You can’t say she was killed for this or that case,” she said. “But we have no shadow of a doubt she was punished for doing her job.”'"

"'09-07-18,'0','Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, won the bankruptcy auction for Eddie Bauer Holdings, the outdoor clothing chain, with a $286 million bid and a plan to keep most of its stores open. Golden Gate also plans to keep most of the retailer’s outlets and employees, Eddie Bauer said Friday. Golden Gate’s offer will be presented for court approval Wednesday, the company said. Eddie Bauer attracted bidders as varied as the Iconix Brand Group of New York, the owner of the Rocawear clothing brand, and the liquidators Hilco Consumer Capital and the Gordon Brothers Group, said David Pollack, a bankruptcy lawyer. Eddie Bauer, which opened its first sporting-goods store in Seattle in 1920, has about 370 stores in the United States and Canada.“Creditors in general and landlords in particular should be happy,” said Mr. Pollack, a bankruptcy lawyer with Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll in Philadelphia, whose clients hold leases on about 100 Eddie Bauer stores. Golden Gate agreed to keep at least 300 stores open, he said. Affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors agreed to make the initial $202 million bid after Eddie Bauer, based in Bellevue, Wash., filed for bankruptcy last month. As the court-approved stalking-horse bidder, it will receive a $5 million breakup fee from Golden Gate, Mr. Pollack said.'"

"'09-07-18,'0','One has to be suspicious when China detains an Australian executive on charges of stealing state secrets without providing further details or evidence and waits three days to inform the Australian government.Suspicions grow exponentially when it happens that the executive’s employer, the Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto, recently snubbed a bid by China’s state mining company for a major stake. Rio Tinto is also playing hardball in negotiations over the price of iron ore it sells to Chinese state-owned steel mills.Stern Hu, the Australian detained along with several Chinese employees, was Rio Tinto’s top negotiator for a new long-term supply contract. Whether the accusations have any merit, Beijing’s tactics reinforce fears about its penchant for bullying companies to get its way.More than 10 days after detaining Mr. Hu and his colleagues, the Chinese government has not provided further details of the charges against them. Reports in state-controlled media suggest they are accused of bribing officials at Chinese steel mills to obtain confidential information and gain an edge in negotiations.It is not clear how that would ever qualify as stealing a state secret and endangering China’s national security. Beijing has used similarly vague, arbitrary and all-too-convenient charges to punish dissidents.All countries have a right to prosecute foreign companies and their executives for violating its laws. China’s steel business is reportedly rife with corruption.But the Chinese government is acting like the guilty party. To be credible, it must detail the charges and provide evidence to justify its actions. The executives must be guaranteed an impartial, transparent trial. So far they haven’t even been allowed to see a lawyer. A Rio Tinto official said that won’t happen until they are officially charged — and that could take months.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','The swine flu will probably return in force earlier than seasonal flu usually begins, federal health officials predicted Friday, saying they expected it to erupt as soon as schools open rather than in October or November.The swine flu is still circulating in the United States, especially in summer camps, even though hot weather has arrived and the regular flu season ended months ago, “so we expect challenges when people return to school, when kids are congregating together,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of respiratory diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a telephone news conference held jointly with vaccine experts from the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services.It is still unclear how many doses of a swine flu vaccine will be available by then, and officials have been reluctant to make firm predictions beyond saying that they expect tens of millions, rather than hundreds of millions, and they plan to triage them to people who are the most vulnerable, like pregnant women and people who are the most likely to encounter the flu, like health care workers.The number of doses available will depend on how fast seed strains grow, how much protection a small dose provides, and whether immune-system boosters called adjuvants are needed and prove to be safe; adjuvants are not used in American flu vaccines now.Clinical trials testing those questions are expected to take another couple of months, said Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.Assuming a swine flu vaccination campaign begins, it will be voluntary, Dr. Schuchat emphasized, but she “strongly encouraged” pregnant women to get both a seasonal flu shot and a swine flu shot when they are available.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','WASHINGTON — The American Conservative Union, which bills itself as the nation’s oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, has found itself fending off charges that it put its principles up for sale.In a letter sent last month to FedEx, the group offered its support in a bitter legislative dispute with United Parcel Service, but said it wanted a contract of up to $3.4 million to wage a campaign to win support for FedEx’s position. When FedEx did not agree, executives at the company said, the conservative group’s chairman, David A. Keene, turned around and signed a letter using the group’s logo endorsing the UPS view and blasting FedEx.The group’s letter to FedEx, dated June 30, and the subsequent Keene letter were first reported Friday by Politico on its Web site.Dennis E. Whitfield, executive vice president of the lobbying group, released a statement on Friday saying that Mr. Keene, who has been a longtime influential figure in conservative political circles, had signed the letter supporting UPS in his personal capacity and that the group was still supporting FedEx.Maury Lane, a FedEx spokesman, said that he thought that explanation was “disingenuous” and that it was implausible to contend that Mr. Keene had acted in his individual capacity. He noted that the July 15 letter supporting UPS in the dispute included the ACU logo in the letterhead along with those of six other conservative groups and that Mr. Keene’s signature noted he was president of the American Conservative Union.The initial letter from the ACU was written by Mr. Whitfield, and it proposed to a FedEx vice president in the Washington office, Rick Rodgers, an elaborate campaign of building support.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','The New York Post, which reported the incident Friday, said that the dog had also bitten an elevator worker and a painter at the residence.Ms. Shorenstein said Cheerio is not a troublemaker. But interviews with people who have petted or played with him or heard his piercing bark reveal that Cheerio can be something of a menace.“It certainly didn’t seem like the kind of dog you’d want to reach out and pet,” said one Republican staff member in Albany, who, like most people interviewed about Cheerio’s disposition, declined to speak on the record out of fear of further antagonizing the pooch.The Republican staff member recalled a meeting on a hot August day last year at the executive mansion with Mr. Paterson; Dean G. Skelos, then the Senate majority leader; and Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. While members of Mr. Skelos’s and Mr. Silver’s staff sat on a couch in the living room waiting for the meeting to end, Cheerio yelped loudly, ran around in circles and jumped up on the couch, where he barked some more.A Paterson associate, who also asked not to be named, said he was petting Cheerio one evening at the mansion when he remarked to another guest how docile and friendly the dog seemed. “Yeah, until he bites you,” the other guest said, and told a story about the dog lunging at a state trooper on the governor’s security detail.Through Ms. Shorenstein, Mr. Paterson on Thursday described his relationship with the dog as “strained,” though he admitted to sometimes letting the dog rest on his lap while he listened to his daily briefings on the telephone. The dog is more the pet of the governor’s wife, Michelle Paige Paterson, and Mr. Paterson’s patience with Cheerio has been known to fray.After the attack Thursday, the Patersons checked Cheerio’s vaccination records and made sure all his shots were up to date.Cheerio splits his time between Manhattan and Albany, and is said to enjoy staying at the governor’s mansion because of the sweeping five-acre grounds that surround it. He is also given the run of the house.Pets are almost always a plus for a politician, from Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Scottish terrier Fala to President Obama’s new Portuguese water dog, Bo. Dogs tend to humanize politicians, showing their more playful side. Cheerio’s behavior, of course, could test that truism. (President George W. Bush’s beloved dog Barney did last year when he bit a Reuters reporter on the index finger.)Still, Cheerio is not the first dog to snap at a visitor to the New York governor’s mansion. Cara, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo’s German shepherd, once bit Rudy F. Runko, a deputy budget officer at the time. Patrick Bulgaro, then the budget director and Mr. Runko’s boss, said he empathized with Cara.“I don’t know what Rudy was doing,” Mr. Bulgaro joked in a phone interview Friday. “There were days I felt like biting Rudy, too. So I can’t say I blame the dog.”Cheerio and Cara had nothing on Gov. Thomas E. Dewey’s Great Dane, who was known as a fierce protector of the mansion’s grounds. Mr. Bulgaro, who grew up in the Albany area, said he remembered walking past the mansion and seeing the dog barking at the fence — a successful deterrent that “let you know you weren’t welcome in the area,” he said.At least one person who has visited the mansion and seen Cheerio on his best behavior said the dog should not be blamed. Albany, he said, can bring out the worst in anyone. “Maybe Albany has a way of turning friendly pets into rabid animals.”'"
"'09-07-18,'0','Verizon Wireless said Friday that it would let small wireless companies have access to some of the cellphones that it offers exclusively to its customers under contracts with phone makers. The move is an attempt to head off federal regulation of such exclusive handset deals.From now on, when Verizon strikes a deal with a manufacturer for exclusive access to a handset, it will allow the phone be sold after six months to any carrier with fewer than 500,000 customers.Congress has begun questioning whether wireless carriers are hurting competition by shutting out rivals from offering popular new phones like the Apple iPhone, the Palm Pre and the BlackBerry Storm. And the Federal Communications Commission has said it is looking into the issue.The hottest phone right now is the iPhone, which is available only on AT&T’s network in the United States. Verizon has an exclusive deal with Research in Motion to offer the touch-screen Storm, and Sprint Nextel has an exclusive on the Pre.Verizon’s move, announced in a letter to Representative Rick Boucher, the Virginia Democrat who is chairman of a major telecommunications subcommittee, appears meant to address the concerns of the smaller carriers while preserving the right of big carriers to offer handsets their rivals cannot.'"

"'09-07-18,'0','A federal appeals court in Manhattan on Friday reversed a lower-court ruling that had allowed the government to bar a prominent Muslim scholar from entering the United States on the ground that he had contributed to a charity that had connections to terrorism.The scholar, Tariq Ramadan, 46, a Swiss academic, was to become a tenured professor at the University of Notre Dame, but the Bush administration revoked his visa in 2004 and again denied him a visa in 2006. The government cited evidence that from 1998 to 2002, he donated about $1,300 to a Swiss-based charity that the Treasury Department later categorized as a terrorist organization because it provided money to Hamas, the militant Palestinian group.Professor Ramadan said in a later court affidavit that he was not aware of any connections between the charity, the Association de Secours Palestinien, and Hamas or terrorism, and that he believed that the organization was involved in legitimate humanitarian projects. “I have condemned terrorism at every opportunity,” he wrote.In its ruling on Friday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held unanimously that the government was required to “confront Ramadan with the allegation against him and afford him the subsequent opportunity to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know, and reasonably should not have known, that the recipient of his contributions was a terrorist organization.”The record was unclear as to whether a consular officer who had denied the visa had done so, the panel said in its ruling, written by Judge Jon O. Newman and joined by Judges Wilfred Feinberg and Reena Raggi.The panel sent the case back to the lower court for a determination on whether Professor Ramadan had been confronted with the allegation, and then given a chance to deny it.If that did not happen, the panel said, a new visa hearing should be held.“I am gratified that the court has found that my exclusion from the United States is without basis,” Professor Ramadan said in a statement on Friday.Professor Ramadan, who had frequently visited the United States in the past, lecturing and attending conferences, said he was eager to “engage once again with Americans in the kinds of face-to-face exchanges” that were “crucial to bridging cultural divides.”“I hope to be able to come back to the States and resume my work with scholars,” he said later in a telephone interview. “This is what I want.”Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, which argued the case for the government, declined to comment.The government, in barring Professor Ramadan, had first offered no explanation, and then cited a provision of the Patriot Act that allows for the exclusion of foreigners who use “a position of prominence within any country to endorse or espouse terrorist activity.”In 2006, the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Civil Liberties Union sued on behalf of three groups: the American Academy of Religion, the American Association of University Professors and the PEN American Center. The suit argued that Professor Ramadan’s exclusion violated the First Amendment rights of groups that wanted to meet with him and hear his views.The government then cited, as the reason for denying him entry, his donations to the charity, which he had revealed in interviews with officials in the United States Embassy in Bern, Switzerland.Jameel Jaffer, the A.C.L.U. lawyer who argued the appeal, said he was pleased with the decision and its finding “that in this case the government simply has not offered a constitutionally adequate justification for its actions.”'"
"'09-07-18,'0','COLMAR, France — Two riders in the Tour de France sustained minor injuries Friday in the 13th stage when they were struck by shots from what was most likely an air rifle, Tour officials said.Julian Dean, a New Zealander on the Garmin-Slipstream team, and Oscar Freire, a Spaniard on the Rabobank team, were hit with pellets more than three-quarters of the way into the 124-mile (200-kilometer) stage. They had been riding in a group of 20 to 30 cyclists at the back of the pack when three shots rang out from the roadside. Both riders finished the stage and were expected to continue racing.The pellet grazed Dean’s right index finger, causing some bruising and bleeding. The bleeding had stopped by the time he finished the race and reached the team bus, said Matt White, a race director for the Garmin team.Freire was hit in the leg, and the pellet was embedded there. Freire’s team doctor removed it.Tour officials said that the gendarmerie, the national police force, was investigating the incident.“It’s not the worst thing I ever heard of, but it’s definitely the weirdest,” said White, adding that fans had thrown things, like eggs, at riders in the past. “But seriously, the boys could have been really hurt if they were hit in the wrong part of their body or in the face. Or if it caused a crash. But Julian’s quite tough. He didn’t really complain. It was just another day at the office.”Officers from the gendarmerie are set up along the route of each stage, to ensure the safety of riders and fans. They also often lock hands along the course after the finish line, so riders can get to their team buses without incident.'"

Fitzwater of the Federal District Court in Dallas wrote in a 35-page decision released Friday.“We are reviewing the court’s ruling and weighing our options,” Scott Friestad, associate director of the S.E.C.’s division of enforcement, said Friday in a statement.Judge Fitzwater has given the S.E.C. 30 days to file an amended complaint to the court.If it files another complaint, “the S.E.C. must allege some facts that were not previously known, i.e., that Cuban somehow became or consented to be a fiduciary to Mamma.com,” said Joshua Davis, a Texas trial lawyer.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','The anemic economy decimated state tax collections during the first three months of the year, according to a report released Friday by the Rockefeller Institute of Government. The drop in revenues was the steepest in the 46 years that quarterly data has been available.The blow to state coffers, which the report said appeared to worsen in the second quarter of the year, reflects the gravity of the recession and suggests the extent to which many states will probably have to resort to more spending cuts or tax increases to balance their budgets.Over all, the report found that state tax collections dropped 11.7 percent in the first three months of 2009, compared with the same period last year. After adjusting for inflation, new changes in tax rates and other anomalies, the report found that tax revenues had declined in 47 of the 50 states in the quarter.All the major sources of state tax revenue — sales taxes, personal income taxes and corporate income taxes — took serious blows, the report found.As more people lost their jobs, took pay cuts or worked fewer hours, personal income tax collections fell 17.5 percent in the quarter. Weak retail sales sent sales tax collections down 8.3 percent. Corporate income tax collections, which are often highly variable, declined 18.8 percent.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','“I was one under par after seven holes and just right there in the championship and had a few tough holes right in a row and couldn’t get it back,” said Woods, whose only other missed cut in a major was at Winged Foot in 2006. “I knew the outgoing nine was going to be tough, and I hit some poor shots.“I just made mistakes. And obviously you can’t make mistakes and expect to not only make the cut but also try and win a championship. You have to play clean rounds of , and I didn’t.”Watson has been saying all along that unlocking Turnberry would come down to links experience and straight driving. Those elements were not part of the equation for Marino, who sprayed the ball all over the course but managed to get up and down from everywhere.“It was probably one of the best scoring rounds I’ve ever had,” said Marino, 29, who only learned Sunday he was in the field when his manager told him that Shingo Katayama had withdrawn.“I was really struggling off the tee,” Marino said. “I hit it in the rough a bunch, missed a bunch of greens. I holed a shot from 116 yards for birdie, made a bunker shot for a birdie, and then there were points where I felt like I was one-putting every hole.“I really don’t think I could have shot one stroke less today, to be honest with you.”While Marino was leaving the golf course for his hotel room up the hill at the Turnberry Hotel, Watson was fighting through the wind and the rain. He was still driving the ball in the fairways but could not get up and down from greenside bunkers at both par 3s on the front. He three-putted No. 5 from the back fringe, and bogeyed the par-5 seventh after a “terrible” layup in the rough with a 5-iron.A funny and odd thing happened then. sidled up to Watson in the fairway at the eighth hole and exhorted him to “Come on, old man.” Watson was grinning as he told the story of getting a pep talk from García, the insular 29-year-old Spaniard who is at one under and trying to win his first major.“That was nice of Sergio to give me a little pep talk there,” Watson said, chuckling as he repeated García’s words, “ ‘Come on, old man.’ He was making a joke of it, but I said, ‘Well, I feel like an old man.’ ”The old man then stopped the bogey train. He played “two really good shots” at No. 8 and two good shots at No. 9 and made birdie.“It turned my round around when I made the putt at 9,” he said. “I made a good swing at the tee ball at 9, made a good shot from the light rough there, and ended up hitting to the right distance. I did that several times today.”Watson had a feeling those putts were going to go in the hole at 16 and 18. He has the feel in his hands again, and they are closing in on a sixth Claret Jug. He is 36 holes from history, again, much as he was in 1994 when he came so close here only to have his putter desert him in the final round. But the feeling is different now, 15 years later.He was asked what he meant by his reference to the spirits being with him.“Well, the memories,” Watson said. “I guess the memories are with me, all the wonderful memories I’ve had playing links golf. You know, walking down the fairways, walking up onto the greens, people showing their respect for me, showing my respect for them.“And it’s been since 1975. For 34 years I’ve played links golf. And it’s a fabric of my life, I can tell you that. To be able to be doing what I’m doing out here, making a few lucky putts here and there and still feeling like I have a chance to win.“That’s pretty cool at age 59. That’s why it’s kind of spiritual.”'"
"'09-07-18,'0','Capital equipment orders for G.E. fell sharply, especially transportation machinery like locomotives and health care equipment like medical-imaging machines. In a conference call with analysts, company executives said they expected industrial equipment orders to be off about 25 percent for the year.“That’s a pretty significant decline, but it’s not unexpected in this economy,” said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s.Still, analysts said, the fall in industrial orders disappointed investors, sending G.E.’s shares down 6.05 percent, to $11.65.Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, said his management team was focused on cutting costs, operational improvements and repairing the finance unit, while still investing in businesses likely to prosper when the economy recovers. “We’re as well positioned as you can be in this environment,” Mr. Immelt said.Analysts say two main concerns cloud the outlook for G.E. Its industrial side is a collection of capital-equipment businesses, and many customers will delay large purchases until genuine signs of economic recovery surface, they say.The worry about the finance unit, analysts say, is the possibility that G.E. may not yet have seen the worst of losses and that it may have to set aside more money to cover them. But for a quarter at least, the trends looked encouraging.The finance business was the biggest drag on G.E.’s results. Its operating profits fell 80 percent, to $590 million, down from $2.9 billion a year ago. And revenue in the finance unit, which includes home mortgages in Britain and private-label credit cards in the United States, declined 29 percent, to less than $12.8 billion, from nearly $18 billion.G.E. has moved to strengthen the finance business. It said leverage, or the ratio of borrowings to equity, is down to 5.6 to 1, compared with 7 to 1 a year ago. And borrowing in the short-term commercial paper market is down to $50 billion, from $72 billion a year ago.A new uncertainty about G.E.’s finance business was raised last month with the Treasury Department’s initial plans to overhaul the financial system. One recommendation, aimed at companies with large financial and nonfinancial businesses, would require G.E. to shed its big finance unit.G.E. executives said the company would fight the proposal. “We are really committed to GE Capital,” Mr. Immelt said.The company’s television network and movie studio unit, NBC Universal, also hurt the quarterly results, with earnings off 41 percent because of charge-offs and falling television advertising.The impact of economic stimulus programs has not yet been evident, Mr. Immelt said. “We’ll see benefit from the global stimulus in the second half of the year,” he said.'"
"'09-07-18,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Supreme Court on Friday acquitted Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader and former prime minister, of hijacking charges, effectively removing the last legal hurdle for him to run for public office, according to his lawyers and party officials.The charges stemmed from events in 1999 when Mr. Sharif was prime minister and, trying to forestall a coup, diverted a plane carrying the military chief at the time, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. The coup succeeded anyway, and General Musharraf seized power.Mr. Sharif was then convicted of hijacking charges in 2000 and went into exile in Saudi Arabia.He returned to Pakistan in 2007 and has since emerged as the most popular politician, but the hijacking charges remained a bar to his return to elected office, until the court ruled Friday that they should be dismissed.Siddiqul Farooq, a spokesman for Mr. Sharif’s political party, said that the judgment “nullifies the decision of the kangaroo courts that acted on the orders of Pervez Musharraf.”President Asif Ali Zardari hailed the ruling, the third in recent months supporting Mr. Sharif’s return to politics, as a “step in the direction of ensuring a level playing field for all political leaders and parties,” according to a statement from his office.The court decision coincided with a meeting between Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif later Friday. Officials from Mr. Sharif’s party said Mr. Zardari had requested the meeting, which was the first between them after eight months of mutual distrust and accusations. It lasted four and a half hours.“There is a lot of pressure on Mr. Zardari on the economic and security fronts, and he seems to be seeking cooperation of Mr. Sharif,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political analyst in Lahore, Pakistan. “It looks like Nawaz Sharif’s fortune is on the rise.”'"

"'09-07-19,'0','On Wednesday, Mr. McCartney performed at another Beatles venue, when he played a set of songs atop the marquee at the Ed Sullivan Theater in Manhattan for “The Late Show With David Letterman.”The Citi Field audience brought its own memories: Beatles T-shirts and talismans, held aloft to soak up the occasion. When Mr. McCartney sang Beatles songs, in arrangements that nearly replicated the studio versions, there were loud, fond sing-alongs.But Mr. McCartney wasn’t fixated on looking back. Although he has enough hits to fill his two-and-a-half-hour set with oldies from Wings, the Beatles and his solo albums, he chose to stay current as well, stumping the nostalgia crowd with songs from the album he released in 2008 as the Fireman, “Electric Arguments.” At 67, he is still a vigorous musician: writing tuneful and wily songs, playing assorted instruments, crooning his ballads ardently, hitting the high notes and howling like a rock and roller.Of course, Mr. McCartney wasn’t about to return to the primitive conditions of a 1965 Beatles show, when the band performed isolated on an empty ballfield with fans far away in the stands. (There was field seating, on covered turf, along with the stands at Citi Field.)Stadium concerts have evolved mightily, and Mr. McCartney had all the paraphernalia to make his music fill the stadium as the sound and image of the Beatles could not (which didn’t make the Beatles concerts any less exciting). Video screens rendered Mr. McCartney visible to the upper decks, and they illustrated songs like “Back in the U.S.S.R.” (with old images of Russia) and “Got to Get You Into My Life” (with the computer-animated Beatles from the video game “The Beatles: Rock Band”). Flash pots and fireworks blazed to underline the explosive transitions of “Live and Let Die.”As always, Mr. McCartney was boyish onstage, making faces and tousling and retousling his hair. His genial and straightforward presence made some of his songs even more enigmatic, like “Jet,” “Helter Skelter,” “Flaming Pie” (the title song of Mr. McCartney’s 1997 album) and “Mrs. Vandebilt” (a song he resurrected from the Wings album “Band on the Run”).Mr. McCartney plays like a musician cheerfully doing his job. He makes no fuss over how many paths he opened with the Beatles and how much he can do. At Citi Field, the delicacy of “Yesterday” and “Blackbird,” the near-gospel of “Hey Jude,” the mandolin-strumming skiffle of “Dance Tonight,” the quasiclassical string parts of “Eleanor Rigby” (digitally simulated) and the lusty blues-rock of “Let Me Roll It” were all part of Mr. McCartney’s music, and all performed neatly and deftly. Mr. McCartney keeps his songs familiar; his band members barely deviated from the solos played by the Beatles and Wings. So when Mr. McCartney did make changes, they were striking — particularly when he segued from the middle of “A Day in the Life” into “Give Peace a Chance,” with a peace sign on the video screen and the crowd raising two-fingered V-signs while singing along.When Mr. McCartney and the Beatles played Shea Stadium in the 1960s, they were brash young rockers. It was before the orchestral ambition of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” or the introspection and style-hopping of “The Beatles” (known as the White Album), with songs the Beatles themselves would perform only in the studio, though Mr. McCartney has taken them on tour. It was before Mr. McCartney’s songs became something parents introduced to children and grandchildren. And it was before Mr. McCartney had another four decades of experience, losses and memories to sing about, in a stadium that awaits history of its own.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','The Obama administration has proposed a number of new regulations and agencies, notably including a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which would be charged with safeguarding consumers against things like abusive mortgage, auto loan or credit card contracts. The new agency is to encourage “plain vanilla” products that are simpler and easier to understand. But representatives of the financial services industry have criticized the proposal as a threat to innovations that could improve consumers’ welfare.As the story of the steam engine shows, innovation often entails tension between safety and power. We need to foster inventions that better human welfare while incorporating safety mechanisms that protect the public. Could the proposed agency accomplish this task?The subprime mortgage is an example of a recent invention that offered benefits and risks. These mortgages permitted people with bad credit histories to buy homes, without relying on guaranties from government agencies like the Federal Housing Administration. Compared with conventional mortgages, the subprime variety typically involved higher interest rates and stiff prepayment penalties.To many critics, these features were proof of evil intent among lenders. But the higher rates compensated lenders for higher default rates. And the prepayment penalties made sure that people whose credit improved couldn’t just refinance somewhere else at a lower rate, thus leaving the lenders stuck with the rest, including those whose credit had worsened.This made basic sense as financial engineering — an unsentimental effort to work around risks, selection biases, moral hazards and human foibles that could lead to disaster.This might have represented financial progress if it weren’t for some problems that the designers evidently didn’t anticipate. As subprime mortgages were introduced, a housing bubble developed. This was fed in part by demand from new, subprime borrowers who now could enter the housing market. The bursting of the bubble had results that are now all too familiar — and taxpayers, among others, are still paying for it all.This raises a question: If a consumer agency had been set up 20 years ago, would the subprime mortgage crisis have been prevented? We don’t know, but it seems improbable.Such an agency would most likely have slowed some abusive practices, like offering low teaser rates on adjustable-rate mortgages and hiding information about future rate increases in fine print that most people do not read. That kind of regulatory intervention would have reduced the severity of the crisis, and that is no small thing.On the other hand, unless these regulators were extremely vanilla in approach and just said no to any innovation, or unless they had an unusually deep understanding of speculative bubbles, I think they would have allowed most of those subprime mortgages. And they probably wouldn’t have had the detailed knowledge they would have needed to halt the decline of lending standards on prime mortgages in a timely way. In all likelihood, we would still be in this financial crisis.In short, the new agency seems a good idea, and, if it is created, it should be chartered to support innovation and should be staffed by people who know finance and its intricacies, including some who appreciate that human behavior must be understood and factored into financial design.But that leaves us with the deeper quandary: Our society needs financial innovation, and still seems vulnerable to changing animal spirits and speculative bubbles that create truly big problems. Even if they can be mitigated, periodic crises may not be preventable, at least not by banning abusive credit cards or even by throwing the bad guys in jail.We need consumer products that people can use properly, and if this is what “plain vanilla” means, that’s a good thing. But we also need financial innovation that responds to central problems. The effectiveness of our free enterprise system depends on allowing business people to manage the myriad risks — including the risk of asset bubbles — that impinge on their operations in the long term. And this process needs constant change and improvement.Complexity is not in itself a bad thing. It is, in fact, a hallmark of modern civilization. A laptop computer is an immensely complex instrument, with trillions of electronic components, and almost none of us can explain what goes on inside it. Yet it can be designed well so that it seems plain vanilla to the ultimate user.And as for steam engines, the modern turbine high-pressure versions are not plain vanilla in any sense. They are sophisticated triumphs of engineering. They help generate most of our electric power with very few accidents.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by a Texas consortium protesting the Department of Homeland Security’s choice of Kansas for a multimillion-dollar biodefense laboratory.The judge decided that the lawsuit was premature and dismissed it without prejudice, opening the way for the Texas Bio- and Agro-Defense Consortium to refile the lawsuit later, which the group said it might do.Details of the judge’s decision were temporarily sealed. Judge Mary Ellen Coster Williams of the United States Court of Federal Claims said in a hearing this month that the lawsuit seemed premature. She said the laboratory might never materialize and noted that a deal had not been struck for Kansas to provide land in Manhattan for the laboratory. The Kansas Board of Regents has agreed to provide the land, but the Homeland Security Department has not signed that agreement.“Instead of saying ‘no,’ the court simply said ‘not yet,’ ” Michael Guiffre, the Texas consortium’s lawyer, said on Friday. “We’ll be right back where we started as soon as D.H.S. figures out what it is doing.”The Texas group had contended that the department ignored the region’s high risk of tornadoes and that the site selection had been tainted by politics.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','The United States is clearly hoping that Indian business will help bridge potential gaps between the two countries.Mr. Ambani, for example, proposed that Indians and Americans work together to develop “clean technologies” that would reduce carbon emissions. The Indian government is resisting the Obama administration’s push for a global treaty that would mandate cuts in carbon emissions, arguing that developing economies deserve to grow without compulsory constraints.“Rather than argue about who has a right to pollute,” Mr. Ambani said, “we will move forward to create institutions.”As the richest man in India, Mr. Ambani is influential. But he may soon face his own problems with the United States. His conglomerate, Reliance Industries, operates refineries that sell fuel to Iran. That could make him vulnerable to sanctions against Iran being proposed in Congress.The choice of Mumbai as Mrs. Clinton’s first port of call was steeped in symbolism for another reason: It offered her a platform to speak out against the coordinated terrorist attacks here last November that killed 173 people and wounded more than 300.Mrs. Clinton told an Indian broadcaster, Times Now, that she stayed at the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, one of two hotels that had been attacked, partly as a “rebuke” of the terrorists.Last week, she encouraged India to support Pakistan’s effort to stem a radical insurgency in Pakistan, a request that may unsettle some Indians. India and the United States blamed a Pakistan-based militant group for the Mumbai attacks, and India has long complained that Pakistan is not serious enough in cracking down on militants.Mrs. Clinton met with the hotel’s general manager, who lost his wife and child in the attack, as well as other employees, before signing a condolence book.“Just as India supported America on 9/11, these events are seared in our memory,” she said at the news conference, adding that terrorism is “global, it is ruthless, it is nihilistic, and it must be stopped.”Mrs. Clinton delivered her message on an outdoor terrace at the hotel that had been littered with bloodied bodies during the siege. Just before the news conference, the Indian police urged her not to speak there for security reasons, but she resisted.The rest of her day was devoted to two longtime interests: women’s issues and education.She visited a shop run by the Self Employed Women’s Association, a cooperative of 1 million women who make and sell embroidery and other products using microfinance methods. In 1995, Mrs. Clinton visited the group as the first lady; she has stayed in touch since then.Inevitably, some of these encounters are more successful than others. In the category of less successful was a panel discussion on education at a Jesuit college, at which Mrs. Clinton appeared with Aamir Khan, a prominent Indian film star who campaigns for better teaching.While Mrs. Clinton offered an earnest discussion of teaching standards in Arkansas, Mr. Khan appeared to condone dropping out of school to pursue entertainment careers.Mrs. Clinton appeared unfazed, closing with a quote from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who, she noted, “of course learned so much from Gandhi.”'"
"'09-07-19,'0','This elevation of what was once considered junk food to the subject of vigorous aesthetic analysis represents the convergence of two trend lines. The first is many Americans’ growing sophistication about, and fascination with, what’s for dinner (or breakfast or lunch): the variety of it; the vocabulary for it; where to buy the best this; how to cook the best that. More and more people seem to insist on deliciousness, and more and more seem to have readily articulated opinions to go along with that demand.But they’re bumping up against a troubled economy and budgets with stricter limits. For food lovers and for the periodicals, newscasts and blogs that serve them (and are themselves cash-strapped), what’s the solution?To apply one’s powers of discernment to doughnuts. To mull the nuances of burritos and cupcakes. To assess rival burgers as if they were rival brasseries on the Left Bank.“This one guy called Mister Hamburger was ranking all sorts of minute details of every burger,” recalled Adam Kuban, a prominent New York food blogger, referring to a local peer whose Web site no longer exists. “He did ‘beef-to-bun ratio.’ He did ‘patty color.’ ”Mr. Kuban also mentioned Texas Burger Guy, a blogger who rates burgers according to these criteria: “herd killer,” a reference to their size, and thus how quickly they’re thinning a herd of cattle; “handling,” or how easily gripped they are; “bling bling,” their price; “ooze factor,” their juiciness; and “gravedigger,” how quickly their greasiness and heft might put you six feet under. Gravedigger ratings range from one to 10 shovels.Mr. Kuban has his own burger blog, A Hamburger Today, along with his own pizza blog, Slice, on which he occasionally evaluates pizzas in terms of the “tip sag” of a given piece.“If it’s not crisp enough, the tip will sag,” he said, adding that a bit of sag is actually fine, even preferred, so long as it’s not too much. “Ideal tip sag would be — you could have maybe an inch or so, three-quarters of an inch. If it starts sagging more than that, it’s indicative of a soggy crust.”The Internet with its infinite real estate is of course a big force behind the fetishization of everyday food, giving voice to niche obsessions and connecting enthusiasts far and wide.But that’s not the whole of it. In recent years a rising number of accomplished chefs have trained their energies on the sorts of mass-market foods once beyond (and beneath) their interest. And that adjustment carries the message that no food is too lowly to be fussed over — or deconstructed.Daniel Boulud, one of New York’s most celebrated French chefs, just opened a burger joint. At the downtown Manhattan cocktail lounge PDT you can compare hot dogs by David Chang, of the revered Momofuku mini-empire, with those by Wylie Dufresne, a renowned evangelist of avant-garde cuisine.Michael Psilakis, who took Greek food in an unusually creative — and decidedly upscale — direction when he opened Anthos in Midtown Manhattan two years ago, has just unveiled Gus & Gabriel on Manhattan’s Upper West Side. Its menu includes hot dogs, pretzel nuggets, nachos and even fried mozzarella.All of the highbrow talent lavished on lowbrow fare — and all of the discerning palates migrating in that direction — are reflected in the girth of New York magazine’s annual bargain-restaurants issue, which came out on Monday.In this year’s installment, 25 pages — including 15 on pizza alone — are devoted to economical dining. Last year, the page count was 18; the year before that, 17.And no sooner had the issue hit stands than the magazine’s Web site, Grub Street, supplemented it with an online “burger register” of the city’s 82 best burgers. Apparently 25, 50 or even 75 burgers just wouldn’t do.Food porn begets fast-food porn, which in turn has come to verge on fast-food parody, some of it perhaps intentional. The Web site Fancy Fast Food actually devises and presents recipes for seemingly refined, accomplished dishes that just rearrange and redeploy ingredients in items purchased directly from, say, Kentucky Fried Chicken.Or Domino’s. That chain’s American Legends Pacific Veggie pizza is the entirety of the shopping list for a dish that Fancy Fast Food labels Dao Mi Noh Chow Mein and that, as pictured on the site, looks like something in a proper Chinese restaurant.How crazy can it get? Do a Google search on “cupcake blog” and see how many pop up, including “Hello, Cupcake!,” “Cupcake Project,” “Crumbs and Doilies,” “No One Puts Cupcake in a Corner” and “Cupcakes Take the Cake,” whose inventory of posts includes “cupcake kebab how-to,” “cupcake license plates” and “cupcake bakeries on Twitter.”The cupcake universe is obviously richer, subtler and more varied than was once imagined, but can doughnuts really reward much reflection? Especially chain doughnuts of the most basic order?Apparently, yes. The Urbanite blog judged Timbits superior to Munchkins because they were “denser, more cake-like.” But the Feed blog’s 16 taste-test participants on balance favored Munchkins, finding them “sweeter, lighter, fluffier.”You, no doubt, will come to your own conclusion, based on yeastiness and maybe “crumb factor” and possibly “hole-to-dough ratio.” Then you can move on to an exhaustive inventory of snow cones.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','“Anyone involved in pulling back the break, besides AG2R, shouldn’t have been there,” Rich Hincapie said, referring to AG2R La Mondiale, the team defending Rinaldo Nocentini’s overall lead.George Hincapie, who is 36, started Stage 14 in 28th place, 5 minutes 25 seconds behind Nocentini. He was the highest-placed rider in the breakaway, which gave him a chance at the yellow jersey.After the stage, which traveled 123.7 miles or 199 kilometers through the Alsace section of France, Hincapie ended up second over all, five seconds behind Nocentini. Alberto Contador of Astana slipped to third but remained six seconds back; his teammate Lance Armstrong similarly fell to fourth, still eight seconds off the lead.Hincapie, who is not in contention for the overall victory because climbing is not his forte, finished eighth in the stage, 16 seconds behind the winner Serguei Ivanov of Team Katusha.Rich Hincapie said that his brother was saddened that the Garmin-Slipstream team and Astana had been working out at the front of the pack Saturday, while the breakaway struggled to stay out front. George Hincapie has close friends on both teams and those friends knew what wearing the yellow jersey — even for a day — would mean to him, Rich Hincapie said.“I don’t think he has called the Astana guys or the Garmin guys to say anything, but there have been an awful lot of excuses flying around,” he said. “Why do they feel like they have to explain anything if they haven’t done anything wrong? They are obviously guilty or worried.”The day ended with a squabble between Columbia and Garmin, the only American-based teams in the Tour. The Columbia team owner, Bob Stapleton, said Garmin helped reel in the breakaway because it was jealous of Columbia’s previous success.“I don’t know why you would do that with George at this stage of his career,” Stapleton said. “I mean that’s a victory for everybody. That’s something that would have gotten attention all over the U.S., that would have been good for the whole sport in America.”Matt White, Garmin’s race director, said his team had nothing against Hincapie and certainly did not ride faster simply to keep him from the yellow jersey. He said he had given his riders the order to stay out front, to keep them out of trouble in case of a crash or a split in the peloton.“I said, O.K. guys, we’re coming into a dangerous final, or a nervous final, and let’s get out front and go at a high speed; let’s not get caught out like we did in one of the earlier stages,” said White, who was Hincapie’s teammate on the United States Postal Service team. “We weren’t out to ruin anyone else’s day in yellow. We came here to win the Tour de France.”He added: “If it was someone else, I don’t even think we’d be talking about it. But because he is so respected and such a good rider and he is American, here we are.”Garmin riders later said that Hincapie’s loss was not their fault. The AG2R La Mondiale team pushed the peloton forward to try to protect Nocentini’s yellow jersey. Garmin simply went along.“It hurts us greatly that people actually think that we hunted him down to do that,” the Garmin rider David Millar said of Hincapie’s missed chance. “I feel bad that people are pointing fingers at us.”After the race, many questioned Garmin’s tactics, including Johan Bruyneel, Astana’s team manager, who said there was no explanation for Garmin’s move.Armstrong also blamed Garmin for Hincapie’s loss. He later explained to a pool reporter why Astana had put riders out front when the breakaway was six minutes ahead. He said the team did not want the time gap to grow to 10 or 11 minutes and that his teammates were riding at a “moderate tempo.”“That is by no means a chase,” Armstrong said. “It’s the Tour de France. You can’t let a break have 15 minutes. The scenario of George in yellow was perfect for our team.”But Hincapie, who has worn the yellow jersey once in his long career, has not commented on any of that yet.“It’s a shame for George,” said Armstrong, who called Hincapie his “best bud in the peloton.”'"
"'09-07-19,'0','A 2003 study estimated that cellphone distractions caused 2,600 traffic deaths every year, and 330,000 accidents that result in moderate or severe injuries.Yet Americans have largely ignored that research. Instead, they increasingly use phones, navigation devices and even laptops to turn their cars into mobile offices, chat rooms and entertainment centers, making roads more dangerous.A disconnect between perception and reality worsens the problem. New studies show that drivers overestimate their own ability to safely multitask, even as they worry about the dangers of others doing it.Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.Police in almost half of all states make no attempt to gather data on the problem. They are not required to ask drivers who cause accidents whether they were distracted by a phone or other device. Even when officers do ask, some drivers are not forthcoming.The federal government warns against talking on a cellphone while driving, but no state legislature has banned it. This year, state legislators introduced about 170 bills to address distracted driving, but passed fewer than 10.Five states and the require drivers who talk on cellphones to use hands-free devices, but research shows that using headsets can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversation distracts drivers from focusing on the road.Fourteen states have passed measures to ban texting while driving, and the Assembly sent such a bill to the governor on Friday.The states that rejected any efforts to limit distracted driving this year include .“I’m on the phone from when I leave the Capitol to when I get home, and that’s a two-hour drive,” said Tad Jones, the majority floor leader in the Oklahoma House, who helped block the legislation. “A lot of people who travel are used to using the phone.”Scientists who study distracted driving say they understand the frustrations of colleagues who publicized the dangers of tobacco. Like , they say, gadgets are considered cool but can be deadly. And the big device companies even offer warnings that remind them of labels on cigarette packs.Wireless, for instance, posts instructions on its Web sites not to talk while driving — with or without a headset. But neither Verizon nor any other cellphone company supports legislation that bans drivers from talking on the phone. And the wireless industry does not conduct research on the dangers, saying that is not its responsibility.Some researchers say that sufficient evidence exists to justify laws outlawing cellphone use for drivers — and they suggest using technology to enforce them by disabling a driver’s phone. “Just outlawing the behavior cannot possibly go very far toward getting people not to do it,” said Robert D. Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center at the . “The behavior is too ingrained and compelling.”For his part, Mr. Hill rarely talks when he drives now. His mother gave him a hands-free headset two months after the accident. She thought it would create less distraction. He tried it once, and found his mind wandering into his phone call so much that “I nearly missed a light,” he said.He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, for the death of Ms. Doyle. Now, when he is a passenger in a car, it makes him nervous when the driver starts talking on the phone. But Mr. Hill, who is polite and deferential, said he doesn’t want to badger drivers about the risks.“I hope they don’t have to go through what I did to realize it’s a problem,” he added.Sgt. Matthew Downing, a tough-talking 11-year veteran on the Oklahoma City police force, drives a car with no lights on the roof. That way, drivers are less likely to notice him as he waits for speeders.Increasingly, he sees erratic behavior — swerving across lanes, running red lights — that looks just like drunken driving. Instead, he sees drivers talking on their phones, or texting. “A ton of people pass me literally unaware of their surroundings,” he said.Sergeant Downing, who often handles traffic fatalities, arrived at the scene of Mr. Hill’s crash after paramedics had extracted Ms. Doyle, who was 61, from her car. He found Mr. Hill sitting on a fire truck, acting “hysterical.”There was no mystery about the accident’s cause; the roads were dry. “He told me he was talking on the phone and didn’t see the light,” Sergeant Downing said.“He’s a nice kid,” he said of Mr. Hill. But he said he felt angry, both at Mr. Hill and at what he sees as an epidemic of multitasking on the road. “Driving and talking are automatic,” he said.Over all, cellphone use has soared. From 1995 to 2008, the number of wireless subscribers in the increased eightfold, to 270 million, and minutes talked rose 58-fold.Last year, the federal agency dealing with road safety, the , published a study, based on researchers’ observations of drivers, suggesting that at any time during daylight hours in 2007, 11 percent — or 1.8 million drivers — were using a cellphone.And in a survey of 1,506 people last year by Nationwide Mutual , 81 percent of cellphone owners acknowledged that they talk on phones while driving, and 98 percent considered themselves safe drivers. But 45 percent said they had been hit or nearly hit by a driver talking on a phone.“When we ask people to identify the most dangerous distraction on the highway today, about half — correctly — identify cellphones,” said Bill Windsor, associate vice president for safety at Nationwide. “But they think others are dangerous, not themselves.”He and others who favor restrictions say drivers regularly make what amount to ill-informed analyses of cost-benefit tradeoffs, often deciding that the value of constant communication outweighs any risks.Seven years ago, when cellphones and services like texting were less common, federal researchers estimated that drivers using cellphones caused about 1,000 fatalities and played a role in 240,000 crashes. (In 2007, drunken driving caused 13,000 fatalities.)By other measures, American roads are becoming safer. According to the highway safety agency, the number of driving fatalities has remained around 42,000 a year for most of the last decade, though it fell to 37,261 in 2008, when gas prices rose sharply and Americans drove less.From 1997 to 2007, the number of reported accidents fell to 6 million a year from 6.7 million, according to the highway safety agency. “There are more drivers, more talking drivers,” said John Walls, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association. “If it’s so risky, then logically one would think there would be more accidents.”The association, a trade group, fought rules to ban phone use while driving until January, when it shifted to a neutral position on the issue. “I wouldn’t say, ‘Talk on the phone more and have fewer accidents,’ ” Mr. Walls added. “I’m just saying, ‘How does this square?’ ”Some scientists say this argument is flawed. “We’ve spent billions on air bags, antilock brakes, better steering, safer cars and roads, but the number of fatalities has remained constant,” said David Strayer, a professor at the and a leading researcher in the field of distracted driving.“Our return on for those billions is zero,” he added. “And that’s because we’re using devices in our cars.”Better data would help settle the debate. But 21 states do not include a box on accident forms for police to mark electronic devices as a cause. Those that now account for it started doing so only recently. Mr. Windsor of Nationwide Mutual said that such data, while valuable, would greatly underestimate the problem because it relies on driver confessions. Sometimes drivers say they just finished a call. Cellphone records are not much help because of the difficulty of establishing the precise time of an accident.“By the time you get to a crash, it’s very, very difficult to determine whether someone was talking on the phone and whether the phone caused the crash,” said Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.For Mr. Windsor and many scientists who study the issue, accident figures are not necessary to prove the risks.“The research is just so strong,” Mr. Windsor said.In a windowless room at the University of Utah, Professor Strayer has spent a decade studying driver distraction.On a recent afternoon, Anne McLaren, 19, who just finished her freshman year studying dental hygiene and who gets class for volunteer work, climbed behind the wheel of Mr. Strayer’s $100,000 driving simulator. Her task was to closely follow a white car that often slowed abruptly. A voice on a speaker phone asked Ms. McLaren questions like, “When you do a pull-up, do your palms face toward you?” and “Can you touch your elbow to your ear?”For the most part, she ably multitasked. But sometimes she took her hands from the wheel when trying to answer a question, like, “True or false: A peanut butter jar opens clockwise.” And she was so focused on her call that she seemed to miss surprises, like a body at the side of the road.Texting while driving was more difficult; she soon slammed into the virtual car in front of her.Mr. Strayer’s research, using a small camera to track his volunteers’ eye movements, shows that texting drivers regularly focus on their screens for stretches of more than five seconds.“I should pay attention to the road,” she said afterward. But sometimes it’s hard to ignore the phone, she added, like when her parents want to reach her. “My dad gets more mad if I don’t have the phone than if I’m talking and driving.”Mr. Strayer’s research, showing that multitasking drivers are four times as likely to crash as people who are focused on driving, matches the findings of two studies, in and in , of drivers on actual roads.The highway safety administration estimates that drivers using a hand-held device are at 1.3 times greater risk of a crash or near crash, and at three times the risk when dialing, compared with others who are simply driving. The agency based its conclusions on research from the Transportation Institute, which placed cameras inside cars to monitor drivers for more than a year. The study found cellphones to be the most common cause of driver distraction.Research also shows that drivers conversing with fellow passengers do not present the same danger, because adult riders help keep drivers alert and point out dangerous conditions and tend to talk less in heavy traffic or hazardous weather.Scientists note that there are limits to how much the brain can multitask. The brain has trouble assessing separate streams of information — even if one is visual and the other aural, said Steve Yantis, professor of psychological and brain sciences at .Further, he said, when people talk on the phone, they are doing more than simply listening. The words conjure images in the mind’s eye, including images of the person they are talking to. That typically doesn’t interfere with driving. The problem starts when a car swerves unexpectedly or a pedestrian steps into traffic, he said, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.“There is zero doubt that one’s driving ability is impaired when one is trying to have a cellphone conversation — whether hands-free or hand-held, it doesn’t matter,” said David E. Meyer, professor of psychology at the .In fact, some scientists argue that hands-free laws make driving riskier by effectively condoning the practice. As early as July 2003, researchers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reached that conclusion based on what they referred to, in a proposed draft of a cellphone policy for the agency, as “a significant body of research worldwide.”The draft policy said: “We are convinced that legislation forbidding the use of handheld cellphones while driving will not be effective since it will not address the problem. In fact, such legislation may erroneously imply that hands-free phones are safe to use while driving.”The agency’s current advice is that people should not use cellphones while driving and that hands-free devices do not eliminate the risks of distracted driving.Scientists are grappling, too, with perhaps the broadest question hanging over the phenomenon of distracted driving: Why do people, knowing the risk, continue to talk while driving? The answer, they say, is partly the intense social pressures to stay in touch and always be available to friends and colleagues. And there also is the neurological response of multitaskers. They show signs of addiction — to their gadgets.John Ratey, an associate professor of at Harvard University and a specialist on the science of attention, explained that when people use digital devices, they get a quick burst of adrenaline, “a squirt.” Without it, people grow bored with simpler activities like driving. Mr. Ratey said the modern brain is being rewired to crave stimulation, a condition he calls acquired .“We need that constant pizzazz, the reward, the intensity,” he said. He largely dismisses the argument that people need the time in the car to be productive. “The justification for doing work is just that — a justification to be engaged,” he said.In many legislatures, including Oklahoma’s, the concerns of such scientists have made little impression.In February, five months after the accident that killed Ms. Doyle, Sue Tibbs was in Tulsa undergoing one of her regular seven-hour treatments for .As an Oklahoma state representative, Ms. Tibbs was finishing a bill to require hands-free devices for drivers and to ban texting while driving. She had developed an interest in the issue last fall, after hearing about a growing number of crashes like the one involving Mr. Hill and Ms. Doyle, and after an Oklahoma state trooper told her he was increasingly concerned about multitasking behind the wheel.As Ms. Tibbs sat in the center, she overheard a conversation that sealed her resolve. A woman nearby talked of how her husband often became so engrossed in his cellphone calls he would miss the turn for the road to their home. The cellphone, Ms. Tibbs decided, isn’t like other distractions. “When you’re eating, you’re not concentrating like when you’re on the cellphone,” she said.On Feb. 19, the public safety committee voted 8 to 4 to send Ms. Tibbs’s bill to the full legislature. She was thrilled. But on March 12, the last day her bill could be considered, the majority floor leader, Mr. Jones, hadn’t brought up her bill. That night, she asked Mr. Jones, a fellow Republican, why. He explained that there was too much opposition, she said. Later, Ms. Tibbs said, he added another reason: she was fragile from cancer and he didn’t want her to go through a long-shot battle for the bill.Mr. Jones, in an interview, said he and his colleagues needed more evidence of the dangers before they considered restricting the freedom to talk while driving. “We’re concerned about going into the cellphone realm at this point,” he said, adding that he was not lobbied by any companies that make money from the use of devices in cars.But he said he recognized from using his phone while driving that it could be dangerous, particularly when dialing. “There’s definitely a time when you’re looking at your cellphone,” said Mr. Jones, who uses a hands-free device. “If you’re going to do it, you have to be extremely cautious.”Like Oklahoma, many states have resisted legislating against multitasking behind the wheel because there is no long-term data on crashes caused by distracted driving, said Anne Teigen, a policy specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures. But she also acknowledged the shortcomings of any such studies. “It mostly relies on self-reporting, and for insurance reasons people don’t want to admit they were on the phone,” she said.Others cite more fundamental reasons to block any such legislation. “To me, the death of freedom is far worse than the risk of talking on the phone while driving,” said Carl Wimmer, a state representative in who successfully fought a bill this year to ban talking while driving. “Why pick on cellphones?” he asked, noting that distraction comes in many forms. “You can’t legislate against stupidity.”Some states have overcome opposition to pass restrictions. Joe Simitian, a state senator in , managed to get his hands-free legislation, an effort he began in 2001, passed in 2006. He argued, based on data collected by the California Highway Patrol, that drivers using cellphones caused more fatalities than all the drivers distracted by eating, children, pets or personal hygiene.In each previous year, the bill was killed — after lobbying by cellphone carriers, including , and T-Mobile. Mr. Simitian said that in the first two years, he would visit the offices of his colleagues on the Transportation Committee on the day of the vote and “find three cellphone industry lobbyists sitting in the legislator’s office,” Mr. Simitian said. “They’d just smile.”He said they fought him even though their brochures said that distracted driving was dangerous. The exception was Verizon Wireless, which supported his efforts from the start.Opposition gradually eased, and his bill requiring use of headsets while driving took effect in July 2008. In the first six months the California law was in effect, a preliminary California Highway Patrol estimate showed that fatalities dropped 12.5 percent — saving 200 lives. Mr. Simitian said it was too soon to determine whether the law or other factors caused the drop.Mr. Simitian said one reason political opposition eased was that fellow legislators saw the dangers firsthand. “They’d come to me and say: ‘You may be bringing me around. I almost got creamed at the corner,’ ” he recalled.For its part, the cellphone industry trade group said it had dropped its objection to restricting cellphone use by drivers — it now is neutral on the subject — because it decided the industry should play no role in trying to shape public policy on the issue. “The change came after we had an epiphany that, if you will, we’re in the business of providing service, and how they use that service is at their discretion,” said Mr. Walls, the industry spokesman.But Mr. Windsor from Nationwide Mutual and others are skeptical of the cellphone industry’s explanation. They believe its position changed because its business has changed to rely less on total minutes that people spend talking. Cellphone companies’ growth is coming more from customers surfing the Internet, downloading games and using other data services — things that people typically do less of behind the wheel.Mr. Simitian believes that a ban on talking on cellphones while driving would save even more lives. But he hasn’t proposed one, and has no plans to. “It’s a political nonstarter,” he said. “It’ll be a cold day in hell before people give up their phones altogether in cars.”Not to mention other devices.Mr. Hill now owns a silver Chevrolet Silverado pickup that he bought with help from his grandmother. When he drives, he keeps his cellphone tucked in a space in the dashboard, and has set strict rules not to use it — rules he acknowledges he sometimes breaks.He is also careful to keep his eyes on the road as he searches for his Nickelback, Christian rock or other CDs to play on his stereo.His dashboard is relatively primitive compared with those of many other vehicles. Sales of multimedia systems for cars — with audio, video and GPS — were up 46 percent in the first four months of this year from a year earlier, according to the research firm NPD Group. More such systems also now come with a dock for MP3 players.Scientists say they are frightened by each new device, giving drivers more reasons to look away from the road — like searching through song titles on the small screen of an .To device makers, it’s a big and growing market, though they say they are keenly aware that drivers can become distracted. “We have a chance to create what I call the ‘digital car,’ ” said Glenn Lurie, an executive at AT&T, the service provider for iPhones. “There are phenomenal opportunities.”For instance, he said, new wireless technology could allow better real-time services, like maps that point to the closest, cheapest gas station. Mr. Lurie said devices would be developed foremost with “safety and security” in mind.But other corporations emphasize just how engrossing their in-car entertainment can be. A recent ad from Audible.com, which sells audio books, says, “you just might miss your exit on the turnpike.”Automakers also see a market for new features. , for example, offers in most of its cars a $395 Sync system, which lets drivers use phones and players with voice commands. The company says it is working to develop the product so drivers might even surf the Internet through voice commands and hear responses.Joe Berry, Ford’s director of business and product development, said Sync enhances safety by providing a hands-free experience. But he said that not using a device is still safer.The bottom line is that Ford is catering to consumer interests, Mr. Berry said, using an argument that car makers have made when the safety and fuel economy of sport utility vehicles are questioned, and used by tobacco companies as health concerns grew. The Sync product, he argues, makes drivers safer because its voice-command features let them keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.“It’s not as if you are going to be able to take this away from people,” he said of phones and other devices in cars. “They simply won’t give it up.”Mr. Berry compared the situation to eating unhealthy foods. “We, as people, don’t want to stop doing things that aren’t in our best interest,” he said.And so the fight against in-car distraction has fallen to a small band of activists, notably those who have lost a loved one. They argue that, unlike eating unhealthy foods — or for that matter, not wearing a seat belt — mobile multitasking can cost someone else’s life.When Linda Doyle was hit by Mr. Hill’s truck, she was on her way to pick up cat food. She volunteered at the Central Oklahoma Humane Society, and drove every day without fail to nearby Lake Overholser, where she fed abandoned cats.She would sometimes talk on the phone in her car. “If she was driving and I called, she would answer,” said Jennifer Smith, 35, Ms. Doyle’s daughter. “If my sister called, she would answer.”Ms. Smith, who lives in Grapevine, Tex., and is a real estate agent, says she, too, once talked incessantly while driving. “We’re all guilty of it,” she said. “I’m the first to admit it.”In her case, no longer. Ms. Smith almost always ignores the ring of an incoming call. And she has become one of the cellphone era’s answers to Mothers Against Drunk Driving. She devotes half her time to her uphill battle — contacting legislators in and Oklahoma, filing a complaint with the federal and reaching out to other victims and their families.She has talked to a handful of class-action lawyers. “They tell me this is the tobacco or asbestos case of our generation,” she said. But she says they also tell her the case would be too time-consuming and expensive.David Teater of Spring Lake, Mich., is also fighting distracted driving; he works for the National Safety Council on transportation issues. His son Joe was killed on ’s Birthday in 2004, hit by a young woman talking on the cellphone to someone from her church, where she volunteered. Even after the accident, Mr. Teater said, he had trouble breaking his cellphone habit.“With all the motivation in the world I couldn’t do it,” he said, adding that he eventually took more decisive action: “I put the cellphone in the trunk.”Some drivers who caused accidents themselves have become activists, too. Mr. Hill, as part of his misdemeanor charge, must devote 240 hours to community service — talking about the risks of distracted driving, as well as working with animals, as Ms. Doyle’s family said she would have liked.He spoke to a classroom of fellow students about his experience, sparing no details.“Their jaws just dropped,” he said. “They couldn’t believe they had someone standing in front of them who was talking on the cellphone and killed someone.”'"

"'09-07-19,'0','It seems that a bulk order from the Tel Aviv equivalent of Costco may be necessary.Then there are weightier adjustments, like getting used to being the greatest hope in Israeli basketball history.No Israeli has ever played in the N.B.A. Until last month, none had ever been drafted in the first round.When the Kings took Casspi with the 23rd pick, he became the first Israeli to secure a guaranteed contract, which will almost assuredly make him the first to play in an N.B.A. game.That moment will come this fall. The celebrations began immediately on draft night.“It was a huge festival in Israel,” said Dan Shamir, a longtime Israeli coach who worked with Casspi when Casspi was a teenager on the national team. “For many years, people were asking when Israel will have an N.B.A. player. When it actually happened, it made huge headlines.”At home in Yavne, a suburb of Tel Aviv, the 21-year-old Casspi celebrated with friends and family, and wept. The emotions were overwhelming, not only because Casspi had attained a goal, but also because he had realized a nation’s dream.Basketball is the No. 2 sport in Israel, trailing only soccer. Maccabi Tel Aviv, Casspi’s team, is considered a national treasure, with 47 championships and 5 European Cups.“Iconic,” Shamir, who now coaches Bnei Hasharon, said of Maccabi. “Players there are like rock stars in Israel.”In the days before satellite television and 500 channels, the country would practically shut down on Thursday nights, when Maccabi was on TV. “The streets were empty,” Shamir said.Next fall, thousands of Israeli alarm clocks may simultaneously wail around 4 in the morning, when N.B.A. games are broadcast. The Kings may become the second-most-popular basketball team in Israel. And Casspi will become an instant hero to millions of Israelis and Jews worldwide.He is embracing the honor, though with no small measure of anxiety.“I think all the eyes and ears in Israel, in basketball in Israel, are focused on me now,” he said, sitting behind a desk in his hotel room in Las Vegas. “There is big expectations, and all the Jewish community in the States is really excited about it. So I think there’s a big responsibility with it.”As a child, Casspi said, he would wake up early in the morning to watch N.B.A. games, particularly the Chicago Bulls. He was a huge Michael Jordan fan. But Casspi’s dream then, he said, was to play for Maccabi “because I had nobody to look up to in the N.B.A., no Israeli.”He added, “I think the young kids right now, they have somebody to look up to.”There was no egotism in his tone, just a statement of fact. Casspi hastened to add: “I’m just trying to focus on basketball. I’m not trying to think about all that.”There is much work to do on the court. The Kings had the N.B.A.’s worst record last season, 17-65, and they have not made the playoffs since 2006.A 6-foot-9, 225-pound forward, Casspi is part of a promising but raw core that also includes the fourth pick in the draft, guard Tyreke Evans. They are joining a youthful roster featuring guard Kevin Martin and center Spencer Hawes.Casspi, too, is a work in progress. He is a capable shooter, rebounder and ball handler, but he does not excel in any one area and is not considered particularly athletic. He said his goal was to become another Hedo Turkoglu, the playmaking forward from Turkey who helped guide Orlando to the N.B.A. finals.Jason Levien, the Kings’ assistant general manager, said the franchise was drawn to Casspi for his passion, toughness and tenacity. The word energy comes up often.“That’s his specialty,” said David Thorpe, a coach at IMG Academies and an analyst for ESPN, who watched Casspi during the summer league. “Energy in the N.B.A. is a real talent.”Casspi shot 33 percent in his first four summer league games, averaging 7.3 points, 3.3 rebounds and 4 turnovers. He is still trying to regain his rhythm after the whirlwind draft process and a brief holdup in paperwork that kept him from practicing with the team.Even with Maccabi, Casspi’s value was never evident in the raw statistics but in the results.“He’s fearless,” Shamir said. “When he was on the floor, things happened for them.”Before Casspi was drafted, The Jerusalem Post documented the many Israeli players who just missed making it to the N.B.A. In 1979, Miki Berkowitz was set to join the Atlanta Hawks, but Maccabi would not release him from his contract. Twenty years later, Oded Katash appeared close to joining the Knicks, but the N.B.A. lockout and contractual issues killed the deal.The Israelis Lior Eliyahu and Yotam Halperin were taken in the 2006 draft. But as second-round picks, they did not have guaranteed contracts and thus had little incentive to make the move.More than 60 other nations have been represented in the N.B.A., including Belize, Estonia and Denmark. The Middle East has produced players from Egypt and Lebanon. The first Iranian, Hamed Haddadi, arrived last season.Casspi’s arrival has energized Jews in Sacramento. A large contingent — many wearing jerseys with Casspi’s name spelled in Hebrew — turned out for a postdraft rally. They have taken Casspi on tours of the city and offered assistance in finding a house, a car and, naturally, some good restaurants.“I feel blessed, really, to be in this situation,” Casspi said.He is, however, still searching for a good Israeli restaurant and a worthy tub of hummus.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','The newly refurbished John Drew Theater at Guild Hall in East Hampton reopened with its first full-scale production, “The Glass Menagerie” by Tennessee Williams, last weekend after a two-year hiatus. And the wait was worth it: Amy Irving dazzled the audience with her nuanced portrayal of Amanda Wingfield, the play’s rueful abandoned wife and obsessively protective mother.Though the program lists four actors in the ensemble, a fifth character, the missing-in-action husband and father — a “telephone man who fell in love with long distance,” to quote Amanda — dominates the proceedings. His presence, in the form of a smiling photo stage center, continues to haunt his discarded family 16 years later. (Beowulf Boritt’s claustrophobic set, moodily lighted by Sebastian Paczynski, with its diaphanous scrim through which the outside world beckons, echoes the theme.)Tom, who refers disdainfully to “our father,” is the older of Amanda’s two children, a poet forced to work at a local shoe-company warehouse in order to support his mother and sister. Ebon Moss-Bachrach is riveting in the role, his lyrical narration segueing seamlessly into tormented exchanges with his mother.Clearly tuned in to the realities of his existence but unwilling to spend his life as a prisoner of his past, Tom will do anything, including shipping out with the merchant marine, to escape his destiny. This includes inviting home, at his mother’s urging, a work buddy named Jim O’Connor, played with an engaging charm if a bit too much suavity and ease by John Behlmann. Unwittingly, Jim is serving as gentleman caller to Laura, Tom’ s crippled, pathologically shy and isolated sister.The decision by the director, Harris Yulin, to place Laura’s beloved glass animal menagerie in a visual no-man’s land, off to one side and toward the back of the stage, is unfortunate. Add Louisa Krause’s colorless performance as Laura, and the play’s dramatic tension becomes unbalanced, skewed in the direction of mother and son.In Amy Irving’s Amanda, however, the audience is treated to an interpretation so richly satisfying and profoundly moving that questions of balance become moot. Hers is an Amanda that inspires appreciation of a mother’s pain rather than a harsh rush to judgment.The actress is commanding as she shifts from coquettish flirtatiousness to steely determination without missing a beat. And she looks positively gorgeous in the beautifully detailed period costumes designed by Martin Pakledinaz. (Theater buffs might be interested to learn that in 1984, Ms. Irving appeared at the Santa Fe Festival Theater as Laura, with her mother, Priscilla Pointer, in the role of Amanda.)'"
"'09-07-19,'0','Certainly these glum reflections were not shared by his national security adviser; he had his own.For Kissinger the business year (as recorded in his immaculate ""Record of Schedule"") ended on December 23 with visits from Admiral Thomas Moorer, the browbeaten chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff Al Haig, to discuss the effect of the Christmas Bombing, a session with his close associate, Peter Rodman, in the Map Room, a lunch date with the journalist William Safire, currently a presidential speechwriter; then, at 3:22 p.m., Nancy arrived to collect him from his office. It was a familiar mix, though less intensive than his habitual workday. Christmas Day was spent lunching with Joseph Alsop, his favorite and most trusted among the Washington journalists, at 2720 Dumbarton Avenue in Georgetown, and then dining with Evangeline Bruceį in her grand abode nearby.Though Washington had closed down for the holidays, the next day, December 26, a key message from Hanoi brought Kissinger racing back to his office. It was the signal the White House had anxiously been awaiting; it was also the day of one of the biggest raids by the giant B-52s. The North Vietnamese had agreed to a resumption of the Paris peace talks as soon as the U.S. bombing stopped, and registered its willingness to settle ""the remaining questions with the U.S. side."" It looked like the ultimate climb-down by Hanoi. Kissinger observed in his memoirs, ""We had not heard such a polite tone from the North Vietnamese since the middle of October."" He signaled back suggesting a resumption of talks on January 8 (ultimately deferred to the 23rd). The bombing was ceased forthwith. A visit from the White House barber, and at 2:50 p.m. Kissinger took off — alone — on a wellearned six-day holiday to Palm Springs in the Southern California desert.For a man whose mind was never still, it was a time for serious reflection. While strolling down the beach near the San Clemente White House, the weekend before the elections in November 1972, Kissinger had mused gloomily to author Theodore ""Teddy"" White: ""How do you withdraw? How do you get out of a situation where every single crisis around the world gets dumped on us?""Not since conversing with grandees like George Marshall and Dean Acheson could White recall ""the use of American power so carefully explained"" as in that conversation. A passerby shook Kissinger by the hand, thanking him ""for peace."" Kissinger seemed taken aback, exclaiming, ""Where else could it happen but in a country like this.... To let a foreigner make peace for you, to accept a man like me — I even have a foreign accent!""Events had taken a distinctly encouraging upturn since that November stroll, but similar thoughts were not far from the forefront of Kissinger's mind over the Christmas break. The prospects for the coming year looked good, certainly better than they had at the same time twelve months ago. As he apostrophized the coming year of 1973 in his memoirs, it was to begin ""with glittering promise; rarely had a Presidential term started with such bright foreign policy prospects.""As his close associate on most of his ventures at that time, Winston Lord, adumbrated these heady days to the author, ""U.S. foreign policy was at an absolute peak,"" with the Nixon-Kissinger team looking ""poised to continue to build a structure of peace."" Nixon had been reelected in a landslide, the Vietnam War was (or looked to be) over; the Middle East seemed stable; there was the opening to China to build on; and major progress in détente with the Soviet Union. ""Now they could continue progress on those fronts while turning to issues that needed more attention; relations with Europe and Japan (especially after the shock of China), Middle East, other regions including our own backyard, 'newer' issues like energy, North-South relations, etc. Congress buoyed by an end to Vietnam War and dramatic summits and progress with two Communist giants.""There was just one small, one very small, blip. It was called Watergate.Back in the idyllic European peacetime summer of 1870, British foreign minister Lord Granville had been able to discern, justly so it seemed at the time, not ""a cloud in the sky."" Yet three months later Emperor Louis-Napoleon's Third Empire had collapsed, crushed by a triumphant Prussia, the emperor himself forced to abdicate; the whole European order had been turned upside down. In 1870 the whole balance of power in Europe had changed overnight. In America, though the skies were perhaps not so cloudless, there was certainly no sense of the drama that lay ahead: a major war in the Middle East, but — with far profounder significance — the leader of the free world, successor to Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, disgraced and disabled. But, perhaps less than a cloud on the horizon, Watergate was more like a shark circling, as of January 1973 at a respectful distance, still -but slowly out there moving in. Whether, that lonely Christmas of 1972, the ripples in the water figured yet anywhere near the forefront of the mysterious, dark reflections — brooding on thoughts of revenge against his many foes — of Richard Milhous Nixon, will never be known. There were rumblings over the break-in at the Watergate complex the previous summer; but that probably caused the least of disturbance to the slumbers of this secretive man. We'll never know. Yet there was no reason to think they did. Had he not just won one of the most spectacular reelection victories of all time? So why the dark thoughts, the sadness?Certainly they were unlikely to have featured in those of his national security adviser (he of course had his own worries, but not such torments). In his memoirs Kissinger wrote, ""We had begun Nixon's second term imagining that we were on the threshold of a creative new era in international affairs; seldom, if ever, had so many elements of foreign policy appeared malleable simultaneously.""Malleable. However, ""Within months we confronted a nightmarish collapse of authority at home and a desperate struggle to keep foreign adversaries from transforming it into an assault on our nation's security."" Whereas, from a diplomat's point of view, he saw Nixon's first term having formed ""in a sense an adolescence.... Diplomacy in the second term, which ended abruptly in the late summer of 1974, was a rude accession of maturity."" As far as his own role was concerned, he summarized, it was to fall ""to me to attempt to insulate foreign policy as much as possible from the domestic catastrophe."" But ""all our calculations were soon to be overwhelmed by the elemental catastrophe of Watergate.""With the full impact of that foolish break-in still imperceptible to him, Kissinger could not help but look toward 1973 in a ""mood compounded of elation and relief."" This was not, however, how he regarded his own future. ""I thought we were then in a superb governmental position -everything seemed to be running well,"" he told me. ""But I had really made up my mind to have left by the latest by the end of 1973. I was thinking of going to Oxford, to All Souls. I had had talks with Isaiah Berlin (the famous philosopher) ... the international situation was very strong and I thought, personally, my relations with Nixon could not go on much longer. We had just been made Joint Men of the Year by Time — now this was something impossible for a president to share with another."" This surely said something about the curiously insecure jealousy of the most powerful man in the Western world. ""Also,"" continued Kissinger, ""I was having a lot of nagging from [Chief of Staff Bob] Haldeman about how many times I was meeting Nixon. I didn't think I could go on juggling the NSC with State."" There lurked too the steadily worsening relationship between him and his office and the worthy but unimpressive secretary of state, William P. Rogers, a Washington lawyer — a lame, if not a dead, duck secretary of state. Repeatedly Kissinger had urged Nixon to let him take over at State. He was addressing deaf ears. To Kissinger's chagrin, Nixon had consistently refused.What did Kissinger plan to do among those dreaming spires of Oxford? ""Maybe work on my memoirs ..."" He continued: ""David Bruce, whom I hugely admired, also felt I should leave — so by the end of 1972 I had a period of expecting to leave by the end of '73, and a conviction that Nixon and I had left foreign policy in extremely good shape."" As he outlined it in his memoirs, ""I intended to stay on long enough in 1973 to see the peace in Indochina established; to launch the new initiative toward the industrial democracies that came to be known as the Year of Europe; and to consolidate the new Moscow-Washington-Peking triangle.""But was he being entirely sincere? There was always something compulsively irresistible about Washington to any outsider who had once sampled its heady embrace; power, Kissinger himself was once quoted as saying, was the ""ultimate aphrodisiac.""So, after the Christmas break, the working year of 1973 began on January 3, with a fairly quiet day in the life of the president's national security adviser:On the 7th he set off to Paris, once more, on his seventeenth trip to negotiate with the North Vietnamese.Any which way you looked at it, by any criterion — and this was not peculiarly related to Henry Kissinger's role in it — 1973 was not an ordinary year. Whole books have been written about it. One most recently, by Andreas Killen, identifies it, for the United States at any rate, as ""the decade's pivotal year ... a year of shattering political crisis and of remarkable cultural ferment."" In it Killen saw three major shocks to the United States:1. Defeat in Vietnam (though it may not have quite seemed so at the time).2. Watergate, calling, by the year's end, for presidential impeachment.All three were to occur on Henry Kissinger's watch.Though it may have marked a low point in U.S. history, it was a bountiful year for moviemakers, especially those catering to violent and to pornographic tastes. Last Tango in Paris, Deep Throat, The Exorcist, and The Godfather all contributed to make 1972-74 box office record years. In the fall of 1973, Erica Jong assaulted the last surviving bastions of old-fashioned modesty with her Fear of Flying. Assisted by the new technology, lightweight cameras, and abandon of all inhibition, U.S. TV scored a runaway success through a twelve-part series called An American Family. In a precursor of the horrors of ""reality television"" three decades later, week by week the American public would hunker down to watch as the Loud family lived their daily lives, and tore themselves apart in Santa Barbara — all for the benefit of the eager media. Amazingly the Louds had actually volunteered for the purgatory that they were submitted to. By the year's end the couple had gotten divorced. Their son, Lance, had been outed as a transvestite. During the series he became successively the darling then the hate-object of the gay community, and was to admit ""television swallowed my family."" An identical sentiment might just as well have been voiced by the first lady, Pat Nixon. By a curious stroke of fate, the premiere of the Loud family crucifixion took place the very day that Senate Democrats first voted to investigate Watergate — January 11, 1973, while the taping equipment for both the White House and the Loud house had evidently also been installed at about the same time. Equally, in the course of the series, Pat Loud — with extraordinary parallelism to the Plumbers of Watergate — is seen rifling her husband's files for evidence of his infidelity.Each series was to rival the other for prime time watching as the year went on.But was 1973 worse than any other year? — or did it just establish a benchmark for the future?Certainly the media was coming to assume an increasingly dominant role in American public life. As Abigail McCarthy, the wife of defeated presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy, bemoaned: ""In public life one learns very quickly that everyone wants to be on television. There are very few private people left."" Looking back from the no less agitated vantage point of 2008, some might even see 1973 as the year the media burst out of Pandora's Box, never to be recaptured, as an unelected power took over from the legitimately elected democratic rulers. Doubtless this was how Richard Nixon saw it.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','Some years ago, I became involved in a spirited debate with an editor who was compiling a volume of essays on reading and writing, to which I had contributed a chapter. Apparently, I had forgotten to mention the most important rule of fiction: Every short story is required to have a moment of epiphany, a climax in which a character realizes, and is changed by, some transformative truth. I said I didn’t believe this was an actual rule. I offered to list dozens of masterpieces in which no one learns anything about anything, tales whose heroes are, at the end, not one iota more enlightened than they were at the beginning. I can’t recall how (or if) our disagreement was resolved, but the questions it raised stayed with me. So, reading Jean Thompson’s “Do Not Deny Me,” I kept thinking how much that editor would have enjoyed these stories, most of which feature a flash of recognition or under­standing, after which nothing in their protagonists’ lives will ever remain the same.As in her earlier collection “Who Do You Love,” a finalist for the National Book Award, Thompson populates her fiction with characters who, on the surface, could hardly be more ordinary, more like the folks down the block. Male and female, old and young, they teach school, stitch quilts, work in offices and hardware stores, and at jobs with so little bearing on their identity that we never learn exactly what they do. When they fall from grace, their crimes — baking brownies and eating the entire batch, spying on the neighbors, dabbling in a bit of petty fraud to stave off homelessness — are the sort of misdemeanors that we ourselves may have committed, or at least considered. They endure problems — aging, illness, bereavement, divorce, professional and romantic failure — that are no less painful for being unexceptional. Indeed, the narrator of “Liberty Tax” watches her hopes for the future swirl down a drain that is by now all too familiar to a large segment of our population; her house is worth less than its mortgage, and her newly unemployed husband has been given four months’ severance pay and the option of purchasing a year of health insurance with the money they no longer have.These sensible souls take such pride in their refusal to stray from the straight and narrow that they are utterly thrown off balance when their luck takes a precipitous turn for the worse. So the heroine of the title story, the strongest and most well written in the collection, is unhinged by the sudden, unexpected death of her boyfriend of four months:“She had always thought of herself as practical, steady, reliable to the point of dullness. Different people she knew had launched themselves in odd directions, had a fling at Buddhism or Christian farming co-ops, embraced animal rights or Alcoholics Anonymous, or changed genders, adopted Chinese girl babies, any manner of dramatic transformations. All the while Julia went about her business, put money in her 401(k), changed her oil and antifreeze on schedule, remembered people’s birthdays. She’d been unhappy at times, all the usual growing-up stuff: loneliness, self-hatred, the boys who hadn’t loved her back, the drip drip drip of her mother’s criticism. Then later, the disappointments of adulthood: doubt, fatigue, the realization that some struggles were the sort that lasted the rest of your life. She thought she’d faced her share of suffering, thought she’d acquired solid credentials. But nothing had upended her as this had, unraveled her nature to the point where she might believe anything of herself, and of the confounding world.”What’s most admirable about Thompson’s fiction is her unflagging patience with the flaws and limitations of these decent people; even the narrator of the aptly titled “Mr. Rat,” a guy so self-­centered as to give narcissism a bad name, ultimately reveals the insecurity and fear concealed beneath the insensitive bluster and shallow self-regard. Time and again, her characters are granted temporary or permanent reprieves from the bleakness of their daily routines, though their prospects are less likely to improve than their attitudes, their willingness to face their predicaments with resignation or acceptance. In some cases, a distressing event gives rise to a more optimistic perspective; in “Smash,” a serious auto accident makes an unhappily married man feel “finer than fine” about his cramped existence. More frequently, an opportunity to observe the sufferings of others, and to measure them against one’s own sorrows, offers consolation. The lonely unmarried woman at the center of “Wilderness” is comforted by a visit to a college friend whose suburban domestic idyll turns out to be a private hell of infidelity and betrayal. Reading this story, and others with a similar design, I noticed that I was thinking, somewhat unhappily, of the adage about the shoeless individual cured of self-pity by a providential encounter with a man who has no feet.Given how sympathetic Thompson’s characters are, and how tenderly she cares for them, I found it puzzling that after a while, I was anticipating the epiphanic, redemptive plot turns with something closer to apprehension than to the relief and satisfaction I assumed I was meant to feel. Simultaneously, the same qualities that arouse our compassion and make these men and women so appealing — their modesty and humility, their bravery and resilience in the face of un­deserved misfortune — began to seem ever so slightly oppressive. I kept putting down the book to ponder how the greatest writers, the Chekhovs and the Alice Munros, can make the quotidian seem transcendent, while others (not that Thompson is necessarily among these) merely remind us of the claustrophobia-inducing banality of the everyday.Part of the trouble with “Do Not Deny Me” may be that the structure of these stories can seem more formulaic than organic. At times, Thompson appears so determined to part the clouds and let a ray of light shine through that the convenient change, however subtle, in the psychic weather can border on the implausible. In one of the least successful fictions, “The Woman at the Well,” a jaded prisoner who watches a fellow inmate possessed by the holy spirit during a Bible study session is persuaded that “love was the only way back into heaven.” However true to the plainspoken straight­forwardness of the characters whose inner depths it plumbs, Thompson’s language rarely soars beyond the serviceable and competent to impress us with a closely observed detail, an original perception, an elegant or unexpected turn of phrase. Too often, she seems more interested in finding something with which the reader can safely identify (oh, right, I remember the time I ate all those brownies after the divorce) than in risking the searing, disquieting honesty that makes us (as we do, reading Munro) see and admit something secret and previously hidden about ourselves, our behavior and the world in which we live. It’s the reader, not the character, whose epiphany can make a story memorable.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','Let’s face it: happiness is banal. We may desire loving relationships in real life — if you believe the magazines, anyway — but in literature, they make for dull and static prose. So if a novel begins with a happy couple, things usually sour by the end.“A Happy Marriage,” by Rafael Yglesias, begins in the 1970s, on the night the 21-year-old Enrique Sabas meets Margaret Cohen in his Greenwich Village apartment. “He had ordered her in,” the opening sentence provokes, like “take-out Chinese.” A mutual friend has driven Enrique crazy by talking endlessly about this “extraordinary” woman but failing to define what makes her so special. Enrique — who sold his first novel at the wildly precocious age of 16, then dropped out of high school to write full time — prizes precise language and believes nothing is so ephemeral it can’t be pinned down in words. He goads his friend into producing the mystery woman by declaring that she must not exist. The stakes are high, but after just one night of cheap wine, unfiltered Camels and witty banter, “Margaret, or at least her bright blue eyes, . . . snapped his brittle heart.”The second chapter opens on a bleak night 30 years later. Margaret, now Enrique’s wife, is in her 50s, at the end of an excruciating three-year battle with cancer. “You have to help me die,” she begs her husband. This is a tall order. She needs him to nurse her; to prevent anyone from sustaining her when she falls into a coma; and to tell her parents she won’t be buried in their family plot — tough tasks, but also concrete ways he can help. Harder is accepting that her life is ending, that “their marriage was a mystery he was going to lose, despite 27 years living inside it, before he understood who they were.”This mystery propels the book forward, as Enrique internally drafts and revises his parting words to his wife, determined to get them right. He wants to nail down exactly what she has meant to him, so he can let her know in no uncertain terms how much he will miss her. The title of this novel is not ironic. This is, fundamentally, the story of a happy marriage. But it’s not simple, because marriage — like love — isn’t static. And Enrique is ruthlessly honest in his quest to figure out what made his last.Bolstering the case for the banality of happiness, some of the book’s strongest sections describe the most challenging periods in their relationship. For their first few years together, Enrique is overcome with passion for Margaret. But their characters differ in fundamental ways, causing friction. Enrique is moody, insecure in his desire to become a best-selling author. Margaret, by contrast, seems unambitious to him. She is a talented artist, and he can’t fathom why she gives up after a first round of rejections from galleries. One chapter chronicles the birthday gifts that he presents to her over the years: the diamond earrings that were not her taste, the cumbersome vintage camera, the unromantic blender. On the surface, this is classic Mars-Venus stuff, the knucklehead husband who doesn’t get his fussy wife. But Enrique prides himself on being a keen observer of human character. It bothers him that he can’t please Margaret. While he is relentlessly expressive, she is restrained, both verbally and in the bedroom, always holding something back.Their marriage hits a low after the birth of their first child, when her libido dwindles and he connects with another woman who is ambitious and gregarious, a seemingly better match. He considers leaving Margaret, until a couples’ counselor asks her what she wants. In the pause that follows, Enrique realizes that he has no idea what she will say. The thing that troubles him about her — her self-containment — is also what brings him back. Again, the mystery of Margaret has him hooked. In another book, an epiphany at a counseling session might seem a cheap device for character advancement. But for the voluble Enrique, in New York City in the 1980s, it feels almost embarrassingly realistic.'"
"'09-07-19,'0','“The MiTo is going to help us re-establish the Alfa brand in the United States,” said Richard Gadeselli, vice president for communications of the Fiat Group, in a recent interview at the company’s headquarters here.Though Alfa Romeo left the American market in 1995, the MiTo hatchback will not really be the first new Alfa to appear in the United States since then. The 8C Competizione and Spider have been available through select Ferrari and Maserati dealers since last year. Considering the stratospheric prices of the limited-edition, hand-built 8C, the MiTo will be the first new Alfa intended for general audiences.Both the MiTo and the 500 will be sold at Chrysler — not Ferrari — dealerships, though they will still wear Alfa and Fiat badges. American-market prices have not been announced, but $20,000 or so seems likely for the MiTo and mid-teens for the 500.The autostrada connecting Milan and Turin was an appropriate venue for a test drive; the MiTo, which is pronounced me-TOE and sounds like an athlete’s foot remedy, is in fact a melding of the names of those cities. Milan, where Alfa was founded in 1910, is the location of the Centro Stile design studio where the MiTo was conceived, and Turin — Italy’s Motor City — is where it is built.Mito is also the Italian word for myth or legend.A public naming contest was held for the car in 2007, after it was introduced as a design study. “Furioso” was the winning name, but intervention by the marketing department resulted in MiTo instead. Catchy, huh?An Alfa Romeo in Giulietta red — which sounds vaguely Shakespearean — would seem to fit the dictionary definition of sports car. But while the MiTo is sporty, it is no sports car; Alfa calls it a three-door “supermini.” Interestingly, the MiTo — whose footprint is similar to a VW New Beetle — is built on the Gamma small-car platform developed by General Motors during its short-lived venture with Fiat (which G.M. paid $2 billion to exit). The Fiat Punto and Opel Corsa also use this versatile front-drive platform.Don’t be fooled by photos that make the MiTo look sleek; up close, it’s a jelly bean. The fish-eye headlights and arrowhead grille provide retro touches. The Mini Cooper is its likely target.The front buckets looked up-market and they were sporty, well contoured and inviting. Two people — perhaps three in a pinch — will fit in back. Controls were nicely laid out, although the optional navigation system is an odd, tiny-screen thing mounted on a pedestal atop the dash.The instrument panel had a textured faux-carbon-fiber pattern — an appealing way to make economical materials look richer. The tilting-and-telescoping steering wheel could be easily adjusted. But the steering felt rubbery with a dead zone at high noon. The MiTo handles competently despite a basic beam-axle rear suspension and MacPherson struts in front.There’s an adjustable DNA switch — it stands for Dynamic, Normal and All-Weather modes — that recalibrates the engine, brakes, steering and suspension for each condition. Over all, the MiTo tracks with accuracy, though it is fairly unforgiving on rough pavement.My test car had a 6-speed manual transmission mated to a 1.4-liter turbocharged gasoline engine, with 155 horsepower and the promise of 0-to-60 m.p.h. sprints in eight seconds. I averaged about 36 m.p.g. over 1,200 miles of varied driving.Coming this fall will be Fiat’s Multiair technology, which optimizes the engine’s air-fuel mixture to increase horsepower and torque, improve mileage and reduce emissions. A 237-horsepower 1.8-liter engine is in the works, and it may be what Americans get. If so, 0-to-60 times for the 2,500-pound car could drop to five seconds flat.Performance like that may help pave the way for other Alfas. But, fellow Americans, shouldn’t we get our own naming contest?'"

"'09-07-19,'0','Re “Hire That Hot Tenor Years in Advance, and Hope for the Best” by Anthony Tommasini [July 12]:A tenor with the flu may be a sick kitten to his family and friends, but to his fans and the opera house director who hired him, he is a dog with rabies.For example I am thinking of Luciano Pavarotti. He suffered so many health problems, and consequently so many cancellations, that disgruntled fans dubbed him “Mr. Cancellation.” I recall when a last-minute bout of flu made him cancel several Metropolitan Opera performances of “Tosca” in 2002. He was too sick to comply with the request of the general manager, Joseph Volpe, that he at least apologize to his devastated audience. For he was, indeed, as weak as a sick kitten, and not the rabid dog that the media made him out to be.Peter Gelb, the Met’s current general manager, implies that even dependable, young, healthy singers are always a “calculated risk” when hired years in advance. Yet isn’t every live opera performance — from the superstar singers and conductor, down to the orchestra musicians and stagehands — a “calculated risk” well worth taking?

"'09-07-20,'1','One girl announces she has punctured her foot on a hypodermic needle, while a biker says he saw a seagull “choking on a corn dog.”The end of the spot mentions “cigarette butts, soda cans, a glasses’ case, a diaper and a tennis shoe without a lace,” before the teenagers sing, “The party isn’t over till we trash the place, let’s trash the beach!”Then flash the words, “Actually, let’s not,” in a 1960’s-style font, with the URL of Keep California Beautiful’s Web site.The spot is the second public service announcement created by BBDO West for Keep California, a 20-year-old, Sacramento-based, nonprofit organization; its board of directors includes government officials and executives from McDonald’s, the Walt Disney Company and Northrop Grumman. The first spot, released three years ago, spoofed “The Sopranos.” It shows two thugs throwing a body wrapped in a carpet off a dock; one drinks from a plastic bottle, hesitating before pitching the bottle into a recycling bin. The tagline says, “Redeem yourself. Recycle. KeepCaliforniaBeautiful.org.”Keep California Beuatiful helps more than 200 California communities with clean-up and beautification efforts, including the annual Great American Cleanup, during which volunteers collect litter and trash across the state. During last year’s cleanup alone, volunteers removed almost 2.2 million pounds of litter and debris, saving state and local governments an estimated $4.7 million in labor costs.Christine Flowers-Ewing, executive director of KCB, said the marine debris problem might well be exacerbated this summer, as more Californians vacation closer to home to save money: According to a poll last fall by TripAdvisor, the Web site that carries user-generated hotel reviews, 61 perecnt of travelers said they would visit a beach destination this year, while 60 percent of respondents to a Harris Poll survey in May said they hoped to economize on vacations this summer by finding less expensive activities, and half said they would vacation near home.Roz Romney, a creative director at BBDO West, said the prospect of “a million people descending on the beach on a holiday weekend, and leaving tons and tons of trash behind, made us want to get out there with something that will potentially grab people’s attention.”“We didn’t want to do something preachy, boring,” she said, adding that the new spot provided the opportunity to skewer the “Beach Blanket Bingo” genre, “contrasting innocent teens with what they’re actually doing.”The spot’s director, Geordie Stephens of Tool of North America, a Santa Monica-based production company, who is himself a surfer, said, “I’ve watched for years the deterioration of beaches and the lack of effort of people to clean up after themselves. We felt that if we made something really impactful, maybe they’d think twice about leaving their leftover picnic food and trash.”“The irony of the entire project is that films like ‘Gidget’ and ‘Beach Blanket Bingo’ showed very pristine beaches that are a happy place to be. People still have the perception that beaches have beautiful, white sand, and that the ocean has clean water, and are shocked that that vision no longer exists,” he added.Mr. Stephens and Ms. Romney say the spot is aimed at adults, particularly young adults in their 20’s, who visit and party at California’s beaches; the state’s coastline is approximately 1,100 miles long.The spot’s retro flavor should appeal to viewers of all ages, said Nick Bartle, director of behavioral planning for BBDO North America, because in stressful economic times, people find comfort and security in the familiar.Keep California Beautiful has given the new spot to Keep America Beautiful, the national organization, for dissemination in other states with beaches, either on the ocean or on rivers or lakes.Keep America Beautiful, which has a network of almost 1,000 state and local groups that develop public-private environmental partnerships and programs, created the 1971 public service spot starring the American Indian actor, Iron Eyes Cody.Rob Wallace, a spokesman for Keep America, said, “While the famous ‘Crying Indian’ campaign had a huge effect on an entire generation, one thing we’re finding is that negative messages, and messages that use guilt as a motivator, don’t sit well with today’s young people. Doom and gloom has turned them cynical. As a result, they like humor. They appreciate irony. Keep California Beautiful, through their new p.s.a., is keeping the message light but also making a point, that in this day and age, littering is just ridiculous.”'"

"'09-07-20,'1','Most Americans think swine flu will be back with a vengeance in the fall, with almost 6 in 10 saying they believe a serious outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) is likely, a new survey has found.But while most adults are not overly concerned about their own health or that of their families, they are worried about the financial hit they will take if illness or school closings keep them home from work, according to the survey by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health.Some 44 percent of those surveyed said they would lose income if they missed work for a week to 10 days due to illness, and a quarter said they could lose their jobs or businesses altogether.Parents with children in school and day care were similarly concerned about the impact of extended school closings. More than half said they or another member of the household would have to miss work to care for children if schools or day care centers were closed for two weeks.Some 43 percent of parents said the loss of income would cause financial hardship, and 26 percent said it could cost them their jobs.Dr. Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at the school, said the findings are a “wake-up call” to businesses that they need to reexamine their sick leave policies.“It’s really clear: we live in a country where parents work. It’s not 1918 anymore, where most families had someone who stayed at home,” Dr. Blendon said. “Unless we have some general leave polices that are supportive of people, we’re going to have a lot of families in very difficult economic circumstances very quickly.”'"

"'09-07-20,'1','No Italian golfer has made this kind of impact since Costantino Rocca was sinking putts and puffing cigarettes in the 1990s. Rocca and the Spaniard Severiano Ballesteros are two of Manassero’s role models: Rocca because he was Italian and Ballesteros because of his intuitive style of play.“Seve was playing another golf; I don’t know how to say it,” Manassero said.The great who had the biggest effect on Manassero’s game this week was 59-year-old Tom Watson, who played with Manassero during the first two rounds and bonded with him enough to exchange hand slaps with him after they each made long birdies at 16.“Playing with Tom Watson, I grow up a little bit,” he said. “Because even if he doesn’t say something to you, even if he doesn’t give you advice, you grow up watching him.”FISHER’S ROCKY FINALE With no urgent phone call or text message coming from his pregnant wife, Ross Fisher took to the Ailsa course once more in the crosswind. After three holes and two birdies, he had an early two-shot lead over Tom Watson.The only thing that seemed capable of causing him trouble was a message from his wife, Jo, telling him that she had gone into labor. Fisher had said that if it happened, even during the final round, he was going to leave to be by her side.But Watson’s fairy-tale tournament was not the only one that came apart. Fisher clearly was not ready for what hit him, and Britain’s 10-year drought at the British Open continues. With his name atop the leader board for the first time, Fisher proceeded to drop seven shots in just five holes, including a quadruple-bogey 8 on the fifth. He fell from five under par to two over par as the galleries at Turnberry groaned at times and watched in embarrassed silence at others as it became all too easy to hear the rumble of the nearby sea.“I’ve tasted being the leader of the Open championship, so it’s pretty cool,” Fisher said. “But unfortunately, it didn’t last.”He got lucky for a hole. At the par-3 fourth, his tee shot flew right onto a rough-covered ridge to the right of the green. It ended up landing next to two cameras left in the grass by a photographer, nestling between a long lens and a neck strap. A marshal was soon supervising the removal of the equipment, which had helped his ball avoid falling too deep into trouble, and Fisher was leaving the hole with a bogey and a two-shot lead.But there would be no more great escapes. On the fifth, Fisher hit an iron off the tee that went right in the crosswind again. This time, it ended up in thick rough on a grassy knoll not far from that of his playing partner and compatriot Lee Westwood.Westwood would not get to hit his ball for a little while, however. Fisher needed two shots to remove his from the rough and when his second shot did reach the air it sailed into the thick rough on the other side of the fairway, where Fisher eventually decided that his lie was unplayable.Four shots later, Fisher had a quadruple-bogey 8 and no more lead. He finished in an 11-way tie for 13th place. But with his wife five days overdue to give birth to their first child, Fisher has something more important than a golf tournament in his future.“I’ve just switched my phone on, so I’ll finish with you guys here and try to get out of here,” Fisher told a group of reporters. “Fingers crossed, next couple of days I’ll become a dad.”WESTWOOD’S MISCALCULATION After playing an astonishing shot from a deep fairway bunker at the final hole, Lee Westwood left himself with a long birdie putt he thought he needed to stay in contention for the Open.With Tom Watson a shot ahead at three under going to the last hole, Stewart Cink was in the clubhouse at two under. Westwood believed he had to make the 60-foot putt and attacked the pin. He sent it 10 feet past, missed that and slipped out of contention at one under.“I’ve gone from frustration to sickness now,” Westwood said after finishing tied for third.At last year’s United States Open at Torrey Pines, he failed to sink a putt on the final green to miss out on the title. On Sunday, he watched Stewart Cink beat Tom Watson in a playoff after shooting a 1-over 71 in the final round. (AP)WOOD TO THE MASTERS Chris Wood has played in two majors and has finished in the top five both times. He was a 20-year-old amateur last year at Royal Birkdale when he tied for fifth, which made him eligible for this British Open. By matching the low score of the final round, a three-under 67, Wood wound up tied for third. This finish made him eligible for the Masters, so Wood will have his first trip to Augusta National. ... Paul Lawrie had a double eagle — the rarest shot in golf — by holing out a 4-iron from 213 yards on the par-5 seventh. Thomas Levet made a hole-in-one on the 15th hole on his way to a 71. (AP)'"
"'09-07-20,'1','To understand the Democratic Party and its reflexes on health care, look no further than Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut.As a senator’s son and a former national Democratic chairman, Mr. Dodd carries the party’s impulses in his DNA. As a stand-in for his ailing friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts on the Senate’s health committee, he has met President Obama’s call for prompt action on legislation greatly expanding coverage for the uninsured  on a party-line vote.“Would I prefer it’s bipartisan? You bet I would,” Mr. Dodd said in an interview. “I think that sustains you over a longer period of time.”“But given the choice between a bipartisan bill that’s weak and doesn’t do much for my people at home, or one that is a partisan bill that actually gets more done,” he added, the second “is where I’m going.”House Democratic leaders have mirrored Mr. Dodd’s approach and initial success. Not coincidentally for the party of government activism, both have lavished more attention on expanding coverage to the more than 45 million Americans now uninsured than on controlling medical costs, which Mr. Obama also emphasizes.The question now facing Mr. Dodd, his colleagues and the White House is whether to continue moving briskly on that familiar path. The alternative course is slower, harder and less politically expedient  but perhaps more able to attract Republican cooperation and curb health expenses.It’s no surprise that cost control has gotten relatively short shrift so far  and not merely because Democrats bend naturally toward larger rather than smaller government services. No one knows what will work.Health economists see promise in steps like the improved management of chronic diseases, increased focus on preventive care and advances in health information technology. But because those efforts have little track record, budget scorekeepers have trouble predicting their value.Other potential cost-saving changes, like shifting away from reimbursing medical providers based on the volume of services provided, are difficult for lawmakers to explain.Still others are all too easy to understand  and politically risky. Democrats and Republicans alike flee from talk of rationing medical services, and of using the tax code to curtail health benefits that employers provide.Yet after decades of health care inflation exceeding inflation in other sectors, all those steps may be necessary to achieve Mr. Obama’s ambition of “bending the cost curve” on what amounts to one-sixth of the American economy.After the Congressional Budget Office director, Douglas W. Elmendorf, cast doubt last week on the cost implications of Democratic bills moving on Capitol Hill, that approach  what Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and 2008 presidential candidate, referred to as “all of the above” in discussing energy policy  began receiving fresh attention.Mr. Obama called for augmenting a Medicare advisory board with new powers to reduce spending, the way a military base-closing commission has helped shutter unneeded defense installations. House leaders quickly embraced a beefed-up “Med-Pac,” which may be the closest lawmakers come to rationing care, if only indirectly.House leaders are seeking floor passage of their bill before the August recess, as Mr. Obama has requested. This week, attention will focus on whether Mr. Dodd and his Senate colleagues can do the same.Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the Finance Committee chairman, has lagged behind Mr. Dodd as he negotiates with Republicans on a bipartisan approach. Some Democrats argue that, using the expedited procedures of “reconciliation,” they can set aside that effort and pass legislation without Republicans.That idea carries at least two problems. One, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Sunday, is that a Democrats-only bill would deny Mr. Obama and his party political “cover” in elections.The other is that efforts to lure a half-dozen or so Republican senators revolve largely around steps that could curb costs, like taxing some health benefits that employers now give workers tax-free.In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama spoke out against Mr. McCain’s proposal to tax benefits; labor unions fiercely oppose the idea as a raid on middle-class workers. Moreover, Mr. Dodd and White House electoral strategists see it as a political trap, since most Republicans would vote against the measure anyway and use it to attack Democrats.Yet Mr. Baucus, joined by some health policy experts inside and outside the administration, sees taxing benefits as a potential linchpin of compromise that could raise revenue for expanded coverage and reduce incentives for excessive spending at the same time.Mr. Dodd says the absent Mr. Kennedy, even as he battles brain cancer, “would crawl over broken glass to be here” if needed to break a health care stalemate. The Democrats’ quandary over whether and how to ramp up cost controls could yet give Mr. Kennedy the chance to have such an impact.'"
"'09-07-20,'1','“I’ve been working really hard the last two or three months on my putting, and my whole mental approach to golf,” he said. “I had a great solid routine there. I knew what I was looking at, and I hit that putt with really — really without a care in the world of whether it went in or whether it missed. But a blank mind like that is the best way to approach a pressure-packed situation, and I was proud of myself the way I handled that.”Cink makes it sound simple, but that has often not been the case. Though he was a star golfer at Georgia Tech and the rookie of the year on the PGA Tour in 1997, he had to shake free of the yips in the early 2000s as short putts were too often turning into existential questions. He battled the problem with the help of psychoanalysis and the tough love of his wife, Lisa. It improved, but not so much that he did not feel the need to shift to a belly putter.He did not use it at Turnberry, however. In May, unhappy with his recent performances, he decided to “totally overhaul” his putting by going back to the short putter and developing a preshot routine that would help him keep his mind clear under duress.“I thought if I stayed with the long putter that it would be too easy for me to fall back into the old warm and fuzzy feelings,” Cink said. “So I decided to scrap everything and start over.”He was not pressure-proof on Sunday. At No. 16, for example, he missed a 6-footer for par that might have given him some late-night pause in the months ahead if not for the way the blustery day turned out. Of the 12 golfers who went out in the final six groups Sunday, Cink, who started the day three shots off the lead, was the only man who broke par.“I just felt so calm,” Cink said. “I never even felt nervous at all. I mean, literally, I did not feel nervous today in a situation that, in the past, I would be extremely nervous. Somebody at a major championships always has that calm peace about them, and I had it today.”Perhaps it helped that Cink, with Watson generating so much buzz, remained relatively low on the horizon all week. Though Cink shot an eye-catching 66 on the opening day, Watson and others caught more eyes by going lower. Cink was not near the very top of the leader board after Round 2 or Round 3, and with nothing in his recent past to indicate that he might be an unstoppable force Sunday, he was able keep living in his bubble until a playoff.He was, needless to say, not the crowd favorite.“It’s not the first time I’ve been in that situation,” he said. “I’ve played plenty of times with Tiger, and hearing the Tiger roars and Mickelson,” he said. “I’m usually the guy that the crowd, they appreciate but they’re not behind me 100 percent of the way. You know, they aren’t. So you know, that’s the sort of role I’ve been cast into for my whole career. And hey, that’s not the worst. It’s O.K.”Cink is accustomed to being a supporting actor. An early Twitter adopter, he has developed a remarkably large following. Earlier this year, he told Sports Illustrated, “It’s like the only legacy I have. One day, on my gravestone it’s going to say: ‘STEWART CINK, TWITTER PIONEER OF PGA TOUR. AND ALSO, PLAYER.’ ”Sunday’s result, however unpopular with sentimentalists worldwide, should change that.'"
"'09-07-20,'1','WASHINGTON — An Obama administration official refused Sunday to rule out the possibility that federal tax money might be used to pay for abortions under proposed health care legislation.Peter R. Orszag, the White House budget director, asked whether he was prepared to say that “no taxpayer money will go to pay for abortions,” answered: “I am not prepared to say explicitly that right now. It’s obviously a controversial issue, and it’s one of the questions that is playing out in this debate.”Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, who along with Mr. Orszag was asked about the issue on “Fox News Sunday,” said it had the potential to complicate the legislative battle over health care. “I would hate to see the health care debate go down over that issue,” Mr. Gregg said.Abortion has been simmering behind the scenes as an issue in legislation to guarantee access to health insurance for all Americans. The debate affects not only the public health insurance plan that Democrats want to create, but also private insurers, who would receive tens of billions of dollars of federal subsidies to cover people with low and moderate incomes.Under the House bill, for example, most insurers would have to provide an “essential benefits package” specified by the health and human services secretary, who would receive recommendations from a federal advisory committee. Opponents of abortion want Congress to prohibit inclusion of abortion in that benefits package, while advocates of abortion rights say the package should be left to medical professionals to determine.'"
"'09-07-20,'1','Dan Coleman, who studied with him at Stuyvesant and returned to teach Mr. McCourt’s old writing course during the 1990s, said students also heard less tragic stories from Mr. McCourt’s life as a single man. (He was married three times.) “He would come in and tell us, in his beautiful brogue, charming, hilarious stories about how he tried to play off of the maternal instincts of the women he’d meet — making reference to how much laundry he had that needed to be done, things like that,” Mr. Coleman said.He was able to amuse his students and put them at ease, but he was also imparting a lesson. “Looking back, it was all part of a technique,” said Vernon Silver, Stuyvesant class of 1987 and a reporter for Bloomberg News in Rome whose book “The Lost Chalice” has just been published. “He wanted you to tell a story too. At the end of his stories, he would turn it on the class.”A common exercise was asking students to describe what they had done when they got home the night before. “He would coax it out of us, showing us how to pay attention to mundane but telling details,” Mr. Silver said. “I remember a dialogue with a shy student. The kid said, ‘I did my homework.’ McCourt said: ‘No, no, no. What did you do when you walked in? You went through a door, didn’t you? Did you have anything in your hands? A book bag? You didn’t carry it with you all night, did you? Did you hang it on a hook? Did you throw it across the room and your mom yelled at you for it?’ ”And on and on, until enough significant glimpses of the boy’s life emerged to begin to paint a picture. In “Teacher Man,” Mr. McCourt wrote that he came upon his method by accident on his second day at McKee. A joke he made about relations with sheep as a boy in Ireland did not go over well with his colleagues:“In the teachers’ cafeteria veterans warned me, Son, tell ’em nothing about yourself. ...You’re the teacher. You have a right to privacy. The little buggers are diabolical. They are not, repeat not, your natural friends. ... You can never get back the bits and pieces of your life that stick in their little heads. Your life, man. It’s all you have.”He went on: “The advice was wasted. ... My life saved my life.”There was more to it than that. “Frank had us sing salacious folk songs, he had us write courtroom defenses of inanimate objects and recite recipes as poetry,” said Susan Jane Gilman, a former student who has published two memoirs. “Stuyvesant was largely for math-science types, it was learning by rote. Frank’s class was an intellectual freefall. I looked forward to it every day.”Although his books were still years off, Mr. McCourt was famous at Stuyvesant throughout much of his time there. “If you were at the school and you wanted to write, you went to meet McCourt,” said David Lipsky, the author, most recently, of “Absolutely American,” a book about West Point. “It wasn’t ‘get a computer.’ It wasn’t ‘go read the complete works of J. D. Salinger.’ It was one word: McCourt.”Mr. McCourt often told students how little he thought of the petty rigors imposed on him by the public school system. One year, during a class that was being monitored and observed by a superior, Mr. McCourt decided to make light of the event. He held up handmade signs — with play-by-plays like “MOTIVATIONAL INTERLUDE” — to cue his visitor in on what was happening in the room.“He essentially made it so that the class was in on the joke,” Mr. Coleman said.Many of his former students became writers, and many kept in touch with him. Ms. Gilman said: “We all thought, ‘He’s such a genius, what’s he doing just teaching us?’ Everybody thought he was destined for bigger and better things. And when he became a global phenomenon, we felt it was justice.”'"
"'09-07-20,'1','LYNN, Mass. — Natasha Smilansky comes to the farmers’ market here each Thursday because she enjoys ripe tomatoes and cucumbers. Now there is the added benefit of using food stamps for her purchases.“It helps me a lot,” said Ms. Smilansky, 53, who is on disability. “I like the freshness of the vegetables here. I spend all year waiting for the market.”The use of food stamps at farmers’ markets has been authorized for some time. But the program has been limited because the federal government in 2004 replaced the traditional paper food stamp coupons with debit cards that were processed through electronic benefit transfer terminals. The system is expensive, costing about $1,100 for each terminal, plus monthly fees; furthermore, the majority of farmers’ markets operate outdoors, with no means to accept the debit card.“There’s a large expense associated with putting a terminal in each farmer’s hand,” said Jeff Cole, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of Farmers’ Markets.Over the past five years, though, states and the federal government, with help from nonprofit organizations, have made hundreds of thousands of terminals available at farmers’ markets. Two years ago, Montana started a program to introduce terminals at 42 farmers’ markets; in Iowa, the state gives wireless machines to farmers and pays all monthly fees associated with them. New Jersey started giving the machines to farmers this month.“It opens up the market to a whole new clientele, and it allows the recipients better access to better foods and fresh foods,” said Jane Aiudi, director of the market and production development division of the Maine Agriculture Department.'"
"'09-07-20,'1','But officials eventually concluded that CIT, unlike the banks that were bailed out last year, posed no risk to the global financial system, leaving its fate in the hands of the private market.The plan was formed after days of round-the-clock negotiations between CIT and its financial and legal advisers, and a group of large bondholders represented by the investment bank Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. The two firms previously represented the biggest group of large bondholders in General Motors.Jeffrey M. Peek, CIT’s chief executive and the architect of the lender’s ill-timed aggressive push into subprime mortgages and student loans, was active in the financing talks, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Peek, a longtime banker who lost a race to become Merrill Lynch’s chief executive, called upon many of his acquaintances on Wall Street to provide some form of aid.Even as CIT negotiated with its bondholders, it also had teams from the investment bank Evercore Partners and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom prepare for a potential Chapter 11 filing. Several advisers, including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, had begun preliminary discussions about raising $2 billion to $3 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, money needed to get a company through bankruptcy.It remains unclear whether CIT’s long-sought lifeline will be enough to give it the room to make crucial changes to its business at a time when it is unable to obtain financing from the capital markets. While it maintains a bank subsidiary in Utah, the company has traditionally relied on money that it borrows in the capital markets to make loans to its customers.Once the credit markets froze and investors became leery of CIT’s loan portfolio, the company was in peril.Were CIT to fail, the company — with $75 billion in assets — would become the largest casualty in the finance sector since Lehman Brothers collapsed last fall. Since then, federal regulators have been pumping billions of dollars into numerous banks across the country to prop them up and create some stability in the financial system.A failure of CIT could have sent ripple effects through the nation’s small and midsize businesses. While most of its portfolio consisted of term loans, the company dominated the market for factoring, a type of lending common within the manufacturing and retail sectors.Many analysts and federal regulators have questioned why CIT did not try to change its risky business model sooner. Last December, amid the market turmoil, the Bush administration rushed through the company’s application to become a bank holding company and gave it $2.33 billion through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.Yet the company made no move to build a sturdier business model. Instead, it applied for access to a program through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that has allowed Goldman Sachs and other banks to issue their debt cheaply with the backing of the agency.Sheila C. Bair, the chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., does not view the program as a bailout solution for banks and financial institutions, a government official briefed on the situation said.When that door closed last week, CIT executives still held out hope that they would receive approval from regulators to transfer $10 billion in assets to the company’s Utah bank, a move that would have given it access to loans from the Federal Reserve. But regulators demanded that such a move be accompanied by CIT’s raising a significant amount of private capital, which at the time seemed nearly impossible.A third front of the debate was whether, after throwing large sums of money to some of the nation’s largest banks, the Obama administration was doing enough to brace up institutions that lend money to smaller businesses. Many of those large banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Bank of America, reported either record or substantially improved results last week.'"

"'09-07-20,'1','“Angela’s Ashes,” published by Scribner in 1996, rose to the top of the best-seller lists and stayed there for more than two years, selling four million copies in hardback. The next year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for biography and the National Book Critics Circle Award.Two more installments of his life story followed: “ ’Tis” (1999), which described his struggle to gain a foothold in New York, and “Teacher Man” (2005), an account of his misadventures and small victories as a public-school teacher. Both, although best sellers, did not achieve anything like the runaway success of Mr. McCourt’s first book, which the British director Alan Parker brought to the screen in 1999.Not to be outdone, Mr. McCourt’s younger brother Malachy, an actor, brought out two volumes of his own memoirs: “A Monk Swimming” (1998), which also made the best-seller list, and “Singing My Him Song” (2000). Then, when it seemed that the McCourt tale had been well and truly told, Conor McCourt, Malachy’s son, gathered the four brothers, got them talking and filmed two television documentaries, “The McCourts of Limerick” and “The McCourts of New York.”It was “Angela’s Ashes” that loomed over all things McCourt, however, and constituted a transformative experience for its author.Speaking to students at Bay Shore High School on Long Island in 1997, he said, “I learned the significance of my own insignificant life.”Francis McCourt was born Aug. 19, 1930, on Classon Avenue on the edge of the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, where his Irish immigrant parents had hoped to make a better life. It was not to be, largely because his father, Malachy, usually spent his scant laborer’s earnings at the local bar. Beaten, the family returned to Limerick when Frank was 4, and the pattern repeated itself.Three of Mr. McCourt’s six siblings died in early childhood. The family’s circumstances were so dire, he later told a student audience, that he often dreamed of becoming a prison inmate so that he would be guaranteed three meals a day and a warm bed. At home, the staple meal was tea and bread, which his mother jokingly referred to as a balanced diet: a solid and a liquid.When Frank was 11, his father went to work in a munitions factory in Britain and disappeared from the picture. Frank stole bread and milk, which became the family’s principal means of support. After dropping out of school at 13, he delivered telegrams and earned extra income writing letters for a local landlady.In 1949, Mr. McCourt, at 19, gathered his savings and boarded a ship for New York and a new life, which began unpromisingly. Finding a job at the Biltmore Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, he was put in charge of the 60 caged canaries in the public rooms. Thirty-nine of them died, whereupon Mr. McCourt taped the lifeless bodies to their perches. The ruse did not work.A series of laboring jobs followed, interrupted by the Korean War. Drafted into the Army, Mr. McCourt served as a dog trainer and later a clerk in West Germany.Despite his lack of formal schooling, Mr. McCourt won admission to New York University, where he earned a degree in English education in 1957. A year later he began teaching at McKee Vocational High School on Staten Island, an eye-opening experience that he recalled, in often hilarious detail, in his third volume of memoirs, “Teacher Man.”In his first week, an unruly student threw a homemade sandwich on the floor, an act that astonished Mr. McCourt not so much for its brazenness as for the waste of good food. After appraising the sandwich with a connoisseur’s eye, he picked it up and ate it.Mr. McCourt developed an idiosyncratic teaching style that found a somewhat more receptive audience at the elite Stuyvesant High School, where he taught creative writing after earning a master’s degree in English from Brooklyn College in 1967. He had students sing Irish songs to break down their resistance to poetry. After discovering a sheaf of written excuses from past years, he recognized an unexplored literary genre and asked students to write, say, an excuse letter from Adam or Eve to God, explaining why he or she should not be punished for eating the apple.He even had students test themselves. “When they wrote their own tests, they asked questions they wanted answers to and then they answered them,” Mr. McCourt told the journal Instructor. “It was grand.”On the side, Mr. McCourt made fitful stabs at writing. He contributed articles on Ireland to The Village Voice. He kept notebooks. But at the Lion’s Head in Greenwich Village, where he became friends with Pete Hamill and Jimmy Breslin, he felt like an interloper, he said. They were writers. He was just a teacher.“I had no idea he had the ambition, much less the ability to carry it off in such spectacular fashion,” Mr. Hamill, who first met Mr. McCourt at the Lion’s Head in the 1960s, said in a telephone interview.In 1977, Mr. McCourt and his brother Malachy, who was acting and bartending in New York, cobbled together a series of autobiographical sketches into a two-man play, “A Couple of Blaguards,” which opened off Off Broadway at the Billymunk Theater on East 45th Street. They performed a revised version at the Village Gate in 1984 and again at the Billymunk in 1986 and took their show to several other cities.This excursion into the past, along with his nagging sense that a writing teacher should write, motivated Mr. McCourt to undertake his childhood memoirs after he retired from teaching in 1987. An early attempt, when he was studying at New York University, had fizzled out, but three decades later, he said, he had worked through his awkward, self-conscious James Joyce phase and had gotten beyond the crippling anger that darkened his memories.“After 20 pages of standard omniscient author, I wrote something that I thought was just a note to myself, about sitting on a seesaw in a playground, and I found my voice, the voice of a child,” he told The Providence Journal in 1997. “That was it. It carried me through to the end of the book.”Still, his plans were vague. “I didn’t know what I was going to do with it, but I had to write it anyway,” he said in another interview. “I had to get it out of my system.”A persistent friend demanded to see what Mr. McCourt was writing, then turned the pages over to a literary agent, Molly Friedrich, who submitted the incomplete manuscript to Scribner. It was bought immediately.Critics, enchanted by Mr. McCourt’s language and gripped by his story, delivered the kind of reviews that writers can only dream of. But the book was ultimately a word-of-mouth success.An instant celebrity, Mr. McCourt did his utmost to resist becoming the designated spokesman for all things Irish, “from agriculture to the decline in the consumption of claret in the West of Ireland,” as he once joked.In Ireland itself, the reaction was mixed. “When the book was published in Ireland, I was denounced from hill, pulpit and barstool,” he told the online magazine Slate in 2007. “Certain citizens claimed I had disgraced the fair name of the city of Limerick, that I had attacked the church, that I had despoiled my mother’s name and that if I returned to Limerick, I would surely be found hanging from a lamppost.”Time healed at least some wounds. Mr. McCourt was awarded an honorary doctorate by Limerick University, and curious tourists can now take “Angela’s Ashes” tours of the city.In 1999, the British director Alan Parker translated the memoir to the screen, with Emily Watson as Angela (who died in 1981), Robert Carlyle as Malachy Sr. (who died in 1985) and three actors in the roles of Mr. McCourt as a small, medium-size and grown boy.For the Irish Repertory Theater, Mr. McCourt devised a history lesson disguised as an evening of storytelling and singing, titled “The Irish ... and How They Got That Way.” It opened in 1997 to less than rapturous reviews. His second volume of memoirs, “ ’Tis,” which began with his arrival in New York, also encountered rough weather from critics still giddy from the memory of “Angela’s Ashes.” Although his storytelling gifts were in full evidence, Mr. McCourt was taken to task by many critics for being bitter and self-pitying, a marked contrast to the stoic tone of “Angela’s Ashes,” putting off many readers.With “Teacher Man,” Mr. McCourt rallied. Although criticized as lumpy and episodic, the book was praised for its humane inquiry into the role of the teacher and the possibilities of education.Mr. McCourt’s first two marriages ended in divorce. In 1994 he married Ellen Frey McCourt. She survives him, as do his brothers Malachy and Alphie, both of Manhattan, and his brother Mike, of San Francisco; his daughter, Maggie McCourt of Burlington, Vt.; and three grandchildren.“I think there’s something about the Irish experience — that we had to have a sense of humor or die,” Mr. McCourt once told an interviewer. “That’s what kept us going — a sense of absurdity, rather than humor.“And it did help because sometimes you’d get desperate,” he continued. “And I developed this habit of saying to myself, ‘Oh, well.’ I might be in the midst of some misery, and I’d say to myself, ‘Well, someday you’ll think it’s funny.’ And the other part of my head will say: ‘No, you won’t — you’ll never think this is funny. This is the most miserable experience you’ve ever had.’ But later on you look back and you say, ‘That was funny, that was absurd.’ ”'"
"'09-07-20,'1','“No one wants to, in any way, stall or undermine economic growth that is necessary to lift millions more people out of poverty,” Mrs. Clinton said at a news conference. “The United States does not, and will not, do anything that would limit India’s economic progress.”American officials said they did not expect these differences to be aired during what was supposed to be an upbeat event, focusing on technology. But they said they did not feel betrayed.To some extent, India’s tough tone is a negotiating tactic as it and other countries prepare to advance their positions in talks leading up to a critical climate conference in in December.“We are simply not in a position to take over legally binding emission reduction targets,” Mr. Ramesh declared at the news conference. “That does not mean that we are oblivious of our responsibilities.”India’s refusal to accept mandatory national cuts in emissions is neither new nor unique. also opposes a deal with compulsory targets. Both countries say their economic growth should not be constrained when the West never faced such restrictions during its industrialization.India’s stance may reflect its pique at a bill passed in Washington by the House of Representatives, which would impose sanctions on countries that did not accept binding emissions cuts.It may also reflect domestic political pressure because India acceded this month to an “aspirational” goal by the industrialized countries to cap the rise in temperatures because of global warming to two degrees Celsius. The group had sought a pledge of far-reaching reductions in global emissions.Even the presence here of Todd Stern, Mrs. Clinton’s special envoy for climate change, has raised eyebrows: On Saturday, The Times of India published an article with the headline “Climate man’s visit shocks India.” American officials insist Mrs. Clinton had long planned to bring Mr. Stern, who said climate change presented an opportunity for India to invest in windmills and solar panels. “India, with its knowledge base and entrepreneurial talent and élan, is well positioned to be a winner,” he said.Mr. Ramesh leavened his tough words with a promise of cooperation in “green technology.” He proposed teaming up with the United States on and biomass, and setting up Indian-American centers to study the long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions.Despite India’s opposition to binding reductions, he said the Indian government was committed to reaching an agreement in Copenhagen. “It is possible for us to narrow our positions,” he said.Mrs. Clinton also sought to put a good face on the differences. “We have many more areas of agreement than has perhaps been appreciated,” she said, “and what we’re looking for is a way to have a framework that includes everyone and which demands certain steps.”She still seemed fascinated by her tour of the office building, a squat structure built around a circular atrium and known as the ITC Green Center, which has been certified by an American green building council with its highest classification.Its owner, ITC Ltd., is a conglomerate that operates hotels and owns India’s second-largest cigarette maker, a line of business that Indian officials say has made it eager to be regarded as a good corporate citizen. Mrs. Clinton compared the building to great Indian monuments like the Taj Mahal, though she conceded, “No one will confuse it with the Taj Mahal.”'"
"'09-07-20,'1','He tried to lighten the heavy pall that hung over his news conference. Looking from one row of glum faces to another, he said, “This ain’t a funeral, you know.” Later, when asked what he thought a good headline would be for the story, he thought for a moment.“The old fogy almost did it,” he said with a rueful smile.So much for romance, mystical endings and tales of age before youth in the lengthening shadows and dying light. Watson, the legend who would have been the oldest major champion by 11 years, was taken out by the last younger man standing and the victor offered no apologies, the vanquished no excuses.“I don’t feel ashamed,” Cink said. “I don’t feel disappointed. I’m pleased as punch that I’ve won this tournament, and also proud of the way Tom Watson played because he showed, not only did he show how great a golfer he is, but he showed what a great game we all play, the longevity that can exist for a guy to come out and compete.”All Watson had to do to claim the claret jug was make an 8-footer for par at 18. But he made a bad putt, pushing the ball right of the hole. Every challenger except Cink and the Englishman Lee Westwood had dissolved into the chilly mists on the rocks below by the time Watson arrived at the final hole with a one-stroke lead. Westwood, on the green in 2 with a 60-footer, was about to join them.Already gone were Ross Fisher, another of ’s hopefuls, who birdied the first two holes to take a two-stroke lead over Watson only to free fall at the fourth and fifth by going bogey, quadruple-bogey on his way to a 75. Mathew Goggin of moved into a tie for the lead with a birdie at No. 10 before bogeying Nos. 14-16 to finish at 73 and tied for fifth.The 21-year-old Englishman Chris Wood, who birdied No. 17 to reach two under, bogeyed No. 18. He missed the playoff by a shot.There stood Westwood at two under and on the green with a 20-footer while Watson, at three under after a birdie at 17, waited in the fairway.“Before I’d hit my putt, I figured he had hit the middle of the fairway, so I thought he was going to make four from there,” Westwood said. “I shouldn’t have got ahead of myself really. I just thought I needed to hole it.”Westwood three-putted instead, sending his shot past the hole and taking himself out of the playoff. Watson hit an 8-iron through the green into the collar and put himself in the playoff.Cink took command of the playoff from the start. The last good shot Watson hit was his first drive at No. 5, a sweet draw that he held against crosswind right into the middle of the fairway. He made bogey from there when his approach shot dove into the left greenside bunker and he could not get up and down. He double-bogeyed the third playoff hole, No. 17, after hooking his drive into the left weeds and lined his tee shot at 18 into the grandstand to the right.As Watson walked up the 18th, a beaten man, the crowd rose as one to cheer him. It is something he said he would choose to remember most about the four days.“Those memories are hard to forget,” he said. “Coming up in the amphitheater of the crowd and having the crowd cheering you on like they do here for me. As I said, the feeling is mutual. And that warmth makes you feel human. It makes you feel so good.”On the green, Cink was also clapping for Watson, a gesture that was heartfelt. As much as he wanted to beat Watson when the playoff began, he had respect for what he had witnessed throughout the week.“When the outcome of the playoff wasn’t really in question anymore,” Cink said, “then I was able to sit back and not only enjoy myself walking up to the green, but also reflect a little bit about what Tom Watson just did in front of all of us.“The same Tom Watson that won this tournament in, what was it, ’77, the same guy showed up here this week. And he just about did it. He beat everybody but one guy. And it was really special.”'"

"'09-07-21,'1','“The potential financial commitment the American taxpayers could be responsible for is of a size and scope that isn’t even imaginable,” said Representative Darrell E. Issa of California, the ranking Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which will hold the hearing. “If you spent a million dollars a day going back to the birth of Christ, that wouldn’t even come close to just one trillion dollars — $23.7 trillion is a staggering figure.”Mr. Issa’s staff distributed a briefing memo for Republicans on the committee that quoted the testimony relating to the $23.7 trillion number, but did not mention any of the qualifications contained in the report.In an interview Monday evening, Mr. Barofsky said he did not view his testimony as misleading.“We’re not suggesting that we’re are looking at a potential loss to the government of $23 trillion,” he said. “Our goal is to bring transparency, to put things in context.”Asked what he thought the maximum total cost could be, he replied that it was not his job to estimate that, and declined to give a figure.Mr. Barofsky has no authority to investigate most of the programs he discussed. He came up with far smaller numbers for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, that he is charged with monitoring. Of the $700 billion appropriated by Congress, the Treasury has so far spent $441 billion, and about $70 billion of that has been repaid.“TARP does not operate in a vacuum,” Mr. Barofsky said in his prepared testimony. To properly evaluate that spending, “the context of these broader efforts” must be considered.That $23.7 trillion figure would amount to about $77,000 for every person in the United States, and would be almost $10 trillion more than the country’s entire economic output, which is $14.1 trillion.To reach that figure, Mr. Barofsky added up all possible Federal Reserve programs, and got a total of $6.8 trillion. He figured the TARP program could end up costing $3 trillion, including possible spending by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Fed.For those totals to be reached, every dollar invested by the government in banks would have to become worthless, and the banks would have to default on securities guaranteed by the F.D.I.C. All the collateral posted by the banks to get loans from the Fed would also have to become worthless.Added to those figures are $4.4 trillion in other possible Treasury programs, and $2.3 trillion in F.D.I.C. guarantees of deposits. The final $7.2 trillion comes mostly from various mortgage-related programs.Even if all those numbers somehow turned out to be accurate, the report conceded that the total would be smaller because “there is potential for double-counting of exposures where different federal agencies provide guarantees for the same financial institutions.”The report does not appear to discuss how total government obligations are increased when the Fed either guarantees or purchases Treasury securities. In the interview, Mr. Barofsky declined to address that question.Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, called the figures “distorted” because they did not consider the value of the collateral posted for loan programs, as well as the value of securities the Treasury has received from banks.“These estimates of potential exposures do not provide a useful framework for evaluating the potential cost of these programs,” Mr. Williams said, according to Bloomberg News. “This estimate includes programs at their hypothetical maximum size, and it was never likely that the programs would be maxed out at the same time.”He added that the United States had spent less than $2 trillion so far, and that much of that was backed by valuable assets.It may be the first time that $2 trillion appears to be a small number.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','But some elements of Mr. Obama’s plan are unresolved, including whether the administration will adopt hotly debated steps like indefinite detention for some high-risk detainees. These would be a small category of detainees who the government determines are a significant security threat but cannot be tried because of the lack of usable evidence.Administration officials said on Monday that there was no decision on such a step but that if it were proposed, it would include Congressional and judicial review as well as periodic review by federal authorities.The administration is also backing a newly designed military commission model to try some detainees who cannot be tried in civilian criminal courts; a measure that has bipartisan support is now pending in the Senate.At a briefing on Monday, Obama administration officials blamed the Bush administration, saying it had left them with unsolved problems.The official, and several others, spoke at the briefing on the condition that they not be identified by name.The Obama administration officials said they were reassessing “fundamental policy issues,” and had concluded that some of those policies required “fundamental change.”The goal, one senior administration official said, is to build a “durable and effective” framework for dealing with the detainees at Guantánamo and future detainees captured in the fight against terrorists. The officials said they were on track to review the current detainees’ cases to determine who could be transferred overseas and who could be tried in military or civilian courts in the United States.In an interim report released Monday by the detention policy committee, officials described for the first time how they would decide whether to send detainees to a military or civilian court.The government will attempt to try detainees in civilian courts if possible, but some of the factors that could affect the decision include “the nature of the offenses to be charged,” the seriousness of the conduct underlying the offense, the identity of victims and the location in which the offense occurred.More than 50 detainees have been approved for transfer overseas, the officials said, expressing optimism about the process. But some countries have been reluctant to accept detainees, and the task is complicated by requirements that foreign governments provide assurances that they be treated humanely and subject to security procedures.'"

"'09-07-21,'1','Critics say that rationale and the failure of the Transportation Department, which oversees the highway agency, to more vigorously pursue distracted driving has cost lives and allowed to blossom a culture of behind-the-wheel multitasking.“We’re looking at a problem that could be as bad as drunk driving, and the government has covered it up,” said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety.The group petitioned for the information after The Los Angeles Times wrote about the research last year. Mother Jones later published additional details.The highway safety researchers estimated that cellphone use by drivers caused around 955 fatalities and 240,000 accidents over all in 2002.The researchers also shelved a draft letter they had prepared for Transportation Secretary to send, warning states that hands-free laws might not solve the problem.That letter said that hands-free headsets did not eliminate the serious accident risk. The reason: a cellphone conversation itself, not just holding the phone, takes drivers’ focus off the road, studies showed.The research mirrors other studies about the dangers of multitasking behind the wheel. Research shows that motorists talking on a phone are four times as likely to crash as other drivers, and are as likely to cause an accident as someone with a .08 blood alcohol content.The three-person research team based the fatality and accident estimates on studies that quantified the risks of distracted driving, and an assumption that 6 percent of drivers were talking on the phone at a given time. That figure is roughly half what the Transportation Department assumes to be the case now.More precise data does not exist because most police forces have not collected long-term data connecting cellphones to accidents. That is why the researchers called for the broader study with 10,000 or more drivers.“We nevertheless have concluded that the use of cellphones while driving has contributed to an increasing number of crashes, injuries and fatalities,” according to a “talking points” memo the researchers compiled in July 2003.It added: “We therefore recommend that the drivers not use wireless communication devices, including systems, when driving, except in an emergency.”Dr. Jeffrey Runge, then the head of the highway safety agency, said he grudgingly decided not to publish the Mineta letter and policy recommendation because of larger political considerations.At the time, Congress had warned the agency not to use its research to lobby states. Dr. Runge said transit officials told him he could jeopardize billions of dollars of its financing if Congress perceived the agency had crossed the line into lobbying.The fate of the research was discussed during a high-level meeting at the transportation secretary’s office. The meeting included Dr. Runge, several staff members with the highway safety agency and John Flaherty, Mr. Mineta’s chief of staff.Mr. Flaherty recalls that the group decided not to publish the research because the data was too inconclusive.He recalled that Dr. Runge “indicated that the data was incomplete and there was going to be more research coming.”He recalled summing up his position as, the agency “should make a decision as to whether they wanted to wait for more data.”But Dr. Runge recalled feeling that the issue was dire and needed public attention. “I really wanted to send a letter to governors telling them not to give a pass to hands-free laws,” said Dr. Runge, whose staff spent months preparing a binder of materials for their presentation.His broader goal, he said, was to educate people about the dangers of distracted driving. “Based on the research, there was a possibility of this becoming a really big problem,” he said.But “my advisers upstairs said we should not poke a finger in the eye of the appropriations committee,” he recalled.He said Mr. Flaherty asked him, “Do we have enough evidence right now to not create enemies among all the stakeholders?”Those stakeholders, Dr. Runge said, were the House Appropriations Committee and groups that might influence it, notably voters who multitask while driving and, to a much smaller degree, the cellphone industry.Mr. Mineta, who left as transportation secretary in 2006, said he was unaware of the meeting.“I don’t think it ever got to my desk,” he said of the research. Mr. Ditlow, from the Center for Auto Safety, said the officials’ explanations for withholding the research raised concerns. He said the research did not constitute lobbying of states.And he said it was consistent with the highway safety agency’s research in other areas, like seat belts.Mr. Ditlow said that putting fears of the House panel ahead of public safety was an abdication of the agency’s responsibility.“No public health and safety agency should allow its research to be suppressed for political reasons,” he said. Doing so “will cause deaths and injuries on the highways.”State Senator Joe Simitian of , who tried from 2001 to 2005 to pass a hands-free cellphone law over objections of the cellphone industry, said the unpublished research would have helped him convince his colleagues that cellphones cause serious — deadly — distraction.“Years went by when lives could have been saved,” said Mr. Simitian, who in 2006 finally pushed through a hands-free law that took effect last year.The highway safety agency, rather than commissioning a study with 10,000 drivers, handled one involving 100 cars. That study, done with the Transportation Institute, placed cameras inside cars to monitor drivers for more than a year.It found that drivers using a hand-held device were at 1.3 times greater risk of a crash or near crash, and at three times the risk when dialing compared with other drivers.Not all the research went unpublished. The safety agency put on its Web site an annotated bibliography of more than 150 scientific articles that showed how a cellphone conversation while driving the brain’s processing power, impairing reaction time. But the bibliography included only a list of the articles, not the one-page summaries of each one written by the researchers.Chris Monk, who researched the bibliography for 18 months, said the exclusion of the summaries took the teeth out of the findings.“It became almost laughable,” Mr. Monk said. “What they wound up finally publishing was a stripped-out summary.”Mr. Monk and Mike Goodman, a division head at the safety agency who led the research project, theorize that the agency might have felt pressure from the cellphone industry. Mr. Goodman said the industry frequently checked in with him about the project and his progress. (He said the industry knew about the research because he had worked with it to gather some data).But he could offer no proof of the industry’s influence. Mr. Flaherty said he was not contacted or influenced by the industry.The agency’s current policy is that people should not use cellphones while driving. Rae Tyson, a spokesman for the agency, said it did not, and would not, publish the researchers’ fatality estimates because they were not definitive enough.He said the other research was compiled as background material for the agency, not for the public.“There is no report to publish,” he said.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','Roger Jenkins, the Hollywood-connected Barclays executive who last year helped preserved the bank’s independence by securing a vital investment from the Persian Gulf, is planning to establish a firm to advise sovereign wealth funds.Mr. Jenkins, who is said to be one of London’s highest-paid bankers, is negotiating departure terms after 25 years with Barclays, a person with direct knowledge of the talks said Monday. The person declined to be identified because no agreement had been reached.Mr. Jenkins first voiced interest in founding a firm a year ago, but senior executives persuaded him to stay to help Barclays through the worst of the credit crisis, this person said.According to The Sunday Times Rich List, Mr. Jenkins earned £40 million, or $65 million, last year and has personal wealth of £120 million.Mr. Jenkins, who is chairman of the investment banking business in the Middle East but is based in London, is said to be eager to move to Los Angeles to spend more time with his family.In October, he was vital to Barclays’ £5.8 billion, or $8.6 billion, deal with Qatar and Abu Dhabi, which helped the bank avoid having to accept a government bailout, which would have meant surrendering some control to the British government. This year, he worked on the sale of iShares, the business that was eventually acquired by BlackRock as part of its purchase of Barclays Global Investors.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','The Sun is still blank (mostly).Ever since Samuel Heinrich Schwabe, a German astronomer, first noted in 1843 that sunspots burgeon and wane over a roughly 11-year cycle, scientists have carefully watched the Sun’s activity. In the latest lull, the Sun should have reached its calmest, least pockmarked state last fall.Indeed, last year marked the blankest year of the Sun in the last half-century  266 days with not a single sunspot visible from Earth. Then, in the first four months of 2009, the Sun became even more blank, the pace of sunspots slowing more.“It’s been as dead as a doornail,” David Hathaway, a solar physicist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said a couple of months ago.The Sun perked up in June and July, with a sizeable clump of 20 sunspots earlier this month.Now it is blank again, consistent with expectations that this solar cycle will be smaller and calmer, and the maximum of activity, expected to arrive in May 2013 will not be all that maximum.For operators of satellites and power grids, that is good news. The same roiling magnetic fields that generate sunspot blotches also accelerate a devastating rain of particles that can overload and wreck electronic equipment in orbit or on Earth.A panel of 12 scientists assembled by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration now predicts that the May 2013 peak will average 90 sunspots during that month. That would make it the weakest solar maximum since 1928, which peaked at 78 sunspots. During an average solar maximum, the Sun is covered with an average of 120 sunspots.But the panel’s consensus “was not a unanimous decision,” said Douglas A. Biesecker, chairman of the panel. One member still believed the cycle would roar to life while others thought the maximum would peter out at only 70.Among some global warming skeptics, there is speculation that the Sun may be on the verge of falling into an extended slumber similar to the so-called Maunder Minimum, several sunspot-scarce decades during the 17th and 18th centuries that coincided with an extended chilly period.Most solar physicists do not think anything that odd is going on with the Sun. With the recent burst of sunspots, “I don’t see we’re going into that,” Dr. Hathaway said last week.Still, something like the Dalton Minimum  two solar cycles in the early 1800s that peaked at about an average of 50 sunspots  lies in the realm of the possible, Dr. Hathaway said. (The minimums are named after scientists who helped identify them: Edward W. Maunder and John Dalton.)With better telescopes on the ground and a fleet of Sun-watching spacecraft, solar scientists know a lot more about the Sun than ever before. But they do not understand everything. Solar dynamo models, which seek to capture the dynamics of the magnetic field, cannot yet explain many basic questions, not even why the solar cycles average 11 years in length.Predicting the solar cycle is, in many ways, much like predicting the stock market. A full understanding of the forces driving solar dynamics is far out of reach, so scientists look to key indicators that correlate with future events and create models based on those.For example, in 2006, Dr. Hathaway looked at disturbances in the Earth's magnetic field that are caused by the Sun, and they were strong. During past cycles, strong disturbances at minimum indicated strong fields all over the Sun at maximum and a bounty of sunspots. Because the previous cycles had been shorter than average, Dr. Hathaway thought the next one would be shorter and thus solar minimum was imminent. He predicted the new solar cycle would be a ferocious one, consistent with a short cycle.Instead, the new cycle did not arrive as quickly as Dr. Hathaway anticipated, and the disturbances weakened. His revised prediction is for a smaller-than-average maximum. Last November, it looked like the new cycle was finally getting started, with the new cycle sunspots in the middle latitudes outnumbering the old sunspots of the dying cycle that are closer to the equator.After a minimum, solar activity usually takes off quickly, but instead the Sun returned to slumber. “There was a long lull of several months of virtually no activity, which had me worried,” Dr. Hathaway said.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','“This is an issue that can cut in every possible direction,” he replied. “The doctor who is herself struggling with her weight will have the advantage of personal experience from the patient’s perspective — which may increase compassion and provide other insights that a primary-care practitioner without the problem may not have.“On the other hand,” he continued, “the patient may view a doctor who is substantially overweight or unfit as lacking the basic understanding of the problem to put those principles into effect in his own life.”The drumbeat of concern about childhood obesity has grown louder in recent years, with much new research and more and more clinical trials and interventions. But in the meantime, the children of America have gotten heavier, I have diagnosed Type 2 diabetes in too many of my patients, and I haven’t done any major shrinking myself.We’ve learned more about risk factors. For example, a 2007 study by Dr. Lumeng found that the fewer hours of sleep children got in the third grade, the more likely they were to be obese in the sixth grade, regardless of other family factors. Her current research centers on how mothers’ beliefs about obesity and diet affect their children’s risk of obesity.But Dr. Lumeng has struggled with her own weight — she says she lost 50 pounds in the past year after a gestational diabetes scare — and she understands how hard it is to translate her own beliefs into daily practice. When she gets home from a long day at work, she told me, she knows she really ought to tell her three children to turn off the television and ride their bikes, while she is cooking broccoli and salmon for dinner.“I know it all, I do research in this,” she went on. “But in the moment I’m exhausted, it’s been a long day at work, everyone’s sort of irritable. You can know what you need to do, but when the moment comes ... .”I could make the admittedly self-serving argument that it’s easier to find common cause with your patients when you understand their frailties. Talking to an adolescent who is experimenting with drugs, or a parent who is smoking around a young child, I can easily take on the paternalistic resonance of moral rectitude: How can you possibly persist in this destructive, dangerous behavior, now that I have told you how destructive and dangerous it is?On the other hand, you could argue that when the doctor gives advice she obviously finds difficult to follow, there’s an underlying — and undermining — complicit wink: Now that I’ve told you about healthy eating, let’s have a cookie together — we’ll change our habits tomorrow!In the end, Dr. Lumeng is left with the same advice that made her glaze over: “I’ve had patients who say to me, ‘Wow, doctor, you’ve really lost weight — how did you do it?’ And I have to say, ‘Well, I exercise more and I eat less!’ ”Back in the exam room, with that 8-year-old, I took some early and unsure steps toward discussing the topic. I showed her her growth chart, on the pink (for girls) graph paper. See, I said, you’re growing — you’re getting taller, and you’re adding muscle to your body as you grow. But we need to give you time to get taller before you add more weight.And we talked nutrition (cut back on sweet drinks, fast food, eating in front of the TV), and we talked exercise (how about tap dancing, soccer, swimming lessons?).And finally I looked the mother in the eye and said, without planning to say it, “If this were easy, I would be thin and fit.”'"
"'09-07-21,'1','His overall assessment: “Every time officials at the Treasury or the Fed thought they finally had gotten ahead of the Great Panic, they turned out to be insufficiently pessimistic. This would be a distinguishing characteristic of this chapter in American economic history: even when officials thought they were planning for the worst-case scenario, they weren’t.”Three policy makers in particular receive low scores from Mr. Wessel. He argues that Mr. Paulson’s abrupt changes of course and failure to understand “the theater” of crisis management hurt his credibility and undermined public confidence. He says that President George W. Bush was “largely a spectator” to “the biggest threat to American prosperity in a generation” possibly because he knew how unpopular he was and figured “he would make Paulson’s job tougher if he appeared to be calling the shots” or because the Bush White House, “stumbling through its last few months, was simply exhausted and understaffed.” And he takes the former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to task for allowing economic conditions to develop that fueled the credit crisis in the first place.Mr. Wessel argues that the Greenspan Fed “kept interest rates too low for too long,” missed warning signs that subprime mortgages were a growing problem and was reluctant to use its powers to restrain subprime lending. He adds that the former Fed chairman, revered during his tenure as an economic wise man, made the incorrect assumption that a national decline in house prices was extremely unlikely and “put too much faith in markets,” failing to use the Fed’s “regulatory clout and rhetoric to restrain the shortsighted, excessively ebullient players in financial markets and to at least try to resist the worst of the abuses in the subprime lending market.”Mr. Greenspan’s successor, Mr. Bernanke, along with Mr. Paulson and Timothy F. Geithner, then the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (and now President Obama’s Treasury secretary), Mr. Wessel says, all “had a gut sense that the U.S. economy was overdue for a financial crisis of some sort” before the catastrophic events of last fall, but “no one at the Fed” rang “the gong and warned investors, lenders, business executives, and consumers that years of easy credit even for risky borrowers, placid markets, and shared optimism were unsustainable.”While Mr. Wessel suggests that Mr. Bernanke was initially timid in his response to brewing problems, he gives the Fed chief credit for being “creative and bold” once he realized the risks, pushing “the Fed to places it had never gone before or at least to places it hadn’t visited since the Great Depression.” A conscientious student of that calamity, Mr. Bernanke was determined, Mr. Wessel writes, that “he would not go down in history as the chairman of the Federal Reserve who dithered and delayed during a financial panic that threatened American prosperity,” and he “adopted a new mantra: whatever it takes.”In this book Mr. Geithner emerges as a usually cool deliberator, admired by his colleagues at the Fed for his “capacity to size up a situation and lay out options coherently and calmly.” His experience dealing with the United States government’s response to the Mexican and Asian financial crises of the 1990s, Mr. Wessel writes, taught him “a lot about crisis management and an enduring lesson: smart people solve crises one at a time and worry about dealing with unintended consequences tomorrow.”As for Mr. Paulson, Mr. Wessel describes him as “a deal maker”: “Like many on Wall Street, he could shout ‘No! No!’ before, citing changed circumstances, abruptly saying ‘Yes!’ The approach provided flexibility in negotiating the best business deal; it didn’t build lasting credibility in Washington.” In contrast, Mr. Wessel says, Mr. Geithner understood “that a tough bargaining stance in a room full of investment bankers made sense, but that the press, the markets, and foreign officials abroad couldn’t distinguish a bargaining position from a policy position.”In Mr. Wessel’s view the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Sept. 14 “caused — or coincided with — so much financial turmoil in large part because of the lack of a consistent story.” It was unclear whether the government let Lehman fall “to teach Wall Street a lesson” about moral hazard or whether it was “legally powerless to save it.” It was unclear whether the earlier rescue of Bear Stearns was a one-time thing and whether the government would intervene to save other major financial firms teetering on the brink.Mr. Wessel quotes Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman: “People in the market often say they can make money under any set of rules, as long as they know what they are. Coming just six months after Bear’s rescue, the Lehman decision tossed the presumed rulebook out the window. If Bear was too big to fail, how could Lehman, at twice its size, not be? If Bear was too entangled to fail, why was Lehman not? After Lehman went over the cliff, no financial institution seemed safe. So lending froze, and the economy sank like a stone. It was a colossal error, and many people said so at the time.”Although an enormous amount of recent attention has been understandably focused on why the government let Lehman Brothers go under, an equal amount of attention might understandably be focused on why Lehman — and other firms like Bear Stearns and A.I.G. — were ever allowed to engage in the sort of reckless, illogical, self-destructive gambling that turned them from Wall Street behemoths into combustible houses of cards in the first place.Why, in an increasingly interconnected and globalized world where financial woes can spread virally like swine flu, was there so little regulation of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that the financier Felix Rohatyn once described as “financial hydrogen bombs”? Why was there so little oversight of the rating agencies that drastically underrated the risk of such flammable, infectious products? Why did the top management of these companies overleverage their firms, why did they willfully ignore the warnings of experts, and why did they fail to take quick, corrective action when the dangers their companies faced became self-evident?Such questions are all raised and italicized by “A Colossal Failure of Common Sense: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers” by Lawrence G. McDonald, a former vice president of that firm, with an assist from the writer Patrick Robinson. Mr. McDonald approaches the story not as a journalist but as a former employee, a member of a group of dissidents who believed that Richard S. Fuld Jr., the company’s chairman and chief executive, and its president, Joseph M. Gregory, were leading Lehman off a cliff.Mr. Fuld and Mr. Gregory, Mr. McDonald contends, ignored the warnings of three of the company’s “cleverest financial brains”: “Mike Gelband, our global head of fixed income, Alex Kirk, global head of distressed trading research and sales, and Larry McCarthy, head of distressed-bond trading.”“Each and every one of them laid it out, from way back in 2005,” Mr. McDonald writes, “that the real estate market was living on borrowed time and that Lehman Brothers was headed directly for the biggest subprime iceberg ever seen, and with the wrong men on the bridge. Dick and Joe turned their backs all three times. It was probably the worst triple since St. Peter denied Christ.”Mr. McDonald depicts Mr. Fuld and Mr. Gregory as out of touch and in denial: arrogant, reckless, eager to embrace “risk, more risk, and if necessary bigger risks” in pursuit of short-term profits, willing to borrow more and more money (on the way to leveraging the firm to “44 times our value”) in order to buy commercial and residential real estate at the top of the market, even though one of his lieutenants had warned in 2005 that the housing market was on steroids and headed for serious trouble.At times Mr. McDonald’s rage or Mr. Robinson’s penchant for melodrama leads to some hyperbolic writing. Mr. Fuld, for instance, comes across as a sort of Lord Voldemort, a “strange wraithlike presence,” an “oddball demigod who ruled everyone’s lives.”Over all, however, Mr. McDonald’s book gives the reader a visceral sense of what it was like to work at Lehman Brothers and the fateful decisions and events that led to the company’s death spiral — decisions that turned the once-proud firm into a grim illustration, in the words of one of the author’s colleagues, of the “colossal failure of common sense.”'"
"'09-07-21,'1','The researchers acknowledged that biologists had not been crying out for a canonical definition of the term. Marlene Zuk, an animal behaviorist at the University of California at Riverside, contrasted that casual attitude with the often acrid debates now under way on how to define the term species. “What you think a species is means a lot for the way you think about evolution,” she said. But with behavior, she added, “there doesn’t seem to be an existential crisis.” Then again, nothing can be more insidious than the wallflower you ignore.Walter D. Koenig of Cornell University, who helped Mr. Levitis in the early stages of the project, said his interest was piqued when he moved from the study of bird behavior to an investigation of the birds’ primary food supplier, oak trees. Why is it that trees dispersed over great distances end up releasing their acorns, or masting, en masse, he wondered. “Are the trees responding to something produced by other trees?” he said. “It’s entirely possible.” And if you designate this sort of inter-arboreal chemistry a behavior, he added, “it ends up pushing the boundaries” of what you think plants can do.To perform their linguistic investigation, the researchers composed an online survey with two basic parts. In the first, they presented 13 “potentially diagnostic” statements about behavior, compiled from their sweep through the scientific literature, with which respondents could either concur or not. “Behavior always involves movement,” for example, and “is always an action, rather than a lack of action.” Or, “behaviors are always the actions of individuals, not groups” and “something whole individuals do, not organs or parts that make up an individual.” Or, “a developmental change is not a behavior.”In the second part, Mr. Levitis and his co-workers offered 20 instances of natural phenomena and asked, Behavior, yea, nay or can’t say? “A sponge pumps water to gather food,” for example, or “a plant bends its leaves toward a light source” or “a beetle is swept away by a strong current.” Does a flock of geese flying in V formation count as a behavior? How about when a person decides not to do anything tomorrow in the event of rain, or when a female ant that is physiologically capable of laying eggs doesn’t do so because she’s not a queen? (If you’d like to take the survey and see how your responses compare with scientists’ and other readers’, please go to nytimes.com/science. Warning, spoilers ahead.)Nearly all of the items were designed as borderline cases that tested the validity of one or more statements in the first half of the survey. “Flocks of geese fly in V formation,” for instance, contradicted the notion that behaviors are the actions of individuals rather than of groups. A person deciding on inactivity in the event of rain and an ant forgoing reproduction because she’s not royalty both flouted the premise that a behavior is always an action. One offering, “a spider builds a web,” contradicted none of the 13 stipulations about behavior and thus served as an experimental control.Tallying results from 174 respondents, the researchers found an impressive lack of accord. “We didn’t have complete consensus for any item on the survey,” said Mr. Levitis, and that includes the little eight-legged control spinning its web. There were some harmonic notes. All but one participant deemed geese flying in V formation to be a legitimate behavior, while more than 95 percent turned thumbs down to the beetle swept away in a stream.Amusingly, more than half the scientists contradicted themselves, some of them multiple times, by designating as behaviors items on the second list that defied the set of rules they had chosen from the first list.Despite the overall lack of concordance, the researchers sought to extract from the results a trial definition for a word their peers bandy about with abandon. As they pitch it, a behavior is the internally coordinated response that an individual or a group makes to a stimulus. The response can be action or lack of action. The stimulus can come from inside or out. By this definition, masting oak trees, bacterial colonies creeping across a sugar gradient, zebra herds fissioning and fusing, are all displaying behaviors. Dogs that bark are behaving, dogs that obey a trainer’s signal and choose not to bark are most definitely behaving.Yet a favorite human sport fails to meet the new lexical guidelines. Thinking, it seems, is not a behavior. If you think about going for a walk and then go for a walk, that’s a behavior. If you think about going for a walk but then decide it’s too cold, that’s a behavior. Walk or not, just make up your mind. It don’t mean a thing till you get off that swing.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','The editor of one of the country’s last opposition newspapers was sent to prison in June for articles he had published, and another, soon afterward, apologized and agreed to shut down his newspaper to avoid court action.A young political activist was convicted of defamation in June and jailed for spray-painting slogans critical of the government on the walls of his house.“The court has always been used as a political tool,” said Theary C. Seng, whose leadership of a human rights group, the Center for Social Development, is being challenged in what she says is a politically motivated court case. “But recently, there is a concentration of cases which seem to be very political and which seem to use the court as a political tool to silence opposition voices.”Mr. Hun Sen dismisses, and even appears to parody, his critics, declaring earlier this month that he was acting in the interests of democracy by stripping the two lawmakers of their parliamentary immunity so that they could face prosecution in the courts.“From now on we are strengthening democracy and the rule of law,” he said. “This is not an anarchic democracy. Democracy must have the rule of law.”Together with land seizures that are driving tens of thousands of people from their homes, analysts say these actions demonstrate a sense of impunity in a government that has resisted efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Cambodia.In the most recent evictions, about 150 poor families were forced from their homes on prime land in Phnom Penh on Thursday and Friday, part of what the World Bank called “a major problem” in Cambodia’s fast-growing cities.The court cases come at a time when countries in the region are looking increasingly toward China as a political and economic model and questioning the democratic and humanitarian values of the West.In recent years, China has become a major donor and investor in Cambodia in projects that do not place the kinds of demands on governing and management that generally accompany assistance from Western nations and aid organizations.“We have been fearing all along that Cambodia’s government is looking eastward toward China and Vietnam as models,” with their strong central governments and intolerance of dissent, said Ou Virak, president of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights.“Now there are a lot of activities recently that confirm our fear, and so it’s pretty scary,” he said. “What they are trying to do is to have only one strong party, and ultimately probably only one party.”The aggressiveness of the government has been matched by what appears to be resigned acquiescence among many of its opponents to the dominance of Mr. Hun Sen and his ruling elite in the Cambodian People’s Party.Nothing demonstrates this more sharply than the apologies that Mr. Hun Sen apparently requires as the price of leniency.“I ask permission to demonstrate deep respect and bow down to apologize,” said Dam Sith, editor in chief of Moneaksekar Khmer, a pro-opposition newspaper, as he promised earlier this month to cease publication of his 10-year-old newspaper.“I have in the past committed inappropriate acts again and again,” he said, adding that his only hope to avoid a defamation conviction is the “compassion and forgiveness” of Mr. Hun Sen — which he duly received.'"
"'09-07-21,'1','The Dow Jones industrial average rose 104.21 points, or 1.19 percent, to 8,848.15, driven by big gains in Caterpillar, Alcoa and Walt Disney. Since June 10, the blue-chip index has gained 8.6 percent to land back in positive territory for the year.The S.& P. 500 jumped 10.75 points, or 1.14 percent, to 951.13, its highest level since November. It has gained 41 percent since early March.The Nasdaq composite index climbed 22.68 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,909.29.The index of leading economic indicators rose 0.7 percent in June, the Conference Board reported. Seven of the 10 leading indicators released Monday — including building permits, stock prices and initial jobless claims — improved in June. Analysts now say that another strong week of earnings reports could lure hesitant investors back into the fray and begin the next bull run.“Momentum is on our side,” said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer’s Investment Research. “There’s a lot of sideline money right now. They’re not yet convinced that the train’s leaving the station without them, but whenever they feel compelled to go in, that’s when you might see this market spike to 1,000.”As of last week, 71 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 reported earnings that surpassed expectations, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.Still, Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, warned on Monday that economic growth next year was “very much in doubt.”In an interview with Bloomberg News, Mr. Summers said, “I don’t feel there’s a basis for predicting that income growth is going to resume in the near term.”Adding to the optimism on Monday was news that CIT, one of the nation’s largest lenders to small and midsize businesses, was nearing a deal for emergency financing. On Sunday, the company’s bondholders agreed to supply a $3 billion emergency loan that would buy some time for the 101-year-old company to restructure its looming debt burden outside of bankruptcy.European shares also rose on the strength of CIT. The FTSE 100 index in Britain was 54.87 points, or 1.25 percent higher at 4,443.62, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 51.75 points, or 1.04 percent, to 5,030.15. The CAC-40 in France gained 52.48 points, or 1.63 percent, to 3,270.94.Investors will closely watch earnings reports throughout this week and next week. Texas Instruments announced results on Monday; Apple, Coca-Cola and Caterpillar will follow on Tuesday.In addition to stocks, the oil market has seen a resurgence on the steady stream of robust earnings.Further aided by a weak dollar, contracts for crude delivery in August rose 42 cents, to $63.98 a barrel.Oil traders cannot seem to reach a consensus on how the world economy and its appetite for oil will shape up, but prices have been rising since crude hit a low of $59.52 a barrel on July 14.Analysts said that the markets are now pricing in expectations that reports later this week will show a decline in oil inventories in the United States. Moreover, a sudden pickup in demand from China in particular, analysts say, could be expected after Beijing officials reported growth of 7.9 percent in the second quarter, comfortably surpassing projections.“China is compelling; it’s what we’re paying attention to,” said John Kilduff, vice president of MF Global, who believes that $70 a barrel will shortly be reached.“All it’ll take is another week or two of declining crude oil inventories. Even the good signs on the earnings front and today’s leading economic indicator played into the thesis that things are picking up,” he said.Bond yields slipped as stocks gained. The yield on the Treasury’s 10-year note fell to 3.61 percent, from 3.65 percent late Friday.

"'09-07-22,'0','To avoid this, Mr. Bernanke says the Fed can use its relatively new authority to pay interest on banks’ reserves. Increasing the rate from the current 0.25 percent would make it more attractive for banks to keep reserves on deposit, giving the Fed time to drain these funds by selling securities back to the banks.But if loan floodgates open faster than expected, the Fed would be faced with the unpleasant prospect of having to crank rates up quickly. That would require lockstep increases in the central bank’s benchmark Fed funds target rate — perhaps to levels that might threaten any nascent economic recovery.Given banks’ continuing risk aversion, the Fed will probably have the luxury of tweaking rates rather than making market-jarring changes. And perhaps the central bank will prove able to finesse the balance between growth and inflation this time around. Unfortunately, it has a poor record of exiting gracefully.Before the financial crunch, the battle between regulators and bankers used to be one-sided. Both agreed that bankers generally knew best. Bonuses, for example, were an internal matter. Postcrisis, however, regulators want more say.Britain’s Financial Services Authority, which is run by Hector Sants, has just laid down a line — a tough one by its traditional standards — on multiyear guaranteed bonuses. In a letter sent to more than 40 chief executives, it suggested such practices “may be inconsistent” with its pending approach to remuneration, which is based on keeping rewards aligned with risk.Institutions based in Britain are not happy, especially with the idea that employment contracts signed as early as March, when the F.S.A. published its first consultation paper, could come under scrutiny. To them, the approach seems unfair and gets in the way of the high pay revival sweeping the industry. Even government-controlled banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland in Britain and Citigroup in the United States, are paying up for talent.In theory, regulators could stop not only multiyear guarantees but also any reversion to old pay practices. The F.S.A. and its peers in the United States and elsewhere could decide that gargantuan pay packages were simply off the table. A few months ago, such a blanket decree, with a few exceptions, seemed plausible.In practice, the mood has changed. The exceptions could now become the rule. When governments are turning a blind eye to the hiring practices of the banks under their control, regulators will have trouble being much tougher.The F.S.A. may still try. Banks would be foolish to ignore its letter completely or protest too loudly. The regulator has the authority to levy fines or even to increase capital requirements for institutions it judges are careless about pay.But wily bankers can probably protect their rewards without direct confrontations. Better to cut back on egregious contract terms, while marshalling persuasive arguments about how bankers and traders are getting extra pay for keeping a particularly close eye on the risks they are taking.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded with a brief e-mail statement defending the conduct of its agents and the home raids — the same kind of response it has made to similar criticism since the Bush administration vastly expanded their use in 2006.In 2007, Mr. Mulvey sharply criticized raids that brought scores of agents from around the country to Long Island, some brandishing shotguns, and rousted many citizens and legal residents from their beds in what Nassau officials called a poorly planned antigang operation.The report said a similar “cowboy mentality” emerged in many other raids. In Paterson, N.J., last year, legal residents from Guatemala and their 9-year-old son, a United States citizen, were threatened with guns by immigration agents who had entered their home while the boy’s mother was in the shower.In a Staten Island case, an immigration judge recently ruled that the conduct of agents acting without a warrant was an “egregious violation” of fundamental fairness; they had entered a man’s bedroom armed with pistols, “forced him into the hall and required him to stand in his underwear before his brother, sister-in-law and their children.”In an e-mail message obtained under a Freedom of Information request, a federal immigration agent in Connecticut invited a state trooper to join a scheduled set of raids in New Haven, writing: “We have 18 addresses — so it should be a fun time! Let me know if you guys can play!”The report also found a strong suggestion of racial profiling in the difference between the ethnicity of the named targets — 66 percent Latino — and of the “collateral” arrests — 87 percent Latino in New Jersey and 94 percent on Long Island.Such concerns have surfaced repeatedly around the country in news articles and lawsuits since 2006, when the Bush administration raised the arrest quota of each raiding team eightfold, to 1,000 a year.Six months into the Obama administration, with the same spokesmen in place from the Bush years, Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded to the Cardozo report with a general defense of its agents.""The men and women of I.C.E. are sworn to uphold the laws of our nation,” the agency said in an e-mailed statement. “We do so professionally, humanely and with an acute awareness with the impact enforcement has on the individuals we encounter. While I.C.E. prioritizes our efforts by targeting fugitives who have demonstrated a threat to national security or public safety, we have a clear mandate to pursue all immigration fugitives.""The Cardozo report said that Janet Napolitano, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, had changed some policies that contributed to the abuses it found, like eliminating the arrest quota. But the report recommended more drastic steps.Home raids should be “a tactic of last resort, reserved for high-priority targets,” and then only after agents have obtained judicial warrants, the report urged. A high-level supervisor should be on site, and home raids should be videotaped, it recommended.Agents should have to note why they initially seized and questioned any person, the study said. “That’s the bread and butter of any arrest report,” said Peter L. Markowitz, who teaches at Cardozo and is one of the report’s authors. Such a note was missing from two-thirds of the arrest reports analyzed in the study.'"

It has begun an offer to repay that $1 billion in maturing debt at a discount.CIT was forced to turn to bondholders in recent days for help after the government refused to save the company last week.Failing to garner enough tender offers for the imminent debt could force it to file for bankruptcy protection, CIT disclosed in the S.E.C. filing.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Christian Vande Velde is an American cyclist who finished fourth in last year’s Tour de France. Riding this year for the Garmin-Slipstream team, Vande Velde will file periodic updates of his experiences at the Tour.No one needs to be a professional bike racer, riding 200 kilomoters a day up and down mountains in searing heat and freezing rain. You do it because you love it.On days like Sunday, a brutal mountain stage at the Tour de France, you take inspiration wherever you can get it. I didn’t give up because I knew that my friends and family who are watching at home weren’t giving up on me.As I came across the finish on Sunday, I found myself holding onto the guardrail (or should I say Gavin, my soigneur), unable to catch my breath. I was suffering the entire climb and had no idea what state I truly was in until I was forced to stop 10 feet past the finish.Heaving, trying to get a hold of myself, I realized that I hadn’t held anything back and thus have no regrets — everyone’s worst enemy.At the bottom of the final climb I was with my teammates David Millar and Bradley Wiggins. We moved toward the front of the bunch because we knew that there were switchbacks and that we needed to be out of trouble for the final kilometers.Staying at the front, ahead of crashes and the larger group, is always the safest place to be. It went fast and I gave it my all. That’s all you can do on the road. I felt physically sick for hours after the race and even had a laugh or two at my own expense with Millar pointing out how miserable I looked.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','“You were instrumental in promoting, funding and facilitating this cruel and inhumane sporting activity,” United States District Judge Henry E. Hudson said at the sentencing in 2007. And that is still true, even as Vick becomes free to live his life.He is, however, a man without a team, because the Falcons dropped him earlier this year. He is also apparently a man without an appointment to see N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, to see if he can get reinstated for potential employment, after 18 months in jail and two months of home confinement.This may sound cynical, but Vick, 29, could become a deserving example of the double standard that says if a player can still produce, somebody will try to rehabilitate him.Remember Father Edward Flanagan, the founder of that worthy institution called Boys Town? Father Flanagan’s motto was “There are no bad boys” — only bad environments. Franchise owners have been known to emulate Father Flanagan. Al Davis always loaded up his Oakland Raiders with renegades and troublemakers and bar-fighters, although Davis has not had much success lately.Character is usually overlooked in the double standards of sport. Even little kids knew Mickey Mantle was the epitome of drinking and philandering, but the Mick could hit the ball off the facade, and that was quite enough.Some standards are inviolate. Shoeless Joe Jackson will probably never get into the National Baseball Hall of Fame because he accepted some money in the farcical gambling coup at the 1919 World Series. No less a figure than Ted Williams lobbied for Jackson’s inclusion in the Hall, on the grounds of mercy and admiration for his skills, but Williams might have been Jackson’s last best chance.Pete Rose is going to have a tough time getting into the Hall — or earning a living in organized baseball — for three reasons: he gambled while managing the Reds; he lied when confronted; and he is forever linked with Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who died days after barring Rose.The double standard is that people will put up with dubious character — but only as long as the athlete can produce. Ty Cobb was a sociopath, but the greatest hitter of his day. Albert Belle’s antisocial pose was tolerated as long as he could hit. Mike Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield’s ear.The double standard has kicked in with drugs. N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern sighed and said, “This is sadness,” when, by league law, he had to banish Micheal Ray Richardson for life after a positive test. But baseball was slow to face reality, which meant Steve Howe received nearly double-digit reprieves for so-called recreational drugs because some club always needed a live left-handed arm.Baseball is stuck with double standards in the wake of the steroid revelations. Some people fret because that nice Barry Bonds is not employed, but you can bet — well, don’t bet — that Mr. Balco would have a job if he were younger and more nimble.Transparent obnoxiousness does not count against Roger Clemens, either. If he were five years younger, he’d be wearing pinstripes or maybe pitching in Queens.Meantime, Michael Vick is legally entitled to earn a living. I cannot find it in myself to say he should never have another chance in the N.F.L., given some of the characters who have run afoul of the law without being suspended. Whenever Goodell gets around to clearing him — and what’s wrong with making him sweat a few more weeks? — club owners are going to be wary of the reaction from animal lovers, and the owners will remember what happened at the Bad Newz Kennels. Vick has put himself in Coventry. At least until a few quarterbacks go down.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Merck said second-quarter earnings fell, hurt by lower sales of its cholesterol drugs, but income from partnerships and a rebound in sales of an asthma drug helped it beat profit forecasts.Schering-Plough, which Merck plans to acquire in the fourth quarter, posted lower quarterly earnings that slightly topped forecasts as demand grew for its Remicade arthritis drug.Merck is expected to reap huge cost savings from the Schering-Plough merger by cutting 15 percent of their combined work force. It will acquire a number of valuable drugs, including Remicade, a promising arthritis treatment called Simponi (golimumab) and a potential blockbuster drug to prevent blood clots that is now in late-stage studies.Merck earned $1.56 billion, or 74 cents a share, in the second quarter. That compares with $1.77 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.A particularly bright spot in Merck’s earnings report was the asthma drug Singulair, whose sales had steadily declined in the past year on concerns it might increase suicide risk. But its quarterly sales jumped 16 percent, to $1.3 billion.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Re “Frank McCourt, Whose Irish Childhood Illuminated His Prose, Is Dead at 78” (obituary, July 20):I had the pleasure of being Frank McCourt’s student in the 1970s, as well as interviewing him for Channel 13 soon after he won the Pulitzer Prize for “Angela’s Ashes.” I asked him his proudest accomplishment, thinking that he would talk about his family or overcoming poverty. He responded without hesitation, saying: “I figure I’ve taught some 10,000 New York City kids over the years. I like to think when I gave them Shakespeare, they got Shakespeare.”Mr. McCourt will be remembered in the hearts of generations of students not only for his wonderful literary achievements, but first and foremost as the best of teachers.I and others who passed through Frank McCourt’s class were saddened to learn of his death.His English class at Stuyvesant High School in 1975 was memorable for his Irish brogue, admiration of Jonathan Swift (“Gulliver’s Travels,” “A Modest Proposal”), general distaste for James Joyce (“Ulysses,” “Finnegans Wake”), and his raconteur-style, old-country tales. While we enjoyed the class, no one thought this particular teacher would become a world-renowned author.I can still hear Mr. McCourt exhorting us to conform our writing to a favorite phrase from “Hamlet”: “Brevity is the soul of wit.” This adage can apply just as well to the lessons of time and memory.Despite the brevity of the classroom experience, Mr. McCourt exhibited a soul of wit that continues to reverberate with his many students.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Caterpillar posted a second-quarter profit on Tuesday that exceeded analysts’ highest estimates, aided by job cuts and a lower tax rate. The company, the maker of construction equipment, raised its full-year forecast, saying stimulus programs were starting to support global demand.“We are seeing signs of stabilization that we hope will set the foundation for an eventual recovery,” Caterpillar’s chief executive, James W. Owens, said in a statement. “Credit markets have improved significantly. Fiscal policy and monetary stimulus have been introduced around the world, and we are seeing signs, particularly in China, that they are beginning to work.”Net income dropped to $371 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with $1.11 billion, or $1.74 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 41 percent, to $7.98 billion.Full-year profit, the company said, will be $1.15 to $2.25 a share excluding some items, exceeding analysts’ average estimate of $1.12. Sales will be $32 billion to $36 billion, in line with the average estimate of $34.8 billion.Shares of Caterpillar rose 7.67 percent, or $2.81, to $39.46.Mr. Owens has pressed the government for tax and trade policies to bolster sales and has eliminated about 17,100 full-time jobs since December. More than 17,000 contract and temporary workers also were cut.Caterpillar’s effective tax rate in the second quarter was 10 percent, less than the estimated annual rate of 31.3 percent, the company said. CAT Financial Services reported after-tax profit of $89 million, a 32 percent decline from a year earlier. Revenue declined 10 percent, to $700 million.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','PARIS — A decision by France’s energy regulator that seems to defy both logic and Europe’s green consciousness has set off a political storm here.At the center is a tiny company that seeks to save consumers money.Two weeks ago, the French Energy Regulatory Commission, the C.R.E., decided that Voltalis, a company that installs electricity management devices in homes and businesses and then manages their use, would have to, in effect, pay power producers for the power that it saves.Voltalis’s Bluepod boxes, free to consumers, plug into the home electrical panel and communicate back to the company’s computers by Internet. When, for example, summer demand on the electrical grid nears a peak, the system would automatically turn off air-conditioners for hundreds or thousands of consumers willing to give up the coolers for a short time to avoid the need for additional electrical production to come on line.The company says its “distributive load shedding” technology can save users as much as 10 percent on their electricity bills and save power producers billions in investments in new plants used only to meet peak demand. Voltalis’s business model assumes the grid operator pays Voltalis for help in maintaining supply and demand equilibrium.But the regulatory commission ruled that Voltalis should pay the power company because “its service would not be possible without the producer maintaining production.”'"
"'09-07-22,'0','That call could come from the Boston Red Sox or the San Francisco Giants, who could both use Johnson in different capacities. Maybe it could come from another team with a need for a reliable player.If the Nationals (27-66) ever trade Johnson, they may get a decent minor leaguer in return and they will pocket the savings from shedding his contract.With the nonwaiver trading deadline 10 days away, executives from other teams said the Nationals had been asking for too much for players like Johnson and Adam Dunn, his slugging teammate. Stan Kasten, the Nationals’ president, declined to discuss any trades and acknowledged that the team always considers possible deals. It is a safe bet that Johnson’s name has cropped up in multiple conversations.“I think Nick is a valuable player to us or to other teams,” Kasten said. “We love having him here.”How much longer Johnson expects to remain with the Nationals is a question he dodged. Johnson’s biggest liability is that he has been injury-prone, having played only 38 games last year because of a wrist injury and none in 2007 because of a broken right leg. Both the Red Sox and the Mets have spoken internally about the danger of acquiring a player who has been brittle. In fact, the Mets, who already have nine players on the disabled list, are unnerved by Johnson’s history.Although Johnson has been healthy this season and has appeared in 89 of Washington’s 93 games, he volunteered that missing huge chunks of seasons will be a factor as teams evaluate him. Johnson wishes it were not an issue.“For me, that injury thing is in the past,” Johnson said. “My body feels good now. That’s basically my main thing, to stay on the field and do my thing.”During Johnson’s first three seasons, all of them with the Yankees, he played on teams that averaged 100 victories. But since the Yankees traded Johnson in December 2003 to the Montreal Expos, now the Nationals, he has not been on a team with a winning record. Johnson acknowledged that it has been difficult playing on perennial losers.“You don’t want to just play .500 ball,” Johnson said. “You don’t want to just get to the playoffs. You play for the ring. I don’t have one. I’ve got two fake ones, two whatever you want to call them.”By fake rings, Johnson was referring to the American League Championship rings he received after the Yankees lost in the World Series in 2001 and in 2003.“They ain’t real,” Johnson said. “I want the real thing.”After the 2009 season, Johnson will become a free agent and will be in control of where he plays next year. Until then, Rex Gary, Johnson’s agent, said Johnson, like so many other players, has had to learn that there will be persistent rumors and that he cannot be distracted by them.“I think it’s impossible to completely ignore it,” Gary said. “I think it’s very possible to put it aside and play.”That is what Johnson is trying to do. Johnson said he keeps “grinding it” and keeps trying to help the Nationals “win as many ballgames as we can.” Still, there are times, maybe even every 20 minutes, when Johnson hears another rumor and wonders about his future.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','A Copernican revolution changed the course of 20th-century art. The human figure, once the center of the known artistic universe, became just another planet more and more distantly orbiting the twin stars of Abstraction and Conceptualism. Today an ability to draw live nude people is no longer the primary measure of artistic competence. It’s an elective, not a requirement.You may regard this as one of the great losses of modernity or as a paradigmatic shift opening art to expansive new vistas. Those in the first camp will not be reassured by “Reconfiguring the Body in American Art, 1820-2009” at the National Academy Museum. An uneven hodgepodge of paintings, drawings, sculptures and a video, the exhibition occupies the whole museum and includes some compelling works but on the whole does not make a persuasive case for a figurative revival.It was organized by Bruce Weber, the museum’s senior curator of 19th-century art, and Marshall Price, the curator of Modern and contemporary art. All 159 works are from the academy’s permanent collection, except for 10 contemporary pieces selected by Mr. Price to represent current trends.What is striking about the exhibition as a whole is how provincial it seems. That is the fault not of its curators but of the museum’s collection, which reflects the historically conservative attitudes of its membership, especially in the 20th century. Of course, in terms of artistic culture, the United States was a pretty provincial place until the end of World War II, so it makes sense that most of the paintings and sculptures from the 19th and early 20th centuries by artists like Kenyon Cox, Kenneth Hayes Miller, Will H. Low and others resemble watered-down European academic art. You won’t find much by Modernists like Marsden Hartley, Georgia O’Keeffe or even Edward Hopper.Nevertheless, the academy owns some true pre-Modernist treasures. One is a self-portrait painted with unflinching realism by Thomas Eakins in 1902. With his gloomy, baggy-eyed mien and tilting posture, he looks as if he were either drunk or shouldering the weight of the world.'"

"'09-07-22,'0','Apple also benefited from the June introduction of a new smartphone, the iPhone 3GS. Apple sold 5.2 million phones in the quarter, up from 3.79 million in the April quarter. The 3GS includes new features like the ability to record video, send picture messages and dial with voice commands. Apple previously said it sold more than one million 3GS handsets in the first three days of the product’s availability.Apple also lowered the price of the old iPhone 3G to $99 in an effort to increase its market share in the expanding market for smartphones, although the company would not say how well it was selling.The company’s overall gross profit margin grew to 36.3 percent, from 34.8 percent in the year-ago quarter.In the only dark spot for the company, sales of the iPod dropped to 10.2 million, from 11 million a year ago, a decline of 7 percent. Analysts said the slump reflected a saturation of the market for MP3 music players as well as the migration of people to phones that play music.Mr. Cook noted that the company had predicted and planned for the decline, and that sales of the iPod Touch — which looks similar to the iPhone and can also access applications from the company’s online iTunes store — had jumped 130 percent over the last year.Mr. Cook took the opportunity of a conference call with media and Wall Street analysts to again criticize the low-cost, pared-down computers known as netbooks, which had provided one of the few bright spots in the computer industry. He said that many netbook buyers became disappointed and that the devices were “very slow, they have software technology that is old, they don’t have a robust computing experience, they lack horsepower, they have small displays and cramped keyboards.”Though analysts wonder whether Apple could introduce its own low-cost computer — or at least some kind of economical tablet reading device — Mr. Cook said Apple would only deliver a product “that is very innovative and that is something we are very proud of.”Apple reported that its net income grew to $1.23 billion, or $1.35 a share, up from $1.07 billion, or $1.19 a share, in the quarter a year ago.Revenue rose to $8.34 billion, from $7.46 billion last year. That exceeded even some of the optimistic expectations of analysts, who projected Apple to announce revenue of $8.16 billion and a profit of $1.16 a share, according to a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters.Apple shares were up almost $7 in after-hours trading, after closing at $151.51 in the regular session Tuesday. Wall Street is impressed with Apple’s growing traction with affluent urban and suburban consumers unaffected by the recession. Analysts are also increasingly confident in how the company will fare without Mr. Jobs, who had a liver transplant in the spring but has recently returned to work.Mr. Jobs was not present on the earnings call with analysts, as some had hoped.The last six months “have been a resounding endorsement” of Apple’s management team, led by Mr. Cook, said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray. “This basically shows that in six months of running the company, Tim Cook has basically pulled it off in a terrible economy.”'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Don Knabe, chairman of the Los Angeles County board, said his county could lose as much as $600 million if the state was allowed to co-opt highway and redevelopment money. “Its very frustrating when you try to do the right thing and then you get the lion’s share of pain,“ Mr. Knabe said.State lawmakers said a property tax borrowing — which must be repaid under state law — was a necessary evil.“I come from local government,” said Darrell Steinberg, the senate president pro tem. “But I would just remind everybody that feels badly and strongly about the context here.”In Sacramento, lawmakers from both parties met with their caucuses to explain the budget deal and draft legislation to enact it. The agreement was announced late Monday, nearly three weeks after the beginning of the fiscal year. The missed deadline caused California to start issuing i.o.u.’s to vendors and tax payers.Inherent in the document are policy changes.Jean Ross, the founding executive director of the California Budget Project, a nonpartisan group that looks at state finances, said the final budget would probably include immediate, concrete changes, including a reduction in the amount of time that families can receive money from the state welfare system, CalWorks.There will also be numerous other effects, like more people in county clinics and emergency rooms and heavier workloads and longer waits in slimmed-down social service departments.Further, to achieve a $1.2 billion cut to the state’s prison system, some inmates will be permitted to finish their sentences on home detention, and there will be a scaling back of the number of people on parole. California is one of the few states that put all offenders on parole, and out of 168,000 prisoners in the state system, 70,000 have committed parole violations.“We are spending way too much money on the Department of Corrections,” Mr. Steinberg said.The changes will be done through what are known as trailer bills, additions to budget legislation that require only a majority vote, rather than the two-thirds needed to pass budgets.In a state where the vast majority of roads are maintained by cities and counties, officials said a loss of highway tax money to the state would mean a surge in the type of headaches that commuters dread, including potholes, slower response to emergencies and spills, and longer cleanups.Mr. McIntosh estimated that the budget would cost 4,000 jobs in public works departments statewide. In suburban Contra Costa County east of Oakland, the public works director, Julia R. Bueren, said her department would lay off more than a third of its staff by the end of August.“We’re going into reactive mode rather than proactive mode,” Ms. Bueren said.That situation may be worse in rural areas like Calaveras County, a sprawling triangle that runs from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada to higher elevations. Tom Garcia, the county’s newly appointed public works director, said he was bracing for a loss of about 20 percent of his budget, meaning many snow-packed mountain roads could go unplowed this winter.“In order to get anywhere in our county, its all on local roads,“ said Mr. Garcia, adding that resorts in the Sierra region could take a hit as well. “If they can’t get to the services in this county because the roads aren’t open, we’ve lost our winter income.”'"
"'09-07-22,'0','Pilobolus Dance Theater, the company formed in 1971 and named after a genus of fungi, has changed drastically over the years in terms of artistic makeup. Lately the group, which opened its third program of the current season on Monday night at the Joyce Theater, has looked to outside choreographers in an effort to ignite creative sparks. In the case of “2b,” a New York premiere by the Israeli artistic team of Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollak, the flame could do with more fanning.An arid work full of vague imagery and set to music by Bach, Tom Waits and Elvis Presley, “2b” features a surreal cast of characters. There are various skirmishes involving a man (Andrew Herro), a fisherman initially seen tangled inside a cluster of black balloons; a figure dressed in blue (Matt Del Rosario) wearing a fish head; a woman (Annika Sheaff) who skulks around the stage on demipoint wearing red tights and long red gloves; and another man (Jun Kuribayashi) who emerges from behind a miniature door.Yoann Tivoli’s lighting casts the stage in night shadows — or perhaps the depths of the ocean. After Ms. Sheaff, entering the stage from behind the tiny doorway, pops the balloons, one by excruciating one, Mr. Herro collapses flat on his back. It’s hard to say for sure what’s happening within this murky atmosphere — the tale seems to involve a fisherman who is outsmarted by a fish — but it’s just like the sort of dream you have after devouring an anchovy pizza before bed.The program features another dubious glimpse into the dark side — Jonathan Wolken’s 2008 “Razor: Mirror,” in which five dancers are transformed into nasty characters from a scrappy freak show.The works holding more allure, however, are those relying less on hollow theatrical conceits than on the dancers’ invincible, acrobatic flair. In Mr. Wolken’s 1973 “Pseudopodia,” Mr. Kuribayashi flips across the stage like a mercurial wonder.In “Symbiosis,” choreographed by Michael Tracy in 2001, Jenny Mendez and Jeffrey Huang grasp onto each other as if they were a sculptural force of slowly mutating muscle and bone. But both of these forays into pure movement are minor compared with “Day Two,” which dates to 1980. Directed by Moses Pendleton, a Pilobolus founder and now the leader of Momix, a company that deftly merges acrobatics and illusion, “Day Two” nails the point in which fantasy meets potent muscularity. In this work, the dancers — four men and two women wearing only dance belts and thongs — are a compelling blend of power and vulnerability as their movement shifts from low primal hops to fluttering hands held above their heads to resemble wings.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Two senior Democratic lawmakers called on the administration Tuesday to make the $700 billion bailout program more visible and accountable to taxpayers.Representative Edolphus Towns of New York, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, called on the Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner to adopt recommendations from a government watchdog that the department has resisted.The criticism came as the oversight committee heard testimony from special inspector general Neil Barofsky, who oversees the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Mr. Barofsky delivered a quarterly report to Congress that was sharply critical of Treasury’s reluctance to better track how the bailout money is being spent.In his report, Mr. Barofsky said Treasury had accepted some of his recommendations for greater accountability, but that the department had not taken steps to require all TARP recipients to report on their actual use of funds. He said Treasury should report the values of its investments in banks and other financial institutions, disclose the identity of borrowers under a nonrecourse loan program and disclose trading activity under a public-private investment fund.Mr. Barofsky also cited accountability weaknesses in a new public private investment fund initiated by Treasury that is intended to purchase mortgage-backed assets that have clogged bank balance sheets. The federal share of the program is $30 billion. Under the program, Treasury selected nine financial firms as partners in the securities purchase plan.Summing up the effectiveness of the $700 billion TARP, he said: “If the goal was to remove $700 billion of toxic assets off the books of financial institutions, that clearly has not happened. If the goal was to increase lending, I think that, too, unfortunately has not happened. If the goal was to avoid a complete systemic collapse of the financial industry, that may very well have happened.”'"
"'09-07-22,'0','“There were a bunch of Democratic states I wasn’t looking too seriously at for a while — , , — that I am taking new looks at because in the past several months, I have seen polling numbers for these governors tank,” Ms. Duffy said. “Let’s face it: Being governor is not the best job in America right now.”There are reasons for this. First, Democrats have more seats to defend next year: 21, compared with 18 for Republicans. (Over all, Democrats hold 28 governorships, and Republicans 22.)In addition, governors everywhere are struggling with huge budget deficits that are forcing them to cut services and raise , enmeshing them in bruising battles with state legislatures and constituency groups. That is causing problems for governors like James E. Doyle of Wisconsin and Chet Culver of Iowa, both Democrats who are up for re-election next year; Republicans are tracking polls showing both men as unpopular.What is more, there are 17 open seats in 2010, mainly because of term limits, and Democrats hold 10 of them.Among the Democrats being forced out by term limits are in , of (where, given the economic situation, she might have had a tough re-election bid); Brad Henry of ; of New Mexico; and Theodore R. Kulongoski of Oregon.And the Democrats can thank Mr. Obama for creating another big opportunity for Republicans in when he tapped the governor, , to be his secretary of health and human services.It is early, and to a certain extent the shape of these races will be dictated by who emerges from some crowded and competitive Republican primary fields across the country. As of now, officials from both parties said, Republicans could see a net gain of at least three governorships. Democrats face especially long odds in Kansas, Michigan, Oklahoma, and perhaps . That list of highly competitive races could end up including Colorado, , Iowa, , , , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, officials in both parties said.“We are mindful of the economic landscape, the historical trends for a president’s first midterm election and the sheer number of seats we need to defend,” said Nathan Daschle, the executive director of the Democratic Governors Association. “These are tremendous advantages for the other side. But the outlook is sunnier than we anticipated even a year ago.”Not that Republicans are not in danger of losing some seats of their own. With Gov. running for the Senate, could prove to be a high-profile and valuable gain for Democrats. The same is true for , where Gov. is barred by term limits from seeking re-election (though given his poll numbers, Democrats might wish he were on the ballot).Democrats are also in a strong position to challenge Republican governors in , , and .Similarly, the decision by Gov. , a Republican, not to seek re-election in , as he prepares for a potential presidential bid in 2012, has created an opportunity for Democrats.Republicans, however, may not have to wait until 2010 to start posting victories. There are two elections for governor this November, in and , both for seats held by Democrats. And both seem to be prime targets for Republicans.'"
"'09-07-22,'0','This is the first article in a weekly series about the challenges and satisfactions of raising a puppy through its first year of life.Scout, soon to be our puppy, was 9 weeks old and ready for pickup from the breeder in Massachusetts.What has possessed us to do this again?Buddy, our beloved, stone-deaf, feisty-to-the-end West Highland terrier, had expired at 15 in March 2007. My two children, who grew up with him but flew the nest years before his demise, joked that Buddy was my one perfect relationship in life. I spoiled him, terribly. Houseguests often awoke to the aroma of my grilling free-range chicken for Buddy. Henry, my husband, would sometimes note, without rancor, that when I went on business trips I always asked how Buddy was doing before I inquired about his or our two children’s well-being. When congestive heart failure claimed him, I was beyond brokenhearted.In the two intervening years, family and friends lobbied hard for us to get a new dog. My friend Jane sent me pictures of an elderly set of basset hound sisters who needed a new home and suggested we split them. I demurred, saying they should not be torn asunder. Cornelia, our daughter, cooked up names. Will, our son, bombarded me at work with impossibly cute photos from Petfinder.com. I was tempted but not ready, especially after an accident left me with a broken leg and foot. But this spring I was overcome by puppy lust, looking at all the cute, companionable dogs on the sidewalks of Lower Manhattan.We discussed at length the relative merits of adoption versus a breeder. If we adopted a dog from a shelter, as my sister has done twice, we would be taking the more virtuous, good-for-animals (and society) route. Saving a dog that needs a home or had been mistreated by a previous owner is an unselfish act. But we were leaning selfish. Henry wanted a bigger dog this time, and, when we took our beach walks, he looked longingly at the dogs who fetched and swam. He fell in love with a gentle English Standard golden retriever who belonged to friends, and had his heart set on a dog just like her. Our friends suggested a breeder.The application process felt a little like college. There were detailed questions, including the length of time we estimated we would be leaving a dog alone or traveling. We were asked to rate our family’s activity level on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being a couch potato and 10 a triathlete. (We were a solid 7.) Were we prepared for constant shedding and digging? These questions made total sense, since goldens need a lot of exercise, love company (Henry works from home and we don’t travel a lot) and are notorious shedders and diggers. Only one question gave me pause. Was our lawn “meticulously kept?” (It depends on your definition of meticulous.)At seven weeks, we were invited by the breeder for a “visit,” i.e. interview. On the eve of our trip, we watched hours of “The Dog Whisperer,” and Henry informed me that he was replacing me as pack leader. (Though I could be forceful at work, I was neither calm nor assertive enough with a dog, the key qualities required by Cesar Millan.) Cornelia loved the name Scout, and that weekend, we found ourselves rewatching the film “To Kill a Mockingbird,” with the wonderful, brave little girl named Scout.One look at the nine little golden puppies, still nursing, and we were hopelessly hooked. Scout, one of the smallest, was a particular favorite of the breeder, who called her Cindy Lou Who after the tiny Dr. Seuss character. We met her mother, Tess, and father, Patrick, as well as a passel of aunts, uncles and grandparents. But we still had to wait two more weeks to take her home.She arrived almost housebroken, a wonderful surprise. Somehow I had forgotten how much having a new puppy is like having a new baby. It’s not only the made-up games, the hide-and-seek and stuffed animals. There is the special puppy smell, much like the distinctive scent, better than perfume, of a new baby’s head. There is the reflexive urge to smother with kisses. There is the getting up in the middle of the night. There is the singing of lullabies to sleep, lying next to Scout’s crate as if it were a cradle. There is the arrangement of play dates for socialization. (My husband, who is doing the lion’s share of the work these first weeks, jokes that the high point of his day is the 4 p.m. play date with Cyon, our friends’ older golden.) There are the books written by experts (our puppy manual is by the Monks of New Skete). There is the feeling of total relief in seeing tired eyes close for a nap.Although we are bonding, no one quite prepares you for the fact that a new dog makes you miss the old one. When Scout rests on her side, I see an image of Buddy, curled similarly, on our old rug in a house we no longer own. A friend, just returned from Scotland, gave me some Westie souvenirs, which I used to collect and display in my office. I felt momentarily tearful.Soon the collection, no doubt, will turn from white to golden.'"

(AP) — Manufacturing conglomerate 3M Co. said Thursday its second-quarter profit fell 17 percent as the global recession cut sales to car makers, but results still beat analysts' expectations.The Dow Jones industrial average component, which makes products including Scotch tape and Post-it notes, also raised its full-year sales and earnings forecasts, and shares rose in premarket trading.Net income attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended in June slipped to $783 million, or $1.12 per share, from $945 million, or $1.33 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company recorded profit of $1.20 per share.Analysts expected profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of $5.41 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Such estimates typically exclude special items.3M increased its 2009 profit outlook to a range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share, excluding special items, from a previous range of $3.90 to $4.30.The company now expects revenue to decline 10 percent to 13 percent from last year, compared with its previous forecast for a decline of 11 percent to 15 percent. The company's new guidance implies revenue of $22.52 billion to $22.77 billion.'"

"'09-07-23,'1','But in fact, racial profiling was a major issue for Mr. Obama when he was in the legislature. He was the chief sponsor of a bill, which became law, that requires police to record the race, age and gender of all drivers they stop for traffic violations and for those records to be analyzed for evidence of racial profiling.And so the substance of his response was not as surprising as the fact that a president so quickly joined the fray.The police were called to Professor Gates’s house on July 16 after a report of a burglary in progress. Professor Gates said he told the police that he lived in the house and that he was jimmying open a damaged front door. Still, the police report said he was arrested for “loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space.” He was held in police custody for four hours. Professor Gates said he was the victim of racial profiling and has demanded an apology, but the police officer involved, who is white, has said he has nothing to apologize for.On Tuesday, disorderly conduct charges against Professor Gates were dropped, and the city of Cambridge, its police department, the Middlesex County district attorney’s office and Professor Gates issued a joint statement calling the incident “regrettable and unfortunate.”Mr. Obama, asked on Wednesday what the incident said about race relations in America, noted up front that Professor Gates is a friend and that his comments might be biased. He said “words” had been exchanged and added:“Now, I don’t know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that, but I think it’s fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know, separate and apart from this incident, is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately. And that’s just a fact.” He added later that the incident was “a sign of how race remains a factor in this society.”He also used biting humor, grinning broadly as he imagined being in Professor Gates’s seemingly preposterous circumstance of being arrested after trying to get into his own home.“Here, I’d get shot,” Mr. Obama said, referring to his new address of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.The statement was a bit of political jujitsu that acknowledged the intense security that surrounds any president while letting sink in the image of what would happen to anyone, let alone a black man, who might seem to be breaking into the White House.Mr. Obama’s response lit up the blogosphere immediately after the press conference. The debate developing overnight was whether Mr. Obama had gone too far in his response.On , one commenter had this to say: “Shouldn’t we all be outraged that a black man can somehow be arrested attempting to break into his own home in 2009? Obama is right on the money on this one. Do we have to be black to get this?”Another said: “I don’t think the arrest was racially motivated. I believe it was a contest of egos. Mr. Gates lost that battle since he was beyond the ivy walls. I agree with the President that the arrest was stupid, but I think there was plenty of blame to go around.”It could not be determined how well Mr. Obama knows Professor Gates. But the professor, a widely respected expert in the field of race relations, had very kind words for Mr. Obama’s pivotal speech on race relations after the Wright affair threatened to sink his candidacy.“I think it was brilliant,” Professor Gates said of the speech in an interview with Tavis Smiley at the time. “It is a great speech about race, and race relations, particularly between black people and white people at the beginning of the 21st Century.”'"

"'09-07-23,'1','Electronic cigarettes contain traces of toxic substances and carcinogens, according to a preliminary analysis of the products by the Food and Drug Administration.The findings, which were announced on Wednesday, contradict claims by electronic cigarette manufacturers that their products are safe alternatives to tobacco and contain little more than water vapor, nicotine and propylene glycol, which is used to create artificial smoke in theatrical productions. When heated, the liquid produces a vapor that users inhale through the battery-powered device.“We’re concerned about them because of what we know is in them and what we don’t know about how they affect the human body,” said Joshua Sharfstein, the F.D.A.’s principal commissioner.The agency analyzed 19 varieties of cartridges, which hold the liquid, and two cigarettes, one manufactured by NJoy and another by Smoking Everywhere.The analysis found that several of the cartridges contained detectable levels of nitrosamines, tobacco-specific compounds known to cause cancer. One Smoking Everywhere cartridge was found to contain diethlyene glycol, a common ingredient in antifreeze that counterfeiters have substituted for glycerin in toothpaste, killing hundreds worldwide.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','His “Concept Note” suggested that responsibility to protect was redecorated colonialism, and that the true means to eliminate genocide and similar scourges included world financial reform, Security Council reform and drawing a lesson from Jesus.“Jesus’ emphasis on redistribution of wealth to the poor and on nonviolence reinforces the right perspective on responsibility to protect,” his note said.Father D’Escoto scheduled a panel discussion before the General Assembly debate featuring speakers like Noam Chomsky, the American academic whose critique of “humanitarian imperialism” discussed the doctrine. Much of the opposition to the doctrine on Thursday is expected to come from traditional opponents of American foreign policy like Cuba, Venezuela and Iran.While Father D’Escoto has supporters, many delegations reacted with the usual combination of outrage and derision that Father D’Escoto, a former Sandinista foreign minister, has a habit of provoking. The ambassador of one Latin American state said it was shocking that a priest was putting ideological and political visions ahead of human suffering. Peter Maurer, the Swiss ambassador, put it more bluntly, saying, “A priest should know that certain things are better kept to your heart.”Father D’Escoto’s spokesman, Enrique Yeves, said the president was being unfairly criticized. “The only thing he is doing is calling for a debate on this issue, which is very pertinent,” Mr. Yeves said.Even without the General Assembly president, the topic — shortened in United Nations-speak to “R2P” — was a hard-fought one. Many developing countries harbor suspicions that the doctrine is merely a Trojan horse for foreign meddling in their domestic affairs. Attempts to slap the label on various crises only deepened those suspicions. As prime minister of Britain, Tony Blair briefly used it as retroactive justification for invading Iraq. France tried to deploy it as the prescription for forcibly delivering aid to Cyclone Nargis victims in Myanmar in 2008. Russia cited it as its tanks rolled into South Ossetia last summer.Edward C. Luck, whom Mr. Ban appointed his special adviser on the topic but the General Assembly refused to pay, wrote a report this year that divided the concept into three pillars: that all states must protect their populations from atrocities; that the United Nations and other institutions can help countries failing in this duty; and that the international community must react in a series of steps when a large number of civilians are at risk, with military intervention the final response. The fight swirls around that last point, when military intervention might be justified and whether that can be codified into law. “The problem with all of this is the one-dimensional perception that R2P is only about military coercion,” said Gareth Evans, a former Australian foreign minister.Delegates from African organizations have come to argue that R2P is not just a Western tool. Other proponents hope the debate will inch the discussion toward practical steps on how R2P can be made operational. But some worry that the more it is debated, the less consensus will emerge.The Bush administration disliked the doctrine on the ground that it might tie American hands in foreign policy decisions, but President Obama basically supports it.Susan Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, often speaks about how the failure to intercede in Rwanda while she was a top Clinton administration official in Africa is a low point in American foreign policy and her personal career. In a speech last month in Vienna, Ms. Rice acknowledged that the doctrine had been abused in conflicts like Iraq, but argued for the responsibility “to respond to the worst outrages.”“We know there will be more perpetrators,” she said. “We know there will be more victims. But we must work to ensure that there will also be more justice and fewer and fewer bystanders.”'"
"'09-07-23,'1','The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., managed to do something in 2008 that fewer and fewer Americans have the wherewithal to do: He paid off his credit card bills.According to financial disclosure documents released Wednesday, Mr. Thompson paid off an American Express card balance of $5,000 to $35,000 that had been lingering for at least a year. The disclosure forms require officials to indicate only broad ranges.Mr. Thompson’s financial portfolio increased as a result of two major changes in his life: He married Elsie McCabe, a woman of substantial wealth and achievement who is president of the Museum for African Art; and his mother, Elaine Thompson, a retired schoolteacher, died at the age of 81.After Ms. Thompson’s death, Mr. Thompson received a bequest of $100,000 to $250,000, according to the documents. He married Ms. McCabe in September, and after she sold her apartment on the Upper West Side, the two bought a row house in Harlem for $2.1 million, according to other public records.Mr. Thompson’s information was part of the first batch of financial disclosure statements released annually by the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board. The first batch also included documents pertaining to the finances of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn and the public advocate, Betsy Gotbaum. It will release documents related to other City Council members and officials next month.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','The lack of criticism of Mr. Bakiyev underscores how the Obama administration has emphasized pragmatic concerns over human rights in dealings with autocratic leaders in Central Asia. Under pressure in Afghanistan, the administration has feared alienating nearby countries whose support is increasingly important.How to react to crackdowns like Mr. Bakiyev’s is a longstanding challenge for American diplomacy, here and around the world. Some American officials stress that rebuking governments over human rights is often ineffective because they lash back, and tighten things further.The administration is mindful that a neighboring former Soviet republic, Uzbekistan, closed an American military facility there after American officials condemned an attack by the security forces in 2005 that killed hundreds of people. The Obama administration is trying to repair that relationship.In the Kyrgyz elections on Thursday, opposition parties have rallied around the candidacy of a former prime minister, Almazbek Atambaev, but he is given little chance. Mr. Atambaev’s campaign manager, Bakyt Beshimov, said the Kyrgyz president drew strength from the American reluctance to speak out.“This regime clearly understand that for the United States, democracy is not a priority, freedom of speech is not a priority,” Mr. Beshimov said. “They want peace, stability, air bases and regional security connected with Afghanistan.”The Obama administration’s attempt to improve ties with Central Asia was underscored by a visit to the region this month by a senior diplomat, William J. Burns.In Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Burns said at a news conference that the United States hoped for “fair and credible elections,” but he did not mention the treatment of the opposition or journalists.Interviewed about the political situation, another State Department official, George A. Krol, said reports of violence “greatly disturb the department.”“The United States doesn’t shy away from raising these issues with the Kyrgyz authorities,” he said.The Kyrgyz president, Mr. Bakiyev, took office in 2005 after the Tulip Revolution — the third in what was seen at the time as a series of so-called color revolutions that offered hope of more democratic governments in the former Soviet Union.Today, widespread disillusionment has set in, as in Ukraine and Georgia, which also had such upheavals.Kyrgyzstan, with five million people, continues to have a more open political system and more open media than its hard-line neighbors in Central Asia. It is not a police state, and in general, only those who overtly challenge the government are hounded by the security services.Even so, human rights groups have been taken aback.“President Bakiyev has become infamous for even greater levels of corruption, authoritarianism and ineffective economic policies than his predecessor,” Freedom House, a human rights group, said in a new report.In an interview at the presidential residence, Mr. Bakiyev dismissed such criticism. He said the security services were in no way persecuting the opposition.He said he would be easily re-elected because the country was faring well despite the financial crisis, adding that opposition leaders were complaining that balloting would be falsified because they needed excuses for their lack of support.“A strong opposition would not behave in that way,” Mr. Bakiyev said.He said he was so confident that the elections would be honest that he had invited the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to monitor them. In a report in May, the organization, which has 56 member states, described concerns in Kyrgyzstan about “a criminalization of the political process.”Mr. Bakiyev, asked about repeated attacks on journalists, said he doubted that the attacks were related to their jobs. He said the government would never try to silence the media.“The only authorities that would take that step are ones who are afraid — afraid of journalists, afraid of openness, afraid of something that they want to hide,” he said. “I, as president, and the government of Kyrgyzstan fear absolutely nothing. There is no motive, there is no reason to hunt down journalists.”Still, the bloodshed continues. This month, a journalist named Almaz Tashiyev died after being beaten by police officers, prosecutors said.Syrgak Abdyldaev says he barely escaped that fate. In March, Mr. Abdyldaev, 47, a well-known journalist who has scrutinized the president’s political activities, was lured to a meeting by an anonymous caller who promised confidential information, and was attacked.He was stabbed 29 times in the thigh, apparently in an effort to cause him to bleed to death. He survived after passers-by came to his aid.“They wanted to make an example of me,” Mr. Abdyldaev said. “They wanted me to die in front of everybody. And then nobody — not a journalist, not anybody with a brain in his head — would dare write anything in the press.”While he was hospitalized, his newspaper, The Bishkek Reporter, dismissed him. He was told it was too risky to keep publishing his work.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','Two weeks later, on July 6, I arrived for my appointment.Dr. Feinberg said my hamstring was definitely injured. Then he said the magic letters: P.R.P. Doctors at the Hospital for Special Surgery, he said, have been trying something new, injecting patients’ own blood or, alternatively, platelet-rich plasma, or P.R.P., directly into the injured area.Before he could begin to explain, I burst out: “Oh — do you offer it here? Can I get it?”I knew about the treatment because I had read an article in The Times reporting that professional athletes were getting platelet-rich plasma, with many claiming it cured them. It consists of your own blood, concentrated so that it is made up mostly of platelets — tiny colorless bodies in blood that release substances that help repair tissues.At the time I read the article, I was dubious, noting that there weren’t even semi-rigorous studies of the effects of P.R.P. Here we go again, I thought, with an expensive treatment spreading and companies selling equipment before research could even begin.Now, of course, in Dr. Feinberg’s office, I suspended my disbelief.Some doctors inject a person’s whole blood; others inject mostly platelets. It’s not cheap, typically costing more than $1,000. But the price varies markedly depending on the area of the body being injected, on whether the injection is done under guidance, whether the doctors also charge for follow-up appointments, and the region of the country. The two treatments cost about the same. Some insurers pay, while others do not.I could find no studies formally testing one treatment against the other. And the evidence in support of both treatments was mostly anecdotal, said Dr. Ronald Adler, chief of the ultrasound division in the Department of Radiology and Imaging at the Hospital for Special Surgery.The idea of injecting blood or platelet-rich plasma into an injured tendon makes some sense. Blood contains platelets that release growth-promoting molecules that can help tissue heal.“We think a switch gets turned on,” and the body starts to heal the injury, said Dr. Brian Halpern, a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. He is the doctor there with the most experience with P.R.P., having used it for two years.One of the most experienced doctors in the nation, Dr. Allan Mishra, an orthopedist at Menlo Medical Clinic in Menlo , Calif., has studied the treatment in the laboratory and found that it helps tendons heal. Others tested it in rats, and reported it sped healing of their tendons.And Dr. Mishra and others who use the treatments say that patients often get better sooner than expected. Some who suffered for years with tendon pain finally got relief after platelet-rich plasma therapy, Dr. Mishra said. He is directing a study in which 230 patients with will receive either a saline injection or P.R.P., to objectively test whether the treatment works.But none of the evidence so far is enough to sway many skeptics, especially when, as Dr. Adler explained to me, “the whole issue of why tendons heal is fairly complex and not entirely understood.” And, he added, “even surgery, which many consider a gold standard, doesn’t necessarily work.”For example, Dr. Adler said, some patients have surgery to repair torn rotator-cuff tendons in their shoulders, and say they feel better. But on scans, he said, he may see “large persistent defects at the repair site, and in some cases no residual repair at all.”Dr. Mishra knows the criticism of P.R.P. well.“When I stand on a podium and give a presentation, I dodge the ,” he said. But, he adds, skepticism is fading these days and, in his opinion, there are now more believers than doubters.On July 8, two days after I saw Dr. Feinberg, I was at the hospital, ready for Dr. Adler to give me an injection. I had run six miles that morning, thinking it might be my last run for quite some time. It was a glorious day; my running partner, Jen Davis, and I ran fast, high on endorphins. (Yes, I know: If this were a story about someone else, I’d think the person was a complete idiot.)I wanted P.R.P., but the Hospital for Special Surgery had temporarily suspended that treatment while its lawyers worked on the waiver that patients sign. So I took what I could get — an injection of my own blood.The technician started to scan my hamstring, then went to get Dr. Adler, who was to do the injection. When she left the room, I thought maybe I wasn’t really injured and they would just send me on my way without the blood injection.To my absolute shock, though, Dr. Adler told me just the opposite. I had a bad injury — the tendon that holds my hamstring to the bone was 50 percent torn. It was more severe than almost any other injury he had treated with blood injections and he had no idea whether an injection would work. Did I still want it?So, using ultrasound to guide him, Dr. Adler poked a needle into my tendon while a technician took 5 cubic centimeters of blood from my arm — about a teaspoon. Then Dr. Adler injected the blood. It felt like , but in a different place. Dr. Adler said that injuries like mine typically took six to eight weeks to heal, that I could not run for at least two weeks and that I should ask Dr. Feinberg what activities I could do.He also said that because the treatment was so new to orthopedics, no one really knew what activities were safe just after an injection. Dr. Halpern, for instance, puts patients on crutches for a few days after he injects their legs, ankles or feet. Another doctor puts patients into a leg brace. Dr. Adler lets patients walk.I was so stunned to learn that I had such a serious injury that when I walked into the subway station to return to work, I just stood in the station in a daze.But Dr. Feinberg was my kind of doctor. After the first couple of days, he said, I could ride my road and work out on the elliptical cross-trainer if I found angles and resistance levels that did not make my leg hurt. In two weeks, he said, I could try “easy jogging” — a mile the first time to see if it hurts — and “see how it goes.”Of course, no matter how it goes, I will never know if the blood injection helped me. I have no way of knowing what would have happened if I had not had the injection and simply took two weeks off from running.I have made an appointment for a follow-up ultrasound scan on Aug. 3. If my tendon is not healing, Dr. Adler says, he will give me P.R.P. And in that situation, I want it.My insurer did pay for the first treatment — I don’t know the cost. And that’s part of the problem — costs are invisible to patients. This one does not even show up on the insurer’s Web site.Dr. Feinberg told me that he had been dubious about the treatments, too, but that patients had done so well with them that he had become convinced they are effective. Now, he added, doctors at the hospital were starting studies giving platelet-rich plasma to people with tennis elbow, knee and Achilles tendinopathy and patients with back pain from disk problems.From what they see in patients with injuries like mine, he said, the doctors are enthusiastic.“The results over all are so promising and so positive,” Dr. Feinberg told me.As a skeptical medical reporter, I’d say, that’s not very convincing evidence. As an injured runner, I say, “I’ll take it.”'"
"'09-07-23,'1','WASHINGTON — President Obama welcomed Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq to the White House on Wednesday and said that despite occasional differences between the two nations’ military forces, the United States was on track for withdrawing combat forces from Iraq by the end of August 2010.“The United States and Iraq have known difficult times together,” Mr. Obama said. “Now, both of us agree that the bonds forged between Americans and Iraqis in war can pave the way for progress that can be forged in peace.”In a joint appearance in the Rose Garden, the two leaders sidestepped some of the recent conflicts over details of the withdrawal and security, and they presented a positive portrait of the evolving relationship between the United States and Iraq. Although Mr. Obama conceded there would be “some tough days ahead,” he said he remained confident that the Iraqi forces would ultimately be able to handle much of their own security so the United States could pull out its combat troops.The president also said he was committed to working with Iraq to persuade the United Nations to ease international sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The sanctions, which were imposed on Saddam Hussein’s government, require Iraq to pay 5 percent of its oil revenue as war reparations.“It would be a mistake for Iraq to continue to be burdened by the sins of a deposed dictator,” Mr. Obama said, responding to a question from an Iraqi reporter.Mr. Maliki’s visit to the White House for a series of meetings with Mr. Obama and other administration officials was the highlight of his weeklong trip to the United States. The two leaders met privately in the Oval Office, their first meeting since American forces turned over security in cities and towns to Iraqis on June 30.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — EBay made its name as the biggest shopping site on the Web. But now, as its e-commerce business slows, it hopes to become the biggest online payments provider on the Web through its PayPal service.If John J. Donahoe, eBay’s chief executive, has his way, PayPal will soon become the way that people pay for everything they buy on the Web or on their mobile phones. On Thursday, eBay is scheduled to announce its plans to open the PayPal platform to developers who want to build applications that use PayPal’s technology.EBay’s payments business, which consists of PayPal and Bill Me Later, has become the company’s growth engine as e-commerce sales decline.On Wednesday, eBay reported that net income in the second quarter, ended June 30, fell 29 percent to $327 million, or 25 cents a share, from $460 million, or 35 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue fell 4 percent, to $2.1 billion from $2.2 billion.But eBay’s online payments business posted $669 million in revenue, an 11 percent jump.In an interview, Mr. Donahoe said that opening up PayPal platform could transform the online payments marketplace. “No other global payments platform, online or offline, has been able to open up to third-party developers. And the effect on PayPal will be very comparable to the effect on the iPhone — we’ll see the exponential innovation and growth that comes with it as you release the creativity of those developers.”For example, Research in Motion, which has been testing the new offering during a pilot period, is using PayPal technology to collect payments from BlackBerry users who buy applications in its app store. And Twitpay, a start-up, uses PayPal’s technology to run its service that allows people to send money using Twitter.Meanwhile, eBay’s traditional marketplace division continues to struggle. Shoppers have reduced spending during the recession, and eBay has been hurt as other e-commerce sites, notably Amazon, take market share. Revenue from the marketplaces segment, which includes the main eBay site and sites like Shopping.com, fell 14 percent, to $1.26 billion from $1.46 billion a year ago.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','“We think of these social media tools as being in the realm of the sophisticated, multiplatform marketers like and , but a lot of these supersmall businesses are gravitating toward them because they are accessible, free and very simple,” said Greg Sterling, an analyst who studies the Internet’s influence on shopping and local businesses.Small businesses typically get more than half of their customers through word of mouth, he said, and Twitter is the digital manifestation of that. Twitter users broadcast messages of up to 140 characters in length, and the culture of the service encourages people to spread news to friends in their own network.Umi, a sushi restaurant in San Francisco, sometimes gets five new customers a night who learned about it on Twitter, said Shamus Booth, a co-owner.He twitters about the fresh fish of the night — “The O-Toro (bluefin tuna belly) tonight is some of the most rich and buttery tuna I’ve had,” he recently wrote — and offers free seaweed salads to people who mention Twitter.Twitter is not just for businesses that want to lure customers with mouth-watering descriptions of food. For Cynthia Sutton-Stolle, the co-owner of Silver Barn Antiques in tiny Columbus, Tex., Twitter has been a way to find both suppliers and customers nationwide.Since she joined Twitter in February, she has connected with people making lamps and candles that she subsequently ordered for her shop and has sold a few thousand dollars of merchandise to people outside Columbus, including to a woman in shopping for graduation gifts.“We don’t even have our Web site done, and we weren’t even trying to start an e-commerce business,” Ms. Sutton-Stolle said. “Twitter has been a real valuable tool because it’s made us national instead of a little-bitty store in a little-bitty town.”Scott Seaman of Blowing Rock, N.C., also uses Twitter to expand his customer base beyond his town of about 1,500 residents. Mr. Seaman is a partner at Christopher’s and Cheese shop and owns a bed and breakfast in town. He sets up searches on TweetDeck, a Web application that helps people manage their Twitter messages, to start conversations with people talking about his town or the mountain nearby. One person he met on Twitter booked a room at his inn, and a woman in ordered sake from his shop.The extra traffic has come despite his rarely pitching his own businesses on Twitter. “To me, that’s a turn-off,” he said. Instead of marketing to customers, small-business owners should use the same persona they have offline, he advised. “Be the small shopkeeper down the street that everyone knows by name.”Chris Mann, the owner of Woodhouse Day in , twitters about discounts for massages and manicures every Tuesday. Twitter beats e-mail promotions because he can send tweets from his phone in a meeting and “every single business sends out an e-mail,” he said.Even if a shop’s customers are not on Twitter, the service can be useful for entrepreneurs, said Becky McCray, who runs a store and cattle ranch in and publishes a blog called Small Biz Survival.In towns like hers, with only 5,000 people, small-business owners can feel isolated, she said. But on Twitter, she has learned business tips from an accountant, marketing tips from a consultant in and start-up tips from the founder of several tech companies.Anamitra Banerji, who manages commercial products at Twitter, said that when he joined the company from in March, “I thought this was a place where large businesses were. What I’m finding more and more, to my surprise every single day, is business of all kinds.”Twitter, which does not yet make money, is now concentrating on teaching businesses how they can join and use it, Mr. Banerji said, and the company plans to publish case studies. He is also developing products that Twitter can sell to businesses of all sizes this year, including features to verify businesses’ accounts and analyze traffic to their Twitter profiles.According to Mr. Banerji, small-business owners like Twitter because they can talk directly to customers in a way that they were able to do only in person before. “We’re finding the emotional distance between businesses and their customers is shortening quite a bit,” he said.'"

They came to us for assistance, and we are doing that.”The Los Angeles coroner’s office has yet to release the results of a toxicology report.The clinic in North Houston is owned by Dr. Davill Armstrong, who had his license suspended by the state medical board from 2006 to 2009 for improperly treating 15 patients, and was fined $2,000 in 2008 for allowing his wife to prescribe medication to a patient at the clinic without a physician present.Dr. Murray, who has an office in Las Vegas, has had numerous legal judgments against him. He was not at the clinic in Houston at the time of the raid.On Wednesday, a publicist for Mr. Chernoff, Tammy Kidd, said the search “was a surprise” to Mr. Chernoff and his associates.Mr. Chernoff has said Dr. Murray did not prescribe any drugs that might have caused Mr. Jackson’s death. In a statement released Tuesday, he said investigators were seeking “more information” from Dr. Murray, including Mr. Jackson’s medical records.“The coroner wants to clear up the cause of death; we share that goal,” Mr. Chernoff said. “We don’t have access to the most important information in this case, the toxicology report. We’re still in the dark like everybody else. Based on Dr. Murray’s minute-by-minute and item-by-item description of Michael Jackson’s last days, he should not be a target of criminal charges.”By noon on Wednesday, the search of Dr. Murray’s office had turned into a spectacle. At least eight Houston police vehicles surrounded the clinic, news helicopters hovered above and crowds of onlookers gathered nearby. Federal agents and local officers were seen carting bags of evidence out of the clinic and loading them into the police cars.'"
"'09-07-23,'1','WASHINGTON  The Senate on Wednesday turned aside the latest effort by gun advocates to expand the rights of gun owners, narrowly voting down a provision that would have allowed gun owners with valid permits from one state to carry concealed weapons in other states.A group comprising mostly Republicans, along with some influential Democrats, had tried to attach the gun amendment to the annual military authorization bill, a must-pass piece of legislation. But the provision got only 58 votes, two short of the 60 needed under Senate rules.Two Republicans, Senators Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, joined with 35 Democrats and 2 independents to reject the amendment, which was bitterly opposed by a number of big-city mayors, including Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.The debate forced senators to wrestle with issues of states rights, sometimes in ways that seemed to clash with the general philosophies of their parties. Many Republicans, who typically favor limiting the ability of the federal government to dictate to states on social issues, voted in this case to limit the ability of states to insist on their own rules for concealed weapons carried by people from other states.“Lives have been saved with the defeat of this amendment,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a leading opponent of the amendment, said in a statement. “The passage of this amendment would have done more to threaten the safety of New Yorkers than anything since the repeal of the assault weapons ban.”The amendment was pushed by Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, and was co-sponsored by several Democrats from states where gun rights are broadly supported, like Montana, where Senators Max Baucus and Jon Tester both favored it. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who is up for re-election in 2010, also supported the measure.Going into Wednesday’s vote, supporters of gun rights seemed to have the momentum in the Senate, with a group of Democrats looking to block the amendment but acknowledging that the vote would be close. Under a parliamentary agreement, proponents needed 60 votes for passage.This was the latest effort by gun advocates to push new firearms rights through Congress, where they hold increasing sway.In May, Congress approved a measure that let gun owners with proper permits carry their loaded and concealed weapons in national parks. And Mr. Thune, Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, and other pro-gun lawmakers had said they intended to bring more provisions seeking to expand gun rights to the Senate floor this year.Every state except Illinois and Wisconsin allows concealed weapons, but the statutes concerning who is eligible to carry one vary widely by state. The amendment defeated Wednesday would have allowed gun owners with permits from states with looser restrictions to transport their guns to states with tougher restrictions; it would not have allowed the use of concealed weapons in Illinois and Wisconsin.Critics of the amendment argued that it would undermine state and local gun-control laws, and accused Republican supporters, typically staunch defenders of states’ rights, of hypocrisy.In their floor speeches and in the lead-up to the vote, Republicans repeatedly sought to rebut that accusation by saying that gun carriers would still have to obey state and local laws.Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, said the provision would not undermine local laws. He quoted a letter from a constituent who said she felt safer carrying her concealed weapon when she went out at night with her family.“Specific state laws must be followed by the visiting individual,” Mr. Vitter said.He also dismissed assertions that the provision would aid criminals.Another Republican supporter of the amendment, Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, said the law would make a gun permit “just like a driver’s license.”“The Thune amendment is a license for self-defense across state lines,” Mr. Barrasso said.Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group of more than 400 mayors headlined by Mr. Bloomberg and Thomas M. Menino of Boston, sent a letter to Mr. Reid and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California pointing out that at least 31 states required gun owners to take a firearms training course to receive a permit and that at least 35 states banned those convicted of certain misdemeanors from carrying a concealed weapon.“The vast majority of states have set minimum requirements for obtaining a permit to carry a concealed gun,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement, “and Congress should respect those laws instead of trying to usurp them.”'"
"'09-07-23,'1','On Wednesday, investigators also detained a woman identified as Ariana Rahma, who is believed to be married to Noordin Muhammad Top, the prime suspect in the attacks, the local news outlets reported. She is said to be the daughter of the head of an Islamic boarding school in Cilacap, Central Java, that was raided last month. Investigators in that raid discovered bomb-making materials identical to those used Friday, the police have said.The authorities have said that the bomb-making methods and the nature of the attacks indicated strongly that they were the work of Mr. Noordin, a Malaysian extremist who is believed to be behind the attacks earlier this decade. He was once a senior official in Jemaah Islamiyah and is the most wanted fugitive in Southeast Asia. Many extremist groups operating in Indonesia are said to have ties to him.Though Mr. Noordin has evaded capture over the years, the Indonesian authorities have greatly disrupted Jemaah Islamiyah’s leadership. Once a network with operations throughout Southeast Asia, experts said, it now survives mostly in Indonesia in loosely affiliated small groups. The Indonesian government has also run a much-praised program in certain prisons that works to persuade Islamic militants to give up extremism.But experts said that the authorities had been reluctant to rein in clerics and schools that had allowed extremists like Mr. Noordin to continue operating.“On the law enforcement side, the achievements have been certifiable,” said Sidney Jones, an expert on Islamic terrorism at the International Crisis Group’s branch here in Jakarta. But Ms. Jones said that with an estimated 50 schools with ties to Jemaah Islamiyah, fugitives were sheltered, new recruits were found and money was raised.“These places remain nodes of communication that are critical to keeping the network alive,” she said. “Everybody knows where these schools are, but there’s been a sensitivity in dealing with them because people don’t want to see Islamic education stigmatized.”Islamic schools, called “pesantrens” here, have long played a central role in many Indonesian communities. Only a few are said to espouse violent tactics. But the schools, which are politically powerful, have long resisted greater government scrutiny.“It would be very difficult to start questioning ulamas from these schools,” said a senior Indonesian counterterrorism official, referring to Islamic scholars at the schools and speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to the media. “Even moderate Indonesians would react negatively against that.”The official said that sensitivity about carrying out any measure with a tinge of the pre-democratic Suharto era also complicated investigators’ activities. While permits were needed to publish books in the past, publishers of radical ideology are now flourishing in Indonesia and account for the biggest source of such thought in Southeast Asia.“Since democratization, we’ve been in a conundrum,” the official said. “Do we start banning books?“We’re conscious that we have not eradicated the deeper problems in the last five years,” the official added.Mr. Gunaratna, of Nanyang Technological University, said Indonesia needed to adopt tougher antiterrorism laws, like those in Singapore and Malaysia, which allow suspects to be detained and questioned longer without bringing charges.“That’s the reason there has been no attack inside Singapore or Malaysia,” he said. “Since democratization, some members of the Indonesian elite have the misguided view that these measures are antidemocratic.”'"
"'09-07-23,'1','The chief executive of the Boeing Company said Wednesday that the aircraft maker was making “solid progress” toward fixing a structural weakness that was discovered last month on its new jet, the 787 Dreamliner.But the executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said it was too early to say when the plane would make its first test flight or how much Boeing would have to pay customers in penalties for the delays. Boeing shares closed down 2.37 percent.Stock analysts have said that the delays could cost Boeing billions of dollars in concessions to airlines waiting for the plane. And The Seattle Times quoted two unidentified engineers on Wednesday as saying that the first test flight would probably not happen for four to six months.But in a conference call with analysts and reports Wednesday, Mr. McNerney said only that the company would not be able to set a new flight date or disclose the financial impacts until later in this quarter.The Dreamliner, which will be the world’s most advanced passenger plane, is considered crucial to Boeing’s future. The company has 850 orders for the plane, which is made of lightweight composite materials and is supposed to be lighter and more fuel-efficient than other commercial aircraft.'"

"'09-07-23,'1','LONDON — The human rights group Amnesty International accused Saudi Arabia on Wednesday of using its campaign against terrorism as a facade for “a sustained assault on human rights” and said the rest of the world had failed to hold the authorities to account for “gross violations.”Its report said thousands of people had been arrested and detained in virtual secrecy “while others have been killed in uncertain circumstances.” It accused the Saudi authorities of using torture to extract confessions and of using their “powerful international clout to get away with it.”Rich in oil, Saudi Arabia is an important Western ally, both as a bulwark against Iran and as a wealthy and influential player in the Middle East crisis. But it has been under Western pressure to combat terrorism since 15 of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were found to be Saudi citizens.Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, is also a Saudi national although the authorities stripped him of his passport in the 1990s.Abdulrahman Alhadlaq, a Saudi Interior Ministry official, told The Associated Press that Amnesty International’s assertions were “claims that have to be proven.”'"

"'09-07-24,'1','But though it all sounds very 2003, the film’s insights are less topical than procedural. It’s not about something that happened but rather about the way things work. Using a mock-vérité style familiar from television shows like “The Office” (and his own series, “The Thick of It,” in relation to which this film is somewhere between spinoff and stepchild), Mr. Iannucci maps the queasy interpersonal power games at the heart of any political endeavor. The inhabitants of his universe are in essence well-connected cubicle rats, or junior high school clique members with media access and large standing armies, or perhaps Renaissance courtiers with BlackBerrys and power suits.They are all hellbent on humiliating, destroying or using one another. But of course all of them — the smooth-faced aides, the preening deputies, the ciphers and backstabbers and the snarling press secretaries who seem to run the whole show — are allies, colleagues and in a few cases, lovers. A journalist’s voice is sometimes heard squawking on the other end of a phone line, and a single significant member of the public at large materializes in the person of Steve Coogan, but otherwise the entire menagerie is, as the picture’s title implies, on the inside and on the same side.Every house, needless to say, is divided against itself. The hapless Simon is pulled this way and that by two rival underlings, the sharp-tongued Judy (Gina McKee) and the deceptively guileless Toby (Chris Addison). Their boss is also sucked into a power struggle between two opposing state department honchos, Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), who wants to slow down the rush to war, and Linton Barwick (David Rasche), who wants to speed it up. Karen and Linton have a pair of antagonistic aides, Chad (Zach Woods) and Liza (Anna Chlumsky), eager young things already adept at smiling, collegial knife work.The plot is as intricate and elegant as a computer circuit board, though at times it looks more like a tangle of crossed wires. The short summary is that everybody betrays everybody else, that opportunism trumps idealism and that telling the truth is a matter of tactical calculation rather than ethical imperative. The principal doves — Karen and a sensitive Pentagon general played by James Gandolfini — are as puffed up and shabby as the hawks. Nobody’s motives are pure, and when it’s all sorted out, the killing will start.The audience, meanwhile, is likely to die laughing. While “In the Loop” is a highly disciplined inquiry into a very serious subject, it is also, line by filthy line, scene by chaotic scene, by far the funniest big-screen satire in recent memory. The hand-held camera work, the hectic jump-cuts and the grubby visuals may resemble television, but the restless pacing and drab appearance serve a clear aesthetic purpose. The film visits some of the world’s great monuments to liberty and order on both sides of the Atlantic — 10 Downing Street, the White House, the United Nations headquarters — and they’ve never looked worse, as if shot through a filter made of grime.And at the end you may feel a little unclean, which is also evidence of Mr. Iannucci’s satirical rigor. The people in whose hands momentous decisions rest are shown — convincingly and in squirming detail — to be duplicitous, vindictive, small-minded and untrustworthy. But why should they be any different from the rest of us?Directed by Armando Iannucci; written by Mr. Iannucci, Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell and Tony Roche; music by Adam Ilhan; production designer, Christina Casali; produced by Kevin Loader and Adam Tandy; released by IFC Films.

"'09-07-24,'1','The Knicks’ off-season has created much discussion but little movement, with the organization at a standstill with its own free agents and others while it teeters between the incremental moves of the present and the potentially momentous ones of 2010.Spurned by the veterans Jason Kidd and Grant Hill, who chose to stay with teams that offered better odds of reaching the playoffs, the Knicks have focused on the Milwaukee Bucks point guard Ramon Sessions. But even signing Sessions is unlikely because of its implications on the Knicks’ payroll during next off-season’s free agency. Sessions is also a restricted free agent, so the Bucks can match any offer sheet.The Knicks have not presented a formal offer to Sessions, said his agent, James Wells. The Los Angeles Clippers are also interested in Sessions, who averaged 12.4 points and 5.7 assists last season.“Nothing’s changed,” Wells said Thursday. “We’re still talking to teams, and the Knicks are one of them. We’re trying to get something done sooner rather than later and go from there.”The Clippers may cease being a suitor for Sessions if they cannot move the recently acquired Sebastian Telfair. That move also stopped their early pursuit of the free-agent point guard Allen Iverson, according to a team executive who was not allowed to publicly discuss the team’s dealings.'"
"'09-07-24,'1','“A lot of the veterans got more out of the mentorships than the rookies,” Swayne said.The mentoring experiment formalizes a longstanding tradition in which a veteran would take a younger player under his wing. The Giants have assembled a team of 10 veterans who will mentor rookies beginning in September. Charles Way, the Giants’ director of player development and a five-year veteran running back for the team, said the idea of the program was to have players get beyond superficial relationships, put teammates in touch with one another and encourage them to share details of their lives and of the paths that carried them to the N.F.L.For Way, a recent Sports Illustrated article about how many athletes end up broke despite having made millions during their careers convinced him that this type of mentoring was sorely needed.“As much education as we do about finances, about career transition, they still don’t get it, so there has to be more,” he said. “It has to be more than sitting them down in a room and telling them this is what you should be doing with your money, this is where you should be going to get a job. It has to be more.”More meant players sharing beliefs and exploring where those beliefs came from.“It’s not about what players learn now but what road they took over the last two decades that shaped beliefs and behaviors,” Way said.“We can have Warren Buffett stand in front of them and say, ‘Hey this is what you need to be doing with your money.’ But if we don’t change the values that were instilled in them for the past 21 years, they’re not going to change.”This is an ambitious plan for professional football teams, whose primary function is winning games. Behavior, as the Giants experienced last season with Plaxico Burress, can have a negative impact on a team’s ability to win. The Giants lost Burress after he accidentally shot himself in the thigh at a nightclub, and his absence is generally cited as helping sink the Giants in the playoffs.In an ideal world, Burress would have had a good mentor years ago and perhaps been talked through some unresolved issues rather than acting them out.“A lot of guys don’t know what people are going through,” Way said. “People keep things personal: ‘I don’t want you to know my sister is probably a drug addict, my mom is probably strung out on crack, my brother just stole a couple thousand dollars from me, my dad just beat my mom up.’ I don’t want to know that — that’s too personal.”Why should players want to engage in this level of intimate disclosure? The player is there to play football and win a job, not confess. “It’s going to keep you in the N.F.L. after you win that job, or it will help you keep the job you already had because now you’re not distracted,” Way said.Swayne did have a warning for veterans who will mentor rookies: “Young men need to be told what to do, but whoever says something better make sure they’ve been given the green light to say something.”As another season begins, pro teams, coaches and athletes continue to search for a happy medium in a competitive arena in which there appears to be so much take but very little give.'"
"'09-07-24,'1','And when a former Goldman Sachs programmer was accused this month of stealing secret computer codes — software that a federal prosecutor said could “manipulate markets in unfair ways” — it only added to the mystery. Goldman acknowledges that it profits from high-frequency trading, but disputes that it has an unfair advantage.Yet high-frequency specialists clearly have an edge over typical traders, let alone ordinary investors. The Securities and Exchange Commission says it is examining certain aspects of the strategy.“This is where all the money is getting made,” said William H. Donaldson, former chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange and today an adviser to a big hedge fund. “If an individual investor doesn’t have the means to keep up, they’re at a huge disadvantage.”For most of Wall Street’s history, stock trading was fairly straightforward: buyers and sellers gathered on exchange floors and dickered until they struck a deal. Then, in 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized electronic exchanges to compete with marketplaces like the New York Stock Exchange. The intent was to open markets to anyone with a desktop computer and a fresh idea.But as new marketplaces have emerged, PCs have been unable to compete with Wall Street’s computers. Powerful algorithms — “algos,” in industry parlance — execute millions of orders a second and scan dozens of public and private marketplaces simultaneously. They can spot trends before other investors can blink, changing orders and strategies within milliseconds.High-frequency traders often confound other investors by issuing and then canceling orders almost simultaneously. Loopholes in market rules give high-speed investors an early glance at how others are trading. And their computers can essentially bully slower investors into giving up profits — and then disappear before anyone even knows they were there.High-frequency traders also benefit from competition among the various exchanges, which pay small fees that are often collected by the biggest and most active traders — typically a quarter of a cent per share to whoever arrives first. Those small payments, spread over millions of shares, help high-speed investors profit simply by trading enormous numbers of shares, even if they buy or sell at a modest loss.“It’s become a technological arms race, and what separates winners and losers is how fast they can move,” said Joseph M. Mecane of NYSE Euronext, which operates the New York Stock Exchange. “Markets need liquidity, and high-frequency traders provide opportunities for other investors to buy and sell.”The rise of high-frequency trading helps explain why activity on the nation’s stock exchanges has exploded. Average daily volume has soared by 164 percent since 2005, according to data from NYSE. Although precise figures are elusive, stock exchanges say that a handful of high-frequency traders now account for a more than half of all trades. To understand this high-speed world, consider what happened when slow-moving traders went up against high-frequency robots earlier this month, and ended up handing spoils to lightning-fast computers.It was July 15, and Intel, the computer chip giant, had reporting robust earnings the night before. Some investors, smelling opportunity, set out to buy shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom. (Their activities were described by an investor at a major Wall Street firm who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect his job.) The slower traders faced a quandary: If they sought to buy a large number of shares at once, they would tip their hand and risk driving up Broadcom’s price. So, as is often the case on Wall Street, they divided their orders into dozens of small batches, hoping to cover their tracks. One second after the market opened, shares of Broadcom started changing hands at $26.20.The slower traders began issuing buy orders. But rather than being shown to all potential sellers at the same time, some of those orders were most likely routed to a collection of high-frequency traders for just 30 milliseconds — 0.03 seconds — in what are known as flash orders. While markets are supposed to ensure transparency by showing orders to everyone simultaneously, a loophole in regulations allows marketplaces like Nasdaq to show traders some orders ahead of everyone else in exchange for a fee.In less than half a second, high-frequency traders gained a valuable insight: the hunger for Broadcom was growing. Their computers began buying up Broadcom shares and then reselling them to the slower investors at higher prices. The overall price of Broadcom began to rise.Soon, thousands of orders began flooding the markets as high-frequency software went into high gear. Automatic programs began issuing and canceling tiny orders within milliseconds to determine how much the slower traders were willing to pay. The high-frequency computers quickly determined that some investors’ upper limit was $26.40. The price shot to $26.39, and high-frequency programs began offering to sell hundreds of thousands of shares.The result is that the slower-moving investors paid $1.4 million for about 56,000 shares, or $7,800 more than if they had been able to move as quickly as the high-frequency traders.Multiply such trades across thousands of stocks a day, and the profits are substantial. High-frequency traders generated about $21 billion in profits last year, the Tabb Group, a research firm, estimates.“You want to encourage innovation, and you want to reward companies that have invested in technology and ideas that make the markets more efficient,” said Andrew M. Brooks, head of United States equity trading at T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund and investment company that often competes with and uses high-frequency techniques. “But we’re moving toward a two-tiered marketplace of the high-frequency arbitrage guys, and everyone else. People want to know they have a legitimate shot at getting a fair deal. Otherwise, the markets lose their integrity.”'"
"'09-07-24,'1','Mr. Dear remains a believer. Private investments, he asserts, will over the long haul outperform stocks by three percentage points a year, and that is necessary to keep Calpers on track to returning its goal of 7.75 percent annual returns.“Three percent on a portfolio as large as ours makes a material difference,” he said.If he can inch Calpers’s investment performance up, many problems will disappear. If not, Calpers may end up in an even bigger financial squeeze than it is today.The scope of his task elicits sympathy from one of Calpers’s harshest critics, Marcia Fritz, a Sacramento certified public accountant and vice president of the California Foundation for Fiscal Responsibility, which has led a loud campaign over the rich benefits received by some Calpers retirees.“Joe Dear has got a tough job,” Ms. Fritz said. “I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. There’s so much pressure. It’s horrible.”A somewhat unorthodox choice for the job, Mr. Dear sounds a little like Captain Kirk surveying the Starship Enterprise when he explains why he leaped at the opportunity earlier this year: “Calpers is the flagship command of the public pension fund world.”He was hired in large part for his management skills and political savvy — honed in Washington, where headed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the Clinton years. He does not have an M.B.A. or any other advanced degree in finance. Harvard, Yale or Wharton is not on his résumé. Instead, his lone degree, in political economy, is from Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash.Most recently, Mr. Dear headed the Washington State public pension fund, which gained a reputation as a daring investor under his oversight. It risked more of its portfolio — 25 percent — on private equity than any other public fund. The bet pushed the Washington State Investment Board, which now has $67 billion in assets, into the top 1 percent of its peer group in performance during the boom years, according to Wilshire Associates. But in the fiscal year that ended last month, the fund lost 27 percent of its value, or $18 billion.Calpers has a lot riding on Mr. Dear’s effort to achieve above-market performance. The fund just posted a loss of 23 percent, the worst in its history. That leaves it 66 percent funded, the lowest level in two decades, meaning it has only $66 on hand for every $100 in benefits promised to 1.6 million California public employees and their families.Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has called the fund “unsustainable.” He has specifically criticized a decision by Calpers last month to give California municipalities a break on their required contributions. Rather than stepping up contribution rates to 5 percent to cover investment losses, Calpers set a maximum increase of 1.1 percent — saving municipalities hundreds of millions of dollars.Mr. Schwarzenegger called it a “pass the buck to our kids idea.” Calpers says municipalities, which pay 15 percent of their payroll — or about $11 billion a year — into the fund, needed the help.Steering through the political cross currents would seem to be one of Mr. Dear’s strengths.“My career sort of culminates in this job, where this combination of investment and political management and organization management come together because that’s what Calpers needs,” he said in his expansive corner office decorated with a photo of himself and Bono. (Bono was a general partner in an equity fund in which the Washington State fund invested.)“The fun part is the investment part,” Mr. Dear added, speaking in fast, yet measured tones. “The necessary part is the organization, the management and the work in the political environment. The common element in my career is that I’m extremely focused on improving the performance of the organizations I work for.”Mr. Dear, 57, is also chairman of the Council of Institutional Investors, a Washington nonprofit group that promotes shareholder activism — an effort close to the heart of the Calpers’s board and one reason he was hired.“The board felt that we had extremely good depth on the investment staff,” said George Diehr, chairman of the board’s investment committee. “We were looking for someone to knock down silos and get various asset managers talking to each other. We felt Joe would have those skills. He’s well known in the public pension field, and he’s a strong advocate for corporate governance.”In the end, Mr. Dear, who will get $408,000 to $612,000 in salary and can qualify for a performance bonus of up to 75 percent of that salary, will be judged by portfolio returns.Already, Calpers has raised its target for private equity and related investments by 40 percent to about 14 percent of the total portfolio. To cover any calls by private equity firms for additional money, the fund has also raised its target for cash on hand to 2 percent of assets.It is ratcheting back on public domestic stocks, which account for less than 25 percent of the portfolio, while another 25 percent of the portfolio is in international equities.Critics say that Mr. Dear and Calpers — which has a staff of 200 investment professionals — are taking on too much risk.“Calpers is significantly underfunded, and they have decided that they will roll the dice,” said Edward A. H. Siedle, president of Benchmark Financial Services, which audits pension plans. “Is that appropriate if you have just lost 25 percent of your portfolio? These are high-risk, illiquid, unregistered products where there is tremendous valuation uncertainty. I would bet you any amount that five years from now, this plan will not have outperformed the market.”Mr. Dear says he can improve performance in other ways as well. He has pressed the private equity and hedge funds in Calpers’s portfolio to reduce their fees, provide more transparency and segregate Calpers’s money from that of other investors. While not ready to announce any agreements, Mr. Dear said he was making “good progress.”Last week, he testified before Congress that private equity and hedge funds should register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and be subject to the agency’s oversight. On the activist front, Calpers has voted against management in a number of recent proxy battles, including management of Bank of America. And Mr. Dear or his staff meet regularly with members of Congress and the Obama administration.Saying he spends a third of his time as investment chief, a third on board matters and a third on outside issues, Mr. Dear remains passionate that this is the moment when shareholders can prevail.As he sees it, “You have public awareness, outrage over the consequences of a failed regulatory system and an administration and Congress prepared to respond.”'"
"'09-07-24,'1','Now the buyout firm is eyeing Procter & Gamble’s $3 billion prescription drug business, a transaction it would probably do with a partner. The investment would work a bit like a bond, throwing off fairly predictable amounts of cash for a finite period and then declining after its drug patents expire in a few years’ time.Doing a safe deal like this would put some of Cerberus’s unused capital to work, bring in a bit of cash flow — and, perhaps, soothe a few investors’ nerves. Still, it would really amount to damage control. Such an investment might stabilize the portfolio, but probably would not deliver outsize returns. Problems elsewhere could still easily re-emerge. Cerberus may be trying to move on, but its past missteps will not be so easily forgotten.Will it be “V” for victory in Asia’s economies? The Asian Development Bank expects the region to recover quickly in 2010 from its sharp downturn, which is regarded as a V-shaped recovery. Trade has bounced back and domestic growth remains strong. The region’s manufacturing-oriented economies with modest budget deficits may now fare better than the centers of the financial crisis.In many cases, the region’s downturns were harsher in the first quarter of 2009 than those experienced in Western economies. For instance, the gross domestic product in Taiwan shrank by 10.2 percent, while Singapore’s dropped by 9.6 percent in the quarter. In comparison, the economy of the United States declined 2.5 percent, while Britain’s fell 4.9 percent.The differences seem surprising at first glance. The Asian Development Bank estimates that of the $1.5 trillion of global financial sector write-downs since September 2008, only $35 billion were in Asia. But the region had a different kind of collapse: exports tumbled around 30 percent.Trade has now recovered significantly, and Asian stock markets have risen by about 70 percent. Most regional economies are expected to post positive growth in the second quarter and to continue doing so thereafter.While the downturn has pushed the countries’ budget deficits higher, only Malaysia’s is expected to be above 5 percent of G.D.P. in 2009. Some worries over China’s financial sector aside, little appears to prevent the region from resuming growth based on domestic strength and an improving, if not stellar, export picture.That contrasts with the United States and Britain, where record budget deficits and sharply negative real interest rates are set to stunt future growth. The economic drag from correcting expansive and potentially inflationary monetary policies and servicing large government debt burdens may cause growth to remain subdued for years.So the Asian Development Banks prognosis sounds reasonable. With less financial sector drag, the region could well lead the way out with a relatively rapid V-shaped recovery.'"

"'09-07-24,'1','According to a study by Forrester Research, 86 percent of corporate PCs continue to rely on the eight-year-old Windows XP.Microsoft’s Windows profits have also fallen because of rising interest in the cheap, compact laptops known as netbooks, which rely on the lower-priced Windows XP instead of Vista.Earlier this month, Google revealed plans for a direct, open source competitor to Windows for the netbook market, which would be provided free to netbook makers, and major PC makers have backed Google in what is most likely a bid to put even more pricing pressure on Microsoft.The big question haunting Microsoft is when sales of its old-line products like Windows and Office will come back and fuel the company’s aggressive strikes into areas like search, mobile device software and online business applications.In its fourth quarter, Microsoft’s net income fell to $3.05 billion, or 34 cents a share, for the period ended June 30. The figures represent a 29 percent drop in net income from the $4.30 billion, or 46 cents a share, that Microsoft reported in the period a year ago.Excluding charges tied to legal matters, layoffs and investments, Microsoft earned 36 cents a share in the quarter, meeting the forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Microsoft’s 17 percent drop in quarterly revenue was more troubling to Wall Street, which pushed the company’s shares down more than 7 percent, to $23.70, in after-hours trading. The company took in $13.10 billion in the quarter, missing analysts’ estimate of revenue by $1.27 billion.For the full year, Microsoft’s revenue declined 3 percent, to $58.44 billion, while its net income fell 18 percent, to $14.57 billion.On a positive note, Microsoft echoed recent comments from Intel, saying that there had been an increase in PC sales and healthier spending in Asia and the United States.“There are some signs that we have at least seen the worst,” said Christopher P. Liddell, the chief financial officer at Microsoft, in a conference call.In numerous public appearances, Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, has warned that people should not expect a major bounce-back in technology spending when the economy recovers. Rather, he suggested that a new, low bar had been set and that companies needed to adjust to such a reality.Microsoft’s recent missteps have resulted in a more cautious public stance. In a recent speech, Mr. Ballmer was equivocal about whether the company’s new Windows 7 software, to be introduced in October, would prompt a surge in PC and software sales. “Maybe it will. Maybe it won’t,” he said.“They want to keep expectations tame in front of Windows 7,” said Israel Hernandez, director of software research at Barclays Capital. “They want to keep things in check until they have better visibility on the economy.”Mr. Ballmer’s most boisterous recent comments have revolved around Microsoft’s staying power. He has vowed that the company will keep pouring money into research and development until it gets search, mobile software and virtualization software right. Microsoft spends close to $10 billion a year on research — more than any other technology company.Analysts contend that Microsoft has survived the downturn well enough, posting profits at a time when losses were more expected. They say the company seems destined to capitalize on large-scale PC upgrades, as companies finally give into the pressure of buying new machines.“They are at a great stage right now,” said Mr. Barnicle.In the recession, Microsoft has laid off thousands of people and sought to cut far deeper than usual into its cost structure. “In my mind, we are a stronger company than we were a year ago,” Mr. Liddell said.If the economy recovers as hoped next year, Microsoft appears poised to find its “mojo,” as Mr. Ballmer describes it. The company will have revamped its traditional products and will be releasing a new wave of online business software.Microsoft already appears confident enough to revisit a search and advertising combination with Yahoo, which Microsoft failed to acquire outright after extensive discussions last year. Talks about a partnership have intensified in recent weeks, and some people at both companies say they believe a deal could be near.'"
"'09-07-24,'1','DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The wife of the Iranian opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi spoke out forcefully on Thursday against the recent publication of accusations against her imprisoned brother, saying the accusations were false and amounted to a new effort by Iran’s hard-line leadership to discredit the opposition movement.Mr. Moussavi’s wife, Zahra Rahnavard, is a well-known figure in Iran who played an important role in his campaign before the disputed June 12 election. She made her statement on Thursday after a hard-line lawmaker accused her brother in print of helping orchestrate the post-election rallies and riots. The brother, Shahpour Kazemi, was arrested a month ago, and the Iranian authorities are reported to be preparing to broadcast videotaped confessions by some people detained in the unrest.“I am announcing that if they force a confession out of Mr. Kazemi or publish a hundred pages of accusations against him, neither I nor the people of Iran will believe it,” Ms. Rahnavard said, in comments published on Mr. Moussavi’s Web site.Mr. Moussavi and his followers assert that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s landslide election victory was rigged and that the real winner was Mr. Moussavi. They have resisted strong pressure from the Iranian authorities to renounce those claims, and recently Mr. Moussavi has said he plans to form a new political and social movement, in another challenge to the ruling elite.The lawmaker who accused Mr. Kazemi, Elias Naderan, also impugned Mr. Kazemi’s wife, adding that she traveled frequently to the United States and had even acquired a green card.In her statement, Ms. Rahnavard did not deny that her brother and his wife had traveled to the United States, but said the trips were for treatment of his wife’s illness and for “the transfer of knowledge and new technologies in the field of communications,” which is Mr. Kazemi’s expertise.'"
"'09-07-24,'1','Whatever you think about the Red Sox, whether you are running for president of Red Sox Nation or wish some new curse would infest Fenway Park with locusts, it is almost certain you never before accused them of being home wreckers.But the Sox went antifamily Wednesday. In the span of a couple of hours Boston made two trades that broke up chunks of two families. The Sox snared first baseman Adam LaRoche from the Pirates, leaving poor Andy at third base without his older brother to endure being in last place (again!). And then they snatched left fielder Chris Duncan from the Cardinals, leaving a steaming dad, the pitching coach Dave Duncan, behind. Worse, perhaps, the Red Sox immediately sent Duncan to the minors.The trades apparently made the Sox feel better about being swept by the Rangers and falling farther behind the Yankees. They also tried to steal a little thunder from the Dodgers, who threw their own little twist into the news when Manny Ramirez hit a game-winning, pinch-hit grand slam on his own bobblehead night. It was the latest wow moment of Ramirez’s colorful but checkered career, writes Helene Elliott of The Los Angeles Times. Conveniently, it gave Dodgers fans another reason to forget the reason he was suspended for 50 games this season. (Reminder: doping!)In other disturbing quasi baseball news, the former Yankees draft pick Taylor Mattingly, the son of Don Mattingly, was arrested in Evansville, Ind., and charged with battery against his mother.On the competitive front, baseball’s trade deadline (which is less a deadline than a suggestion) brings this year’s opportunity for teams to throw money away, writes WSJ.com.

"'09-07-24,'1','UBS’s private banking business suffered as clients withdrew billions of francs since the beginning of last year, partly because the bank’s reputation had been damaged by an investigation by Washington into possible tax evasion by wealthy Americans. UBS said earlier that it expected a second-quarter loss, largely because of restructuring charges, when it reported on Aug. 4.Credit Suisse benefited from its relatively limited exposure to financial products linked to the subprime mortgage market, which Mr. Stark said now allowed the bank to build up capital faster. Unlike its rival, UBS, Credit Suisse was not forced to accept government funds to rebuild its capital. Instead, the bank raised 10 billion francs in October from investors in Qatar, Israel and Saudi Arabia.The bank also took steps to reduce risk. Credit Suisse cut its risk-weighted assets to $139 billion, down 10 percent from the first quarter of this year, and said previously that it planned to reduce the number to $135 billion by the end of this year. Like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, Credit Suisse benefited from growth at its investment banking business in the second quarter as rivals continue to struggle. Morgan Stanley reported a second-quarter loss from continuing operations of $159 million on Wednesday.Mr. Dougan said that he expected further challenges globally but added, “If markets continue to improve, we expect to see further momentum across all our businesses.” He said that unlike some competitors, Credit Suisse did not believe that the banking industry would return to its practices before the recession.“Clients, investors and regulators will behave differently in the medium to long term,” he said in a conference call from Zurich.At its investment banking unit, pretax profit rose to 1.66 billion francs, from 304 million francs a year earlier, and revenue from sales and trading more than doubled. Private banking, which includes wealth management and corporate and retail banking, brought in 10.7 billion francs in net new assets. Of that, wealth management had a net inflow of 8.5 b francs, beating analysts’ expectations, even though it was below the 15.4 billion francs the bank attracted in the same period last year.“We had a solid quarter in private banking, with strong inflows across all regions and a high gross margin in wealth management,” Mr. Dougan said. Yet credit provisions continued to rise at its retail banking unit, making its performance the only one to disappoint some analysts. Provisions for credit losses rose to 75 million francs in the second quarter, from 5 million francs a year earlier.'"

"'09-07-25,'0','SAN DIEGO  Few directors are as revered by the fervent fans who attend Comic-Con as Peter Jackson, and he showed up before a rapturous crowd of 6,500 Friday afternoon with a plea.“I wish you could just take the amount of energy in here, bottle it and give it to Hollywood executives to drink,” he said.What passes for royalty in the movie world had shown up to hold court at what has become the biggest annual gathering for the most passionate fans of comics, movies, science fiction, fantasy and video games  just the sort of folks the studios and networks are most eager to attract and seduce.Mr. Jackson, the New Zealander who is lord of the “Rings” trilogy and all things fantasy and horror, was on hand to promote a science fiction thriller directed by a protégé, Neill Blomkamp.John Lasseter, the king of American computer-generated animation, swapped trade secrets (through an interpreter) with Hayao Miyazaki, Japan’s emperor of anime.And some of Hollywood’s flashiest stars  Denzel Washington, Robert Downey Jr., Cameron Diaz, Megan Fox and Josh Brolin among them  shared their presence with the masses.In fact, Friday’s lineup  the convention officially began Thursday  proved once and for all that virtually no one who makes or stars in Hollywood blockbusters can afford to sidestep this four-day conclave, which is all about direct communication with the fans. It is also very much about marketing, an event that has acquired major importance on the industry’s calendar; major studios promote their biggest coming projects, and television producers for shows like “Lost” and “24” try to stoke interest in their approaching seasons.That can mean painful moments, as actors endure what amounts to a good-natured hazing from fans in cat fur, Bo Peep outfits and neon pink hair. Mr. Washington fairly gave up after he managed to compare working with Gary Oldman to “good sex” and used a racial epithet in parrying a friendly catcall. “We’ll be hearing about that,” he said.The actresses routinely fielded marriage proposals from members of the crowd. “Yes. Where are you?” responded Cameron Diaz, on hand to talk up the thriller “The Box.” She had never attended the convention before, but appeared to have the drill down pat.The impact of Comic-Con’s myriad panels and parties has been supercharged by an increasingly powerful  and instantaneous  tendency by nearly all involved to communicate their experiences via the Internet.Warner Brothers gave plenty to tweet about during a two-and-a-half-hour presentation Friday that included scenes from Spike Jonze’s fuzzy and furious adaptation of Maurice Sendak’s “Where the Wild Things Are”; a specially prepared “emoticon graphic novel” introducing the postapocalyptic release “The Book of Eli” with Mr. Washington; and a bravura performance by Mr. Downey, who popped onstage in shirt and Op Art tie to serve as M.C. for a peek at his “Sherlock Holmes.”“I think the studio gave me too much credit thinking I was smart enough to play this guy, but they cast me anyway,” Mr. Downey said of what promises to be an exceptionally louche and rumpled take on the Baker Street sleuth. Asked about his martial arts training for the film, he assured the audience, “I could windmill through the lot of you, one after another.”While some worried that economic woes would keep the studios away and the crowds down, the presentations were even bigger than in previous years and featured, if anything, an even bigger array of top names. And the fans not only filled the San Diego Convention Center to capacity but also kept it packed through some of the less high-profile presentations that, in previous years, might have been more sparsely attended.This year some of the industry’s more ambitious filmmakers showed up to receive adoration from the fans, and to pay their respects in turn.Mr. Miyazaki, who seldom visits the United States, was an especially big catch. He had arrived to promote the English-language version of his latest, “Ponyo,” about a goldfish mermaid and her young boy companion.Asked by Mr. Lasseter, who oversees animation at Disney and its Pixar unit, about how he goes about creating his stories, the silver-haired Mr. Miyazaki, who appeared both bewildered and mildly amused by the encounter, said: “My process is thinking, thinking and thinking about my stories for a long time. If you have a better way, please let me know.”Mr. Miyazaki was greeted with rapturous hollers, and the capacity audience hung on his every word, for all his puzzlement at the lavish attention.Mr. Lasseter, meanwhile, introduced Disney and Pixar ventures like 3-D versions of the “Toy Story” movies and “Beauty and the Beast” and a coming jazz-age musical called “The Princess and the Frog,” which relies on conventional hand-drawn animation. He also let slip that the Disney animation shop will be soon be posting tidbits about its works in progress online, beginning with a video blog he expects to begin in the next day or two.The director Tim Burton, who said he had not visited the convention since he was a student in the ’70s, showed up Thursday to plug his “Alice in Wonderland,” from Disney, then, on Friday, to talk about “9,” an animated film of which he was a producer.Mr. Jackson, meanwhile, wrapped up the day with a preview of Mr. Blomkamp’s “District 9,” a science fiction adventure about apartheidlike townships for space aliens. The Comic-Con crowd ate it up, but it went ballistic when the “Lord of the Rings” director started riffing on another project, the big-screen adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien’s “Hobbit” that he intends to write and produce and have Guillermo del Toro direct.He said he expected to deliver a script to Warner Brothers in three or four weeks and hoped to be in a position to start offering roles to actors within two months  assuming studio executives approve of his script.“Drop Warner Brothers a line and encourage them to be kind to us,” he said.As movie stars and star-quality filmmakers occupy ever more space at Comic-Con, old hands are wrestling with what one of them, the author, television producer and veteran convention panelist Mark Evanier, called their most troubling question: “What am I playing against?”Mr. Evanier’s Friday panel discussion, with the comic and voice actor Stan Freberg, was scheduled opposite Mr. Jackson, one of Comic-Con’s biggest draws. And Pat Oliphant, the political cartoonist, was on a panel opposite Mr. Miyazaki’s appearance.But then, any gathering that could embrace Mr. Freberg, Mr. Jackson, Mr. Oliphant and Mr. Miyazaki all at once probably has room for everyone.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','The daunting prospect of adapting the big-box business to the Big Apple has limited Target to the city’s outer boroughs, while Wal-Mart has not ventured in from the suburbs.The retailers that do set up shop in Manhattan come for the exposure, the cachet and the pipeline to some of the nation’s wealthiest consumers, even in a recession.Although Penney’s has stores in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island, Manhattan represents its own geographic and psychographic space.“It is the center of media in the United States,” said Mr. Boylson, who added that being in Midtown would enable his company to introduce itself to Manhattan residents (and news media) who may have “an outdated perception” of Penney’s. The company has been using the tag line “We’re stepping up our style” in its advertising, and highlighting its clothing by the likes of Charlotte Ronson and Nicole Miller.Penney’s, which will occupy two lower levels of the Manhattan Mall, on the Avenue of the Americas near 33rd Street, also contends it can make money in Manhattan.“We think now, more than ever, the value that we bring to the table is going to play very, very well,” Mr. Boylson said.Most of the borough’s boutiques and department stores cater to upscale consumers, he said, so Penney’s prices “are going to fill a void.” Executives have said the chain tends to do well in ethnically diverse markets and is among the most popular clothing stores for Hispanic consumers.By opening in a major traffic hub and aiming at households earning about $65,000 a year, J. C. Penney hopes to attract new customers and take its national retail battle with Macy’s to its rival’s home turf. Advertisements for the new store zing Macy’s with barbs like, “the real miracle is now on 33rd Street,” referring of course to the film “Miracle on 34th Street,” about a Macy’s Santa Claus.Penney’s is tackling Manhattan even as June comparable sales fell 8.2 percent from June 2008. The heady days of 2006 when the company was reporting robust sales increases seem a dim memory. The relatively good news, however, is that while Penney’s is still reporting declines with other retailers, the double-digit drops of last year have not been repeated since January.At 153,000 square feet, Penney’s Manhattan store (which includes a Sephora cosmetics shop) is about the same size as its other locations. But the ceilings are significantly lower — eight feet high instead of the usual 11. To create the illusion of height, the company installed white panels that float slightly below a black ceiling. Also, directional signs that hang from the ceiling are daintier than usual.Like all out-of-towners, retailers go to great lengths to make it in Manhattan. They overhaul their typical big-box store designs, rethink how they manage inventory, hire more employees and even offer different merchandise. And they must contend with local concerns — the survival of nearby small businesses, traffic patterns, noise and labor practices.Even after years of planning, they still must do a lot of on-the-job learning. Home Depot, for instance, learned from customers that, in a borough of tiny kitchens, diminutive ranges, not usually stocked by the chain, are a must.“That was one of those baptisms by fire,” said Steve Lieberman, a regional merchandising manager for Atlanta-based Home Depot. And the chain’s popular free do-it-yourself workshops had to be tailored to Manhattan residents. Instead of clinics on lawn care, the Manhattan Home Depot offers seminars on how to pot a plant. Another class that has been popular in Manhattan is how to install your own toilet.“We sell a boatload of toilet seats and toilets” in Manhattan, Mr. Lieberman said. And delivery is much more important than in the suburbs; customers cannot lug a toilet home on the F Train. (Penney’s is offering same-day delivery in Manhattan for $15 for up to 70 pounds of merchandise.)Then there is the special character of New Yorkers. Executives have estimated that a city customer’s “wait tolerance” will be no more than 90 seconds.To hurry things along in its Manhattan shoe department — which will offer more shoes (some 41,000 pairs) than any other Penney’s — the retailer hired shoe runners. When a customer wants to try on a pair, a sales associate will use an electronic hand scanner to send the shoe’s size and type to the runners in the stockrooms. The runners will fetch the shoes and then place them on dumbwaiters that zoom up to the sales floors.Other New-York-minute amenities include an electronic queuing system that directs customers to cash registers and estimates wait times — almost as if the checkout line were a Walt Disney World ride.A machine called the FindMore has a touch screen to enable shoppers to view every item in the store and on Penney’s Web site. Even if the store is out of an item, customers can still buy it using the machine.Among the trickier challenges Manhattan poses to retailers is figuring out how to distribute a big-box store model over multiple floors.James Damian, senior vice president of the enterprise design group for Minneapolis-based Best Buy, said chains had to determine whether their brand could survive vertically.“Most big-box retailers fail because they’ve never kicked the tires on that,” he said.One consideration is how well each floor will accommodate throngs of shoppers. “The traffic is ferocious,” Mr. Damian said.That and the scarcity of storage space in Manhattan means big-box chains typically must house their inventory outside the borough, and use small trucks to bring it into their stores. Mr. Boylson said Penney’s was storing inventory in a distribution center in Manchester, Conn., and expected to be “running smaller trucks to New York almost around the clock.”The chains also have to increase the number of employees, cash registers and fitting room stalls.The Manhattan Penney’s has 500 employees, making it the company’s largest store staff. It has 100 cash registers; most Penney’s have 58. The fitting rooms have twice the number of stalls, 61, of the average Penney’s.Elbow room is tight, even for dummies. The Manhattan store has more mannequins than any other J. C. Penney outlet, to fill the myriad display cases near the escalators and entrances.The company is also using technology to help manage potential crowds: if an hour goes by and the bathrooms have not been cleaned, a buzzer automatically goes off, alerting store staff.Heavy customer traffic is among the reasons the company likes Manhattan Mall. Consumers can enter from the street, or from the 34th Street Herald Square subway station and the 33rd Street PATH train station.Company executives declined to say whether the recession had enabled them to get a break on the rent, but Mr. Boylson said the mall owner, Vornado Realty Trust, allowed Penney’s to design the space as it desired.The Manhattan store merchandise is essentially the same as that in other Penney’s, though during a recent tour, Pete Sadler, a district manager, said the store planned to take market share from Macy’s by offering more plus- and petite-size clothing.A lot of merchandise is already on sale, like 40 percent off cultured pearl jewelry, and 50 percent off clothing brands like St. John’s Bay.Walking the aisles, Mr. Sadler squeezed $3.99 pillows and stacks of white bath towels, also $3.99.“We think the people in Manhattan are going to love these prices.”'"

Evidence indicates that at least one suspect was significantly injured and could be seeking medical treatment on either side of the United States-Mexico border, the F.B.I. said. Mr. Rosas had spotted a suspicious group of people Thursday night in the Campo area near the Mexican border and called for additional agents to help track them, said a Border Patrol spokesman, Daryl Reed. When the suspicious group split up, Mr. Rosas followed some of the suspects on his own, Mr. Reed said. Other agents lost radio contact with him shortly after 9 p.m., then heard gunshots. Mr. Rosas, 30, was pronounced dead at the scene.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','Until recently, students like Ms. Parsons had every reason to expect a bounty of high-paying career opportunities, said Manny Contomanolis, president of the National Association of Colleges and Employers, an organization for career counselors that met last month in Las Vegas to ponder how to help themselves and their students cope with the souring economy.“If you went back to September and October, most campuses were reporting record recruiting activity,” Mr. Contomanolis said. “It was really in the November time frame that things really started manifesting themselves. A lot of students haven’t gone through a full recruiting cycle yet.”Some students, like Ms. Parsons, say they can afford to hold out a while. So does Robert Sherman, a finance major at Syracuse University who rejected a $50,000-a-year job as head of technology for a consulting company because he did not get a good vibe from his potential bosses. Instead, he said, he is “doing odd jobs to support myself, and I’m O.K. with that” while he tries to get two technology companies of his own off the ground.“I’m definitely seeing a lot of the older generation saying, ‘Oh, it’s so awful,’ but my generation isn’t getting as depressed and uptight about it,” said Mr. Sherman, who admitted he and his parents had deliberated for a week before he turned down the offer. “We’re working within the bounds of the situation. The economy will rebound.”Some praise that approach. Steven Rothberg, founder of the online job board CollegeRecruiter.com, noted that most seniors were not compelled by mortgages or other expenses to grab just any position at whatever salary is offered. To do so could haunt them later when the economy improves, he said.“A lot of times, the offer is simply not acceptable to them, the compensation is far beneath where it should be, the job does not line up with their career interest,” Mr. Rothberg said. “If they take it, they’re going to be stuck with that career path and compensation level for years to come.”The phenomenon of students’ turning down offers despite the economic conditions is so pervasive that the president of the University of Connecticut, Michael J. Hogan, addressed it in his commencement speech in May.“My first word of advice is this: Say yes,” Mr. Hogan urged the graduates when it came to prospective employers. “In fact, say yes as often as you can. Saying yes begins things. Saying yes is how things grow. Saying yes leads to new experiences, and new experiences will lead you to knowledge and wisdom. Yes is for young people, and an attitude of yes is how you will be able to go forward in these uncertain times.”That is how Anthony Scruggs, 23, sees it, too. Mr. Scruggs recently graduated from the University of Arkansas and is moving home to Houston to take a $30,000-a-year job as a self-described “paper pusher” with a real estate development firm, the only offer he received in seven months of searching.“It kind of took me by surprise because you just assume when you’re in college that when you graduate you’re going to get the job, and here I am,” Mr. Scruggs said. “I’m 23 years old, and I’m going to move back in with my parents. I kind of had to rearrange the game plan for sure.”Career counselors like Ms. Wilsey wish more students saw it that way. She is bracing for a busy summer as new graduates finally face up to the tough market and turn to her for help.“There are fewer successes, but I have to keep a positive attitude because if I don’t, then I’ll get discouraged, and then that’ll discourage the students,” Ms. Wilsey said. “I’ve got to say: ‘Here’s what you have to do, here’s how I can support you — yeah, it’s going to be tough, but I’m going to support you.’ ”'"

"'09-07-25,'0','Mr. Smith said the concessions had the potential to settle the latest European antitrust case. “This is an important step forward and follows extensive and lengthy discussion between Microsoft and the commission. But until the commission approves something, nothing is really done. Given the state of the economy, we believed it was very important to move forward quickly,” he said.“This would mark a big step forward in addressing a decade of legal issues and would be good news for European consumers and our partners in the industry,” the company said in its statement.The ballot screen would not be an option for buyers of PCs using Windows 7 software in the United States or in other markets outside of the European Union. But Microsoft said it also planned to release confidential technical information worldwide that would help competitors design software that worked more smoothly with Windows, Windows Server, Exchange, Office and SharePoint.Its rivals were taking a wait-and-see attitude. “It is, of course, a good development that Microsoft will make changes to allow users to choose their own default Web browser,” said John Lilly, the chief executive of Mozilla, which makes Firefox, the second-most-used browser after Internet Explorer. But Mr. Lilly said he reserved judgment on the proposal until seeing details, including which browsers would be able to participate in the ballot and under what terms, and whether Microsoft would use automatic updates to offer a browser choice to existing Windows users. Google, which makes the Chrome browser, had no comment.John Briggs, a partner at Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider, a Washington law firm specializing in antitrust litigation, called the development a breakthrough for Microsoft and the commission.“I think it is very significant that Microsoft is willing to provide access to other browsers,” he said. “It’s also significant that the commission and Microsoft are negotiating without having proceedings go all the way.”Microsoft and European regulators had clashed for almost a decade in the first antitrust case, as the software maker tried to rebuff charges of abusing its dominance in operating systems to aid its media players and servers. The legal wrangling eventually cost Microsoft more than $1 billion in fines, and reams of negative publicity.Microsoft abandoned the case in October 2007 after losing an important appeal before the European Court of First Instance in Brussels, which upheld the commission’s 2004 judgment.The commission’s browser case — which has drawn support from Microsoft’s rivals like Google, Sun Microsystems, Nokia and others — appeared to be on a similar, acrimonious track.Mr. Briggs said Microsoft had learned a costly lesson in the first antitrust case. “They got their lunch handed to them in the first case and I think they probably realized it may be easier to give up a little than to lose a lot again.”'"
"'09-07-25,'0','So that leads to the question: How can parents help children with a healthy sense of entitlement adjust to the new economic reality?EMOTIONAL REASSURANCE The first thought that pops into many parents’ heads when they worry about their children is bailing them out. But the best thing many parents can do, particularly those with children who are not asking for money, is to set the right example.While children may be idle this summer, many parents are out of work, too, and casting about for ways to pay the bills. If they mope around, their children are going to pick that up. If, on the other hand, they discussed what has happened over the last year, their children will be better equipped to make their own financial decisions.“The patriarch can say, ‘This is the risk I took, this is how I felt, these are the lessons here,’ ” said Evan Roth, founding partner of BBR Partners, an adviser to ultra-high-net-worth clients. “It’s, ‘Look at how I’m handling this; I’m teaching you a valuable a lesson here.’ ”That lesson is often the need to work hard. Ms. Herz Brown tells the story of a financial services client who traveled a lot on business. When his role at work was reduced, he started spending less time on jets and more time at home with his teenagers.“He had a sense that too much came to them,” she said. “It came from a basic belief that what he had created for his kids was this sense that everything comes to you.”So he made them look for summer jobs. And when they couldn’t find any, he made them take odd jobs to earn money. He also gave them a budget for school clothes and other incidentals and made it clear that if they budgeted poorly, they were not getting more money.The point was that he recognized he was enabling his children’s sense of entitlement, she said. While his children will probably never want for money, he realized his actions had been just as indulgent as a parent who gives in to his child’s every request for fast food.FINANCIAL PLANNING There are, of course, many reasons to give money to your children. A popular one during the bull market was estate planning — the more you could pass on while you were alive, the less subject to estate tax later.One of the most popular structures during the bull market was a grantor retained annuity trust. This arcane-sounding trust was predicated on assets going up. The idea was that parents could put an asset they thought would appreciate into the trust for a set period of time, usually two to 10 years. At the end of that period, their child would get the appreciated value tax-free, less a small interest payment paid to their parents.Now that most asset values have gone down, these trusts look as if they have failed. But there is a chance to salvage them. The grantor can swap out the original asset for one of equal value without penalty and start another trust with the original asset, if he believes it unfairly lost value.Rich Kohan, partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers Private Company Services practice, said people who set up the trusts should take advantage of the opportunity. “If the asset has dropped in value, it’s likely not to leave anything for the benefit of children,” he said.Then there are trusts set up for reasons other than tax savings. Joan Crain, senior director of wealth management strategies at Bank of New York Mellon, said she had seen an increase in clients setting up trusts for their adult children.“Their children are in their late 30s to 50s, and they’re not good stewards with money,” she said. “Parents want to protect them from creditors but also ex-spouses, even if the children are happily married or not married.”Money in trust is doled out to the beneficiaries and kept from creditors, but it is not shielded from estate taxes. That people are employing this strategy, though, should be a stark lesson to parents: teach money management skills to your children when they are young.PRACTICAL SUPPORT In tough times, parents may need to set aside their estate plan and bail out their child.One way parents or grandparents can help without seeming intrusive is to cover all medical and education costs for their children and grandchildren. If they pay the hospital or school directly, they will not incur gift tax.Separately, if a husband and wife pool their annual gift exclusions, they can give up to $52,000 a year to a child and his spouse to help make up for a lost job.“Parents worry it’s humiliating,” Mr. Roth said. “But paying their mortgage is not a direct handout. It’s the same thing, but if you don’t see it, it doesn’t affect them as much.”On the positive side, this may be the right time to finance a child’s entrepreneurial idea.“The consensus is the fortunes of tomorrow are going to be made today in this downturn,” said Mary Duke, head of private wealth solutions for the Americas at HSBC Private Bank.The key is not to give your child a handout. Ms. Duke suggests setting up a board of advisers to look over the plan and provide assistance with framing and carrying out the idea. This takes the child’s request out of the realm of asking Mom and Dad for money and into the arena of an actual business plan.“It’s important kids understand budgeting,” she said. “Everyone is more focused on living within their reduced means.”If a parent can instill that discipline in a child, the rest may just fall into place.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','An expert panel reported on Friday that two more diseases may be linked to exposure to Agent Orange, a defoliant used by the American military during the Vietnam War.People exposed to the chemical appear, at least tentatively, to be more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease and ischemic heart disease, according to the report. The report was written by a 14-member committee charged by the Institute of Medicine with determining whether certain medical conditions were caused by exposure to herbicides used to clear stretches of jungle.The results, though not conclusive, are an important first step for veterans groups working to get the government to help pay for treatment of illnesses they believe have roots on the battlefield. Some other conditions linked to Agent Orange already qualify.Claud Tillman, a 61-year-old veteran from Knoxville, Tenn., who lost his job repairing guns after he received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease, said those benefits could help dig him out of tens of thousands of dollars in debt.Mr. Tillman has not worked since March 2007 and now lives on loans from relatives, including his son. “It sure has messed my life up,” said Mr. Tillman, who said he was sure he became ill after exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam. “I don’t know how to explain it. It won’t be long till I’m living under a bridge. I am confident that that’s where it came from, but there’s no way to prove it.”'"

"'09-07-25,'0','There are caveats to the forecast, of course. Somewhat illogically, the index of leading indicators is subject to revision in coming months, which could make the recent gain seem smaller and not necessarily indicative of an approaching recovery.Only seven of the 1o leading indicators for June have been reported by the government, while the other three were estimated by the Conference Board, an independent research group that compiles the indicators. Some of the seven indicators that have been reported may be revised.As can be seen in the accompanying charts, six of the seven recessions since 1960 either ended in the month the indicator first showed a 12 percent annualized gain, or had ended a month or two before the index did so.The exception was the 1990-’91 recession, which was followed by one of the slowest recoveries ever. The official end of the recession was in March 1991, but the recovery was so tepid that it was not until December 1992 that the economic research bureau made that call. As it happened, December was the same month the indicator first showed such a strong three-month rise.An end to recession is not, of course, the same thing as the beginning of a boom. The indicator “has an unblemished record on calling the turning point,” said another economist, Robert J. Barbera of ITG, “but it is not a particularly good guide to the power of the upturn.”Indeed, one of the strongest moves in the leading indicators came at the end of the brief 1980 recession, as credit controls were removed. But the economy soon fell into another, longer recession.Mr. Bandholz thinks we may get a “W” recovery, in which early gains are followed by weaker figures. “We do not expect this recovery to be strong and self-sustaining,” he said. “What is lacking is support from consumer spending.”During the most recent three months, the strongest indicators have been the financial ones. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has risen while the gap has widened between long-term and short-term interest rates. The indicators index was also helped by an increase in consumer expectations and a slowing in deliveries by suppliers. (Slower deliveries are assumed to be caused by rising orders, although such a change could indicate the suppliers simply laid off too many workers.)Two of the 10 indicators — the money supply and new orders for consumer goods — have shown declines.Another measure compiled by the Conference Board, the index of coincident indicators, has fallen for eight consecutive months, and dropped in 17 of the last 19 months. That indicator is often used by the economic research bureau in dating decisions, and its failure to stabilize is a reason that Mr. Bandholz says he thinks the downturn is not yet over.The index of coincident indicators has fallen 6.4 percent from the peak it reached in November 2007, making this the deepest recession since 1960. Before this cycle, its steepest decline was a 5.6 percent slide during the 1973-’75 downturn.'"

"'09-07-25,'0','A coalition called Gorran, which means “change” in Kurdish, is working to unseat the two governing parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, in a boisterous, if improbable, election campaign that has led to scuffles in the streets. A recent rally, where car horns honked and Gorran supporters waved dark blue flags depicting their movement’s emblem, was broken up by the police after it descended into fistfights with supporters of the governing parties.The coalition is led by Nawshirwan Mustafa, 65, a former mountain rebel against Saddam Hussein who was among the founders of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Now, he says, his former comrades have been corrupted by power and have betrayed the Kurdish cause. “There is a form of totalitarianism in our system,” he said in a recent interview. “We believe the time is ripe to put our house in order.”His work is attracting both a following and a fierce backlash from the governing parties, which call him an opportunist and a charlatan. Still, there is doubt whether Gorran or any other challenger will pick up enough seats in the local Parliament to effect change.This is a testament to the control that the governing parties — known as the P.U.K. and K.D.P. — exert over the Kurdish areas.Though deadly enemies for years, the parties are participating in the elections as one coalition, a reflection of the “strategic agreement” that has enabled them to divide the region’s government and economic resources 50-50. They command the region’s armed forces and intelligence services. They own business conglomerates.Most important, they control jobs, salaries and patronage. Thus, the consensus among Kurds is that the only way to get ahead is to support the parties.The parties’ leaders encourage the thought, saying that only they can safeguard the gains made by Kurds, a distinct ethnic group accounting for almost 20 percent of Iraq’s population. And indeed the achievement is substantial.After the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the party leaders — Massoud Barzani of the K.D.P. and Jalal Talabani of the P.U.K. — buried their historic feuds and focused instead on turning the region, which has been semiautonomous since 1991, into a haven from the tumult and violence in the rest of Iraq.Foreign investors now clamor for a foothold in the oil-rich region. Sweden recently became the 16th country to establish diplomatic ties. Signs of wealth — including hotels and condominium projects with names like German Village — are everywhere in Sulaimaniya and the regional capital, Erbil, farther north.The parties’ leaders also point to freedom of expression and the coming elections as milestones toward democracy.But critics say none of the four opposition candidates stands any chance of unseating the region’s president, Mr. Barzani, of the K.D.P. And little chance is given to the 23 other parties and coalitions vying for 111 seats in the local Parliament, overwhelmingly controlled by the K.D.P. and P.U.K. and widely seen as a rubber stamp for Mr. Barzani and Mr. Talabani. Mr. Barzani’s son heads the region’s security forces and intelligence service, while Mr. Barzani’s nephew is the region’s prime minister. After the elections, that post is expected to go to Mr. Talabani’s protégé, Barham Salih, now a deputy prime minister for all of Iraq, in accordance with the agreement between the parties.Still, the candidacy of Mr. Mustafa, a former insider, has shaken the ruling class somewhat, with Mr. Salih speaking bluntly in campaign speeches about the need for reforms. The parties have also lashed back at Mr. Mustafa. One K.D.P. official recently described him as “chata,” meaning bandit in Kurdish.A P.U.K. official, Hikmat Mohammed Karim, said, “He is a demagogue who is fooling the masses.” Mr. Karim also issued a strategic threat: that party members who backed Mr. Mustafa would be deprived of their pay.“This is my money and party,” Mr. Karim said.Cheman Mohammed, a P.U.K. official who switched to Mr. Mustafa’s side, said her salary was frozen, while P.U.K. supporters were given land, cash and pistols.Another contender for president in the elections, Ali Bapir, expects to eventually lose what he says is a hefty allowance from the governing parties for the Islamic movement he heads.Mr. Bapir, 48, was detained for almost two years by the United States military, suspected of ties to Al Qaeda. His partisans were imprisoned and tortured by the Kurdish authorities. Some were freed as part of his détente with the K.D.P. and the P.U.K.He has now formed an unlikely alliance with Communists to run in the elections. Mr. Bapir accuses the two parties of stoking popular anger by suggesting that their election rivals are agents of the central government and neighboring countries out to reverse Kurdistan’s achievements.The warning of external threats resonates with voters in Kurdistan, who feel besieged from all sides. They worry that Iran and Turkey, which have their own restive Kurdish populations, will crush further steps for Kurdish autonomy or secession. And tensions remain high with the central government over disputed border lands and the sharing of oil and gas revenues.In the end, the electoral message seems to be: the stakes are too high to risk change.“We are still victims of geopolitics,” said Fadhil Merani, one senior K.D.P. leader.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','The dissent is playing into the hands of industry lobbyists, who are trying to defeat major provisions of the ambitious White House plan — and are skilled in playing regulators and lawmakers against each other.In the early skirmishes, the lobbyists have notched a few small victories. Earlier this week, senior Democrats in the House conceded that they would not be able to complete work on the proposal to create a consumer protection agency for financial products like credit cards and mortgages before the lawmakers depart for their summer recess at the end of next week.House Democrats had hoped to complete legislation creating the agency this month. But because of the opposition, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, said on Friday that the committee would delay its work on the proposal until September.Mr. Frank said that next week the committee, and then the full House, would approve legislation imposing new rules on how companies award executive compensation.In the Senate, meanwhile, both the chairman and ranking Republican on the banking committee have been skeptical of the administration’s proposal to expand the reach of the Federal Reserve, even though Mr. Bernanke has said that the proposal is only a modest extension of what the central bank is already doing.Barely had Mr. Geithner left the witness chair when a panel of senior regulators challenged many of the details of his plan. First Mr. Bernanke questioned the proposal to transfer the Fed’s existing job of regulating mortgages and credit cards to a new consumer product agency. Mr. Bernanke said the writing and enforcement of consumer protection rules “are complementary” to the other bank supervisory functions performed by the Fed and those important benefits “would be lost through this change.”Then Ms. Bair, the outspoken chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, criticized the proposal to give the new consumer protection agency the authority to enforce new regulations. She also said it would be better to give a council of regulators, which would include her agency, the authority to oversee risk across the industry, rather than vest broad new authority in the Federal Reserve.“The Oversight Council described in the administration’s proposal currently lacks sufficient authority to effectively address systemic risks,” Ms. Bair said. Flatly contesting Mr. Geithner’s recommendation on the new consumer agency, she added, “Federal banking agencies should retain the authority to examine and supervise insured institutions for both consumer protection compliance and safety and soundness.”Mr. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency, which regulates nationally chartered banks, said he also disagreed with the proposal to give the new consumer protection agency the authority to enforce any new regulation. Instead, that should remain with the existing bank regulators, he said.Mr. Geithner urged the lawmakers not to delay or bow to industry pressure, but to move swiftly.He said that disagreements between the regulators were virtually unavoidable because the plan contemplates shifting a significant amount of power among them.“It’s perfectly reasonable and understandable,” he said, that institutions and officials with authority would not want to give it up. Referring to Mr. Bernanke, he added, “With respect to the chairman and the others, they are doing what they should — protecting their prerogatives.”In trying to make the case for the new consumer agency, Mr. Geithner noted that mortgage brokers and large mortgage companies, which played a central role in the financial crisis, were now virtually unregulated by the federal government. And though financial oversight exists in other areas involving consumer protection, companies have been able to select their regulators, a practice that led to “the least restrictive oversight of consumer protection.”And he noted that the banking agencies responsible for enforcing consumer protection had typically had other priorities.Large and small banks and their trade associations in Washington have waged a major lobbying effort to kill the proposal, or at least substantially water it down, so that the new agency would not be able to write new regulations and also enforce them. The banks have maintained that the creation of a new agency would lead to burdensome and duplicative regulation of the banks.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','Women who undergo hysterectomies often have both ovaries removed along with the uterus in order to prevent ovarian cancer. But a new study suggests ovary removal may increase the risk of another seemingly unrelated ailment, lung cancer.University of Montreal scientists stumbled onto the connection while investigating the relationship between lung cancer and hormones in women. They found no relationship between hormonal factors like menstruation patterns, child-bearing or breast-feeding histories and the risk of lung cancer. The researchers did, however, discover that women whose menopause had been induced medically were at 1.92 times greater risk of developing lung cancer than women who had experienced natural menopause.“We were surprised — we had no prior expectation of this finding,” said Anita Koushik, a researcher at the University of Montreal’s Department of Social and Preventive Medicine and the first author of the study, published online in May in The International Journal of Cancer. “Aside from the fact that smoking increases your risk of lung cancer, the results of this study suggest that having a non-natural menopause contributes to an almost doubling of the risk.” She noted, though, that the findings could have occurred by chance.The vast majority of women who had experienced a non-natural menopause had had both ovaries surgically removed, she added.While smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, other factors may play a role in enhancing the impact of the carcinogens in tobacco, Dr. Koushik said. In women, these factors could be hormonal. Both normal and cancerous lung tissue express estrogen receptors and may be influenced by levels of the hormone in the body, Dr. Koushik said. The patterns of expression are different in men and in women.Medically induced menopause usually occurs at a younger age than natural menopause. Surgical menopause results in a sudden drop in estrogen levels, compared with the more gradual decline in hormone levels that occurs with natural menopause. Dr. Koushik suggested the increased lung cancer risk may be linked to the impact of plummeting hormone levels.'"
"'09-07-25,'0','BANGKOK — Lawyers for the jailed pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi presented their closing arguments on Friday, and prosecutors were expected to conclude their case on Monday, according to reports from Myanmar.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, is charged with violating the terms of her house arrest, a charge that could send her to prison for five years. The case against her is based on the intrusion of an American who swam across a lake and spent two nights in her villa in early May. She has been held in a prison residence since her arrest on May 14.Defense lawyers concede the facts of the case — that the man, John W. Yettaw, entered and stayed in her home — but they say Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi did not break any laws. They also say the government’s security guards at her compound should be held responsible for the intrusion.The trial in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has drawn sharp criticism from abroad, most recently this week at a meeting of regional foreign ministers in Phuket, Thailand, where Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton demanded the release of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been held under house arrest for 14 of the last 19 years.Mrs. Clinton said her release “would open up opportunities at least for my country to expand our relationship with Burma, including investments in Burma.”'"

"'09-07-26,'0','Nicholas D. Kristof’s column about phthalates (“Chemicals and Our Health, July 16) highlights major shortcomings in our chemical regulation system. It’s clear that we need stronger laws to protect the public from chemical hazards, and speaking as a biologist, I think it’s clear that we need stronger regulatory science as well.Decisions about chemical risks are often based on the effects of a high dose of a single chemical on an animal. This approach leaves huge questions about the relevance of these effects to human health, and in the case of phthalates, their relevance to the health of children.Given the inadequacies of the current system, we must move toward methods that address real-life concerns for humans, like chemical mixtures, different concentrations and effects on people of different ages. Some regulatory agencies are beginning to invest in these approaches, but as the column points out, the Obama administration and Congress also need to invest in transforming chemical regulation itself.'"
"'09-07-26,'0','Now, as in 2028, reasonable people may disagree about how much remedy is enough, and how much too much, but despite the election of Barack Obama, no reasonable person can look at our society’s disparities in income, employment, education and incarceration rates and argue that the job is done.Ross Douthat argues that affirmative action programs need to be phased out over time because of the potential for corruption and because affirmative action “condescends to its beneficiaries, and corrodes the racial attitudes of its victims.”I, too, hope that affirmative action will, at some point in the future, not be needed. However, it is not affirmative action that corrupts and condescends and corrodes, but rather a society in which unequal educational and economic opportunities are provided to some of its citizens because of the color of their skin.Affirmative action is a necessary corrective for our imperfect society.Ross Douthat seems to take it as a given that race-based preferences will become unjustifiable as minorities begin to outnumber whites. But often the most galling kind of racial disparity occurs when an area of society remains dominated by whites despite the changing racial makeup of the community. This can be intentional or incidental, or a mixture of both.Mr. Douthat may think that the backroom machinations of a black preacher better account for New Haven’s decision to scrap the results of its firefighters exam, but it is just as plausible that the city wanted to eliminate exactly this sort of racial gap between the fire department and the community whose confidence it needs.I agree with Ross Douthat that ideally affirmative action would not be a part of the political and social landscape forever. But it is a bit disingenuous to suggest that just because there will be a higher percentage of nonwhites in the population, discrimination will automatically cease and desist.Regarding college admissions, besides social barriers, we still have an archaic way of financing education, so that there are huge regional and local disparities between rich, middle class and poor. It’s a no-brainer that wealthier communities are generally going to have a better school system than poorer communities. I wouldn’t be surprised to find public schools becoming more de facto segregated, especially in big cities, than they were 30 years ago.How about federally financed education based on student enrollment and a cost-of-living pay differential for teachers as a first step toward a truly level playing field? Perhaps, after a generation or two, affirmative action would not be needed.'"
"'09-07-26,'0','In any other universe, costs reduce earnings. But in Alliance’s happy world, expenses actually improve the bottom line.Alliance adds other costs back into its income calculation as well. It takes a portion of the premiums that it pays when it acquires credit card portfolios and account lists, for example, and adds that to its earnings. Such premiums are normally viewed as a cost of doing business, but Alliance considers them to be an intangible asset, which it amortizes over time. Adding this amortization amount to its “cash” earnings each year generates a fatter figure.These adjustments make for a big difference between earnings based on generally accepted accounting principles — you know, the kind where you actually subtract expenses from revenue before arriving at earnings — and the figure the company has chosen to highlight. Alliance’s “cash earnings” for the second quarter, which it reported last week, came in at 95 cents a share. Real earnings in the period were 51 cents a share.In the first quarter of 2009, the spread between the two figures was even wider: Alliance reported “cash” earnings of $1.19 a share, compared with GAAP earnings of 45 cents.To be sure, Alliance is not the first company to devise financial metrics that put its results in the best possible light. It has urged investors to judge it on “cash earnings” since it issued stock to the public in 2001.But at least one analyst objects to the fact that the company’s performance pay is based on a number that management can easily massage. And basing executives’ pay on a measure that does not take into account the costs of acquisitions means that Alliance’s management is encouraged to make acquisitions with little regard for price.You get it: Neither practice is what you would call “shareholder friendly.”A spokeswoman for Alliance said the company doesn’t discuss matters relating to compensation beyond what it reports in its financial filings. But Robert Minicucci, chairman of Alliance’s compensation committee and a general partner with Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a large private equity firm, said that Alliance’s board is “very interested in pay-for-performance.”“How many companies do you know that have gone from $12 to $48 in the last six years?” Mr. Minicucci asked. “It is hard to say that shareholders are buffoons here and directors are asleep at the switch.”Nevertheless, the cost of the stock awards that the company adds back to its earnings calculation can be significant. In each of the last two years, Alliance reported stock award expenses of about $48 million; in 2006, this expense was $36 million.As Alliance’s stock expenses have risen by 36 percent, the company’s operating income has risen by 23 percent and net income has increased by just 15 percent. Its shares have appreciated by a third in the period.In the first three months of 2009, Alliance awarded an additional 710,303 performance-based stock units; vesting restrictions on a third of these shares will disappear next February if the company’s “cash earnings” grow by an unspecified amount during 2009, its quarterly filing said. If that growth figure is met, the stock grants will vest completely by February 2012. Typically, restricted stock grants vest over longer periods.Stock awards are a big piece of the pay pie for Alliance executives. Edward J. Heffernan, its chief executive, received $4.7 million in total compensation in 2008. (He was chief financial officer at the time.) Stock awards had a value of $3.34 million in the period.J. Michael Parks, Alliance’s former chief executive, received $6.7 million in total compensation; $3.4 million of that came from stock awards.Note the circular nature of this compensation structure. If Alliance’s “cash earnings” achieve a specified growth rate in a given year, some of the company’s stock grants vest sooner. Because the costs of these stock grants contribute to “cash earnings,” the growth target becomes easier to reach the more options are awarded.And that makes some analysts uneasy.“By artificially inflating ‘cash earnings per share,’ management is able to serve its desire to accelerate vesting and hit ‘cash earnings per share’ targets for the Street,” said William Ryan, an analyst and managing director at Portales Partners, an independent research firm in New York.Of course, all of this might be viewed as a matter between Alliance and its shareholders. Except for one thing: Because the securitization market has shut down, Alliance has had difficulty selling securities backed by its private-label credit card receivables. So, the company recently turned to a government program for help raising money: the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.Last April, Alliance issued $709 million of securities under the program — a program that we, the taxpayers, back. So Alliance’s accounting practices are kind of our concern, too.“The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Obama administration are all coming down on pay packages that don’t correlate with metrics that are conventionally accepted by investors,” Mr. Ryan said. “So Alliance comes up with a metric that you can adjust yourself, effectively a self-graded exam.”Another example of how good it is to be king in some corners of corporate America.'"
"'09-07-26,'0','When Frank McCourt died last weekend at age 78, we were momentarily transported, it seemed, to a more innocent age of the American memoir.For once, public discussion of a best-selling memoirist didn’t involve the words “fabrication,” “apologize” or “James Frey.” Instead, publishing insiders and ordinary readers alike recalled being captivated by the poetic intensity and rueful humanity of Mr. McCourt’s “Angela’s Ashes,” while former students fondly recalled the brilliant New York City public school teacher who waited until his mid-60s to finally grow up into a world-famous, Pulitzer Prize-winning author by writing down the amazing stories of his hardscrabble Irish childhood he’d been spinning out loud for years.The memoir genre has taken plenty of hits from moralists, fact checkers and freelance scolds in the 13 years since “Angela’s Ashes” sold four million copies in hardcover and spent more than two years on the best-seller lists. But it endures as perhaps the dominant genre of contemporary literature  and an easier route to fame and fortune than the novel (as Mr. Frey, who has said he originally submitted the discredited “A Million Little Pieces” to his publisher as fiction, has surely come to appreciate).Today, bookstores are clogged with memoirs, not just about abuse and addiction, but about parenting, cooking and dog rearing. There are B-list (and C-list) celebrity memoirs. There are memoirs about dedicating a year to reading the Oxford English Dictionary, living without toilet paper or having as much sex as possible via the personal ads in The New York Review of Books (a subgenre sometimes mocked as “shtick lit”). The first-person confessional approach is an easy way for writers to add drama and voice to the most improbable subjects, while increasing their odds of getting booked on talk shows that shun the average novelist.But the heartland of memoir is still childhood, a place of magically vivid but fragmentary (and often uncheckable) memories that fairly cry out for imaginative reconstruction. While Mr. McCourt had the greater success, it was really Tobias Wolff who in 1989 set the template for the contemporary literary memoir with “This Boy’s Life,” according to Ben Yagoda, a professor at the University of Delaware and the author of a coming history of the memoir.“In the 19th and early-20th century, books of memoir were usually books about someone else  a memoir of Charles Dickens by his best friend, for example,” Mr. Yagoda said. “Wolff started the trend of using it for a book about yourself. He wrote in this novelistic way, and he wrote about an unhappy childhood.”Mr. Wolff also seems to have been the first (if you don’t count Gypsy Rose Lee’s 1957 autobiography) to use the now ubiquitous subtitle “A Memoir,” according to Mr. Yagoda.“All of those things ended up being hugely influential,” he said.When “This Boy’s Life” was published, some critics wondered at a modestly known fiction writer seizing a genre normally reserved for grand old men. “Isn’t it premature (if not presumptuous) for a young writer with three slim volumes under his belt to lapse into his anecdotage?” Joel Conarroe wrote in The New York Times Book Review. But while “This Boy’s Life” sold modestly, there followed a string of literary memoirs of harrowing experience, including Elizabeth Wurtzel’s “Prozac Nation” (about depression), Susanna Kaysen’s “Girl, Interrupted” (mental illness), Lucy Grealy’s “Autobiography of a Face” (disfigurement) and Mary Karr’s “Liar’s Club” (alcoholism and general family craziness), to name a few.The memoir boom represented the triumph of the first-person narrator, and of one who could claim (if not always plausibly) a less slippery relationship with the truth than the unreliable narrators of modernist fiction.Ms. Karr says that the memoir filled a need that fiction was failing to meet. “Angela’s Ashes” in particular, captured the “wiggly-ness and disempowerment of childhood,” she said. “We all felt like we lived inside the body of that boy.”That sense of identification, even among middle-class book buyers who had never burned pieces of their bedroom wall for heat, dismayed some critics, especially back in Ireland. In his hometown, Limerick, Mr. McCourt was denounced for peddling what some locals saw as an overly operatic view of the city’s squalor. In his book “The Irish Story: Telling Tales and Making It Up in Ireland,” the Oxford critic Roy Foster accused Mr. McCourt of perpetuating “idealized Irish personal history” that pandered to “the enduring pride and reassurance which Americans find in hot water and flush lavatories.”While Mr. Foster and others have raised their eyebrows at Mr. McCourt’s total recall of dialogue overheard from the crib, no serious doubts were ever raised about his essential truthfulness. (Mr. McCourt never put his dialogue in quotation marks  “a small but honorable thing,” Mr. Yagoda said.)Still, have the recurring scandals over fake memoirs ruined the game for the honest ones?Ms. Karr has described how she sent the manuscript of “The Liar’s Club” to all the major characters, to fact check her memory, but emphasized that no honest writer  or reader  expected a memoir to reflect anything other than the author’s inevitably slanted view on the truth.“There’s a kind of recursive loop” in memoir, she said. “Imagination informs memory, and memory informs imagination. People are concerned that the events are fabricated, when what’s most lethal is the slant you put on it.”Mr. Yagoda insists that the border between novel and memoir can’t be closed, especially now that so many novelists themselves are crossing over.“What seems to be more common now, and it’s generally a good thing, is writers who go back and forth,” he said. “Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, David Foster Wallace  they have all tried different forms. John Updike’s ‘Collected Stories’ was an autobiography of a sort, 99 percent autobiographical. He was a great writer, but why should he have been limited to that fictional form?”While the claim to be a true story gives memoir an extra “juice and jolt,” as Mr. Yagoda put it, even Mr. McCourt came to feel constrained by the genre.In an essay in Slate two years ago, he lamented that as his later memoirs “’Tis” and “Teacher Man” brought him closer to the present, his publisher forced him to change more and more names and details, to avoid offending the living and their lawyers.“The only way around this nervousness is the novel  and that is what I’m trying now,” he wrote.“Yes, yes, I still have to cover my tracks.” But, he added, “I’ll have greater freedom.”'"
"'09-07-26,'0','When construction first began on the Southern State Parkway in 1926, it was envisioned as part of a system of ribbon parks, allowing Sunday drivers from the city a leisurely and scenic route across bucolic sections of Long Island to the beach.Today, the parkway is Long Island’s most heavily traveled thoroughfare and also has a more dubious distinction as one of the area’s most dangerous highways. New York State’s Department of Transportation has found, in fact, that the Parkway has five of Long Island’s 10 most dangerous driving spots. The road is so prone to accidents that locals call one particularly treacherous stretch Blood Alley.The Southern State’s problems are less a matter of maintenance than engineering: Its shoulder, grade, width and exit and entrance ramps were all designed for an era when there were fewer and smaller vehicles designed to travel at slower speeds. But replacing the road would entail acquiring and razing residential neighborhoods in order to widen the road, a prospect that the state officials consider “socially, financially and practically unfeasible, ” according to Eileen Peters, a department spokeswoman.Instead, Albany has allocated money to try and keep the pavement, median, lighting and guardrails in good shape and warns motorists to treat the road with caution. “If people use their signals, don’t exceed 55 m.p.h. and abide by traffic rules, it’s a safe roadway,” Ms. Peters said. “When they don’t, that’s when there are problems.”'"
"'09-07-26,'0','Modernism came late to comics. Cartoonists are naturally stylistic chameleons, selecting and altering visual techniques to serve their subjects. But explicitly presenting style as content? That’s always trickier. It took creative giants to make it work in literature, music and fine art, and many comics artists of the last few decades who’ve made formal and stylistic exploration the chief focus of their work have had to neglect the pleasures — and audiences — of storytelling.Enter “Asterios Polyp”: a big, proud, ambitious chunk of a graphic novel, with modernism on its mind and a perfectly geometrical chip on its shoulder. The tension between formalist rigor and emotional subtlety is not just the theme (and method) of the cartoonist David ­Mazzucchelli’s decade-in-the-making opus; it’s basically the plot. The book is a satirical comedy of remarriage, a treatise on aesthetics and design and ontology, a late-life Künstlerroman, a Novel of Ideas with two capital letters, and just about the most schematic work of fiction this side of that other big book that constantly alludes to the ­“Odyssey.”Asterios Polyp himself is adorably dislikable, an egocentric, condescending, irritable “paper architect” and academic who sees everything in terms of dualities. (“Anything that is not functional is merely decorative,” he declares.) When Polyp’s father came to America, we’re told, “an exasperated Ellis Island official had cut the family name in half.” That name would have to have been Polyphemus, as in the Cyclops. Asterios himself is a metaphorical cyclops, lacking the ability to perceive emotional depth. Even his head is drawn as a two-dimensional construct: half a perfect circle, interrupted by two equally proportioned curves.As the book begins, his life has gone straight to Hades. His wife, Hana, has left him; his home has been struck by lightning and burned down; and he’s bought a one-way ticket to the middle of nowhere to try to figure out how to live in a world in which form doesn’t always follow function. In the little town of Apogee, he befriends the malapropistic auto mechanic Stiff Major and his holistic hippie wife, Ursula, as well as a revolution-happy country-punk band called the Radniks (say it out loud), and puts his knowledge to work in the real world for the first time. It shouldn’t come as a surprise that his personality ends up a bit more 3-D.That’s only the present-day section of the story, though. A lot of “Asterios Polyp” consists of digressive flashbacks to its protagonist’s relationship with soft-­hearted Hana, a go-with-the-flow sculptor who makes organic forms out of found materials. (Various other artists, with their media and aesthetic philosophies, turn up too, although some get more respect than others: Mazzucchelli particularly has it in for Willy Ilium, a snooty, priapic little choreographer whose work consists of postmodern appropriation and recontextualization.) Characters constantly digress into discussions of religion, political history, watch mechanisms and practically the entire trivium and quadrivium. On top of that, there are a handful of fantasy sequences involving the book’s narrator, Ignazio, Asterios’s twin brother, who died in the womb but keeps appearing anyway.And atop everything else, there’s Mazzucchelli’s scrupulously controlled, composed and gestural artwork. Every chapter opens with a small, wordless tableau that introduces its themes and usually serves as the beginning of its narrative. In one early chapter, that introductory image is a grid of 16 line drawings of an apple. The first interesting thing about those apples is that they’re rendered in 16 distinct visual styles (out of the countless ones at Mazzucchelli’s command). The second is that the two colors on the page are solid purple — which he uses rather than black throughout the book — and cyan, neither of which are the color of actual apples. The point is clear: even while he’s telling a story through representation, every line Mazzucchelli draws carries symbolic freight, and its iconic value may even outweigh its literal meaning.'"
"'09-07-26,'0','We’ve gotten to know enemy tactics fairly well. Armed with carefully constructed curriculum vitae and repeatedly rehearsed “right answers,” pre-med students at my university drill themselves in anticipation of the grueling process of applying to medical school.For the past four years, students have been arduously training for the anticipated battle. Like drones, we have flocked to soup kitchens, joined clubs, risen in the ranks of organizations, shadowed doctors and lurked in laboratories to satisfy all the unwritten requirements to becoming a med-school matriculant. We look for ways to quantify the level of our interests and the magnitude of our values so as to make it easier for our future evaluators to identify our worth.But our opponents in this effort are not the admissions committees, the core science classes or the pitiless professors who mark up our exams.No. We are our own opponents. Paranoia is endemic at all pre-medical functions, society meetings and information sessions. Each organization participant is a rival; each society member is a competitor; each fellow student is an adversary. Even the most noble of students can’t help acknowledging the brutal mathematical postulate that characterizes admissions: if my friend is offered a spot in medical school, there is one less spot available for me.I wish I could claim immunity from this jaded state-of-being, but I can’t. I want nothing more than to believe that I have a sincere passion for the organizations I am a part of. But I have to admit that each elected position, university honor and research experience is a step on the ladder to graduate medical study; in some subconscious way, this realization drives my decisions. Though it’s hard to admit, my values are likely tainted.As a high-anxiety pre-med, I go to great lengths in search of advice. My quest for guidance led me to the office of a friend’s family friend. I expected to see research awards and honors as the sinew connecting his diplomas ( Columbia and the University of California, San Francisco). I expected to see a man in a buttoned-up shirt sifting through files at his desk while I pestered him with questions. I expected to cower in fear.I was way off.When I walked in, Prof. Alexander Blackwood, a member of the medical school admissions committee at Michigan, sat cross-legged in his chair, barefoot. His office was adorned with photos of a peewee football team he coaches, pictures of various children’s toys and pictures of his friends and family.I had come to speak with him about the year I intended to take in between college and medical school. Without so much as saying so, I wanted him to tell me which of my options would make me more likely to be accepted to a medical school of my choice. I cloaked my intentions with the ramblings of a confused college senior, hoping that his advice would somehow contain a hint as to which of my possible paths would be more appreciated by an admissions committee.He saw right through me. If I expected him to tell me which option would give me the best chance of getting into medical school, I had come to the wrong place. He did not have that kind of an answer, he told me. What he did explain were the types of nonacademic qualities he values in prospective candidates. First and foremost, sincerity. I should spend my next year doing something I was passionate about and excel at it.I swelled with guilt and cringed with embarrassment. He knew I had come hoping for some sort of magic bullet to medical school admissions  one that apparently does not exist. How could I have been so transparent? While I wanted to leave the office, my curiosity compelled me to stay and listen.Professor Blackwood explained further: When he sees swarms of applicants that have covered all the bases but haven’t demonstrated particular interest in anything, he gets nervous. Why train doctors who can’t invest themselves in anything? He said he would rather have a student who is a glee club national award winner than one who has perfect grades, worked in labs and shadowed fleets of doctors. Only if applicants can truly care about something can they care about their patients.I needed to think about how I would become a good doctor (not a good applicant).We continued talking. He told me about his life and practice. He had been a college football player with a thirst for science. As an African-American, he had encountered many hurdles on his path to medicine and still more when he donned the stethoscope. What he loved almost as much as medicine, though, was being a mentor, being able to generate a passion for the study of medicine. I sifted through my vocabulary in an attempt to find the right words to tell him, without sounding cheesy, that he was generating that type of passion in me at that moment (apparently, sometimes being cheesy is unavoidable).I left his office inspired. Endorphins lingered in my system the rest of the day. Before bed, I went to check my e-mail. To my surprise, Professor Blackwood’s name was at the top of my in box.Preempting the “thank you” letter that I intended to send him, he told me that no thanks were necessary and that, instead, he wanted a promise from me. Professor Blackwood wrote: “None of us have made it without the help and advice of those ahead of us. I truly believe in pay it forward. Don’t feel bad about asking me for time. Just remember in the future I expect you to be there for the next generation.”With his words prominently emblazoned in my mind, I pulled back the sheets and climbed in. I had become a better person that day. I would become a better doctor tomorrow.'"
"'09-07-26,'0','Last year, I nonchalantly signed up to take second-semester organic chemistry, a k a Orgo. My friends thought I was a maso-​chist. The class is reputed to be the hardest at Brown, and rumor has it that its sole purpose is to weed out pre-meds. Nobody else takes it except chemistry majors. I had come to the conclusion that I was not going to apply to medical school, and it was unnecessary for me to take the course for any other reason. Still, I figured I could always change my mind about the med school thing. And how bad could it be?According to statistics posted by the Orgo professors, averages on the midterm exams ranged from 47 to 65 points out of 100; by semester’s end, half of the class got C’s or failed (there are no D’s at Brown). This does not take into account the large percentage who ended up dropping the class. I know many students who failed the first time and had to take it a second or even a third time. Others retook it over the summer at pushover schools like Stanford and waltzed out with an A+.Orgo students in pre-med carry the textbook with them wherever they go, and they always seem on the verge of panic. The chemistry majors always have smiles on their faces, either because they relish the pre-meds’ pain or because they truly get a kick out of doing organic chemistry.One of my friends is a chemistry major, and sometimes he would help me study. When I would ask him how to do a problem, he would just tell me the correct answer. He could never explain how he had found the solution, only that my answer was wrong and his was correct. This led me to conclude that chemistry students are born with an innate and nontransferable ability to understand Orgo.I sometimes found it interesting to study my own reactions as I sat in class or tried to do homework problems. I found that Orgo activated my sympathetic autonomic nervous system, more commonly referred to as the “fight-or-flight response.” The response is frequently activated when a creature is placed in a situation in which it needs to attack or run away. Unfortunately, it was difficult to “attack” Orgo, and running away did not seem like a useful alternative, either.Here is an example of my thought process as I attempted a homework problem: O.K. N,N-dimethylbutanamide is hydrolyzed faster in aqueous sodium hydroxide solution than is butanamide itself. Why? Why would it hydrolize faster? I don’t even know what all those words mean; I shouldn’t even be taking this class; for some reason this is so much more difficult than the rest of my classes; maybe it’s just because I’m not that interested; maybe I should drop out and then I would have more time to spend with my friends; maybe I need to take more humanities classes; let’s see, what other work do I have . . . MATT, FOCUS, oh, right, I should just do this now, and then I can do other things, BUT I DON’T CARE. . . .Perhaps an anecdote can best capture the hopelessness that Orgo induces in the human psyche. As the story goes, last year, about five minutes into the exam, a kid stood up. Everyone turned to watch as he shouted, “I can’t take this [EXPLETIVE] anymore!” and ripped up his exam before storming out of the room. Some people thought that it was staged, but I think the sentiment accurately reflected what most people were thinking.There are benefits in taking Orgo. One is that I became more creative as the semester progressed. On one exam, I spent 20 minutes drawing a cartoon of a little man army-crawling over a carboxylic acid to get to an acetylcholine.The final week of the semester I did the calculations and realized I would need to ace the final to pass the class. I checked with the professor just in case, and he confirmed my calculations, suggesting I skip the final and take the class again next year.Despite this advice, I was not ready to walk away with my tail between my legs. Because of Brown’s grading policy, my transcript would not reflect the class if I dropped or failed it. But by skipping the final — and thereby dropping the class — I would be admitting defeat, and Orgo would have won.I had made it this far. If I was going to fail, I was going to fail with dignity. I decided to take the final.I arrived at the large hall, with row upon row of worried faces, and calmly took my seat. I laid out my pencils on the desk, sensing the tension in the room but feeling distinctly separate from it. I thought about the students who felt their entire future relied on the outcome of this test, and I hoped that if I bombed I would at least bring down the average and help someone else pass the course.The test was handed out, and the furious scribbling began. I slowly flipped through the 15-page exam, answering the two questions I knew, guessing on another and staring blankly at the rest. After about 15 minutes, I stood up and walked over to the T.A. at the front of the room. I said, “Thanks, I’m all set,” and handed him my exam.Then 400 eyes turned to follow me as I walked out the door — and into the bright sunshine.'"

It would require fund managers operating in the 27 members of the union to abide by certain restrictions and regulations on their operating activity that go far beyond rules that have been proposed in the United States and elsewhere.For example, the first draft of the resolution would require hedge fund managers to meet certain reporting criteria as well as new governance and risk management standards like minimum capital levels. The marketing of funds would only be allowed with a special marketing passport that the directive creates, the AIMA said.While foreign funds can obtain these marketing passports, the lobbying group argues that the directive also delays their introduction by three years and imposes major obstacles (like demonstrating regulatory and tax equivalence) to obtaining them.On Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the United States government is quietly lobbying Europe to soften the changes in the proposal and move to a more harmonized regulatory system.European nations are trying to avoid a repeat of the financial contagion set off by the mortgage debacle in the United States. While hedge funds and their activities may not have been at the root of the crisis, European officials, especially those in France and Germany, argue that tighter regulation of financial market participants could help in preventing future crises.Go to Press Release from the Alternative Investment Management Association » Go to Article from The Wall Street Journal »'"

"'09-07-27,'1','CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) — The authorities in Mexico have arrested a man suspected in the fatal shooting of an American Border Patrol agent.The main suspect in the killing, Ernesto Parra Valenzuela, 36, was among five men detained late last week in Mexico, the authorities said Sunday. Mr. Parra Valenzuela was reportedly carrying a Border Patrol-issued pistol at the time of his arrest.Records showed that Mr. Parra Valenzuela had not yet retained a lawyer.The authorities would not say what role, if any, the other three men might have played in the death of the agent, Robert W. Rosas, 30, who was killed Thursday near the Mexican border in southeastern San Diego County.Agent Rosas was the first Border Patrol agent to die in a shooting in more than a decade, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page Inc., a nonprofit organization that tracks fallen officers using information provided by law enforcement agencies.Another agent, Luis Aguilar, was intentionally run over by a fleeing man driving a drug-laden Hummer in January 2008.Agent Rosas, a three-year member of the Border Patrol, had a 2-year-old son and an 11-month-old daughter, said Richard Barlow, acting chief patrol agent for the San Diego sector of the Border Patrol.'"
"'09-07-27,'1','In this uncertain moment for the party of Lincoln, behold the jaunty, robust specimen of Republican centrism.Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California strides into a conference room in his Sacramento office with a smile, having wrestled down his state’s mammoth budget deficit in a compromise with a Democratic-controlled Legislature.Public service “brings me joy” just as Hollywood stardom did, he declares, walking a visitor toward the outdoor tent where he shares stogies with fellow politicians in the search for common ground. As sour as the nation feels toward most incumbents, tourists still crane to glimpse the Austrian émigré who first gained fame as a champion bodybuilder.Now, across the country, see the slight, dour spokesman for orthodox Republicanism. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of the shrunken Republican minority, will never be mistaken for a bodybuilder or a movie star.In his Southern-accented monotone, the Alabama native urges colleagues on Capitol Hill to block President Obama’s agenda and lower their sights toward incremental changes in health and energy policy. While Mr. Schwarzenegger exhorts the White House to “never give up,” Mr. McConnell criticizes the president’s push to “raise taxes in the middle of a recession” to cover those without insurance.Six months after President George W. Bush left the stage, neither brand of Republicanism fares especially well with the public. But there is no doubt which holds more midsummer box-office appeal among the party faithful  and it is not the Terminator’s.Combining star power with can-do enthusiasm, Mr. Schwarzenegger seems at first blush a model for Republican resurgence. His blend of fiscal conservatism and social moderation produced two lopsided election victories in the blue-state colossus of California.“It’s important that we are in the center,” Mr. Schwarzenegger said in an interview. “Because that’s where the action is.”Yet that formulation has proved more successful in campaigns than governance. California’s political culture represents an exaggerated version of the nation’s, with starkly polarized parties and rules that inhibit leaders from acting.Mr. Schwarzenegger has appealed directly to Californians  most recently in springtime ballot initiatives designed to attack the deficit by capping spending and raising taxes. Voters shouted “No!”  forcing last week’s deal to cut spending on state services so deeply that even the governor declined to declare victory.The results have estranged him from both sides, producing Bush-like approval ratings of under 40 percent. As he prepares to leave office next year, he sometimes sounds closer to Mr. Obama than his own party.Mr. Schwarzenegger does not rule out an Obama administration post, and urges the president to press ahead with a health care overhaul that tracks his own failed push on the issue in California.“People say, ‘Well, he has taken on too many things,’ ” Mr. Schwarzenegger said of Mr. Obama. “But if he doesn’t take on the too many things, then they say, ‘Well, he hasn’t taken on enough.’ ”Contrasting his approach with that of Sarah Palin, the conservative celebrity who has quit the Alaska governorship, he concluded, “I would never give up.”Inside the Capitol, Mr. McConnell has a different Republican message: stick together in resisting Mr. Obama’s ambition.“We have an example, in my view, of not doing it right, and that was the hurry-up job on the stimulus,” Mr. McConnell said in an interview. “They said we had to get it done almost immediately. If we didn’t do it, unemployment would go over 8 percent. We did do it; unemployment is now going to go over 10 percent.”He continued, “And the assumption that doing health care is going to help the economy, which the president’s been selling, is utter nonsense.”That message gains traction with every new caution from the Congressional Budget Office, every tick up in unemployment, every slip in Mr. Obama’s approval ratings. It emboldens a cadre of Senate Republicans  including Senators Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine  in their protracted negotiations with the Finance Committee chairman, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, on a possible compromise.“I view them as somewhat like agents of the rest of our conference,” Mr. McConnell said. “They don’t want to be part of an agreement that doesn’t have widespread support among Republican senators.”That is a daunting negotiating burden, given the ideological gulf between the two parties. And because Republican resistance makes centrist Democrats waver, too, it means Mr. Obama’s “don’t bet against us” confidence faces a severe test even if Democrats move ahead without bipartisan support.“The Senate is a place where it’s pretty hard to steamroll the minority,” said Mr. McConnell, flexing political muscles that have begun looking unexpectedly formidable.'"

"'09-07-27,'1','But Senator , Democrat of , acknowledged that “there are some questions” about whether insurance would be affordable. “People who are making $50,000 or $60,000 a year and are spending $13,000 on health insurance may not get much of a subsidy,” said Mr. Wyden, a member of the Finance Committee. “Those people will ask, ‘How am I going to make this work for me and my family?’ “When President and tried to overhaul the health care system in 1993-94, they proposed an employer mandate requiring companies to pay about 80 percent of the cost of coverage for their workers. In response, many businesses rallied against the Clinton plan and helped defeat it.Besides requiring employers to help finance coverage, Democrats this year would also require individuals to have insurance and would impose financial penalties on those who do not meet the requirement.Under all the major bills, people could obtain exemptions from the requirement to carry insurance if they could show financial hardship. But such exemptions do not help achieve the purpose of the legislation, which is to get people insured. More than 45 million people do not have health coverage.In a letter to Congress last week, advocates for patients — including , the and the — said the affordability of insurance was “of paramount importance.”After analyzing the leading House and Senate bills, Stephen E. Finan, a health economist at the society, said, “Subsidies do not appear to be adequate even for coverage in the lowest-cost plans.”“Under the bill approved by the Senate health committee,” Mr. Finan said, “a family with annual income of $40,000 could obtain subsidies, but would still have to pay premiums of $1,760 a year and might have to pay as much as $2,320 in co-payments and deductibles, for a total of $4,080, or 10 percent of family income. And they might have to pay more if they use specialists outside the network of doctors in their health plan.”Subsidies are a major factor in the cost of the legislation, and lawmakers are desperately hunting for ways to pay for it. The says the government would spend $773 billion on subsidies from 2013 to 2019 under the House bill. Among people who receive assistance, it said, the average subsidy would be $4,600 in 2014, rising to $6,000 a person in 2019.Under the House bill and a similar measure approved by the Senate health committee, premium subsidies would be available to families with incomes up to four times the poverty level, or $88,200 for a family of four. With income at that level, a family could be required to pay as much as 12.5 percent of its income in premiums under the Senate bill and 11 percent under the House measure.Lower-income families would receive more help. A family of four with income of $34,000 might pay 1 percent to 3 percent of its income in premiums.But lawmakers said that federal aid for low-income families could be pared back as Congress struggles to hold down the overall cost of the legislation.Premiums, which increase with health care costs, are rising much faster than personal income. So federal subsidies must also increase to keep insurance affordable.The Senate Finance Committee is considering proposals to limit eligibility for subsidies, a move favored by some fiscally conservative Democrats in the House Blue Dog Coalition. One proposal would bar subsidies for people with incomes over 300 percent of the poverty level ($66,150 for a family of four.)Richard J. Kirsch, the national campaign manager of Health Care for America Now, a consumer group, expressed concern. “If Congress sets the limit at 300 percent of the poverty level,” Mr. Kirsch said, “millions of middle-income families would not be able to buy insurance because they could not afford the premiums on their own.”The median income for married-couple families was about $73,000 in 2007, the last year for which figures are available.Bruce Lesley, president of First Focus, a bipartisan advocacy group for children, said, “We are very concerned that as the legislation evolves, insurance will become less and less affordable than under the original proposals.”Asked whether insurance would be affordable to everyone, Senator Snowe said: “That’s unknown. That will really be a test of this initiative in the final analysis.”Still, Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal-leaning consumer group, said the proposed subsidies would “make health insurance significantly more affordable than it is today.”In addition, sponsors of the legislation said it would make insurance more affordable by slowing the growth of health costs in the long run.The Senate health committee bill says “coverage is defined to be unaffordable if the premium paid by an individual is greater than 12.5 percent” of the person’s adjusted gross income.In , which requires all adults to have health insurance, about 76,000 people qualified for hardship exemptions in 2007, the first year of an innovative state program to expand coverage. Nearly 430,000 are newly insured, the state says.The major bills moving through Congress would set annual limits on out-of-pocket spending for co-payments, deductibles and similar charges. The limits would be $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family under the House bill, and $5,800 and $11,600 under the Senate health committee bill.Premiums are not counted against the limits. Nor are the extra charges that people often must pay when they go to doctors and outside an insurer’s network. People with insurance are often startled to find that they are responsible for thousands of dollars in such extra charges.'"
"'09-07-27,'1','At the same time, Mr. Daley and other supporters of the Games argue that the Olympics would be a force — perhaps the force — to lift Chicago from this financial gloom, with seven years of new construction, jobs and tourism.Asked about the difficulties of lobbying for an Olympics bid during a recession, Lori Healey, the president of Chicago 2016, the bid committee here, said: “I think it makes it easy. People are hungry for jobs and opportunities.”Earlier events that placed Chicago on an international stage, Ms. Healey said, also came during periods of financial gloom: a World’s Fair in 1893 and again in 1933.To hear Ms. Healey and other bid leaders tell it, there is no downside. If the International Olympics Committee were to choose Chicago over Madrid, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo on Oct. 2, advocates predict the Games would not only break even but would also make money (as have, they say, earlier Olympics in the United States), generate more than $22 billion in indirect economic impact on the city and create $1 billion in new tax revenue. Many of the sites needed for the events would not require construction because they already exist.Organizers say private financial support is mounting, with $60 million raised so far for the bid, and no city dollars are expected to be needed for either the bid or the Games.On that last point, however, residents of Chicago seem skeptical. They have heard promises before.This spring, a $1.15 billion deal to privatize the city’s parking meter system turned into a fiasco after City Hall’s inspector general called it a dubious financial deal and after motorists said they poured money into fancy new meters that, in turn, spat out error messages. A few years ago, Millennium Park, a downtown centerpiece, opened behind schedule and millions of dollars over budget.“You all are projecting we’re going to make a lot of money,” a resident, Robin Kaufman, told Olympics planners at a neighborhood meeting, one in a series intended to shore up support. “But the bankers were projecting they were going to make a lot of money. Bernie Madoff was predicting he was going to make a lot of money.”At a high school auditorium on the West Side, where the bid leaders showed glossy Olympics schematics and stood beside toned former Olympians, Stephanie Patton asked, “Why should we trust you?”Even without a city having been picked for the 2016 event, Chicago agreed this summer to spend $86 million on land for an Olympics village. Bid leaders say private developers will ultimately foot the bill for a project that is to create permanent housing regardless of the Olympics.Bid leaders say the Games themselves are expected to make $450 million in profits. In case of a shortfall, though, a “safety net” package for the Games will include an expected $1 billion in private insurance, according to bid leaders, as well as pledges from the State of Illinois of $250 million and the City of Chicago of $500 million.Then last month, Mr. Daley indicated that he would sign a host contract required by international Olympics officials, including a standard blanket provision offering the city’s backing — one that Chicago leaders had earlier said they hoped to modify.The notion that the city could then be responsible beyond $500 million “set off some alarm bells” for aldermen, one of them, Joe Moore, said. Mr. Moore added that the City Council was seeking more details before it signed off on it. And a group here opposed to the event, No Games Chicago, said the prospect seemed to have suddenly stirred an outpouring of interest from people who had been silent on the Olympics.“The levee broke around that issue,” said a founder of the group, Bob Quellos.What strikes some residents as particularly puzzling is the bid committee’s refrain that, as a private nonprofit entity, it is separate from city government and public money. Technically, that may be, but skeptics note the committee and City Hall share goals and often seem intricately intertwined; Ms. Healey, for instance, stepped down as the mayor’s chief of staff to lead the committee.Crucial to maintaining residents’ support for the Games, polls suggest, is convincing them that their dollars will not be spent. In February, a poll by The Chicago Tribune found that 64 percent of residents of Chicago and its suburbs favored having an Olympics but that 75 percent were against the use of tax money to cover shortfalls.At one of the community forums, a city official likened the efforts of those planning the Olympics Games to Jean Baptiste Pointe DuSable, who is believed to have been the first non-Indian settler of Chicago, and Daniel H. Burnham, whose 1909 Plan of Chicago largely designed the city with the long strip of lakefront parkland that defines it.Then the bid leaders brought out their big guns for these crowds: a videotape of Barack Obama, then a candidate for president, in Chicago, his hometown, smiling and shaking hands with Mr. Daley during a rally last summer for the bid and declaring his wish that an Olympics reveal Chicago as “not just a city that works, but a city that inspires.”Patrick G. Ryan, the founder of the Aon Corporation and the chairman of the bid committee, told one crowd that the thought that private money being raised for the Games might otherwise pay for schools, garbage collection or city workers’ salaries was wrong.“To say we could spend the money either hosting the Games or on something else is really a false choice,” Mr. Ryan said. “This money only comes in if we win.”'"
"'09-07-27,'1','Hundreds of Gurkha veterans and their supporters turned out in Katmandu, Nepal, on Sunday to thank the British actress Joanna Lumley, above, whom they praised as a “goddess,” for her work on a campaign to allow as many as 36,000 Nepalese soldiers who fought for the British Army before 1997 to settle in Britain, The Associated Press reported.In May the British government reversed itself and gave Gurkhas who retired before July 1, 1997, when their base was in Hong Kong, the right to immigrate to Britain. According to The Associated Press, the ban was put in place out of concern that the soldiers had weak links to Britain and that immigrants would put a strain on the government’s finances. Ms. Lumley, best known for her portrayal of the drunken man-eater Patsy on the television comedy “Absolutely Fabulous,” traveled to Nepal to meet with its prime minister and president, as well as some of the Gurkhas she helped. She told journalists on Sunday that her father, who served as a regiment officer with Nepalese soldiers in World War II, inspired her campaign.'"
"'09-07-27,'1','“There were security concerns,” said Kelly Ivahnenko, a spokeswoman for the customs agency. “The sign could be a huge target and attract undue attention. Anything that would place our officers at risk we need to avoid.”The move is a depressing, if not wholly unpredictable, example of how the lingering trauma of 9/11 can make it difficult for government bureaucracies to make rational decisions. It reflects a tendency to focus on worst-case scenarios to the exclusion of common sense, as well as a fundamental misreading of the sign and the message it conveys. And if it is carried out as planned, it will gut a design whose playful pop aesthetic is an inspired expression of what America is about.Just as disheartening, it underscores how the desire for security continues to override the spirit of openness that is fundamental to a functioning democracy.The General Services Administration’s efforts to raise the quality of government architecture date to 1994, when it established its Design Excellence Program to reverse a decades-long trend of government commissions going to firms with the deepest political connections rather than to those with the most talent. One of the program’s greatest accomplishments is that it was able to maintain its high standards of design despite mounting security concerns that began with the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.The visual transparency of projects like Richard Meier’s district courthouse in Central Islip, N.Y., completed in 2000, and Morphosis’ 2007 federal building in San Francisco, were proof that it was possible to pump up security without transforming government buildings into fortified bunkers, even as the country’s anxiety mounted over fears of more terrorist attacks.The Massena station is the latest chapter in that history. As you come over the St. Lawrence River on the bridge from Canada, you see the big sign looming directly in front of you.The metal letters spelling out “United States” are painted the yellow of a yield sign. Their top halves are tucked underneath a translucent polycarbonate screen that encloses the second floor of the building, giving them a blurry quality and imbuing the sign with a sense of mystery. You wonder, is this simply an emblem of American pride, or is there something more nuanced going on here? Some private code the viewer is meant to decipher?The answers are in the architecture.As you approach the station, yellow lines funnel you into one of several lanes — some for cars, some for commercial trucks — before disintegrating into a series of yellow bollards that lead to checkpoints to the right and left of the main building. A few yards from the guard booth, ominous-looking security cameras and warning signs flank you on both sides.Those with a paranoid turn of mind may feel they have entered a gantlet in which they are relinquishing more and more control to government authority with every step. But any such impression is quickly tempered by a sense of ease of movement. There are no curbs anywhere, which emphasizes the smooth, flowing surface of the asphalt. The slender canopies over the checkpoints resemble airplane wings on a runway, as if parts of the complex were preparing to take off.This tension — between the need for control and the architects’ desire to create a feeling of lightness and transparency — is apparent everywhere in the design of the crossing station. A few hundred feet beyond the main building, for example, is the Nonintrusive Inspection Building — a giant X-ray machine for trucks. One side of this structure, made of corrugated metal, has a narrow slot window along its base so that from the crossing area the wall seems to be floating, unsupported from below. The back wall, by contrast, is made of one-foot-thick poured-in-place concrete, both to absorb radiation from the X-ray machine and to protect the site’s perimeter.Even the arrangement of the buildings is more complicated than it at first seems. The big open spaces between them give the site an open, airy quality. But when I asked Laurie Hawkinson, one of the architects, about the layout, she said it was partly designed to create view corridors, so that border officers could monitor anyone approaching them from the surrounding woods.To some, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson’s mix of pop references and tough everyday materials will bring to mind Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, who famously celebrated the architecture of the Las Vegas strip in the early 1970s. It also owes a debt to the work of postwar Los Angeles architects like Charles and Ray Eames, who were striving to create an architecture that reflected the optimism of the postwar era. Their lightweight structures, made of everyday mass-produced materials, were the sunny face of cold war America.But in Massena that optimism has been carefully ratcheted down. The buildings’ translucent plastic surfaces are not only about light; they suggest a cautious, at times shadowy, interior world. The lightness of the forms reminds us of how fragile our ideals can sometimes be.In fact, the sign itself demands multiple readings. Unlike the Freedom Tower, whose name could be interpreted as a jingoistic expression of America’s post-Sept. 11 arrogance, Smith-Miller & Hawkinson’s “United States” sign is politically neutral. Its meaning is constantly changing for the viewer. It communicates openness and possibility, not aggression.It is hard to see how values like those would make any building a target. They may even seem like something worth defending. They certainly put into question the thinking behind Customs and Border Protection’s decision. It is as if the government is attuned to architecture’s symbolic power, but unable to decipher its meanings.'"

"'09-07-28,'0','The Yankees are 10-1 since the All-Star break, taking a two-and-a-half-game lead over the Red Sox in the American League East. They are seven and a half games up on the third-place Rays, the first team they meet on a nine-game trip that also has stops in Chicago and Toronto.Nick Swisher, Robinson Cano and Johnny Damon supported Burnett with homers on Monday, Swisher connecting from both sides of the plate for the ninth time in his career. Damon’s home run was the 200th of his career.Damon was among the Yankees who hoped the team would sign Burnett last winter. Burnett regularly sliced up the Yankees while pitching for the Blue Jays, rattling hitters in advance the way Pedro Martinez did in his prime.“He’s one of those guys that you maybe dream about at night, you know? Not in a good way, in a bad way,” Damon said, laughing at his choice of words. “You’re thinking, is he going to throw me that fastball or that curveball, or brush me off the plate? He’s a guy that I compare to Pedro, because I remember facing Pedro when he was the best in the game, and you don’t sleep well that night.”Hearing Damon’s answer from his adjoining locker, Swisher cackled and offered his own praise for Burnett. “Like Johnny said — I don’t dream about him — but he’s one of those guys that you hate facing, but you love him on your team,” Swisher said. “No doubt about it.”Burnett left with a 7-1 lead, after Alex Rodriguez doubled in two runs in the top of the eighth. The Rays scored twice in their half off Jonathan Albaladejo, but Dave Robertson struck out Carlos Pena with two men on to end the threat.Robertson stayed in for the ninth to earn his first career save, though the game was well out of hand by then and he said he did not even notice the save situation. Manager Joe Girardi had planned to rest Alfredo Aceves, Phil Coke, Phil Hughes and Mariano Rivera, so Robertson’s effort was important.Of course, Burnett’s endurance mattered most. With a high pitch count early, he said Posada called more two-seam fastballs to induce ground balls. It worked. Burnett conserved pitches as he got nine outs on grounders in his last four innings.A stubborn pitcher early in his career, Burnett, at 32, has learned to adjust. A young Burnett who was missing his curveball would have countered, he said, by overthrowing his fastball.“People throw mad balls when things don’t go right,” Burnett said. “You learn a lot. I’m older now, and I know how to put the ball on both sides of the plate with movement.”Run support was never in doubt Monday. Cano, carrying a .208 average with runners in scoring position, smashed a run-scoring triple in a three-run second off James Shields. He sent Shields’s first pitch of the sixth sizzling over the center-field wall, and Swisher followed with a blast deep into the right field bleachers. A rout was on.“If we keep playing like this,” Swisher said, “it’s going to be a really, really fun season.”Reliever Mark Melancon has not pitched since July 10, mainly because the Yankees’ starters have lasted at least into the sixth inning of every game since the All-Star break, according to Joe Girardi. ... Ramiro Pena, a converted infielder, needs more games in center field for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre before he can be promoted for outfield depth, Girardi said. Brett Gardner is on the disabled list because of a broken left thumb and the Yankees will soon need another outfielder. ... Hunter Strickland, who was traded to Pittsburgh from Boston last week for Adam LaRoche, pitched six innings of a no-hitter Monday against the Yankees’ Class A Charleston, S.C., affiliate. Pitching for West Virginia, Strickland and reliever Diego Moreno beat Charleston, 4-0.'"

"'09-07-28,'0','Delphi, the auto parts supplier that has been in bankruptcy for nearly four years, looks set to emerge after a third try at an exit plan.Delphi’s board on Monday evening approved an offer to split the company between General Motors, its onetime parent, and its lenders that would lift it out of bankruptcy. The deal would supersede an earlier agreement between G.M. and Platinum Equity, a private equity firm, that was announced nearly two months ago.The board’s approval of the deal would help hasten an end to the company’s bankruptcy, one of the most contentious in recent memory. The latest deal is the third plan by Delphi to emerge from Chapter 11, after the Platinum deal and one struck early last year with a group of hedge funds that later walked away.Delphi’s debtor-in-possession lenders — whose financing let the company operate while in Chapter 11 — had roundly criticized the deal with Platinum, an agreement they argued was a sweetheart deal that shortchanged them what they are owed. Under that proposal, they would have received about 20 cents on the dollar for their claims.Under the terms of the new deal, which was completed over the last two days, the lenders would forgive about $3.4 billion of what they are owed in exchange for taking over the bulk of the supplier’s assets, a process known as credit bidding, according to people briefed on the matter. The lenders would also pay cash to keep Delphi operating, these people said.'"
"'09-07-28,'0','Instead, they say, the formula for success was to bring together people with complementary skills and combine different methods of problem-solving. This became increasingly apparent as the contest evolved. Mr. Volinsky’s team, BellKor’s Pragmatic Chaos, was the longtime front-runner and the first to surpass the 10 percent hurdle. It is actually a seven-person collection of other teams, and its members are statisticians, machine learning experts and computer engineers from the United States, Austria, Canada and Israel.When BellKor’s announced last month that it had passed the 10 percent threshold, it set off a 30-day race, under contest rules, for other teams to try to best it. That led to another round of team-merging by BellKor’s leading rivals, who assembled a global consortium of about 30 members, appropriately called the Ensemble.Submissions came fast and furious in the last few weeks from BellKor’s and the Ensemble. Just minutes before the contest deadline on Sunday, the Ensemble’s latest entry edged ahead of BellKor’s on the public Web leader board — by one-hundredth of a percentage point.“The contest was almost a race to agglomerate as many teams as possible,” said David Weiss, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Ensemble. “The surprise was that the collaborative approach works so well, that trying all the algorithms, coding them up and putting them together far exceeded our expectations.”The contestants evolved, it seems, along with the contest. When the Netflix competition began, Mr. Weiss was one of three seniors at Princeton University, including David Lin and Lester Mackey, who made up a team called Dinosaur Planet. Mr. Lin, a math major, went on to become a derivatives trader on Wall Street.But Mr. Mackey is a Ph.D. candidate at the Statistical Artificial Intelligence Lab at the University of California, Berkeley. “My interests now have been influenced by working on the Netflix prize contest,” he said.Software recommendation systems, Mr. Mackey said, will increasingly become common tools to help people find useful information and products amid the explosion of information and offerings competing for their attention on the Web. “A lot of these techniques will propagate across the Internet,” he predicted.That is certainly the hope of Domonkos Tikk, a Hungarian computer scientist and a member of the Ensemble. Mr. Tikk, 39, and three younger colleagues started working on the contest shortly after it began, and in 2007 they teamed up with the Princeton group. “When we entered the Netflix competition, we had no experience in collaborative filtering,” Mr. Tikk said.Yet based on what they learned, Mr. Tikk and his colleagues founded a start-up, Gravity, which is developing recommendation systems for commercial clients, including e-commerce Web sites and a European cellphone company.Though the Ensemble team nudged ahead of BellKor’s on the public leader board, it is not necessarily the winner. BellKor’s, according to Mr. Volinsky, remains in first place, and Netflix contacted it on Sunday to say so.And in an online forum, another member of the BellKor’s team, Yehuda Koren, a researcher for Yahoo in Israel, said his team had “a better test score than the Ensemble,” despite what the rival team submitted for the leader board.So is BellKor’s the winner? Certainly not yet, according to a Netflix spokesman, Steve Swasey. “There is no winner,” he said.A winner, Mr. Swasey said, will probably not be announced until sometime in September at an event hosted by Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive. The movie rental company is not holding off for maximum public relations effect, Mr. Swasey said, but because the winner has not yet been determined.The Web leader board, he explained, is based on what the teams submit. Next, Netflix’s in-house researchers and outside experts have to validate the teams’ submissions, poring over the submitted code, design documents and other materials. “This is really complex stuff,” Mr. Swasey said.In Hungary, Mr. Tikk did not sound optimistic. “We didn’t get any notification from Netflix,” he said in a phone interview. “So I think the chances that we won are very slight. It was a nice try.”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','In an interview with Forbes in 1983, he said that giving to the arts also impressed customers, and that more people go to museums than ballgames.In 1983, Mr. Weissman installed a branch of the Whitney Museum of American Art on the ground floor of the company’s new Park Avenue headquarters, across from Grand Central Terminal. He was on the Whitney board from 1979 to 1990.When Mr. Weissman retired as chairman of the company in 1984, he spoke of fishing for salmon. But he was soon as busy as ever, becoming vice chairman of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in 1984, then serving as chairman from 1986 to 1994.He oversaw the construction of the Samuel B. and David Rose Building and united all 12 Lincoln Center constituents in a 19-month festival to honor Mozart’s bicentennial. He also encouraged the Classical Jazz series, a forerunner of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which eventually got its own space, in 2004.George Weissman, the son of immigrants from Eastern Europe, was bornin the Bronx on July 12, 1919. After graduating from Townsend HarrisHigh School, he earned a degree in business administration from thebusiness school of the City College of New York. He then edited a small weekly newspaper in New Jersey and worked as a reporter for The Star-Ledger, based in Newark.He joined the Navy the day after Pearl Harbor, helping to chase submarines and shell beachheads for 3 1/2 years. After his discharge, he wrote a review of the Samuel Goldwyn movie “The Best Years of Our Lives” for some labor papers. Goldwyn hired him as a publicity agent at $125 a week.After Goldwyn fired him in a dispute over promoting a movie, he got a job with Benjamin Sonnenberg, who is credited with helping create the modern public relations industry. Soon, Mr. Weissman was devoted full time to the Philip Morris account. He was hired in 1952 as assistant to the president of Philip Morris.In 1960, Mr. Weissman became chief executive of Philip Morris International, where he helped build up overseas sales to the point that they accounted for a third of both sales and earnings for the entire company. In 1966, he was named president of Philip Morris itself, and he guided the company’s strategy of using profits from cigarettes to expand into other businesses, including the acquisition of the Seven-Up Company in 1978.When Mr. Weissman became chairman and chief executive of Philip Morris in 1978, he told Fortune magazine that he saw himself as the quintessential Marlboro man.“I’m no cowboy and I don’t ride horseback,” he said, “but I like to think I have the freedom the Marlboro man exemplifies. He’s the man who doesn’t punch a clock. He’s not computerized. He’s a free spirit.”Mr. Weissman had few compunctions about describing his own habits. “Forty cigarettes a day, one or two beers and I also drink some wine,” he said in a press conference in Paris in 1980.Under his leadership, Philip Morris employed blacks in prominent executive positions, resulting in boycotts in some places in the South. The company also advertised in black and Hispanic newspapers and magazines.Mr. Weissman joined other business leaders in signing petitions against the Vietnam War. When the Nixon administration’s “enemies list” was released by a Senate committee in 1973, he was on it.In addition to his son Paul, Mr. Weissman is survived by his wife of 65 years, the former Mildred Stregack; his daughter, Ellen; his son Daniel; and a grandson.Mr. Weissman told Forbes in 1980 that he felt Philip Morris had a “Masada complex,” referring to the desperate defense of first-century Jews against powerful Roman legions. He said it first fought the tobacco industry as it clawed its way up the ladder, then the government and anti- smoking activists.He seemed to have trouble understanding the view of those who argued that arts organizations should refuse tobacco money as tainted. “Do you stop the Bolshoi from coming here because you don’t believe in the Russian system?” he said in an interview with The Times in 1987.'"
"'09-07-28,'0','MEXICO CITY — The Obama administration has pulled the plug on an electronic billboard outside the American diplomatic mission in Havana that was used to tweak the Cuban government with pro-democracy messages and became a symbol of the bad blood between the two countries.When the billboard went up in 2006, some saw it as an innovative diplomatic stick in the eye of the government of Fidel Castro. Others, though, considered the 25 electrical panels installed by the Bush administration in the fifth-floor windows of the American Interests Section to be fundamentally silly.Mr. Castro, who ceded the presidency to his brother Raúl last year, was clearly not amused by the bright red messages, many of which criticized his government for human rights abuses.In response, he blocked the message board with huge black flags hanging on 100-foot-high flag poles and erected billboards nearby that denounced President George W. Bush. Cuban security guards were also stationed in strategic spots to shoo away any Cubans who might gaze upward at the five-foot-high news ticker, which overlooked the Malecón, Havana’s coastal highway.President Obama, while keeping in place the economic embargo of Cuba, has taken a series of steps to improve relations with the government. The unplugging of the billboard, which was done quietly last month, follows a loosening of travel restrictions and the beginning of migration talks with the Cuban government.'"

"'09-07-28,'0','The city’s health department failed to inspect one in every five restaurants during the 2008 fiscal year, according to an audit issued by the city comptroller’s office on Monday. Inspectors are supposed to make unannounced annual visits to the city’s restaurants. But 22 percent of the restaurants slipped through the cracks that fiscal year, the audit found.“The Health Department is charged with protecting the health and well-being of New Yorkers, but, unfortunately, its internal controls for ensuring that health code violations at restaurants are corrected in a timely manner were found to be flawed,” the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said in a statement.The Bureau of Food Safety and Community Sanitation, part of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, is responsible for inspecting food-service establishments, which include mobile units and cafeterias at schools and senior centers as well as restaurants.If violations are found during a review, inspectors are supposed to return in 14 to 45 days to determine whether the violations have been corrected.According to documents provided by the comptroller’s office, 5,838 restaurants failed at least one sanitary inspection during the 2008 fiscal year.The audit, reported in The Daily News on Monday, investigated a sample of 62 restaurants that failed inspections. In all but two cases, inspectors made follow-up visits, but 20 percent of them were reinspected more than 45 days after the initial inspection.“It is important to ensure that compliance inspections are performed timely,” Mr. Thompson said. “Otherwise the danger that food-borne illness could occur as a result of unsanitary conditions being allowed to continue is increased.”He added, “It may be necessary for the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to make modifications to ensure that inspections are performed in a uniform manner.”The health department acknowledged that it had failed to reach its target during the 2008 fiscal year. According to the department’s figures, inspectors examined 80.1 percent of food service establishments in that period.However, the department said that in each fiscal year from 2004 to 2007, it inspected about 99 percent of food-service establishments, and that it had returned to that level in the 2009 fiscal year.A spokeswoman for the department said the 2008 dip was a result of the need to make more follow-up visits.The health department questioned the comptroller’s assertion that only 80 percent of compliance inspections occurred within the 14-to-45-day time frame.The department’s own analysis from the 2008 fiscal year found that 95.7 percent occurred within the required period.A statement released by the department suggested that the discrepancy between the comptroller’s findings and their own was due to the small size of the audit’s sample.Marion Nestle, a professor in the Department of Nutrition, Food Studies and Public Health at New York University, said food inspections play a crucial deterrent role, forcing restaurant owners to maintain high standards.However, she suggested that not all of the criteria by which establishments are judged are equally significant.“Cooking food to proper temperature and storing food to proper temperature are important food-safety matters,” she said. “Other things seem less important, like whether you stack forks with the fork part up or down.”Beginning next July, all restaurants in New York will be required to post a sanitary grade in their windows, a measure already adopted elsewhere. Professor Nestle supports such public ratings.“Places like Los Angeles that give grades have a lot more clout,” she said. “You go to a B place, you better eat your food hot.”'"

"'09-07-28,'0','Because of reductions in corporate spending, business travelers have begun behaving more and more like leisure travelers, eschewing immediate convenience for lower prices — even in the international premium niche.I can’t begin to summarize the current discount fare environment. But here are a few current and arbitrarily chosen examples. Contemplating a business trip to Shanghai? With a little flexibility, you can travel in luxury and sleep in a lie-flat bed. Air Canada has a sale in which a first-class ticket between Los Angeles and Shanghai is available for less than $3,500. A year ago, a traveler could have easily paid over $15,000 on various airlines for that ticket.Business class from New York to London? For the British Airways swanky Club World cabin, that will be about $2,544 round trip for late summer travel, with an advance purchase. The walk-up fare for Club World on that route used to be about $11,000 and is still about $7,500.New York to Amsterdam? On the mostly business-class planes operated by OpenSkies, a British Airways subsidiary, the summer fare is about $1,300, round trip.As always, you need to check individual airline Web sites for the fine print on advance purchase restrictions and fees.Or, given the current free-for-all in high-end fares, you may even want to consult with a real live travel agent. That’s because finding the right premium fares at the right time has become cumbersome even for business travelers who used to book travel themselves in a less frantic environment.“We all know the airlines are reducing capacity, but that’s going to take time,” said Fran Kramer, who specializes in international bookings for DePrez Travel, a big agency in Rochester with clients all over the country. “While they do that and figure out what works,” she added, “there are certainly a lot of opportunities” for finding major fare discounts on international premium travel.Ms. Kramer said that airlines, desperate for whatever revenue they can get, sometimes reach out to agents with last-minute offers for premium seats that are unsold, even at promotional fares, just before a flight. “Yesterday, we got a call 24 hours in advance offering my client the option to go to Europe in business class for $500 extra,” she said.Airlines can’t continue losing money indefinitely, but they’re still flying those fancy cabins overseas. So big discounts on premium travel will continue until supply can be brought into some profitable relationship with demand. Even then, those stunning $11,000 round-trip business-class fares between, say, New York and London may be a thing of the past.Airline executives have been looking ahead with reduced expectations.“This industry can always reduce prices,” said Willie Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways. “The challenge now is, can you adjust your cost base to reflect that different price point, or ideally can you take the costs out quicker than the prices are going down?”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','The couple, who live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, programmed the festival to their taste. That meant consciously avoiding spiritual, chanting acts in favor of indie pillars like Andrew Bird and Jenny Lewis. On the yoga side, they booked teachers whom Ms. Grant called “rock stars,” like Ms. Rea, from California, and John Friend, from Texas, who tour regularly. They received headliner billing alongside the bands, and drew just as many attendees.Mr. Krasno, 38, and Ms. Grant, 39, also envisioned Wanderlust as a way to capitalize on movements that started as subcultures and have now become mainstays, from yoga to indie rock to environmentalism. “Balance” was the weekend’s mantra.It seems to have worked: more than 4,000 people showed up, Mr. Krasno said, most from the Southwest and California, paying $25 to $165 for tickets to the music or the yoga. About 1,500 of those bought $170 passes that entitled them to experience both: manna to cool-seeking sponsors like Target.Though it wasn’t quite enough to break even, Mr. Krasno said his partners, which include the companies behind established festivals like Bonnaroo in Tennessee and Austin City Limits in Texas, are already considering expanding Wanderlust next year, to three events on three mountaintops.Gary Bongiovanni, the editor of the concert industry magazine Pollstar, said the festival organizers had “a great potential for success if they are able to endure the first few years of getting established.”But let’s pause for a cleansing breath here: can you really party all night and downward dog all day?“Frankly, when I heard about it,” said Mr. Bird, the singer and multi-instrumentalist who was a headliner on Sunday, “my first reaction was, is that going to work, because some of the bands don’t exactly spell inner peace, musically — nor do I, lyrically.”He was persuaded to join not because he’s a yoga fanatic (“most of the moves hurt”) but because the festival’s setting provided a distinctive experience, even for a tour veteran. And he figured the audience would be receptive to the show he wanted to play. “It’s a little more ambient, let it wash over you,” he said.He was right. His set, played on borrowed instruments after his didn’t arrive, got the crowd to hush and listen, even amid the distractions: a lake to skinny-dip in, Frisbee games to join and Hula-Hoops to twirl and twirl.But the festival was not without some drama. On Friday Michael Franti, the leader of the activist Bay Area band Spearhead, canceled his Saturday headlining slot because of appendicitis. (The organizers put up several banner-size “get well” cards for people to sign. “Michael Franti is ill — not in a good way,” one read.)The rapper Common was a last-minute replacement; he drew locals but turned off some of the yogis. “He’s hitting on the girls in the front row in the middle of the concert!” one man said on his way out.And some of the artists didn’t know what to make of the vibe.“I’m not going to do the hippie dance,” said Kaki King, the Brooklyn-based guitarist and singer who performed early on Saturday on the mountaintop stage. “I’m going to put shoes on and I’m not going to drink any mold” (a reference to kombucha, a fermented tea). And, she continued, “I’m not going to do any yoga.”Meanwhile, on the stage at the foot of the mountain, Ms. Rea was instructing her students to point their legs aloft and roll their ankles open, “as if you can drink the sky from the souls of your feet.”There was nothing incongruous about this scene, she said afterward, as she posed for photos with fans. “Polarity is interesting,” she said. “I love to expand the environment of yoga to as many different people as possible, and also get out of the studio.”Festivalgoers like Genevieve Griesau, 35, a yoga teacher in training who came from Oakland, Calif., agreed. “I like crazy hardcore industrial music and punk rock and kundalini yoga — for a long time, those forces were fighting inside of me,” said Ms. Griesau, who wore a pink Go-Go’s T-shirt and polka-dot leggings. As she grew up, though, she found the common ground; she came to Wanderlust for “Girl Talk and yoga,” she said, and managed to stay up dancing until 2 a.m. and still make an early Ashtanga class.Gregg Gillis, the mash-up artist who performs as Girl Talk, and whose shows resemble a raunchy spring break party, is about as far removed from peacefulness as possible. But many festivalgoers said they got the same rejuvenating charge from raucous dancing as from mindful breathing.“These are audiences with open minds,” Mr. Gillis said. “Even if they’re not into it, they’re not there to critique it. And if they like it, they’re not embarrassed to get into it.”A common reference point for attendees was the Burning Man festival in Nevada. Like it, Wanderlust had fire twirlers, stilt-walkers, costumed circus performers and late-night welding; the after-parties were not as much of a draw as offbeat events like midnight yoga Twister, Mr. Krasno’s pet project. (Ms. Grant, who is five months pregnant with the couple’s third child, won the first round.)“Can we please never ever go home?” said Megan Miller, 28, a field representative for Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, who drove up — in a fuel-efficient car — with two friends from San Francisco. She practiced her handstand during Mr. Bird’s set and was moved to tears by Mr. Friend’s class.Perhaps no performer embodied the Wanderlust ethos more than MC Yogi, a San Franciscan who practiced yoga in Adidas shell toes, which didn’t stop him from putting his leg over his shoulder. He beatboxed over the om chant, and with the help of some stilt-walkers, led a parade from an arm-balancing class on Sunday to the stage underneath the gondolas, where he did a yogacentric hip-hop show.“Say namaste!” he shouted into the mike. “How many of you think Ganesh is fresh?” Lined up on their yoga mats, the members of his audience threw their hands in the air. “We’re going to go old school — 4,000 years back,” MC Yogi promised, with intention. “Y’all ready to shake your asana?”'"

"'09-07-28,'0','Still, he is unlikely to be sought as an immediate starter, but rather as a backup or as a situational quarterback for formations like the Wildcat, which would take advantage of his superb scrambling ability. Then perhaps next year, Vick’s tortuous journey back to stardom and the riches that accompany it will be complete. Vick needs that journey to be successful: he has filed for bankruptcy and is deeply in debt.But first, Vick must again convince Goodell — and owners considering taking an enormous risk on him — that he is prepared to reimmerse himself in the N.F.L. without drowning in the bad decisions that pulled him down. Goodell said he met with Vick for about four and a half hours, including two one-one-one meetings in which they discussed Vick’s past, the fact that he lied to Goodell when initially confronted with the dogfighting allegations and the challenges Vick faces off the field. Goodell said they did not discuss football.“I believe he is sincere in his remorse,” Goodell said in a conference call. “He recognizes what he was engaging in was horrific and cruel. He wanted an opportunity to prove that was not Michael Vick. He really didn’t focus significantly on the loss of career and the loss of money.”In a letter to Vick on Monday, Goodell noted that Vick’s margin for error was “extremely limited.” He wrote: “My decision at that time will be based on reports from outside professionals, your probation officer, and others charged with supervising your activities, the quality of your work outside football, the absence of any further adverse involvement in law enforcement, and other concrete actions that you take that are consistent with your representations to me.”Tony Dungy, the former Indianapolis Colts coach, visited Vick during his time at a federal prison in Leavenworth, Kan., and will be his mentor.Vick, who has been suspended since August 2007, was released from federal custody on July 20. He is serving three years of probation. In a statement Monday, Vick recalled the “terrible mistakes” he had made in the past and referred to the maturation he had since experienced.“I would like to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to Commissioner Goodell for allowing me to be readmitted to the National Football League,” Vick said. “I fully understand that playing football in the N.F.L. is a privilege, not a right, and I am truly thankful for the opportunity I have been given.”Goodell interviewed Vick’s family members and associates, and Vick’s ability to show that he has severed ties with some of the people who exerted a bad influence on him at home in Virginia will probably be scrutinized by the league before he is allowed back on the field. Vick also had to submit a written plan concerning his proposed living arrangements, management of his finances, counseling and mentoring plans and his proposed work with the Humane Society of the United States.Goodell said that while considering Vick’s future, he consulted with current and former players and coaches, as well as community leaders, and encountered a broad spectrum of reaction. Goodell spoke repeatedly with DeMaurice Smith, the head of the N.F.L. Players Association, and on Monday, Smith pledged to support Vick.“We are pleased that he is on the right path to return not only to the field, but as a contributing member of his community,” Smith said in a statement.Still, Goodell said some fans would be outraged by the decision to allow Vick back into the league. The team that signs Vick will almost certainly find animal-rights protesters greeting it at training camp, which may deter a franchise that is not a well-respected community presence, no matter how dire its quarterbacking situation.“I’m a believer personally that if somebody recognizes either mistakes in judgment or things, they can do better going forward, that the general public will recognize that and give people an opportunity to prove themselves,” Goodell said. “I’m trying to give Michael the opportunity to prove himself to play in the N.F.L. again. It’s in his hands now.”Vick is not the only troubled player Goodell will have to deal with this season. Plaxico Burress, the former Giants receiver who shot himself in the leg with an unlicensed gun last November, is awaiting a grand jury decision on whether to indict him. The New York Post reported Monday that Manhattan’s district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, wants Burress to spend time in prison. Burress is a free agent, but Goodell has not decided on his eligibility for this season and he is likely to receive a suspension.'"
"'09-07-28,'0','Compared with other sources of driver distraction, “texting is in its own universe of risk,” said Rich Hanowski, who oversaw the study at the institute.Mr. Hanowski said the texting analysis was financed by $300,000 from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which has the mission of improving safety in trucks and buses. More broadly, the research yielding the results represent a significant logistical undertaking.The overall cost was $6 million to equip the trucks with video cameras and track them for three million miles as they hauled furniture, frozen foods and other goods across the country.The final analysis of the data is undergoing peer review before formal publication.Tom Dingus, director of the Virginia Tech institute, one of the world’s largest vehicle safety research organizations, said the study’s message was clear.“You should never do this,” he said of texting while driving. “It should be illegal.”Thirty-six states do not ban texting while driving; 14 do, including , , and . New York legislators have sent a bill to Gov. . But legislators in some states have rejected such rules, and elected officials say they need more data to determine whether to ban the activity.One difficulty in measuring crashes caused by texting drivers — and by drivers talking on phones — is that many police agencies do not collect this data or have not compiled long-term studies. Texting also is a relatively new phenomenon.The issue has drawn attention after several recent highly publicized crashes caused by texting drivers, including an episode in May involving a trolley car driver in who crashed while texting his girlfriend.Over all, texting has soared. In December, phone users in the sent 110 billion messages, a tenfold increase in just three years, according to the cellular phone industry’s trade group, CTIA.The results of the Virginia Tech study are buttressed by new laboratory research from the . In a study over the last 18 months, college students using a sophisticated driving simulator showed an eight times greater crash risk when texting than when not texting.That study, which is undergoing peer review and has been submitted for publication in The Journal for Human Factors, also found that drivers took their eyes off the road for around five seconds when texting.David Strayer, a professor who co-wrote the University of Utah report, offered two explanations for the simulator’s showing lower risks than the study. Trucks are tougher to maneuver and stop, he noted, and the college students in his study might be somewhat better at multitasking.But the differences in the studies are not the point, Mr. Strayer said. “You’re off the charts in both cases,” he added. “It’s crazy to be doing it.”At Virginia Tech, researchers said they focused on texting among truckers simply because the trucking study was relatively new and thus better reflected the explosive growth of texting. But another new study from the organization is focusing on texting among so-called light-vehicle drivers, specifically teenagers.Preliminary results from that study show risk levels for texters roughly comparable to those of the truck drivers. The formal results of the light-vehicle study should be available later this year. By comparison, several field and laboratory studies show that drivers talking on cellphones are four times more likely to cause a crash than other drivers. And a previous Virginia institute study videotaping car drivers found that they were three times more likely to crash or come close to a crash when dialing a phone and 1.3 times more likely when talking on it.Researchers focused on distracted driving disagree about whether to place greater value on the results of such a so-called naturalistic study or laboratory studies, which allow the scientists to recreate conditions and measure individual drivers against themselves.But, in the case of texting, laboratory and real-world researchers say the results are significant — from both scientific methodologies, texting represents a much greater risk to drivers than other distractions.A new poll shows that many drivers know the risks of texting while driving — and do it anyway. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety plans on Tuesday to publish polling data that show that 87 percent of people consider drivers texting or e-mailing to pose a “very serious” safety threat (roughly equal to the 90 percent who consider drunken drivers a threat).Of the 2,501 drivers surveyed this spring, 95 percent said that texting was unacceptable behavior. Yet 21 percent of drivers said they had recently texted or e-mailed while driving.About half of drivers 16 to 24 said they had texted while driving, compared with 22 percent of drivers 35 to 44.“It’s convenient,” said Robert Smith, 22, a recent college graduate in Windham, Me. He says he regularly texts and drives even though he recognizes that it is a serious risk. He would rather text, he said, than take time on a phone call.“I put the phone on top of the steering wheel and text with both thumbs,” he said, adding that he often has exchanges of 10 messages or more. Sometimes, “I’ll look up and realize there’s a car sitting there and swerve around it.”Mr. Smith, who was not part of the AAA survey, said he was surprised by the findings in the new research about texting.“I’m pretty sure that someday it’s going to come back to bite me,” he said of his behavior.'"
"'09-07-28,'0','“This is not an issue that the administration is banging the table on,” said Myron Brilliant, senior vice president for international affairs at the United States Chamber of Commerce.The meetings, called the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, are a successor to a wide-ranging consultation begun during the Bush administration by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. Mrs. Clinton pushed for the State Department to take an equal role in the talks, previously weighted toward economic issues.By broadening the scope, China and the United States were able to forge common cause on issues like North Korea. Mrs. Clinton praised the Chinese government last week for doing more to support American efforts to pressure Pyongyang.“At this point, the relationship is basically in good shape,” said Kenneth G. Lieberthal, who worked on China policy in the Clinton White House. “But I don’t think anyone can assume things will remain in good shape, given the difficulty of the issues.”Mr. Obama referred frankly to tensions over human rights, saying that the United States believes the “that all peoples should be free to speak their minds — and that includes ethnic and religious minorities in China.”But he expressed respect for what he called an “ancient and dynamic” society, and noted that he had named two Chinese-Americans to his cabinet: Steven Chu, the energy secretary, and Gary Locke, the commerce secretary. Mr. Chu later made a presentation on climate change.The Chinese delegation was led by Wang Qishan, a vice premier who oversees economic policy, and Dai Bingguo, a state councilor responsible for foreign policy. Mr. Dai said the upheaval of the recent economic crisis had united the two countries. “We’re actually in the same big boat that has been hit by fierce wind and huge waves,” he said.While there are nascent signs of recovery in both countries, Mr. Obama stressed the need for Americans to save more and for Chinese consumers to spend more. The Americans told the Chinese they would have to adjust to higher household savings in the United States, said David Loevinger, the Treasury’s senior coordinator for the meetings.Mr. Loevinger said American officials did broach the issue of China’s exchange rate, which Beijing deliberately keeps depressed to bolster its exports. But he declined to characterize the exchange.Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said, “The currency issue is going to remain important because of the need to get to ‘balanced growth.’ ”Some of the more contentious issues may be taken up on Tuesday. For example, the United States had yet to register its dissatisfaction with government procurement rules in China that favor Chinese manufacturers.“Let’s be honest,” Mr. Obama said, “some in China think that America will try to contain China’s ambitions; some in America that think there is something to fear in a rising China. I take a different view.”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','Sales of new homes in the United States posted their largest monthly gain in nearly eight years in June, the government reported on Monday, a sign that the housing market is bottoming as buyers take advantage of lower prices.The Commerce Department reported that sales of new single-family homes rose 11 percent in June; economists’ expected a 3 percent increase.The pace of home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted rate of 384,000 a year, the highest level since November.But the figures offered no sign that the housing market had returned to health.Despite the monthly increase, sales of new homes were still down 21 percent from June 2008. The market is still swamped by a glut of for-sale houses. And new homes, facing competition from cheap foreclosures, are sitting on the market for close to a year before they sell, compared with a median time of six months on the market in 2007.“These are still really bad numbers,” an economist at IHS Global Insight, Patrick Newport, said. “The market just couldn’t have dropped much further.”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','BANGKOK — The prosecution in Myanmar concluded its final arguments on Monday in the trial of the jailed pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, her lawyer said.The lawyer, U Nyan Win, said the defense would respond to those arguments on Tuesday, concluding a case that has drawn international condemnation since it opened May 18. No date has been set for a verdict, Mr. Nyan Win said by telephone from Myanmar’s main city, Yangon.Further hearings are continuing in the case of John Yettaw, the American whose two-day intrusion in early May at the villa of Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi was the cause of her trial. She faces a possible five-year prison term on a charge of violating the terms of her house arrest, which has been in place for 14 of the last 19 years.Mr. Yettaw faces a similar term on immigration charges and on a charge of violating city ordinances for swimming across a lake to her house. Two women who live with Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi are also on trial on charges similar to those brought against her.Adding its voice to international condemnation of the military junta in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, Amnesty International awarded its highest honor on Monday to Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, naming her this year’s “Ambassador of Conscience.”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','AT&T, the other large phone company, has been affected by many of the same trends, although it has been quicker to cut costs. The company has eliminated 14,000 positions this year.AT&T’s wireless business has been growing faster than Verizon’s, largely because of AT&T’s exclusive deal to offer Apple’s iPhone. AT&T, which reported second-quarter earnings last week, added 1.4 million wireless customers compared with 1.1 million at Verizon. But that growth came at a price. Because of the heavy subsidy AT&T pays to Apple for each iPhone, its wireless profit margins of 38 percent were far lower than the 46 percent at Verizon.On the landline side, it is Verizon that has increased its growth through investment, but at a cost of profitability. Verizon has invested more in its FiOS fiber optic system than AT&T has spent on upgrading its network, but has lower margins than AT&T. Verizon’s revenue from residential customers is essentially flat over a year ago, while AT&T’s fell by 6.3 percent. Verizon’s average home customer pays the company $72.59 a month, but the average FiOS home pays more than $135 a month.Verizon added 300,000 FiOS TV customers in the quarter and 303,000 FiOS Internet customers.For the second quarter, Verizon reported net income of $1.48 billion, or 52 cents a share, down from $1.88 billion, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Most of that decline was related to costs of its planned sale of some rural phone systems to Frontier Communications. Excluding the one-time charges, Verizon earned 63 cents a share, in line with analysts’ estimates and down 6 percent from a year ago.Total revenue increased by 11.6 percent, to $26.9 billion, but most of that growth came from its acquisition of Alltel. The company’s core business grew by only 1.9 percent, sharply slower than the 5.3 percent pace of a year ago.Wireless revenue was $15.5 billion, up 9 percent (excluding the acquisition), driven by increased use of data plans by cellphone customers. The most profitable group of wireless customers are those that pay bills every month directly to Verizon. The company added 1.1 million such customers in the quarter, down from 1.5 million in the second quarter of 2008.Landline revenue was $11.5 billion, down 5.2 percent. The decline came entirely from business customers. The company has stayed in Wall Street’s good graces, however, by cutting costs fast enough to compensate for the decelerating growth. “Their second-quarter results reveal a tightly run ship,” Craig Moffett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to clients.On a conference call with investors Monday, Dennis F. Strigl, Verizon’s president, told investors that he was not concerned about the impact of Apple’s popular iPhone. He said Verizon had many new handsets coming out, including the Palm Pre, which it will start selling early next year. And it is planning to open its own store for smartphone applications by the end of 2009.Mr. Strigl said AT&T’s exclusive deal with Apple helped everyone. “It accelerated innovation,” he said. “It is very good for our customers. Everyone is coming out with their own iconic devices.”'"
"'09-07-28,'0','After traveling on to Amman on Monday, Mr. Gates said at a news conference that he had received assurances from the Israelis that as long as there was a time limit on the outreach to Iran, “the Israelis were prepared to let it go forward.”Mr. Gates, apparently in an attempt to smooth over anxieties, reiterated at the news conference in Jerusalem that was hopeful that Iran would accept the offer of talks at the time that the convened in late September. Mr. Obama has set a further deadline of the end of the year for Iran to show some progress on the issue.Still, Mr. Gates acknowledged that “we’re very mindful of the possibility that the Iranians would simply try to run out the clock.” In Amman, he said that if engagement with Iran did not work, the United States was prepared to press for tougher economic sanctions against it. Iran is already the subject of United Nations sanctions.“Our hope still remains that Iran will respond to the president’s outstretched hand in a positive and constructive way, but we’ll see,” Mr. Gates said.The United States and Israel estimate that Iran is within one to three years of developing nuclear-weapons capability. Despite international pressure, Iran has continued to add centrifuges for enriching uranium at its plant in Natanz. But Iran insists that its nuclear program is geared only toward peaceful electricity generation.Iran’s disputed presidential election on June 12 and the turmoil afterward have significantly complicated American efforts to engage the country’s leaders, and even to determine who is in charge.Before June 12, Mr. Obama’s top aides have said, they received back-channel indications from emissaries who claimed to represent Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah , and who said that they would respond this summer to the president’s overtures. But the crackdown and divisions among senior clerics have changed the political dynamics, and senior administration officials say they have heard nothing from Iran’s leadership.Mr. Gates, on his first trip to Jerusalem in two and a half years, is one of a stream of Obama administration officials traveling to the city this week, including James L. Jones, the national security adviser; Dennis B. Ross, an Iran expert on the staff; and , the special envoy for the .The United States has sent out conflicting messages this past month on its views of any Israeli military strike against Iran. Mr. Gates and Adm. , the chairman of the , have said that an Israeli strike would be “profoundly destabilizing” to the region. But Vice President has said that the United States “cannot dictate” to Israel.President Obama has more recently said that the United States is “absolutely not” giving Israel its approval for a strike.In Amman, Mr. Gates met with King of Jordan.'"
"'09-07-28,'0','Although corporate earnings are down more than 20 percent from last year, they are still coming in much better than the 35 percent decline that many market watchers had expected. Of the 202 companies that have reported earnings, 77 percent have beaten expectations, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.“Not only are more companies beating, but they’re beating by a lot more,” said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. “It’s been a relatively low bar to beat, and the market’s reacted pretty positively to that.”But on Monday, shares of the health insurance company Aetna fell 2.7 percent after it reported a 28 percent decline in profit and reduced its outlook.Verizon Communications reported a 7 percent drop in profit, yet its results met Wall Street expectations. Verizon said, however, that it planned to cut another 8,000 jobs, and its shares fell 1.6 percent to $31.Although earnings reports from financial giants like Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase commanded much of the attention on Wall Street recently, some focus is shifting back to economic indicators this week.A closely watched gauge of housing prices is being released Tuesday, and the government will detail the overall rate of economic growth when it reports the advance gross domestic product for the second quarter on Friday.The economy declined at a pace of 5.5 percent in the first three months of 2009, but economists expect that the rate of contraction shrank to 1.5 percent in the second quarter.Shares of major home builders rose on Monday after the Commerce Department reported that sales of new homes rose 11 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted rate of 384,000, a sharper increase than the 3 percent rise economists had expected. Sale prices fell for another month, to a nationwide median of $206,200, the government reported.Economists said the figures offered more evidence that housing was bottoming out. This month, the government reported that housing starts had bounced higher in June, and the National Association of Realtors said sales of used homes increased for a third month.The London interbank offered rate, a measure of borrowing costs, fell below 0.5 percent on Monday in another sign that credit markets were responding to huge government interventions. The three-month Libor rose to 4.8 percent last fall as credit locked up, but has dropped to record lows as lending conditions improved.“They’re still challenging, but they’ve eased substantially since the worst parts of the cycle,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup.In Europe, the major markets closed slightly higher. The DJ Euro Stoxx-50 index, a barometer of euro-zone blue chips, rose 0.72 percent, giving the index a gain for the year of 6.28 percent. The CAC-40 in Paris rose 0.18 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt was up 0.42 percent. The FTSE-100 index in London rose 0.21 percent.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills, and 20-year inflation notes:'"
"'09-07-28,'0','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Monday it was open to new discussions to help resolve the dispute over its nuclear weapons program, although the North emphasized that it was not interested in resuming six-nation talks on the impasse.The comment from the North Korean Foreign Ministry was seen as an apparent willingness to engage the United States in bilateral talks, a longstanding North Korean preference.Over the weekend, Sin Son-ho, the top North Korean diplomat at the United Nations, said his government was “not against a dialogue” with Washington. And the ministry’s statement on Monday alluded to bilateral talks as “a specific and reserved form of dialogue that can address the current situation.”North Korea’s suggestion brightens the prospects for dialogue with the United States after months of increasing tensions set off by the launching of a long-range rocket by North Korea in April; its second nuclear test, in May; and a series of test-firings of short-range missiles.But a fundamental rift remains: The Obama administration has indicated it would be willing to engage the North in direct talks only if the North agrees to return to the six-nation talks that involve the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas.'"

The victims of the genocide were held hostage by cold-war politics, for which the world should feel enduring shame.The trials do not constitute the entire mandate of the United Nations system in Cambodia. My own organization, Unicef, returned to Cambodia in 1979, just after the fall of Pol Pot’s regime. It devotes some $20 million a year to reduce maternal and child mortality, assure basic education and protect vulnerable children from the exploitation and abuse that are manifestations of continuing poverty.'"
"'09-07-29,'0','Congress has pledged to reform the banking system, but too often over the past year lawmakers have chosen instead to shield the financial industry, a big campaign contributor, from accountability.So the public has every right to ask whether the newly formed Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission — created by Congress to investigate the meltdown — can be counted on to put the public interest ahead of political loyalties, professional ties and ideological biases.The men and women on the panel are accomplished in their fields — business, law, economics and academia — and many have past government experience. They have been chosen to perform a service that is crucial to restoring trust in the markets and in the government; their findings will also inform efforts.The 10 members — six chosen by the Democratic leadership, four by the Republican leadership — also have long partisan histories and at least one has strong ties to the financial industry.The Democratic chairman, Phil Angelides, a former state treasurer, has given, together with his wife, nearly $327,000 to Democratic candidates over the past two decades, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The vice chairman, former Representative Bill Thomas, a Republican, received $1.6 million in campaign contributions from financial, and real estate interests during his nearly two decades on Capitol Hill. He is now an adviser to a law firm that represents banking and financial-services clients.'"
"'09-07-29,'0','On the other side of the Capitol, a half-dozen members of the Senate Finance Committee reported further progress toward a possible bipartisan compromise, which includes creation of a new federal panel to hold down Medicare costs, particularly payments to hospitals and other health care providers.But some liberal Democrats, like Senators John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, expressed reservations about concessions being made by Democrats to keep a few Republicans on board.Mr. Rockefeller said he was unhappy that the legislation would end the Children’s Health Insurance Program and could reduce the scope of benefits for 11 million children in the program.Asked if he would support the bill, Mr. Rockefeller shot back a somber, stony look. “Can’t you see the joy on my face?” he asked.Speaking at a town-hall-style meeting organized by AARP, Mr. Obama said his proposals would slow the growth of health spending and avoid the need for future cuts in Medicare, the insurance program for 45 million people who are 65 and older or disabled.Democrats in Congress plan to finance about half the cost of the legislation by squeezing savings from Medicare. The White House says benefits will not be cut and beneficiaries will not be hurt.“Nobody is talking about cutting Medicare benefits,” Mr. Obama said.But Representative G. K. Butterfield, Democrat of North Carolina, said he heard many expressions of concern from constituents when he answered telephone calls to his office on Tuesday.“The longer we wait to vote,” Mr. Butterfield said, “the more opportunity our opponents have to put out false messages. Seniors fear they will lose Medicare. They worry they will have to discuss plans for end-of-life care every five years.”A provision of the House bill would provide Medicare coverage for the work of doctors who advise patients on life-sustaining treatment and “end-of-life services,” including hospice care.Conservative groups have seized on this provision as evidence that the bill could encourage the rationing of health care. The Family Research Council, for example, said the bill would “limit end-of-life care.”The House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, said, “This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.”Representative Robert E. Andrews, Democrat of New Jersey, said, “I have met seniors who think their Medicare will be taken away, which is false.”Lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol struggled Tuesday to come up with a bill that would cover the uninsured and control costs.In the House, the fiscally conservative Democrats — members of the Blue Dog Coalition — said they were not satisfied with the offers made Monday by the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. They drafted a counteroffer.House Democrats said their bill included provisions that would help older Americans. For example, they said, the bill would gradually close a gap in Medicare coverage of prescription drugs known as a doughnut hole. It would eliminate co-payments and deductibles for most preventive services in Medicare and make it easier for low-income people to get help with the cost of their Medicare premiums.The House bill would cut more than $160 billion over 10 years from the projected growth of Medicare payments to insurance companies that manage care for more than 10 million of the 45 million Medicare beneficiaries.“We’ll eliminate billions in unwarranted subsidies to insurance companies in the Medicare Advantage program — giveaways that boost insurance company profits but don’t make you any healthier,” Mr. Obama told AARP members.But Robert E. Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, a trade group, said that if Congress made those cuts, “beneficiaries would face higher premiums and reductions in benefits, and in some parts of the country, they might lose access to their Medicare Advantage plans.” When Congress cut Medicare payments in the past, he said, insurers withdrew from some counties.'"
"'09-07-29,'0','Barring an unexpected change in plans by General Motors, it appears that the 51st Buick Open this week at Grand Blanc, Mich., will be the last under the Buick sponsorship umbrella. According to a source who requested anonymity because the person is not authorized to speak about the sponsorship agreement, Buick’s parent company, General Motors, will cease sponsorship after this week’s tournament.The revelation follows reports by The Associated Press that said G.M., which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings July 11, would end its sponsorship of the tournament, a $5.1 million event at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club, and would instead focus its marketing budget on new product advertising. A separate report in The San Diego Union-Tribune said Buick was expected to withdraw its sponsorship from the 2010 Buick Invitational at Torrey Pines Golf Course.Pete Ternes, a G.M. spokesman, said Tuesday that the company was in discussions with the PGA Tour about both tournaments, which are contracted through 2010, and added, “We have not agreed to any changes.”Ty Votaw, a spokesman for the PGA Tour, said the tour had no comment on the reports. Votaw said that the commissioner, Tim Finchem, would meet Tuesday night with tournament officials and members of the tour’s Player Advisory Council but would not issue a statement afterward.Golfweek magazine last week said the PGA Tour would announce a new event and sponsor next week, and quoted the tour player and council member Tom Pernice confirming that this week’s event would be the final playing of the Buick Open.“Buick doesn’t have the finances; G.M. can’t afford it,” Pernice was quoted saying in Golfweek. “From a perception standpoint, you can’t lay off all of those people and then sponsor a golf tournament. They’ve supported us forever. It’s been a huge part of the tour. I think a lot of people knew the writing was on the wall.”Ternes said Buick would not discuss its plans about the tournament until after it ends on Sunday. Despite reports of the tournament’s demise, Buick has a strong promotional presence at Warwick Hills.'"

"'09-07-29,'0','The Obama administration said Tuesday that it would take new steps to ease American sanctions against Syria on a case-by-case basis, the latest sign of a diplomatic thaw.Administration officials said the message was conveyed to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria on Sunday in Damascus by President Obama’s Middle East envoy, George J. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell said the American government would try to expedite the process for obtaining individual exemptions to the sanctions, which prohibit the export of all American products to Syria except food and medicine.The move will particularly affect “requests to export products related to information technology and telecommunication equipment and parts and components related to the safety of civil aviation,” said a State Department spokesman, Andrew J. Laine.While the shift does not change the letter of the law of the sanctions, which were passed by Congress in 2003 and cannot be modified without Congressional consent, administration officials said it was significant because it indicated a change in how the White House would view requests by companies for waivers to sell their wares to Syria.It is also another notable instance of the Obama administration opening the door to Syria on what it calls a basis of mutual interest and respect — and as part of a broader strategy of trying to get the country to turn away from its alliances with Iran and Islamic militant groups. In June, the administration said it would send an ambassador to Syria for the first time since 2005.'"
"'09-07-29,'0','Until recently, many real estate professionals expected investment funds seeking opportunities in distressed real estate to swoop down on Miami and buy condo units by the hundreds at wholesale prices and then rent them out until the market recovered.A few bulk purchases have occurred — in the dozens rather than the hundreds — but most buyers have paid the current market price, not a wholesale price. For example, an investor from Colombia recently bought 31 units at 1060 Brickell for an average of $203 a square foot, according to Mr. Zalewski. Last week, however, a private equity group paid only $63 a square foot for 51 oceanfront condo-hotel units at the Regent Hotel in Miami Beach, he said. Previous units there had sold for $1,100 a square foot. But condo-hotel units are considered riskier and harder to finance than traditional condos.For the most part, bulk condo sales have yet to catch on. With the steep decline in values, developers of newer buildings are no longer in control of their projects and must defer to their lenders. “The lenders did not want to take the hit that the bulk purchasers were offering,” said Martin A. Schwartz, a partner at Bilzin Sumberg, a Miami law firm that represents developers.Another obstacle is that under Florida law, anyone who buys seven condos in a building with 70 or more units may be assuming all the liabilities of a developer, Mr. Schwartz said. “There is an element of risk,” he said. Mr. Barnett, for example, was unable to arrange a bulk sale for 346 units at 1060 Brickell last year at $200 a square foot.Robert Kaplan, a principal of Olympian Capital Group, a Miami mortgage brokerage, said the focus had shifted away from bulk sales to retail sales because lenders were not willing to take $100 to $125 a square foot when they could get $175 or more. “Every condo lender is considering market-rate sales,” he said. “They have no choice.”Bargains are being offered for under $200 a square foot at Brickell on the River South, near Southeast Fifth Street. At 500 Brickell, developed by the Related Group of Florida, the industry leader, prices for one-bedroom apartments have dropped to $180,000, from $260,000, said Lucas Lechuga, an agent for Keller Williams Realty in Miami. “The buildings that have slashed their prices are doing pretty well now,” he said.If demand does not keep up, prices will have to adjust, Mr. Kaplan said. “But we’re not seeing that yet,” he added. “We’re seeing velocity at the new lower prices,”According to Ronald A. Shuffield, the president of Esslinger-Wooten-Maxwell, a local brokerage, condo sales in new buildings increased to 82 a month, from an average of 50 a month, since April.Jack McCabe, the chief executive of McCabe Research and Consulting in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said, however, that he thought prices were likely to drop a lot further because of the high volume of foreclosures. “There are a lot of buildings where 30 to 35 percent of the units are in foreclosure,” he said. He predicted that bulk sales at prices as low as $100 a square foot would eventually occur, especially for inland properties. “It’s still early,” he said.In newer buildings with many unsold condos, developers are negotiating uncontested, or “friendly,” foreclosures with their lenders, sparing them the expense of a protracted battle. Last month, the Related Group surrendered its 420-unit CityPlace South development in West Palm Beach, Fla., where only 39 sales had been completed, to a group of lenders led by the Bank of Nova Scotia. Related paid an undisclosed sum to cancel its $119 million construction loan and other liabilities and won the right to continue to manage and maintain the project and run the sales operation — all for lucrative fees.According to recent news reports, Related hopes to work out a similar arrangement within the next couple of months to retire about $1.5 billion in outstanding debt on other South Florida condo projects, including the company’s showpiece, Icon Brickell, where only 31 of 1,646 units have sold. Related executives did not return telephone calls.Thomas R. Lehman, a Miami lawyer who has been negotiating several friendly foreclosures, said many developers had already quietly turned over the keys to their projects. “The wave has started,” said Mr. Lehman, the managing partner at Tew Cardenas. “Public records are catching up to what’s already been negotiated. Lenders are realizing that no one is going to buy their loans and they might as well get their projects back and put them on the market.” He said developers often were trying to preserve other assets they might have put up as collateral for their construction loan.But what has been a catastrophe for developers has been a bonanza for renters. According to a report commissioned by the Miami Downtown Development Authority, a quasi-independent city agency, 62 percent of the already completed new downtown condo units are occupied, split evenly between renters and owners. Monthly rents have declined 15 to 20 percent in Miami, with the median rate at $1.64 a square foot, Mr. Zalewski said.The Related Group has instituted an unusual rent-to-own program, in which no price is set in advance and all of the rental payments count toward a down payment, if the unit is purchased within a year.Joe Higgins, the owner of Grove Town Properties, a local brokerage, said about one-quarter of his rental clients were University of Miami law students doubling up with roommates, but the rest were professionals working downtown.With so many new buildings on the market, tenants have become choosy and now demand features like an updated kitchen, Mr. Higgins said. “Renters don’t want the older buildings,” he said. “They want the granite; they want the stainless steel.”'"
"'09-07-29,'0','BANGKOK — Final arguments concluded Tuesday in Myanmar in the trial of the pro-democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and the court announced that it would deliver a verdict Friday, diplomats said.Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 64, faces a term of up to five years in prison on charges of violating the terms of her long house arrest when an American intruder swam across a lake and spent two nights at her villa.After the hearing, Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, looking healthy and composed, thanked foreign diplomats who had been permitted to attend five of the sessions since the trial began May 18.“She said, ‘Thank you for trying to promote a just outcome,’ ” a diplomat said by telephone from Yangon, the main city in Myanmar. Another diplomat said Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi had expressed doubts about such an outcome in the highly political trial.Both spoke on condition of anonymity because of their embassies’ policies.Many analysts say they believe that a guilty verdict has already been determined. They say the trial is intended to keep Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi in custody at least through the parliamentary election expected next year.'"
"'09-07-29,'0','Predictive analytics technology plumbs information in corporate and government databases, and increasingly data on the Web or data streams from sensors on things as diverse as food shipments to cellphones. The software can help look for developing trends in markets or patterns of behavior. I.B.M. and SPSS are already partners, and they use the predictive software on projects like identifying emerging crime “hot spots” for law enforcement and monitoring patient health records to find people who are most likely to develop chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease.“The opportunity is to move from sense-and-respond decision-making to a predict-and-act model,” said Ambuj Goyal, a computer scientist who is the general manager of I.B.M.’s information management business.Joining I.B.M., said Jack Noonan, chief executive of SPSS, which is based in Chicago and has 1,200 employees, will speed the adoption of his company’s technology, given Big Blue’s global marketing reach and deep pockets for investment.I.B.M.’s $50-a-share cash offer is a premium of more than 40 percent over SPSS’s closing stock price on Monday. And SPSS shares jumped in step with the offer in trading on Tuesday, closing at $49.45, up $14.36.“None of the consolidation purchases we’ve seen in the business intelligence industry have been fire sales,” said Jim Davis, senior vice president of the SAS Institute, a private company based in Cary, N.C., that is the largest supplier of business intelligence and predictive analytics software.The growing appeal of the sector, Mr. Davis said, reflects the increasing pressure by the senior management of corporations for “tighter, fact-based decision making, especially in this economy.”Other independent analytics software makers may well become takeover targets, said Mr. Evelson of Forrester. Among the candidates, he said, are Accelrys, Applied Predictive Technologies, Genalytics, InforSense, KXEN and ThinkAnalytics.The broad consolidation wave in business intelligence software, analysts say, will bring increasing price pressure on some segments of the industry as major companies seek to increase their share of the market. And the open-source programming language for data analysis, R, is another source of price pressure on software suppliers.The most price pressure, analysts predict, will be on the presentation layers, or software dashboards, for users and on more basic reporting and analysis functions. Yet the field, they said, will afford ample opportunity for tailored offerings and growing demand for skilled data analysts.“Building business intelligence and predictive models is very hard work,” Mr. Evelson said. “The software can automate some things, but it’s still going to require an army of experts to write the algorithms, who know particular businesses and markets, to tune and tweak the technology and really make it work.”I.B.M. certainly seems to recognize that need by making a big investment in data-analysis services as well as software. In April, the company created a new Business Analytics and Optimization Services group that will tap the expertise of the more than 200 scientists in its research labs, and I.B.M. plans to retrain or hire 4,000 more data analysts across the company.'"

"'09-07-30,'1','LOS ANGELES — The owner of an embroidery and printing business sued California’s controller and treasurer on Wednesday, saying they had violated state and federal law by issuing hundreds of thousands of i.o.u.’s since July 2 to vendors like herself with no immediate prospect that they could be cashed.The suit, which seeks certification as a class action on behalf of all affected vendors, was filed in the Federal District Court in San Francisco. It demands that California stop issuing the i.o.u.’s, or registered warrants, and redeem all those it has dispensed.“I’ve never seen a state behave in such a cavalier manner to the people that provide goods and services that enable it to operate,” said William M. Audet, the lawyer for the plaintiff. “The state is forcing people to accept these pieces of paper and pay taxes on them. Small businesses are closing, and more will close by the time the state redeems these warrants.”The plaintiff, Nancy Baird, said she would have to shut her business if California did not quickly redeem her $27,752.16 i.o.u., the payment given her for polo shirts and uniforms supplied to a state-run youth camp. Her bank would not accept the warrant, she said, because she had had an account there only nine months.Tom Dresslar, a spokesman for State Treasurer Bill Lockyer, said Mr. Lockyer “understands the frustration felt by i.o.u. recipients and feels bad about the hardship they’ve suffered.” But, Mr. Dresslar said, the state’s process for issuing and redeeming the warrants “meets all legal and constitutional requirements.”'"

Revenue was down 20 percent, to $402 million from $504 million.“We have performed well in these turbulent markets,” Mr. Wasserstein, Lazard’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Although the markets may continue to be erratic and the general economy may lag, we feel it is the end of the beginning of the stabilization of the financial sector.”The firm’s strongest gains were in its restructuring advisory business, which reported $93.2 million in revenue for the quarter, nearly three times what it pulled in for the same time period last year and 53 percent more than in the first quarter.'"

"'09-07-30,'1','The pheromone of choice for men is a family of , related to , found near the axillary glands in the underarm area. For women, a commonly used compound is estratetraenol, a derivative of the sex hormone estradiol. (The patents of these synthesized hormones are proprietary, and when asked, the makers would not reveal their ingredients.)But does adding synthetic pheromones truly evoke that elusive Love Potion No. 9?“There has been a lot of misconception about what human pheromones do,” said Dr. Charles Wysocki, a behavioral neuroscientist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in and an author of “Human Pheromones: What’s Purported, What’s Supported,” a recently published report commissioned by the Sense of Smell Institute, a branch of the Fragrance Foundation. “We want to raise a flag and say, where’s the evidence? How human pheromones work is still totally questionable.”Identified by American scientists in 1959, pheromones are believed to be part of a chemical communication system that signals reproductive readiness and affects other animal behaviors.“For humans, though, it’s usually love at first sight, not love at first smell,” said Dr. Helen Fisher, a biological . “There are many factors to sex appeal, and romance and scent is among them. But from studying the brain, I would argue that our brains are largely built for visual stimuli.”While Dr. Fisher believes pheromones may not initially be an aphrodisiac, someone’s scent can certainly be a turnoff, or a turn-on, once courtship has been established, she said.Beginning in the early 1990s, companies like in and Stone Independent Research, in , N.Y., began to create human synthesized pheromones in response to evidence from animal studies that showed a relationship between pheromones and reproduction, as well as a handful of human studies that suggested human behavior may be affected by the perception of pheromones. Pheromone-enhanced products like the fragrance line Realm by Erox were marketed, but remained mostly on the fringes of the beauty industry.Since then, other companies have signed on. Parlux, a fragrance maker in , was among the first in a recent wave of companies to use synthesized pheromones, which are among the ingredients in the signature fragrance, which came out in 2004. Urban Decay has a line of Pocket Rocket lip gloss with synthesized pheromones embedded into the ink on the lip gloss dispensers (the idea is that by merely handling the dispenser, you’re releasing pheromones into the air), and Marilyn Miglin’s earthy Sixth Sense fragrance is due out this month.James Kohl, an independent clinical laboratory scientist who has written on pheromones and is in partnership with to sell fragrances, said he believes the additives enhance one’s natural scent. “I put it right up there with makeup to enhance visual appeal,” Mr. Kohl said.“It gives people confidence,” said Dr. Winnifred Cutler, an author, biologist and behavioral endocrinologist who markets pheromone products through her Athena Institute in .But whether or not someone can boost their confidence wearing synthesized pheromones or inspire someone else’s still remains a scientific mystery.“We do know there are several types of pheromones,” said Dr. Wysocki of the Monell Chemical Senses Center. “Modulator pheromones have shown us, for example, when women are exposed to certain male underarm compounds, they become less tense, more relaxed,” he said. He added, however, that what beauty and personal-care companies are trying to market “is a releaser pheromone that has been equated with being a sexual attractant, and we just don’t know enough about them.”'"
"'09-07-30,'1','MADRID — Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero said Wednesday that Spain was willing to increase its troops on long-term assignment in Afghanistan, in what appeared to be a gesture of support to the Obama administration.Spain’s Socialist government has long resisted calls from the United States and other NATO allies to increase its Afghan force.Mr. Zapatero said the move could be achieved by prolonging a temporary deployment of forces that had been sent to help with security in Afghanistan ahead of the Aug. 20 presidential election.“We’ve always been willing to provide additional troops in order to support elections, as we are doing currently,” Mr. Zapatero said in an interview in his office in the Moncloa Palace here. “And if there is the need to sustain a greater number of presences in Afghanistan, we are willing to do so.”Spain, which is to assume the rotating presidency of the European Union in January, has about 800 troops in Afghanistan, mostly in Herat and Badghis Provinces, in the country’s northwest. It recently sent an additional contingent of 450 soldiers to provide extra security before the election.'"
"'09-07-30,'1','“There has never been a better time in Louisiana for the creative class to thrive,” said Mitchell J. Landrieu, the state’s lieutenant governor.Jon Guidroz, 27, is one of the entrepreneurs who was persuaded to move to the city. He grew up in New Orleans but was living in Massachusetts and working for Free Flow Power, a renewable energy company, after Katrina hit. “I wanted to return to help,” he said. But he said he did not see a strong business reason to move.Then, last year, Sean Cummings, a real estate developer and entrepreneur in New Orleans, randomly found Free Flow’s Web site and noticed that the company had a Mississippi River project in the works. Mr. Cummings, 44, a co-founder of a group called Startup New Orleans, invited Mr. Guidroz to visit his offices in New Orleans at 220 Camp Street, a loft building called Entrepreneur’s Row. As an extra incentive, Mr. Cummings even offered to give him six months free rent.“He helped me fulfill my dream of bringing this business to New Orleans,” said Mr. Guidroz, who moved back in January. “Until these guys rolled out the red carpet for me — immediate access to a substantial network in the city and state for getting things done, finding local investors — I don’t think we would have done it.”Entrepreneur’s Row was conceived in May 2007, when Mr. Cummings received a phone call from Nicolas Perkin, the co-founder and president of the Receivables Exchange, an electronic marketplace for the buying and selling of commercial receivables. Mr. Perkin had recently gotten married, and he and his bride wanted to relocate to New Orleans from New York. What did Mr. Cummings think?Mr. Cummings thought it was a great idea, and the two men set about figuring out how to attract other entrepreneurs to the city. “To really prosper, New Orleans must focus on the few opportunities where we have a compelling competitive advantage,” Mr. Cummings said. “We must likewise recruit entrepreneurs who are drawn to a joyful quality of life. It’s a home-run success story. Entrepreneurs are reinventing New Orleans, like Prague after the curtain, like Milan, like a smaller Seattle.”Along with three other business executives, Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin came up with Startup New Orleans, a Web-based information service to connect entrepreneurs with the resources they need to set up a new business. In March 2008, Mr. Cummings established Entrepreneur’s Row. Today, it is home to nine companies, including the Receivables Exchange; Mr. Guidroz’s company Free Flow Power; and Audiosocket, a music licensor. (Mr. Cummings has a financial stake in at least six of the companies.)The Icehouse — a 12,000-square-foot, renovated warehouse in the Seventh Ward, which was severely damaged by Katrina — opened in April 2008 and now houses seven businesses. They each pay $600 a desk each month, which covers a phone with private number, high-speed Internet, a kitchen and a rooftop deck access.“One of the things we wanted to do post-Katrina was to make sure that our footprint had maximum impact,” said Robbie Vitrano, president of Trumpet, a branding and business development firm that is managing the building. “We wanted to be in a neighborhood that was redeveloping.” Mr. Vitrano, 45, is also a co-founder of Startup New Orleans.Earlier this year, the Idea Village and Greater New Orleans Inc. refurbished an 85,000-square-foot building at 643 Magazine Street in the warehouse district and called it the I.P. (Intellectual Property). It has nine tenants, including TurboSquid, a 3-D modeling company; TJ Ebbert and Associates, a disaster management consulting firm; and Carrollton Technology Partners, a technology development company. The building has a cafe, a gym with his and her saunas, business concierge desk and multiple “brainstorm rooms.”Part of the appeal is that New Orleans is, perhaps, the ultimate college campus for adults. After work, many of the young businesspeople gather for drinks at International House, the boutique hotel in the central business district that Mr. Cummings opened 10 years ago across the street from his loft building. Mr. Cummings and Mr. Perkin also hold monthly meetings at the hotel in which business owners can share war stories and vent.“The thing about this city, like no other — everybody wants everyone to succeed,” said Seema Sudan, the owner and director of design at the knitwear company LiaMolly, who moved to New Orleans in October 2007. “I have never been in a place that is so community-oriented,” she said. “Competitive gets you nowhere. It’s about being collaborative. And this city is so like that, from the people helping each other rebuild their homes to building businesses.”She said she also appreciated the quality of life, and the fact that she paid $800 for a 900-square-foot studio in the Garden District, and $1,800 for a three-bedroom apartment with a yard and tree house.Two years into his project, Mr. Cummings remains enthusiastic.“I am blown away by the caliber of talent,” he said. “It’s a thriving creative culture of invention. And it is growing every day.”'"
"'09-07-30,'1','Visa, the electronic payment network, said on Wednesday that its fiscal third-quarter profit jumped 72 percent, as recent cost-cutting helped offset declining payment processing volume.The company reported net income of $729 million, or 97 cents a share, for the three months ended June 30. That compares with a profit of $422 million, or 51 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items such as the sale of an interest in a Brazilian venture, Visa’s adjusted quarterly profit was $507 million, or 67 cents a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 67 cents a share excluding one-time items.Visa’s revenue rose 2 percent, to nearly $1.65 billion, slightly above analysts’ forecast of about $1.64 billion.Visa said operating expenses fell nearly 15 percent, to $824 million in the latest quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the decline in operating expenses was 9 percent.'"
"'09-07-30,'1','The American Express Company paid the Treasury Department $340 million Wednesday to redeem warrants to buy its stock, allowing it to fully escape the government’s bank bailout program.The credit card and travel services company joins Goldman Sachs Group, U.S. Bancorp, BB&T and State Street Corporation among large financial companies to buy back warrants issued under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program.JPMorgan Chase decided to let the government auction its warrants rather than pay a price it thought was inflated.American Express last month bought back $3.39 billion of preferred shares it had issued the government. The warrants would have let the government buy 24.3 million shares.Linus Wilson, an assistant finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who has monitored warrant repurchases, said the $340 million repurchase price was in line with the $1.1 billion that Goldman paid to buy back its warrants, after repaying $10 billion of bailout money.“It seems that Congressional pressure has significantly stiffened the negotiation stance of the U.S. Treasury,” Mr. Wilson said in an e-mail message.'"
"'09-07-30,'1','Still, there are realists. Nationally, betting handle decreased 16.9 percent in June compared with 2008, according to Equibase, and wagering is down 10.5 percent for the first half of 2009, compared with that period last year.Purses have dropped nearly 7 percent in the same time frame, which has prompted NYRA to be more innovative. It started an incentive program for trainers to get their horses out of the barn and into races.In dirt races at nine furlongs or farther, for example, the prize money will increase $4,000 to $8,000 per horse above six betting interests, depending on the level of the race.“It’s pretty straightforward: the more horses in the race, the more people bet and the bigger the purses become,” said Harold G. Handel, NYRA’s executive vice president and chief operating officer.This more-for-everyone theory was on display with the five turf races, which typically draw the largest fields, that were featured on opening day. Last summer, the first three weeks were essentially rained out as 35 races were taken off the turf, prompting a 10.3 percent drop in betting.Even though the Kentucky Derby champion Mine That Bird and the Preakness winner Rachel Alexandra will miss the $500,000 Jim Dandy Stakes on Saturday, the Spa offers the finest summer stakes racing in the nation.Over the next six weeks, 34 graded stakes, 14 of them prestigious Grade I races, will be contested. The Travers Stakes, known as the Midsummer Derby, will be run Aug. 29. The owners of Mine That Bird intend to run him in the Travers as long as he emerges healthy from the $750,000 West Virginia Derby on Saturday.Saratoga’s stakes schedule began Wednesday with the Grade III Schuylerville, a six-furlong race won by Hot Dixie Chick, whose trainer, Steve Asmussen, also has the superfilly Rachel Alexandra in his barn.Jess Jackson, Rachel Alexandra’s owner, has not ruled out bringing her here for the Alabama Stakes for fillies or for the Travers, where she would run against the boys again. She is facing the Belmont Stakes winner Summer Bird, who also is aiming for the Travers, in the $1.25 million Haskell Invitational on Sunday at Monmouth Park.“A large part of me wants her to be there, but we will have to see how she comes out,” Jackson said of Saratoga. “I would like to see her run there. If she comes out of the race well, we will consider a race there and the alternatives.”The prospect of a Travers featuring the three winners of this year’s Triple Crown races thrills horsemen and horseplayers alike.“Those are three very classy 3-year-olds, and it would make for a spectacular race,” the trainer Nick Zito said. “Those horses are owned by owners who want to do right by the sport.”If all three show up, it would be the first time three winners of the classics met here since 1982, when Gato del Sol (Derby), Aloma’s Ruler (Preakness) and Conquistador Cielo (Belmont) ran in the Travers.Chip Woolley, Mine That Bird’s trainer, is hoping to see Rachel Alexandra here in late August.“I would have loved to run Mine That Bird in the Haskell,” he said. “There’s a lot of money there, a lot of prestige. But the problem is that if you’re not within five or six lengths of the lead early at Monmouth, you have no chance. My horse is always going to be 15 to 20 lengths out of it early on.”Along with hope, a whole lot of luck is needed to keep an old sport healthy. The horseplayers are hoping for sunny skies at the old Spa and wishing that Mine That Bird, Rachel Alexandra and Summer Bird come out of the weekend races healthy and able to make the Travers a Midsummer Derby to remember.'"
"'09-07-30,'1','The Microsoft-Yahoo pact represents a pragmatic division of duties between the two companies, instead of the blockbuster deal Microsoft, No. 3 in the search market, was shooting for last year when it bid $47.5 billion to buy Yahoo, No. 2 in search.That hostile offer was ultimately withdrawn by Microsoft, and its collapse led to lots of soul-searching at Yahoo and the replacement of its co-founder with an outsider, , in the chief executive role.Under the pact, Microsoft will provide the underlying search technology on Yahoo’s popular Web sites. The deal will give a lift to Microsoft’s search engine, which it recently overhauled and renamed Bing. Its search ads will have broader reach and become more lucrative.Bing, which tries to put search results in better context than rivals, has won praise and favorable reviews, after Microsoft spent years falling farther and farther behind Google in search.For Yahoo, the move furthers the strategy under Ms. Bartz to focus the company on its strengths as a publisher of Web media sites in areas like finance and sports, as a marketer and leader in online display advertising.“This deal allows Yahoo to invest in what we should be investing in for the future — audience properties, display advertising and the mobile Internet experience,” Ms. Bartz said in an interview on Wednesday. “Our vision is to be the center of people’s lives online.”The terms of the 10-year agreement give Microsoft access to Yahoo’s search technologies. Yahoo will receive a lucrative 88 percent of the search-generated ad revenue from its own sites for the first five years of the deal, much higher than is standard in the industry.After the takeover bid failed, the companies renewed talks about a partnership last summer. The talks included discussion of a large upfront payment from Microsoft.But when Ms. Bartz joined Yahoo at the start of this year, the interest on the Yahoo side shifted. Ms. Bartz was more interested in steady revenue to ensure the longer-term financial health of Yahoo instead of a big payment, she said in a conference call Wednesday.Shares of Yahoo fell 12 percent, to $15.14, after the deal was announced, apparently reflecting investors’ disappointment in the lack of a payment. Shares of Microsoft rose slightly.“It feels kind of like a stab in the chest,” said Darren Chervitz, the co-manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owns about 100,000 shares of Yahoo. “It certainly feels like Yahoo is giving away their strong and hard-fought share of the search market for really a modest price.”Now, Yahoo’s financial fate will be inextricably linked with Microsoft for years. “My sense is that Yahoo will regret making this move,” Mr. Chervitz said.If the deal is completed next year as planned, and after the partnership is fully in place in three years, Yahoo estimates that its operating income will increase by $500 million a year, based on the anticipated higher search traffic and ad revenue, and a substantial drop in its in technology development., Microsoft’s chief executive, said in an interview that Ms. Bartz had driven a hard bargain. he said, “she got 88 percent of the revenue and none of the cost.”Still, Mr. Ballmer added that he won something he badly wanted as well: “I got an opportunity to swing for the fences in search.”The crucial issue for the partnership, analysts say, is its ability to stop and reverse the advance of Google, which has steadily gained in search and search ad share in the last few years while Yahoo and Microsoft have kept on fading. Reversing the trend, they say, would give the partnership newfound credibility with advertisers and publishers.“If Microsoft and Yahoo are 30 percent and growing in search, then the dynamics of the market can shift,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School.Mr. Fader of Wharton said he was not sure the partners would be able to shake up the business. “Microsoft is buying some market share, but there is no evidence they are going to change the game in any fundamental way,” he said. “What the Microsoft-Yahoo partnership needs is real breakthroughs to deliver disruptive innovation in search.”Advertisers and Web publishers say they will be looking to the combination to improve its search technology and service and put more pricing pressure on Google, which has turned the small text ads that appear next to search results into a multibillion-dollar business.“It could be a more competitive marketplace, but that’s not certain,” said Bob Liodice, president of the , a trade group. “Google still holds two-thirds of the market.”Branding was one important consideration in the deal. Yahoo will still control the look of the search features on its sites and will determine how search technology may be tailored differently for, say, entertainment and finance sites. But Yahoo’s search will include a logo saying “Powered by Bing.”And Yahoo will be able to tap into records of searches for its own purposes, like monitoring the online behavior of anonymous users to more efficiently place online display advertisements.Throughout a conference call and the later interviews, Ms. Bartz and Mr. Ballmer emphasized that combining the No. 2 and No. 3 companies in search would not harm competition but enhance it. Google was rarely mentioned by name, but it was the subtext of the conversation and the deal itself.Ms. Bartz pointedly said the partnership would “put choice back in the hands of consumers, advertisers and publishers,” all of whom, she said, were “increasingly concerned” about the rising power of Google.Microsoft and Yahoo said they expected resistance from Google. But Microsoft’s general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, said he looked forward to explaining the details of the planned partnership to antitrust officials in and .“There is a compelling case that this is going to increase competition,” Mr. Smith said.The Microsoft-Yahoo stance, legal analysts noted, amounts to the assertion that Google is so dominant in Internet search and search advertising that the best way to foster competition and innovation is with a duopoly — with the Microsoft-Yahoo partnership creating a credible rival to Google.That position, legal experts say, will take some skillful persuasion, since antitrust regulators typically oppose the creation of duopolies. But Yahoo, they say, is likely to contend that it could not afford to keep up in the technology arms race against Google, unlike Microsoft, and that Yahoo’s greatest chance for commercial success lies in focusing on being a Web media portal.“That is a pretty strong story, and I suspect the one they will present to the Justice Department,” said Andrew I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University.'"

"'09-07-31,'1','Exxon Mobil’s second-quarter earnings drop was not surprising considering the recent plunge in oil prices. But the extent of the earnings decline at Exxon, the West’s biggest company, hints at a longer-term conundrum for the oil giant and its private sector rivals. Oil is getting much harder to find and costlier to extract, and that won’t change.Exxon’s earnings fell 66 percent from a year earlier, while revenue slid 46 percent. The problem, however, is that the company — so revered in the industry for tight cost control — failed to produce a corresponding reduction in the expense line, which fell just 42 percent.This is partly explained by Exxon’s capital spending. While down 6 percent in the quarter from a year earlier, so far this year the company has spent about as much as it did in the first half of last year to discover new hydrocarbon sources. That gets to the heart of Exxon’s long-term strategic challenge.Governments are increasingly guarding their fossil fuels for the home team. At the same time, rivals like PetroChina — whose $385 billion market cap trumps Exxon’s $345 billion — have become more competitive in bidding for assets around the world. This reduces the potential profit margins in existing oil-producing regions, while requiring the majors to operate in difficult new places.To wit, Exxon’s production fell 3.3 percent, to 3.68 million barrels of oil equivalent a day. The only places where it reported significant increases in production were in the United States, Africa and Russia. In the United States, that has meant pursuing costly sources like deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, and, of course, aggressive lobbying to expand offshore drilling. In addition, the rising dependence on Africa and Russia exposes Exxon shareholders to greater political risk.'"

"'09-07-31,'1','Perhaps it means that if an asterisk sticks to one group of champions, it could also apply to all. And if every great team of an era has an asterisk, what is the point of the asterisk, anyway?“This makes me laugh,” the former Red Sox ace wrote on his blog, . “I have already seen the bandwagon fans start the *04 and *07 threads and remarks, people with teams who are far deeper into this than most other teams — as if this makes it all O.K. Every team going back 10-15 years needs an * if you want to consider giving it to anyone.”Schilling has spoken out against use — though he famously went quiet before Congress in 2005 — and Damon insisted his name could not have been on the 2003 list. “It better not be on it, or there’s going to be lawsuits,” Damon said.Damon mentioned himself, Schilling, Derek Lowe and Pedro Martinez as other important contributors to the Red Sox then, but he seemed interested to know just how many of his teammates were doping. The more names, he suggested, the less weight the championship carries.History may be kinder, and may side more with Schilling, who played in two other World Series, for the 1993 and the 2001 champion . Both rosters were also dotted with steroid suspects.Some have doubted the validity of the Yankees teams that included , , and Jason Grimsley, who appeared in the 2007 report by , the former Senate majority leader, on steroids in baseball. The report named few players on the Red Sox, a team for which Mitchell is a paid adviser to the ownership group. ( Company is a minority owner of the team.)But was not meant to be comprehensive, and he stated in it that players from all teams were found to have used drugs. Among his primary sources were Kirk Radomski and , both based in New York.“Common sense tells us every team in baseball had steroid users during that era,” said , who was here to broadcast the Thursday night Yankees- game for MLB Network. “Those that appeared in the Mitchell report by and large came from teams and circumstances where Mitchell and his staff had sources, and they didn’t have equal sources in every big-league city.”Costas continued: “ didn’t win anything during that period of time, and it’s pretty clear that Texas might have led the league in massive steroid use. So I don’t know how you evaluate or devalue championships during that period of time.”The players on Thursday seemed weary of the issue, the way it continues to monopolize attention whenever a new name is revealed. Yankees Manager , who won three championships as a catcher for the team, compared it to a Band-Aid slowly peeling off the skin.“Names just keep coming out,” said the Yankees’ , who is active in the players association. “I agree with everyone else and say, ‘Get it all out.’ It’s ridiculous. Let everybody deal with the issue at the same time, because every two months things come out, and it’s not good for the game. It happened in 2003.

The controversy must not obscure Mr. Obama’s real goal: nudging Israel and the into serious peace negotiations.Mr. Obama and his negotiator, George Mitchell, have focused on settlements after prying loose a commitment — highly caveated — from Prime Minister to a two-state solution. The Palestinians insist they won’t return to talks until all construction halts. The Americans have decided that a freeze is needed to show Palestinians and other Arabs that Israel’s conservative government is serious about peace.Less visibly, but we hope just as assertively, the administration is pressing the Palestinians and other Arab leaders to take concrete steps to demonstrate their commitment to a peace deal. Those must clearly contribute to Israel’s sense of security.Unless all sides deliver — the Palestinians, Arabs and Israelis — Mr. Obama’s credibility and the credibility of the peace process will be undermined.The ultimate question of who controls which land will have to be resolved at the peace table with border negotiations and land swaps.

"'09-07-31,'1','The association, a collective of riders and action sports industry figures, was formed almost six months ago after the death of Jeremy Lusk, 24, a top freestyle rider who won a gold medal at the 2008 X Games.Lusk, of Temecula, Calif., died Feb. 9 after he crashed while attempting a Hart Attack back flip at a competition in San José, Costa Rica. Lusk failed to fully rotate while soaring more than 20 feet above the ground, landing on his front tire and crashing face-first into the dirt. He sustained severe head injuries and died three days later.Riders say they believe he is the only professional to have died in competition.Horrible crashes are part of the game in freestyle motocross. Brian Deegan, who has won more X Games medals in freestyle motocross than any other rider, lost a kidney — and nearly his life — after a crash in 2005 while filming a jump for a television program. He attributed the crash to windy conditions. He also said wind and a lack of adequate practice time were factors in Lusk’s fatal crash.While mourning his friend in a Costa Rica hotel room last winter, Deegan hatched the idea of the American Freestyle Motocross Association. In addition to coordinating medical care, the association intends to create a unified voice to address safety at professional and recreational events and demonstrations.“The sport of freestyle motocross is only 10 years old,” said Deegan, 34, who runs a freestyle team through his clothing brand, Metal Mulisha. “There’s so much money being thrown at it, but the riders are still on their own. There’s no voice for them.”An offshoot of motocross, freestyle developed during the 1990s in Southern California when racers took to the hills to pull maneuvers while launching through the air. Soon small-scale competitions were organized. When freestyle made its debut at the 1999 X Games, the sport exploded in popularity.Still, freestyle remained largely unorganized, with riders competing as independent contractors around the world.Past attempts to unify failed, in part because of aggressive negotiating tactics by some athletes. Those efforts rankled promoters and cost athletes opportunities and money in a sport where many events are invitational. “At this point we’re going against the fact that a lot of people have tried and failed,” Deegan said.The association hopes to build its membership through corporate sponsors and membership from professionals and recreational riders through its Web site, www.afmxa.com, while working with promoters.Tim Reed, the senior director of sports and competition for the X Games at ESPN, said network officials believed that “we feel we have the proper stuff in place to make the athletes safe” at events like the X Games, like safe courses and proper medical care. But he said the association could help improve standards at smaller and newer events.Travis Pastrana, who will compete Friday in the Moto X Best Trick event at the X Games, said a group like the freestyle association was not necessarily needed for the large, televised events, but was for smaller operations, where up-and-coming riders are pushing to prove themselves.“This is a sanctioning body for the younger guys, who don’t have as much pull, and are afraid to speak up,” he said. “I think it’s a good time.”At the 2007 X Games, Pastrana landed the first double back flip, leading to an exponential progression in tricks’ risk factor.“It’s become more dangerous with people pushing the bar for the level of tricks that are being thrown now,” said Toby Bost, a member of the freestyle association’s board. “Somebody does a double back flip and then it’s, well, one-up that. Not only has it been dangerous, but it’s becoming more and more dangerous and that’s where we fit in.”Bost is chief executive of the La Jolla Group, a licensing company for several prominent action sports brands. His involvement, along with that of an ESPN executive and two doctors on the freestyle association’s advisory board, should give the association the kind of credibility previous efforts have lacked.The successful response to Sinclair’s injury, which occurred at one of the sport’s largest events — a Red Bull X-Fighters tour stop — has already demonstrated that the association can get things done.“This is an example of what can go wrong,” Bailey said about Sinclair’s crash. “But this is a success story.”Two years after he made television highlights with a 45-foot fall from the mega ramp, Jake Brown of Australia won the gold medal in skateboard Big Air as the X Games opened. Brown and Bob Burnquist, the two time-defending champion, tied with a score of 94.0, but Brown won a tie breaker.'"

Judge DeLaughter became well known in the 1990s after he helped prosecute Byron De La Beckwith for the 1963 sniper killing of Medgar Evers. He is accused of giving an unfair advantage to Richard F.

"'09-07-31,'1','The jury agreed with five of the eight plaintiffs that the town had failed to offer them opportunities for promotion or premium-pay assignments. The five are Terral Hardy, John Rodriguez, Scott Johnson, Carlos Franco and John Woodward. Each of them received $5,000 in addition to their damage awards to compensate them for emotional distress.The jury also made further damage awards to Officers Franco and Woodward, finding that they faced hostile work environments.Three plaintiffs, Robert Brown, Vincent O’Banner and Anthony Cameron, did not prevail on any ground. The jury also rejected a claim that the town had allowed the rankings from a promotional exam to expire in an effort to deny one plaintiff a promotion.All eight officers continue to work as police officers in Greenwich and four of them have moved on to better assignments since the suit was filed.“The case was never about money,” said Lewis Chimes, their lawyer. “They’re all still working there and the economic damages were not that high. I think the case was about vindication, and if you combine the money with the fact that after we filed, four out of the eight of them were promoted, that’s a really good outcome.”“It was about change,” he added. “So I think our clients by and large are very satisfied.”A lawyer for Greenwich, John Wayne Fox, said the jury’s “compromise verdict” was less harsh than it could have been.“Now, obviously, we are not pleased in any scenario where there is a finding that there was a failure to promote because of race-related issues,” Mr. Fox said. “So we’re not happy with that. But there were other aspects where the jury found no wrongdoing. So I look at it as a case where the jury listened attentively and had sympathy for some of these individuals and felt they were treated in a manner that was unfair and gave them what I consider to be reasonable damages.”Judge Kravitz will have to decide whether the town will also pay the plaintiffs’ legal fees, likely to exceed $900,000.The plaintiffs seemed to score points in arguing that their supervisors tolerated offensive comments and did little when complaints landed at their feet.In one instance in 2005, town officials were alerted that an officer had circulated a racially offensive video in an e-mail message while assigned to a federal task force. Mr. Fox said the officer was not under the department’s command at the time.In another instance, the eight officers argued, the town responded lackadaisically to a 1998 civilian complaint lodged against a police sergeant by a neighbor, who claimed that the officer had referred to the neighbor’s children using a racial slur and threatened to shoot them.The town’s insurance policies require it to pay the first $1 million of defense costs or damages, and it has already spent $690,000 on legal fees, Mr. Fox said.'"

"'09-07-31,'1','For their first training camp under Coach Rex Ryan, the Jets arrived in Cortland, N.Y., on Thursday with only one of their two disgruntled running backs. Thomas Jones, the leading rusher in the American Football Conference last season, reported, but Leon Washington, who is closing in on a new contract, did not.Both players skipped some voluntary practices this off-season to express displeasure with their contracts. Jones, who made $13.1 million the past two seasons but is scheduled to make $900,000 this year, is unlikely to receive a restructured deal.Washington, who is in the final year of his rookie contract and due $535,000, will probably receive a deal soon. His agent, Alvin Keels, has visited the Jets in recent days, trying to finish an extension. The team begins two-a-day practices Friday, and Washington will be subject to fines for each missed day.“Right now, he is not here,” Ryan said. “Everyone knows that Leon is a huge member of this football team. Obviously, we want Leon here.”Washington’s absence was not the only news as the Jets began their first training camp held outside Hofstra University on Long Island in four decades. Ryan also said that Kellen Clemens, who is competing with the rookie Mark Sanchez to start at quarterback, will enter the “open competition” in the top spot on the depth chart.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','That Merial-Intervet venture, if it can win approval from antitrust authorities in the United States and Europe, would create the world leader in medications and vaccines for animals.“It will be the No. 1 animal health company,” said Tim Evans, the managing director of Vetnosis, a research and consulting firm in Edinburgh, Scotland, that specializes in animal health and veterinary medicine. The combined business would have nearly 30 percent of the worldwide animal health market, he said.For drug makers, animal health products offer strong growth potential, with global sales rising 7.2 percent last year, to $19.2 billion, Mr. Evans said. By contrast, sales of human prescription drugs in the United States grew 1.3 percent, to $291 billion, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.Animal health has always been a natural fit for pharmaceutical companies, both in terms of product development and manufacturing. And now, with an increased worldwide demand for protein from farmed livestock, and concerns over a safe food supply, animal vaccines have become a more important asset for drug companies.Moreover, because there are no insurers or national health officials trying to keep costs down, companies can set their own prices for animal medicines — products that are bought directly by veterinarians and the owners of pets or livestock.Animal health products “were traditionally the stepchild of the pharmaceutical industry because they had lower margins,” said David S. Moskowitz, chief of equity research at Caris & Company. “Now they are the crown jewels, because they are growing faster than traditional pharmaceuticals.”As part of the option agreement, the value of Merial has been fixed at $8 billion. Merck’s contribution of Intervet to the joint venture would be valued at a minimum of $9.25 billion. If the companies were to join Merial and Intervet, Sanofi would make a payment to create an equal ownership stake.Industry analysts are also examining another potential animal health juggernaut, this one that would result from the impending merger of Pfizer with Wyeth. Pfizer’s animal health business had sales last year of about $2.8 billion, while Wyeth had worldwide sales of animal health products of about $1 billion. Pfizer has said it plans to divest some animal health assets to gain regulatory approval for the Wyeth merger.Even so, the potential Merial-Intervet joint venture, considered along with the combined Pfizer and Wyeth businesses, would account for half of global animal health sales, said Mr. Evans of Vetnosis. “The animal health industry will be highly concentrated with two behemoths, and the other players will be relatively small,” he said.Bayer, with annual sales in animal health of about $1.3 billion, for example, would then become the No. 3 player in the market, he said, but at less than one-quarter the size of a combined Merial-Intervet. “With such a highly concentrated market, it is going to be very difficult for other players.”'"
"'09-07-31,'1','In the past month, the government has allowed fishermen to fish in 12-hour shifts here and has allowed fishing to resume in other previously restricted coastal areas.Fishing is at the heart of the economic and cultural life of this region, indeed of much of coastal Sri Lanka, and its return is being celebrated in the north and east.“When people here cannot fish they feel as if they are not living,” said T. T. R. de Silva, the top central government official here.The rapid rebound of the fishing industry here mirrors a broader rebirth under way, one that gives people in Sri Lanka a tantalizing morsel of how prosperous postwar life could be.In Sri Lanka, with its lush tea plantations, miles of pristine beaches, rolling farmland and deep water harbors, the economy is waiting to be unleashed, government officials and business leaders say. Nowhere is that truer than in the war-scarred east and north of the country.In 1981 the Eastern Province accounted for 11 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. In 2006 it contributed only 4 percent, said Palitha T. B. Kohona, Sri Lanka’s foreign secretary, who has been trying to drum up investment in the formerly war-torn parts of the country.“The potential here is just enormous,” he said. “There is nowhere to go but up.”Sri Lanka’s economy has grown at a relatively good clip despite nearly three decades of war, averaging about 6 percent annually in the past four years.But winning the war, which required an army of about 200,000 men and huge expenditures on arms, has left the government’s coffers almost empty. After weeks of wrangling, the International Monetary Fund has agreed to help Sri Lanka with a $2.6 billion line of credit, despite objections from some Western countries concerned about the government’s human rights record.In the last weeks of the war thousands of Tamil civilians died in a narrow strip of land where they were stuck, along with Tamil Tiger fighters. The government says it did not intentionally attack civilians, but human rights organizations have called for an independent investigation. The government has vehemently opposed such an inquiry.Here in Trincomalee, hopes for a large peace dividend are high.“The war is over,” said D. H. Podimahathaya, a 43-year-old fisherman who has seen his income plummet because of restrictions on fishing in Trincomalee harbor. “Everyone suffered a lot. Now we need money.”Mr. Podimahathaya’s family has been fishing for generations, and the restrictions hit them hard.“Our whole family depends on fishing,” he said. “At some times we didn’t have anything to eat. But now the situation is improving.”Muthumala Gunadasa, a wizened 57-year-old fisherman, said the war had forced three of his brothers to migrate to the south, despite the fact that the fishing here is much more lucrative.“But now those who left are returning home,” he said. “Everyone wants to fish here.”But the picture in Trincomalee is not exactly postcard perfect, said R. Rajarammohan, chairman of the city’s Chamber of Commerce. The seas may be more open, but strict security measures remain on land, like the roadblocks leading from the city to the capital, Colombo, where much of Trincomalee’s daily catch is headed.“When goods and people cannot move freely, it is premature to talk about an economic turnaround,” Mr. Rajarammohan said. “If the war is over, are all of these measures really necessary?”Indeed, the journey from Trincomalee to Colombo, just 160 miles, can take more than eight hours. Soldiers stop motorists more than a dozen times, and at one major checkpoint passengers must get out of their vehicles and have their cargo searched.Government officials say that these precautions are necessary because Tamil rebels may remain hidden in the north and east. The rebels have used women and children as suicide bombers in the past, so almost anyone could be a suspect, Mr. de Silva said.“We cannot be too careful,” he said. “The war only just ended.”Fishermen here are glad to be back out on the water, but they say they are looking forward to the day when they can fish anytime they like. At the moment they can go out for only 12 hours at a time, and they can use only small outboard motors, which limits the size of their catch.“There is so much demand, but we can’t meet it,” said a 62-year-old fisherman named Siripala. “One day, we hope to be free to fish without fear.”'"
"'09-07-31,'1','“In fact,” he concludes, “the real, the ultimate temptation would be to stop everything, lie down, listen to the beat of my heart and quietly wait for it to stop.”Such thoughts must be fleeting for this remarkable pianist, now 40. Mr. Anderszewski (pronounced ahn-der-SHEV-skee) is in New York to play Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 18 in B flat on Friday and Saturday night with the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra, conducted by the young British conductor Edward Gardner, at Avery Fisher Hall.Mr. Anderszewski’s appearances at the festival began late Wednesday night in the Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center. In a program of just over 60 minutes, he performed two Bach keyboard suites: the Partita No. 6 in E minor and the English Suite No. 6 in D minor. For all his revealing comments in the film about the cruelty of solo recitals, he mostly seemed at ease in this intimate setting, part of the festival’s Little Night Music series of concerts at 10:30 p.m., in which just over 200 concertgoers sit at tables enjoying free wine.These were typical Anderszewski performances, full of bold strokes and surprises. He played the moody prelude of the partita with an uncanny combination of rhapsodic freedom and rhythmic rigor. The Allemande had the lilt of an austere dance yet myriad articulations of touch, including punchy bass lines and dry staccato passagework. During his daringly slow, quietly intense account of the Sarabande, Mr. Anderszewski was so engrossed that you were almost afraid to listen, lest you intrude.In the English suite, he tore into the concluding Gigue, with its knotty theme that unfolds in a maze of triplets, intricate counterpoint and searching harmony. Nothing written since, not Beethoven’s Grosse Fuge, not Bartok’s Second Quartet, seemed gnarlier and more modern than this Bach movement as played here.On Saturday afternoon at the Walter Reade Theater, the festival will present the American premiere of the documentary, directed by Bruno Monsaingeon, who has made films about Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould and other musicians. Mr. Monsaingeon will introduce the 83-minute film, and a discussion with Mr. Anderszewski will follow the screening. This is the second movie Mr. Monsaingeon has made with Mr. Anderszewski. One released in 2000 documented Mr. Anderszewski’s first recording for the Virgin Classics: Beethoven’s “Diabelli Variations,” a stunningly inventive account of this monumental work.In the documentary (available as a Medici Arts DVD), Mr. Anderszewski, who speaks Polish, Hungarian, French and English in the film, is shown during a recording session, playing and conducting Beethoven’s First Piano Concerto with the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen.On the concert tour, he travels in a specially appointed train car, complete with a kitchen, a dining area and a place for his Steinway grand, which we see being lifted onto the train by movers. In one scene he hosts a New Year’s Eve dinner party on board for friends.Early in the film, right after Mr. Anderszewski’s confession about his frustrations with the pianist’s profession, he is shown in concert playing the lively Gigue from Bach’s Partita No. 1. Though he takes a brisk, nearly breathless tempo, the playing is so articulate that all the notes come through. Sometimes he really thumps out the bass notes, with clanking tone. Yet there is such zest in the playing over all that the effect is wonderfully ambiguous — like dangerous whimsy.There is something extreme in this performance, exactly the quality that gave me reservations about Mr. Anderszewski’s early work, which was unquestionably brilliant and intensely expressive but strong-willed and feisty. Maybe he has mellowed or maybe I have gained insight into his approach. But in recent years I have found almost everything he does riveting.I tend to like straightforward music-making and quickly lose patience with performers who exude expressivity, who cannot resist putting interpretive tweaks into every phrase. There is a whole repository of musical gestures that can easily resemble stock bits of histrionic acting.When an interpretive gesture in a performance comes not from the artist’s desire to demonstrate feeling for the music but from an acute perception of some element in the music, the difference is subtle yet enormous. Revelatory scenes in the documentary convey the piercing insights that account for the freedom and daring of Mr. Anderszewski’s playing.Responding to a question, he talks about the music that first marked him as a child. Of all pieces, it was Mozart’s popular string serenade “Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,” which Mr. Anderszewski remembers having heard when he was 3.He plays the opening phrase of the first movement, which is like a simple rising fanfare in unison, then explains that it was the next phrase that hooked him, the one in which the theme is more or less inverted. Playing that second phrase, Mr. Anderszewski scrunches his brow, brings a slightly veiled coloring to the notes and makes this seemingly simple music sound quizzical. For a moment he is a little boy again, instinctively alert to the strangely curious elements of music.During several scenes Mr. Anderszewski animatedly plays excerpts from Mozart’s “Magic Flute,” an opera he finds “the most extreme in its ambiguity,” with music that perfectly juxtaposes “the sad, the joyous, the luminous, the divine, the impertinent.” He plays the orchestra music on the piano, singing, sometimes grunting all the vocal parts, attentive to every quirk. During the long Act II aria in which Papageno searches for his lost Papagena, begins to despair and threatens to hang himself, Mr. Anderszewski’s one-man performance is utterly insightful and completely charming. Papageno’s despair “never lasts,” he says, grinning warmly while he plays. “It’s a ludicrous kind of despair.”In another scene, while playing a complex passage in the first movement of Chopin’s Second Piano Concerto, Mr. Anderszewski stretches out the music to expose the harmonic richness and contrapuntal intricacy in each phrase. “Everything goes too fast with Chopin,” he says, “that’s the problem.”Playing Chopin’s Barcarolle, which evokes a Venetian boat song through a long-spun melodic line floating atop an undulant accompaniment, Mr. Anderszewski says, “One thinks of a plate of macaroni.” This gondolier’s song is “like French variety music of the worst kind,” he adds, yet so beautiful.In a perceptive summation of Chopin’s artistry, Mr. Anderszewski asserts that no one expressed Poland better, “its heroism and its ravages.” Here, he says, “you have the Slavic soul in all its breadth and depth, its generosity, the expression of a whole continent extending eastward, all dressed up in an impeccably tailored French suit.”Mr. Anderszewski must have been enjoying himself at the Kaplan Penthouse on Wednesday. Between the Bach suites he gave the audience a surprise. Mr. Monsaingeon, the film director, who plays the violin and was at the recital with his instrument, joined Mr. Anderszewski in two short movements from a Bach sonata.After the concert, Mr. Anderszewski, sipping red wine, greeted people as they left, looking relieved and talking gregariously. At that moment he was indeed an unquiet traveler.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','Eastman Kodak posted disappointing second-quarter results on Thursday as weak demand hurt its film and digital photography businesses, sending its shares down 12 percent.Kodak said sales fell sharply as a global recession limited consumer spending on travel and other activities that spur the usage of cameras and snapshot printers.Kodak’s traditional film business continued to shrink, with sales falling 30 percent in the quarter, hurt in part by uncertainty over Hollywood labor talks, which have since been resolved.Kodak posted a second-quarter loss of $189 million, or 70 cents a share, compared with a profit of $495 million, or $1.72, a year earlier.Excluding special items, the loss was 43 cents a share. Analysts, on average, expected a loss of 36 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.Kodak said its gross profit margin fell to 18.5 percent, from 23.6 percent, as sales declined and intellectual property licensing royalties decreased.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','MasterCard, the world’s second-largest credit card network, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday as it cut expenses and raised fees charged to banks, sending its shares higher.“It is a question of cost control,” said Robert J. Dodd, a Morgan Keegan analyst. “Marketing and advertising expenses were much lower than I expected.”The company’s larger rival, Visa, also reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday, helped by lower expenses.But MasterCard’s chief financial officer, Robert W. Selander, said the downturn in consumer spending would make it difficult for the company to meet its target of average annual revenue growth of 12 to 15 percent during 2009-11.“We don’t expect the economic slowdown across the world will improve until sometime next year,” Mr. Selander said in a conference call with analysts.MasterCard’s second-quarter net income was $349 million, or $2.67 a share, in contrast to a loss of $747 million, or $5.70 a share, a year earlier.Profit rose 2.7 percent, to $1.3 billion, helped by higher fees charged to banks and increased consumer use of credit and debit cards. Those gains were partly offset by the appreciation of the dollar, in particular against the euro and the Brazilian real.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','REDMOND, Wash.  For 18 months, investors dissected every possible angle of a potential search and advertising deal between Microsoft and Yahoo.But when the agreement was finally announced, they failed to understand its long-term ramifications. Or at least that’s the contention of Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer.“Nobody gets it,” Mr. Ballmer said Thursday to a gathering of financial and industry analysts at Microsoft’s headquarters.On Wednesday, Microsoft and Yahoo unveiled a long-term partnership that will unite them against Google, the clear leader in Web search and online advertising. Yahoo has agreed to present Microsoft’s search engine, called Bing, to people surfing across its popular sites.Microsoft will pay for and control the costly underlying computing infrastructure needed to run the search technology, while letting Yahoo keep the vast majority of revenue produced by ads on the Yahoo sites.Yahoo’s shares have plunged since the deal was announced. The stock fell 12 percent on Wednesday and another 3.57 percent on Thursday, closing at $14.60. Meanwhile, Microsoft’s share price has held steady, reflecting the perception of investors that Microsoft got the better end of the bargain.“I was myself kind of surprised by the market reaction,” Mr. Ballmer said at the analyst meeting. “It’s a win-win deal.”Mr. Ballmer went to great lengths to explain how beneficial the deal is for Yahoo. For example, Yahoo will receive 88 percent of the revenue that comes from search ads sold on its sites. “We will not make much,” he said.Mr. Ballmer’s comments, which came during market trading Thursday, did little to stem the slide in Yahoo’s shares.Yahoo’s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz, had led investors to believe that she would demand “boatloads” of money for giving up Yahoo’s search service, which has far wider reach than Microsoft’s.Ms. Bartz said Wednesday that the steady future revenue Yahoo would receive was more important than a large upfront payment.Some Yahoo shareholders have also expressed fear that the company will lose its search expertise, which it might regret later but be unable to recover.“They just gave up one giant stool of their business, which may have very significant implications,” said Darren Chervitz, co-manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owns shares of Yahoo.Mr. Ballmer contends that the partnership will allow it to create a better search product and make meaningful inroads against Google, which handles roughly two out of every three search queries in the United States.Some investors said they found Mr. Ballmer’s arguments compelling.“I think the market was looking for something big and more near term,” said Bruce Kaser, a senior portfolio manager at Voyageur Asset Management. “But they will have a much better chance together than they would have separately.”Microsoft did not bend over backward to provide analysts with detailed information about the agreement with Yahoo. One document, which appeared to have been released by accident, showed Microsoft expecting to lose $300 million over the next two years as it takes on more of the search infrastructure work. The company later removed that slide from its Web site.When not talking about search, Mr. Ballmer defended Microsoft’s position in other markets. He laughed off Apple as a minuscule player in the computing market and mocked some of Google’s efforts to develop software to run on PCs.While the likes of Google and Facebook may come off as flashier than the old-guard Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer said the firm had no trouble attracting young talent.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','Signaling that the panel would not rely solely on senior officials like Mr. Blair who had long rehearsed their justifications for the war, the chairman said it might also call “junior officials with vital evidence about the ways their managers and leaders acted,” and would encourage testimony from families of some of the 179 British soldiers who died in Iraq.Sir John’s insistence that the panel hold as many of its hearings in public as possible, and allow live television coverage — another break with Mr. Brown’s original stipulation of closed hearings — presented the possibility that some of the more contentious sessions would take place in the prelude to a general election that must be held by June.The panel’s chairman said the panel’s task was “huge,” setting the earliest date for its report for the end of 2010, or possibly 2011. That led Michael White, an editor at the newspaper The Guardian, to write that “the daily drip-drip attrition of public evidence will open another flank” against Mr. Brown’s Labour Party during the spring campaign.Sir John suggested that the panel would also to look into the ways in which the relationship between Mr. Blair and President George W. Bush had contributed to Britain’s decision to join the Iraq invasion.“The Anglo-American relationship is one of the most central parts of this inquiry, and how that was conducted is something we need to get a very strong understanding of,” he said.War critics have complained about Mr. Brown’s choice of a former civil servant as the inquiry’s leader, instead of a well-known public figure with established independence from the government. Sir John held a succession of top security-related posts before retiring in 1997, including the top civil service job in the Northern Ireland Office.The inquiry follows two earlier, narrowly based investigations of the war, the last completed only 16 months after American and British forces invaded Iraq in March 2003. Those inquiries were widely judged in Britain to have given the Blair government too easy a passage on the war, which many critics here regard as Britain’s worst foreign policy blunder since the Suez invasion in 1956.The first inquiry, in 2003, looked into the death of David Kelly, a British weapons expert who committed suicide after the Blair government identified him as the source for a BBC report that accused the government of inflating intelligence reports on Saddam Hussein’s supposed stockpile of chemical and biological weapons in the prelude to the war. The inquiry, by Lord Hutton, a senior judge, found Mr. Blair and his officials blameless.A second inquiry, by Lord Butler, a former cabinet secretary, investigated the Blair government’s uses of intelligence in justifying British involvement in the war. The inquiry found that that “more weight was placed on the intelligence than it could bear,” and that the government’s judgments had stretched available intelligence “to the outer limits.”'"

"'09-07-31,'1','LOS ANGELES — If the Walt Disney Company, with its vast theme park operations and television advertising business, is a bellwether for swaths of the economy, third-quarter earnings do not bode well for a recovery.Profit at Disney, the world’s largest media company, declined 26 percent for its fiscal third quarter, hurt by soft advertising sales at ABC and ESPN and drooping consumer spending at Disney World.The immediate prospects of both divisions remain a question mark, with major advertisers sitting on the sidelines for the fall season at ABC and fourth-quarter resort reservations running behind last year despite steep discounting.“We do see signs of economic stability, but the pace and certainty remain uncertain,” said Robert A. Iger, Disney’s chief executive.The company also continued to suffer from a creative slump at its film studio. Walt Disney Pictures is struggling with declining DVD sales because titles like “Bedtime Stories” and “Confessions of a Shopaholic” have been duds. Even the smash success of Pixar’s “Up” was not enough: the unit lost $12 million in the quarter, compared with a profit of $97 million in the year-earlier period.Thomas O. Staggs, chief financial officer, said the studio was also hurt by production costs for “G-Force,” a live action-animated hybrid about gun-toting guinea pigs that opened No. 1 at the box office last weekend. Mr. Staggs described the movie as “very expensive,” but declined to specify its budget.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','Delphi nearly completed its first bankruptcy exit plan a year and a half ago, but a group of investors that had committed to the earlier plan, led by the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, walked away just as the financial and auto sales markets began to falter.The parts maker announced a second plan to emerge from bankruptcy on June 1, in which it would sell the majority of its assets to Platinum Equity, a private equity firm, and G.M. But Delphi’s lenders strenuously objected to that proposal, saying it shortchanged their claims. Some firms had threatened to push for a liquidation of the company, saying it would have given them more money.“This modified plan provides more value for stakeholders than what the stakeholders had been pushing the company to do,” John W. Butler Jr., Delphi’s lead bankruptcy counsel, said after the hearing.Delphi intends to pay Platinum $30.5 million as reimbursement for expenses.Earlier in the day, Mr. Butler described how the company had struggled to devise a new strategy to exit bankruptcy. What became the recently confirmed plan first took shape in January — but was rejected several months later by the company’s debtor-in-possession lenders, whose $3.44 billion in loans kept Delphi afloat in bankruptcy.Now the lenders, led by the hedge funds Elliott Management and Silver Point Capital, have agreed to forgive those claims in exchange for taking over the bulk of Delphi’s assets, a process known as credit bidding. Elliott and Silver Point have agreed to lead a $900 million financing commitment, which will be supported by other Delphi lenders.G.M. will provide more than $3 billion in financing to take back four factories as well as Delphi’s steering business, according to regulatory filing by the carmaker late Thursday. G.M. spun Delphi off in 1999 and remains a major customer.The lenders and G.M. would share distributions from asset sales or a public offering of stock, with the lenders expected to reinvest most of the money they would receive in Delphi. G.M. will share some of its proceeds with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the agency that is taking over Delphi’s pension plans at a cost of $6.2 billion, according to people briefed on the matter.Mr. Butler declined to comment on the specifics of Delphi’s deal with its lenders, saying it was a negotiated among privately held companies.The lenders will take control of a new company known initially as DIP HoldCo 3, but soon to be renamed Delphi. Rodney O’Neal, the company’s chief executive, will stay on, Delphi said. The entity will have a new board.'"
"'09-07-31,'1','On Friday, the House of Representatives may vote on a bill that would order bank regulators to restrict “inappropriate or imprudently risky” pay packages at larger banks.Mr. Cuomo, who for months has criticized the companies over pay, said the bonuses were particularly galling because the banks survived the crisis with the government’s support.“If the bank lost money, where do you get the money to pay the bonus?” he said.All the banks named in the report declined to comment.Mr. Cuomo’s stance — that compensation for every employee in a financial firm should rise and fall in line with the company’s overall results — is not shared on Wall Street, which tends to reward employees based more on their individual performance. Otherwise, the thinking goes, top workers could easily leave for another firm that would reward them more directly for their personal contribution.Many banks partly base their bonuses on overall results, but Mr. Cuomo has said they should do so to a greater degree.At Morgan Stanley, for example, compensation last year was more than seven times as large as the bank’s profit. In 2004 and 2005, when the stock markets were doing well, Morgan Stanley spent only two times its profits on compensation.Robert A. Profusek, a lawyer with the law firm Jones Day, which works with many of the large banks, said bank executives and boards spent considerable time deciding bonuses based on the value of workers to their companies.“There’s this assumption that everyone was like drunken sailors passing out money without regard to the consequences or without giving it any thought,” Mr. Profusek said. “That wasn’t the case.”Mr. Cuomo’s office did not study the correlation between all of the individual bonuses and the performance of the people who received them.Congressional leaders have introduced several other bills aimed at reining in the bank bonus culture. Federal regulators and a new government pay czar, Kenneth Feinberg, are also scrutinizing bank bonuses, which have fueled populist outrage. Incentives that led to large bonuses on Wall Street are often cited as a cause of the financial crisis.Though it has been known for months that billions of dollars were spent on bonuses last year, it was unclear whether that money was spread widely or concentrated among a few workers.The report suggests that those roughly 5,000 people — a small subset of the industry — accounted for more than $5 billion in bonuses. At Goldman, just 200 people collectively were paid nearly $1 billion in total, and at Morgan Stanley, $577 million was shared by 101 people.All told, the bonus pools at the nine banks that received bailout money was $32.6 billion, while those banks lost $81 billion.Some compensation experts questioned whether the bonuses should have been paid at all while the banks were receiving government aid.“There are some real ethical questions given the bailouts and the precariousness of so many of these financial institutions,” said Jesse M. Brill, an outspoken pay critic who is the chairman of CompensationStandards.com, a research firm in California. “It’s troublesome that the old ways are so ingrained that it is very hard for them to shed them.”The report does not include certain other highly paid employees, like brokers who are paid on commission. The report also does not include some bank subsidiaries, like the Phibro commodities trading unit at Citigroup, where one trader stands to collect $100 million for his work last year.Now that most banks are making money again, hefty bonuses will probably be even more common this year. And many banks have increased salaries among highly paid workers so that they will not depend as heavily on bonuses.Banks typically do not disclose compensation figures beyond their total compensation expenses and the amounts paid to top five highly paid executives, but they turned over information on their bonus pools to a House committee and to Mr. Cuomo after the bailout last year.The last few years provide a “virtual laboratory” to test whether bankers’ pay moved in line with bank performance, Mr. Cuomo said. If it did, he said, the pay levels would have dropped off in 2007 and 2008 as bank profits fell.So far this year, Morgan Stanley has set aside about $7 billion for compensation — which includes salaries, bonuses and expenses like health care — even though it has reported quarterly losses.At some banks last year, revenue fell to levels not seen in more than five years, but pay did not. At Citigroup, revenue was the lowest since 2002. But the amount the bank spent on compensation was higher than in any other year between 2003 and 2006.At Bank of America, revenue last year was at the same level as in 2006, and the bank kept the amount it paid to employees in line with 2006. Profit at the bank last year, however, was one-fifth of the level in 2006.Still, regulators may have limited resources for keeping pay in check. Only banks that still have bailout money are subject to oversight by Mr. Feinberg, the pay czar. He will approve pay for the top 100 compensated employees at banks like Citigroup and Bank of America as well as automakers like General Motors.'"
