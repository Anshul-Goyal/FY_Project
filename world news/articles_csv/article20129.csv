With talks over a new deal at a standstill, the N.F.L. sent a memo to its teams this week saying that replacement officials would be used for the first week of games. The regular officials have been preparing throughout the lockout to return to work. The two sides probably have until late Monday to strike a deal in order to get a crew for the Wednesday night opener between the Cowboys and the Giants.The N.F.L. and the union are sparring over raises for officials and over a plan to convert the officials’ pension plan into a 401(k).

"'12-09-01,'0','WASHINGTON — The contractors in charge of guarding the national stockpile of bomb-grade uranium in Tennessee knew well before an 82-year-old nun and two other pacifists broke through three barriers this summer that a lot of the security equipment was broken, and government managers knew it too, according to an internal audit of Energy Department operations at the weapons facility. The inspector general’s investigation found “troubling displays of ineptitude.”The intruders used ordinary bolt cutters to penetrate as far as the uranium storage building before dawn on July 28, and then went undiscovered until they approached an officer in his vehicle and surrendered, according to the audit. The officer failed to draw his gun or even secure his gun from seizure, “and permitted the trespassers to roam about and retrieve various items from backpacks they had apparently brought into the area,” the report said.The three antiwar protesters — Sister Megan Gillespie Rice, of Las Vegas; Michael R. Walli, 63, of Washington; and Gregory I. Boertje-Obed, 57, of Duluth, Minn. — have been charged with felonies in connection with damage to the building. They said they had brought bread and candles for a Christian ritual.The guard told The Knoxville News that he was being used as a scapegoat, and that it was obvious that the trio posed no threat.Internal communications at the weapons plant, Y-12, near Oak Ridge, Tenn., were generally so poor that security officers told the auditors that it was not unusual for roofers or utility repair personnel to show up unannounced, and that when they heard the trespassers banging on the exterior wall of the storage building with hammers, they assumed it was maintenance workers.'"

"'12-09-01,'0','Just what grandpa needed. Soon retirees and other investors will be barraged with advertisements for private stock offerings — via mail, cold calling, television, radio, billboards, the Internet and so on.Such advertising, which used to be banned under federal securities law, will make it easier for hedge funds, venture capitalists, start-ups and other nonpublic companies to find investors. It will also make it easier for hucksters and rip-off artists to lure people into unsuitable investments and outright frauds because private offerings are not subject to disclosure requirements and other investor protections that apply to publicly held companies.Bipartisan majorities in Congress and President Obama are to thank for this development. Bowing to the financial industry, they joined forces last April to pass a law that requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to lift the ban on mass advertising of private offerings.The S.E.C., for its part, made matters worse this week when it proposed a rule to implement the law that utterly fails to address the fact that ending the ban will make everyday investors more vulnerable to fraud. While the commission has no choice but to lift the ban, it does have leeway to write the rules to decrease the threat to investors. It has not used that flexibility.For instance, while the new law allows for mass advertising of private offerings, it also says the buyers of such securities must be “accredited investors,” generally defined as those with at least $1 million in net worth (not counting a home) or at least $200,000 of yearly income. The law also says that private stock issuers must take “reasonable steps” to verify that investors qualify as “accredited.” But the S.E.C. did not impose or even suggest verification procedures to ensure that investors meet the criteria.Even with proper verification, the proposed rule would still fail to protect many investors. That’s because wealth and earnings are often no indicator of investing experience. Indeed, many people who qualify as “accredited” are retirees and professionals whose finances grow out of work and saving, not investing expertise. The S.E.C. should have amended the definition of accredited investor to include other evidence of financial sophistication.The failure to shield investors from mass advertising is all the more disturbing because it comes on the heels of other regulatory failures, including most recently, the S.E.C.’s inability to reach a compromise on reforms to money market mutual funds.'"

"'12-09-01,'0','Whether it is enough to head off the continuing collapse of the industry is another question, catfish specialists say.“I think we are seeing a change before our very eyes, quicker than we ever dreamed,” said Roger Barlow, executive vice president of the Catfish Farmers of America. “We have never had as high a feed cost and at the same time seen our pond-bank price go down,” Mr. Barlow said.A $10 million purchase, at recent prices paid by the government, would be more than three million pounds of frozen catfish.“That’s not a lot, but it can’t help but help,” said Craig Tucker, a catfish expert and former director of the Thad Cochran National Warmwater Aquaculture Center of Mississippi State University, in Stoneville.The glut that has depressed fish prices built up suddenly this year, to the industry’s surprise, after a shortage last year after increasing numbers of farmers bailed out.Inventories of frozen catfish doubled to about 10 million pounds from about 5 million in the last year, according to the government. In effect, the government will soak up most of that increase.But nobody expects the federal purchases, equivalent to about one week’s national sales of processed catfish, to bring the price at the pond up to the break-even point or to affect the price of feed in any way, or to offset import competition, which was up 30 percent in June from a year earlier.“It does not get at any of the underlying problems facing the farmers,” said Terrill R. Hanson, an aquaculture economist at Auburn University.Domestic production of farm-raised catfish has been declining for years, and the trend has accelerated as feed prices and imports have risen. By various measures, the industry has shrunk by half since its peak a decade or so ago.From January 2010 to January 2011, more than 20 percent of catfish farming operations closed.That caused a shortage last year of fully grown catfish for the companies that cut them up, process them for cooking and freeze them, eventually selling them through brokers to restaurants and supermarkets. The price of catfish, both at the farm and after processing, went up as a result, and the business was reasonably profitable last year.As recently as the start of this year, Mr. Hanson predicted in an annual report that there would not be enough fish to supply processors in 2012 and 2013.But instead, the supply has exceeded the demand. As the price of domestic catfish increased last year, customers substituted other fish like inexpensive tilapia, or imported catfish and similar species from countries like Vietnam and China.These buyers, unlike the federal government, have not come back even though prices have fallen.“What makes the situation so dire is that the processors are not getting these sales back,” said Dr. Hanson. “And now, everyone is uncertain — if they grow fish, will there be anyone to sell them to?”The prospect of continuing high feed prices is deeply worrying to farmers, who can easily spend roughly 75 cents on feed to produce each pound of fish in the two years it takes to raise a fingerling to fillet size. Today, they are getting about 85 cents a pound for grown fish, not enough to generate a profit. They sell on the spot market, not under production contracts.The price of catfish feed drifted between about $200 and $300 a ton for 20 years before suddenly rising above $400 a ton in the last two years, and to nearly $600 this summer.“It’s impossible to make even a napkin calculation showing that this is profitable,” said Mr. Tucker.In Arkansas, for example, farmers raised more than 75 million market-ready fish 10 years ago, weighing well over 100 million pounds; this summer there were barely 15 million food-size fish in ponds, with a live weight of 20 million pounds, according to a July census.Many farmers, especially those in Mississippi and Arkansas, where ponds replaced marginal plantings of row crops decades ago, are tempted to simply drain the ponds and plant beans and corn — “to grow grain rather than feed grain,” as Mr. Barlow of the catfish farmers’ group put it. Among other considerations, those crops qualify for federal insurance.In Mississippi’s Delta region, the heart of the catfish belt, Mr. Tucker said, “You can drive down roads and see soybeans growing in what is obviously an old catfish pond.”Compared to catfish, “It’s almost a gold rush,” he said.'"
"'12-09-01,'0','She cited the recent sale of a Manhattan town house designed by the famed 19th-century architect Stanford White, which was listed by Christie’s at what now seems a bargain, $49 million. “But even new construction could be considered art. It’s the equivalent of postwar and contemporary art, which is setting record prices.”Something is certainly leading to record prices for what brokers describe interchangeably as trophy or art properties. An apartment at One57, a tower under construction across from Carnegie Hall, sold for $90 million and another is in contract for a sum said to be over $90 million (though less than the list price of $115 million.) The casino executive Steve Wynn, who is also a prominent art collector, bought a penthouse at the Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South for $70 million in June. A duplex co-op on Park Avenue sold for $52 million in May.For high-end real estate sellers and buyers, the art analogy holds obvious appeal, since prices for paintings cracked the $100 million barrier at auction years ago and quickly rebounded from the financial crisis. The record for the most expensive painting is said to be held by Cezanne’s “The Card Players,” sold last year to the royal family of Qatar for a price estimated by Vanity Fair at $250 million. (A few weeks ago, a member of the same family walked away from a deal at One57, opting instead for a $47 million Upper East Side town house.)To reduce the Cezanne’s 97-by-130-centimeter dimensions to real estate terms, that’s $19,826 per square centimeter. Mr. Klar is asking only $12,500 per square foot, and his apartment comes with swag drapes and a crystal chandelier.It may be time for a reality check.David Kusin, a former Metropolitan Museum of Art curator who also worked on Wall Street and now runs Kusin & Company, a consulting firm in Dallas that specializes in the economics of the art market, told me the comparison of real estate to fine art infuriated him.“There’s absolutely no statistical validity to it,” he said. “It’s like comparing Earth to Saturn. And I’ve been studying these markets for 18 years. I live in a home designed by the dean of Taliesin,” Frank Lloyd Wright’s school of architecture. “The interior designer and landscape architect are at the apex of their fields. There is no comparability at all between the structure I live in and the art that hangs on the walls.”Among the more obvious differences he and others mentioned is that most art is portable, and thus sells in a global market; most great art is unique and can’t be replicated; art serves no utilitarian function; art values are based on a wide range of scholarship, research and critical evaluations, which may take generations to evolve; and valuing art is much more complicated than valuing real estate.“When people get crazy over something, they like to rationalize what they do,” Mr. Kusin added. “If a Russian oligarch is going to spend $88 million, then somehow he has to justify it. So he says it’s more than an apartment. It’s art. That’s absolutely ridiculous. At the end of the day, it’s still a piece of real estate. It’s immovable, and it needs to be maintained.”There are a few real estate properties that even Mr. Kusin would concede qualify as masterpieces, but curiously, they aren’t the ones asking — or getting — anywhere near $100 million. And none of them are in new Manhattan condo buildings. Sotheby’s auctioned the Farnsworth House, a landmark in modernist architecture designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and built in 1951 on 58 acres of prairie southwest of Chicago. The winning bidder was the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which paid $7.5 million.Frank Lloyd Wright’s landmark Ennis House, set on a hill in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles, sold last summer to the billionaire executive Ronald Burkle for less than $4.5 million. It was listed by Christie’s in 2009 at $15 million.Sotheby’s has several listings for palazzos in Venice, some dating to the 14th century.“If you’re standing on a terrazzo floor built in the 1300s, that has a lot of value,” Philip White, president of Sotheby’s International Realty, said. “There are early frescoes in some of the walls that are part of the real estate, and the frescoes alone are worth a lot of money.”Be that as it may, such listings in Venice start at $3.5 million, and Mr. White said none has sold for more than $20 million.“There are only a few properties of great architectural and historic significance,” Mr. White said. “The Mies Farnsworth house was one of those; some of the Frank Lloyd Wright houses; the Philip Johnson glass house in Connecticut. They transformed architecture the way Picasso transformed the art world. That’s how we at Sotheby’s look at it.“I don’t think you can put 15 Central Park West in that category, even if an apartment did sell for $88 million. I’m sure it has some nice elements, but it’s a new condominium.”Paul Provost, deputy chairman of Christie’s, agreed that the analogy could go only so far.“At some point, it falls apart,” he said. Art and real estate “are very different. The assets are different, the liquidity is different. Still, as the art market has become increasingly global, people are looking at art as an asset because the values have increased so much. People have always considered their home as an asset. If they see it’s worth $50 million, they’re even more likely to consider it an asset. So you can see the markets converging.”According to Jonathan Miller, president of real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, “When people refer to their real estate as art, they’re really trying to say it’s unique, that it can’t be replicated.”He said he’s seen the phenomenon not just in New York, but also Miami, London, Los Angeles and other markets where investors “are looking for safety in a world of turmoil and uncertainty.”But, he said, “they’re confusing price with art. You’d think that titans of industry would be very individualistic about their acquisitions, but at the very top, there’s a herd mentality. You get one or two very large transactions that grab headlines and then it’s like a light switch goes off. In New York, this happened in the second half of 2010, and since then it’s been very intense. The size of what’s happening is unprecedented. How long can this go on? You see this kind of behavior and you have to wonder.”Does any of this tickle down to the broader housing market?Anything selling for close to $100 million has to be considered a niche, accessible to only a small number of extremely wealthy buyers, Mr. Miller said. The recent high-end sales seem to have preceded an upturn in the broader real estate market, and some real estates experts consider luxury home sales a leading indicator of broader price trends.This week, the widely followed Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller Home Price Index reported that average American home prices in June posted their first year-over-year increase in nearly two years.“This is an isolated market, but it does create optimism,” Ms. Coumou, of Christie’s, said of the ultrahigh-end sales. “I see the beginning of a recovery. I hope next year we’ll see better results in areas outside Los Angeles, Manhattan and Miami.”Whether record prices can keep soaring is another matter. Mr. Weill realized close to a 20 percent annualized rate of return on his apartment at 15 Central Park West, which he bought in 2007 for $43.7 million. To maintain that rate, it would have to sell for over $200 million in just five years.There’s also the risk of overbuilding at the extreme high end.Unlike Picasso, who’s dead, several such developments like the kind of real estate now fetching close to $100 million — lofty new Manhattan condos with sweeping Central Park views — are under construction or rumored to be in the offing. A tower being built at 56th and Park Avenue is expected to top One57 by several hundred feet; the Baccarat Hotel and Residences New York, scheduled for completion in 2014, is rising across the street from the Museum of Modern Art and will feature interior touches like Baccarat crystal chandeliers; Vornado Realty Trust has proposed a new ultraluxury tower at 220 Central Park South, offering direct park views, not ones from several blocks away; and another soaring tower is rumored for a site near 57th and Broadway.“Are there enough billionaires to fill all these spaces?” one broker mused.Art advisers often caution prospective buyers that they should buy art because they love it, and not just because they expect it to appreciate in value. Perhaps the same could be said about high-end real estate. If living at the top of a new condominium tower delivers unparalleled satisfaction, then perhaps price doesn’t matter.As for the art analogy, in 2008, a stainless steel rabbit sculpture by the American artist Jeff Koons reportedly sold privately for $80 million, not long after his “Hanging Heart” set a record at auction for a living artist, selling for $23.6 million. But since then, prices for his works have plunged — when they actually sell.His “Balloon Flower (Blue)” sold for $16.9 million in 2010 and another “Hanging Heart” sold privately this year for a reported $11 million. Several other Koons works put up for auction didn’t sell.'"
"'12-09-01,'0','Yet the chancellor’s efforts to underline what both sides have dubbed their “special relationship” came under fire from critics at home, who recall her previous willingness to risk Germany’s economic interest to highlight China’s poor record on human rights issues. In 2007, she invited the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, to the chancellery for talks, prompting an angry response from Beijing.A summary of Ms. Merkel’s trip ran under the headline “The Domesticated Chancellor” in the online version of Der Spiegel on Friday, and the conservative newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung warned of the danger of believing that the two countries’ relationship could be defined by economic ties alone.“No matter how dynamically the relation develops in terms of trade and investment,” said an editorial published in the paper on Thursday, “there can never be a ‘special relationship’ between the Communist People’s Republic and Germany, a democratic country in the heart of the European Union, at least not in the sense of the Anglo-American connection.”One of the sharpest critics of the chancellor, however, was in Beijing. The artist provocateur Ai Weiwei, who has a strong following in Germany, began poking fun at Ms. Merkel and posting comments on the Internet to show his disappointment at not being invited to meet her for lunch. He even posted pictures of himself striding outside, wearing Chinese slippers and carrying a cardboard cutout of Ms. Merkel through his garden. He called it “Taking Merkel to Lunch.”Human rights issues may have been largely ignored on this visit, but economic ties have flourished since the two countries began a program of annual governmental exchanges in 2010. On this trip, German executives signed contracts worth more than 4.8 billion euros, or $6 billion, including an order for Airbus, a French-German venture, for 50 jets worth more than $4.4 billion.Still, disagreements over trade, transparency and access to China’s lucrative domestic market remain. Ms. Merkel said on Thursday that she favored negotiation in a trade dispute in which Germany’s largest producer of solar panels is accusing China of dumping low-cost panels in Europe.During a visit to Mr. Wen’s home city, Tianjin, outside Beijing, she made it clear that Chinese companies needed to recognize that subsidies distorted competition and violated European law.“My plea is that everyone be transparent, that they lay their cards on the table about how they produce,” the chancellor said, Reuters reported. Europe’s trade commissioner is expected to decide next week whether to take up the case.At a meeting with German business leaders, Mr. Wen sought to assuage concerns that their subsidiaries based in China were not treated the same as domestic companies.“Fair access to the markets through the access of our subsidiaries as Chinese companies is close to our hearts,” Peter Löscher, the chief executive of Siemens, told the prime minister, dpa reported.Mr. Wen responded by inviting complaints and promising to address any concerns that reached him in writing.Experts on China say Beijing is eager to have Europe welcome more Chinese investment in major areas, not just in the debt market.“The significance of this visit lies primarily in the bilateral economic relations,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing and an adviser to the State Council, or cabinet. “There has been a lot of discussion over China providing financial assistance to Europe. But Germany cannot solely represent Europe, and Europe as an integrated entity still has some concern over receiving Chinese assistance.”'"
"'12-09-01,'0','SHANGHAI — The Chinese dissident who served 10 years after being convicted of state subversion on evidence provided by the American Internet giant Yahoo is under sharp restrictions, his wife said Friday, after he was released and returned home.The dissident, Wang Xiaoning, 62, was released from the Beijing No. 2 prison. Just after 2 a.m., he was taken to a local police station and told that he was not to speak the news media, not to participate in any protests or demonstrations, and not to give any speeches, and that he would be closely monitored, his wife, Yu Ling, said in a telephone interview.“This was not a condition of his release, but he was told to follow these rules,” she said.Mr. Wang, a former engineer, distributed pro-democracy writings using e-mail and Yahoo forums, often anonymously. He was detained on Sept. 1, 2002, and convicted of “inciting subversion of state power” using information the Chinese authorities received from Yahoo. Around the same time, Shi Tao, a Chinese journalist, was convicted of providing state secrets to overseas entities also based on evidence provided by Yahoo’s subsidiary in Hong Kong. He is still in prison.Lawmakers and human rights activists sharply criticized Yahoo for providing information to the Chinese authorities, and for cooperating in investigations involving dissidents.Yahoo eventually apologized for its role in the case and settled a lawsuit brought by the families of several Chinese activists, paying an undisclosed amount of compensation.'"
"'12-09-01,'0','Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., sued Samsung in Tokyo last year in a case that sought 100 million yen, or $1.3 million, in damages.That is a far cry from the billions in damages that Apple had sought from Samsung in federal court in San Jose, Calif. A nine-member jury there ultimately decided on an award of $1 billion after several days of deliberation.Some law professors who have studied international patent disputes say the outcome of that case may be unique in the global tussle between the two companies. Mr. Bessen said that’s partly because the United States is the only major jurisdiction where patent disputes are heard before juries, and foreign companies often face a higher risk of losing cases in such a setting.“I wouldn’t expect there to be a lot of judgments like this one,” said Ronald A. Cass, a former law professor and vice chairman of the International Trade Commission, who is now a legal consultant.Apple has filed other patent suits in Japan against Samsung, including one claiming that the Korean company copied the bounce-back effect when a user scrolls to the end of a list on the iPhone and iPad. And Apple has asked for an injunction that would prevent Samsung from shipping some Galaxy smartphones to Japan. Samsung has also sued Apple in Japan, asserting that both the iPhone and iPad infringe on Samsung patents.In a statement, Samsung Electronics, based in Suwon, South Korea, said the ruling had validated its claims that it had not copied Apple.“Samsung has strongly asserted that its technology is altogether different and does not infringe on Apple patents. The ruling recognizes the legitimacy of Samsung’s assertions and is highly valid,” it said.Apple hardly needs a lift in Japan. The iPhone was the top-selling smartphone there in 2011, while Samsung’s Galaxy series trailed in the No. 5 spot — behind smartphones made by Sharp, Fujitsu and Sony, according to the MM Research Institute, based in Tokyo. Globally, however, Samsung is the largest smartphone maker.But even in Japan, the operating system most commonly used by Samsung and other smartphone makers, Android from Google, has grown steadily, posing a challenge to Apple. Android captured 58 percent of the Japanese market in the first quarter of 2012, compared with the 38 percent market share claimed by Apple’s mobile operating system, iOS, according to the research firm Nielsen.Many analysts see Apple’s suits against Samsung as a proxy battle against Google and Android, which Apple has called a copy of iOS.The patent war between Apple and Google has set off a debate about the future of technological innovation — one that has intensified since the jury in California ruled in Apple’s favor. The jury said Samsung smartphone and tablet products violated Apple’s patents protecting designs and functions, including the rectangular shape and rounded edges of the iPhone.Some experts say such rulings will force smartphone makers to focus on innovating rather than copying, while others say designers could now be stifled by the need to constantly second-guess whether new designs or functions violate other companies’ patents.Meanwhile, Japanese electronics makers have figured little in the smartphone patent wars, underscoring how negligible a threat they now pose to either Apple or Samsung in the sector.Samsung, the world’s largest seller of smartphones, and Apple, the world’s second-largest, together control a little more than 50 percent of the global smartphone market, the research firm Strategy Analytics has said.Japanese smartphone makers like Sharp and Fujitsu, on the other hand, have little presence beyond Japan’s shores.'"

"'12-09-02,'0','The two architects met as undergraduates at the University of Pennsylvania, but it was only after a chance encounter years later on an escalator in Bloomingdale’s that Mr. Shelton and Mr. Mindel started their own firm.It was 1978, and they were only a few years out of architecture school. At first, Mr. Mindel recalled, they shared a desk at a rented atelier and were lucky to get work on bathrooms. A few of those bathrooms, however, were for prominent clients like the director Brian De Palma, and their reputation grew.In 1980 they were hired to design a new nightclub in Times Square called Bond International Casino. The 48,000-square-foot space was a major undertaking, and the architects made it vibrant. A review by Suzanne Slesin in The New York Times in 1980 gives some sense of the grandeur: “The brass, nickel and marble spiral stair dominates the entrance, where there is also a cylindrical brass elevator and an escalator.”Bond closed in the 1990s, but by then Shelton, Mindel & Associates was well known. Although much of the firm’s work was either building very fancy residences or designing their interiors, it also won praise for designing products, including furniture for Knoll and bathroom fixtures for Waterworks. The firm designed homes for the musician Sting and his wife, Trudie Styler, and for the philanthropist Laurie M. Tisch.Although the two architects had different styles and strengths — Mr. Shelton was the quiet visionary who conceived the plans, and the more outgoing Mr. Mindel refined those plans and dealt with clients — they worked on everything together.Over the years, Shelton, Mindel won 25 awards from the American Institute of Architects. The firm was inducted into the Interior Design Hall of Fame in 1996. In 2011 it won the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award for Interior Design.Peter Laros Shelton was born March 26, 1945, in Bethlehem, Pa., to Talbot Shelton and Margaret Laros Shelton. His father was a vice president of Bethlehem Steel and his mother a frequent champion at the local golf club.He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968 and received a master’s in architecture from Pratt Institute in 1975.Mr. Shelton was married at 50 to Ms. Bennett, who survives him, along with their sons, Peik, Truman, Pierson, Larson and Finn; a daughter from Ms. Bennett’s first marriage, Cleo Bennett; and a brother, Talbot.Ms. Bennett was trained in architecture but now does fashion design and was a finalist on the 2006 season of “Project Runway.” She remembered her husband as a perfectionist at the office, but very relaxed at home.“We have a large loft with furniture from Ikea, because we knew the dogs would chew it and kids would smear it,” she said. “It was the opposite of his work, which was so pristine.”'"
"'12-09-02,'0','The tax strategy — which is viewed as perfectly legal by some tax experts, aggressive by others and potentially illegal by some — came to light last month when hundreds of pages of Bain’s internal financial documents were made available online. The financial statements show that at least $1 billion in accumulated fees that otherwise would have been taxed as ordinary income for Bain executives had been converted into investments producing capital gains, which are subject to a federal tax of 15 percent, versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. That means the Bain partners saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes and more than $20 million in taxes.The subpoenas, which executives said were issued in July, predated the leak of the Bain documents by several weeks and do not appear to be connected with them. Mr. Schneiderman, who is also co-chairman of a fraud task force appointed by Mr. Obama, has made cracking down on large-scale tax evasion a priority of his first term.As a retired partner, Mr. Romney continues to receive profits from Bain Capital and has had investments in some of the funds that documents show used the tax strategy.The campaign issued a statement saying that Mr. Romney did not, however, benefit from the practice. “Investing fee income is a common, accepted and totally legal practice,” said R. Bradford Malt, a lawyer for Mr. Romney who manages his family’s investments and trusts. “However, Governor Romney’s agreement did not give the blind trust or him the right to do this, and I can confirm that neither he nor the trust has ever done this, whether before or after he retired from Bain Capital.”Managers at a typical private equity firm or hedge fund collect from their investors management fees based on the size of the fund. But most of their compensation comes as a share of the profits earned by the fund. The allows those profits to be considered “carried interest,” taxed at the capital gains rate typically reserved for investments.The tax strategy used by Bain and other firms to convert management fees — the compensation normally taxed as ordinary income — into capital gains is known as a “management fee waiver.” The strategy is widely used within the industry: 40 percent of the 35 buyout firms based in the surveyed in 2009 by said their partners used at least some of the firm’s fees to make investments in their funds.But some prominent firms appear to avoid the practice. The and have stated in regulatory filings that their partners have not diverted management fees into investments in their funds.In the varied world of private equity, some firms may have lawyers who are not aware of the strategy or have steered their clients away from it, said a lawyer at one firm who has used the strategy for his clients. Others, he said, may not have the operational capabilities to handle the complex transactions.Apollo Global Management, the buyout firm co-founded by Leon Black and now publicly traded, is among those that use the conversion strategy. Between 2007 and 2011, Apollo converted more than $131 million in fees into investments in its funds, according to S.E.C. filings. A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.Likewise, K.K.R. converted more than $180 million in fees between 2007 and 2009, according to its filings. Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for the firm, declined to comment about any regulatory matter, but said in an e-mail that K.K.R. had not used the tax strategy “for the past few years.”Other firms that received subpoenas include Clayton, Dubilier & Rice; Crestview Partners; H.I.G. Capital; Vestar Capital Partners; and Providence Equity Partners. Representatives for all these firms declined to comment.Tax lawyers have justified the arrangements by arguing that converting the management fees into carried interest, which could lose some or all of its value if a fund does poorly, entitles the managers to the lower capital gains rate, which is intended to help mitigate the risks taken by investors.“They’re risking their management fee — they’re giving up the right to that management fee in any and all events,” said Jack S. Levin, a finance lawyer whose firm has represented Bain on some matters. Mr. Levin said he did not consider the practice risky or even aggressive.“The I.R.S. has known that private equity funds have been doing this for 20 years,” he said.In 2007, the agency began taking a closer look at suspected tax abuses at hedge funds and private equity firms. In a statement at the time, an I.R.S. spokesman said that management fee conversions were among several “areas of possible noncompliance.” But no formal ruling appears to have emerged.Some private equity firms take what tax experts consider a less aggressive approach to the conversions, waiving fees on all of a given fund’s investments over the lifetime of the fund, which can be 10 years.But other firms choose which funds or even which particular investments to waive fees on frequently, like every year or every quarter. Such arrangements may allow the executives to apply the waiver only when they believe their funds are more likely to appreciate in value, substantially reducing their investment risk.Mr. Schneiderman is also looking at whether private equity executives treated management fees as a return of invested capital — potentially escaping taxation entirely — or deferred payouts of the converted fees in ways that improperly reduced their tax liabilities.Executives at three of the firms subpoenaed by Mr. Schneiderman, who asked for anonymity because they were bound by confidentiality agreements, said that disclosures to their investors clearly stated that the waived fees were allocated equally to all the investments in a fund.The leaked documents show that Bain has in recent years waived management fees in at least eight private equity and other funds, including one formed as early as January 2002. The documents stated that Bain executives had the right to decide either annually or each quarter whether to waive some or all of their management fees; they also had the ability to convert the waived fees into investments in particular companies held by the funds.Victor Fleischer, a law professor and finance expert at the who has been critical of the tax rules for private equity firms, said he believed Bain had waived management fees into investments with so little risk that the arrangement would not qualify for the capital gains rate if challenged by the I.R.S.“There is a tension between economic risk and tax risk that is supposed to be inversely proportional,” Mr. Fleischer said. “The way Bain set it up there’s not much risk at all, so it’s hard to see how this income should receive capital gains treatment.”'"
"'12-09-02,'0','Mr. Belski added that it’s unfair to assume that earnings for companies that are growing faster than average are apt to be more volatile than profits for slow growers. He studied corporate earnings results for the various sectors over the last decade and discovered that technology stocks “showed the largest increase in earnings stability.”“People underestimate how this sector has changed over the past 10 years,” he said.Robert E. Turner, chairman of Turner Investment Partners, argues that it is in just these types of markets — when the economy is struggling to pick up speed — when classic growth stocks often shine. “Growth does better when the economy is modest because investors value companies that can grow their earnings regardless of the economic backdrop,” he said.When gross domestic product was expanding only modestly from 1993 to 1995, for instance, growth stocks in the S.& P. 500 outperformed value-oriented shares.There’s another important advantage to growth stocks these days: they’re relatively cheap.While earnings for tech and industrial companies are growing faster than the broad market, stocks in these sectors are trading at an average price/earnings ratio of 13.3 based on projected profits, according to Bloomberg. That’s slightly below the P/E ratio for the overall S.& P. 500 and is a notable discount to the defensive utilities sector, with an average P/E of 15.“Only twice in the last 20 years have tech stocks sold at a discount relative to utilities,” Mr. Turner says. The only other occasion was during the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009, he says.GRANTED, not all tech stocks are cheap or attractive. Yet the recent struggles in the market — caused by changing opinions about the true state of the global economy and the debt crisis in Europe — have lowered the price of growth companies.Take Texas Instruments. Shares of the semiconductor giant, which has a big presence in the growing smartphone market, have sunk about 15 percent since late March, when the market shifted to a decidedly risk-off stance. If investors can tolerate the near-term volatility in a stock like this, “it’s got a nice long-term story,” says Bradley P. Hinton, director of research and a portfolio manager at Weitz Funds, which owns Texas Instruments shares.Matthew K. Berler, co-manager of the Osterweis Fund, notes that there are some health care companies with decent growth prospects — and that aren’t dependent on a fast-growing world economy.One stock he likes — and that his fund owns — is Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a specialty drug company that operates in the United States and Canada as well as in Latin America and Eastern Europe. Valeant shares fell more than 20 percent in the spring, and they now trade at a mere 10 times projected earnings.There’s one other reason investors may not want to turn their backs on growth stocks just yet.While volatility in the market has fallen back a bit lately, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, a closely watched gauge of fear among investors, is above 17 points again.Why is this important? Mr. Belski at BMO analyzed growth stocks in the past based on the performance of the VIX. He found that when that index hovers between a reading of 15 and 20, growth stocks tend to beat the broad market.When the VIX rises even more, to between 20 and 25 — which is where it was during the spring market slide — growth stocks do even better compared with the overall S.& P. 500.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','A. I don’t know if you can print some of the things people have said. When you’re shutting down or de-emphasizing divisions, and making changes to senior leadership, it can be difficult.Q. What do you notice about culture when you first go into a company?A. It’s really bad when you have a clock-watcher culture. I did some consulting work for one company where you could get hurt if you were near any exit at 4:30. You had the feeling they were literally waiting for the bell to ring.You want to create an environment where people want to be at work. I lived through that whole Internet craze where you couldn’t hire people fast enough. During those days, you thought of culture as Ping-Pong tables and disco balls. Now I think the big focus on culture, particularly in a down economy, is on how you get people invested so that they care about what they’re doing and feel like they have a hand in things. The only way you can do that is if you have very clearly defined and measurable goals. Then you make sure each and every department knows them, and how their work will support the overall goals.It sounds easy and simple, but it’s not. In my current company, it probably took me six months to clearly define the right goals and how to measure them. It’s also devastating if you get them wrong, because then you’re encouraging the wrong behaviors. But once you get it right, you see this change in people. They want to get the job done, and not just put in the time.Q. Some companies place a big premium on creating a mission statement. Do you think that’s important?A. Honestly, I think that a mission statement is less important than every employee understanding what the company’s positioning is. To me, the mission can be a little academic. I’ve got to create change quickly and drive results. When I go into a company, I might ask 10 senior executives what they think is unique about the company, and I get very different answers, sometimes even conflicting answers. So just getting everyone on the same page about the company’s positioning is more important than the mission. Culture is about performance, and making people feel good about how they contribute to the whole.Q. What are some other dynamics you’ve noticed in the companies you’ve worked with?A. It could be because of the work I do, but when senior leaders get scared because their company is not doing well, they tend not to share decision-making. They are very reactive to the latest feedback from the most recent board meeting. So they tell everyone to all of a sudden focus on this, and then the next month it’s something totally different. They tend to keep decision-making power very close to them.Q. How has your leadership style evolved?A. You start out in leadership roles thinking that it’s really important to be right. You want to be smart. As you evolve, you realize that you need to be open to feedback. I’ve learned to shift from focusing on being smart to knowing what I know and knowing what I don’t know, and when I need to rely on other people. At the same time, though, there can be a slippery slope in the decision-making process. I say to my team a lot — and often they don’t like it — that teams provide input, and individuals make decisions. If you have a team making a decision, then you end up with mediocrity. It doesn’t mean that I’m always making the decision. But if a team recommends a solution, I want one person who’s going to make that decision, with the input of the team.Q. Do you have some tips — some dos and don’ts — for C.E.O.’s?A. You have to remember to focus on the work. People who move into a C.E.O. or a C.O.O. role are often highly competitive, and they are used to competing with others. But what happens when you get to the top of the company? Who are you going to compete with? There’s this mental shift that needs to happen, where you realize you’re not competing with the people around you. You’re competing with other companies, and you’re trying to solve problems. So make sure you’re focusing on the work and not all the politics swirling around the work. I think the most successful C.E.O.’s check their ego at the door. I mean we all have healthy egos, but people aren’t going to be honest with you if you’re not allowed to be wrong.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','Members of United Russia are now threatening to strip Mr. Gudkov of the legislative immunity that would shield him from prosecution.According to Russian law, Duma members “may not engage in business or other paid activities” and also may not serve on boards of directors or in any other leadership capacity of a business. But many lawmakers maintain investments that seem not to be restricted by the law, or earn money from family businesses though they may not be listed as owners.Ms. Nikolayeva, who denies breaking any law, is just one of the legislators being featured in blog posts by the younger Mr. Gudkov, and his friend and ally Ilya V. Ponomarev, who is also a Duma deputy from Just Russia and a leader of the political opposition.“We continue to acquaint the ungrateful Russian people with the most honest deputies from the ‘Party of Power’ who have been relentlessly battling corruption and illegal enrichment,” Mr. Ponomarev wrote sarcastically on Thursday, as he posted another installment of their efforts.Among the 10 featured lawmakers was Boris D. Zubitsky, a billionaire whose family controls the KOKS Group, a metallurgical company, and who along with his wife has reported owning multiple homes and apartments, a Bentley Mulsanne (the current model sells for about $300,000) and three Mercedeses.Also on the list was Aleksei V. Knyshov, who is described as having annual income of about $4 million, owning two houses and six apartments, including a property in Miami Beach, and being the founder and co-manager of a wholesale business in Slovakia.And there was Sergey Y. Esyakov, who reportedly co-founded a bank in January while he was serving in office.Yabloko, a liberal opposition party that does not hold any seats in the Duma, has posted its own list — and demanded an investigation — of 13 lawmakers from United Russia who it says have engaged in various private business dealings while in office.In August, Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the federal Investigative Committee, which has led the inquiries into the Gudkov family businesses as well as criminal investigations into other opposition leaders, declared at a news conference that investigators had found “evidence providing violations of Constitutional and legal bans by Gudkov.” But Mr. Markin’s office said it could not immediately respond to written questions about whether it is examining the business dealings of other lawmakers.Sergei Mitrokhin, the leader of Yabloko, wrote in a blog post that any effort by United Russia to penalize Mr. Gudkov without disciplining members of its own party would be hypocritical.“If they strip Gudkov of his mandate, members of United Russia must follow him,” Mr. Mitrokhin wrote. “Otherwise it would be selective application of the law.”'"
"'12-09-02,'0','But unlike, say, a narcotics-sniffing dog that can lead its human around by a leash, the research boat itself is, in effect, Tucker’s legs when he has picked up the aroma. He cannot physically go where the sample is to be found, but must somehow signal where he wants the boat to go, with the feces somewhere out there on the water.Like a Delphic oracle whose every nuanced expression must be interpreted by acolytes — Tucker might lean to one side of the boat, then another, then suddenly sink back onto his green mat with his head between his paws, the scent lost — his nose for scat leads on, and all must follow.“The slightest twitch of his ear is important,” said Elizabeth Seely, a trainer who has worked with Tucker for four years at a nonprofit group called the Conservation Canines, which specializes in dog-assisted research on behalf of endangered species. She stood at his side on a recent scat-search session, signaling to Ms. Giles behind the wheel with tiny finger motions — a bit to the right, a bit more to the left, circle back — that Tucker was suggesting by his posture and level of attention.Out on these waters, though, it seems that every creature is learning new tricks. Salmon have taken to hiding under commercial whale-watch boats when they are being hunted by the orcas. The boats, in turn, are filled with people — upward of 500,000 during the peak season from May to October — who have paid to see whales and who in many cases, boat operators and scientists say, return home wanting somehow to help the animals. Whale-loving visitors in turn reinforce a local economic engine that hinges more and more on having whales to see.The whales are becoming, in a strange way, more in sync with the rhythms of their human watchers — resting less during daylight and more at night than they used to in the 1980s or ’90s. As part of her dissertation at the University of California, Davis, Ms. Giles is examining reduced prey availability and increased vessel presence as potential causes.For Tucker, though, it mostly comes down to his ball toy, which he plays with in exuberant, wild abandon, tossing it into the air and staging crouched bouts of tug of war with Ms. Seely. When a fecal sample is found, the researchers carry it toward him and then substitute the ball at the last second, reinforcing the connection between work and reward.Another scat dog in training, a flat-coated retriever named Sadie, was donated to the program by an owner who could not deal with her ball fixation. In frustration, the owner put Sadie’s ball on top of the fridge. Eight hours or so later, she returned and found Sadie still sitting there, staring up at the object of her desires.“When the owner told me that story, my immediate response was, ‘We’ll take her,’ ” said Prof. Samuel K. Wasser, the director of the Center for Conservation Biology at the University of Washington and the director of the orca scat research project.The research, financed by Washington Sea Grant of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is raising new questions about how to protect the orcas. Professor Wasser said that when he started the project four years ago, he thought boat activity would be a crucial element of whale stress, reflected through stress hormones in their scat. But it turned out, he said, that food supply was more important, with fewer salmon — because of overfishing by humans or habitat degradation or both — emerging as a main stress variable. Knowing to focus on fish supply, he said, means knowing where to focus public policy efforts on the animals’ behalf.Through the scat, biologists can tell, for example, which whale pods spend the winter off the coast of Southern California, because their feces can contain higher trace elements of DDT, the pesticide that was banned in 1972. The poison still echoes through the decades in the fish the whales eat before returning north. Other orca groups have concentrations of dioxins or PCBs traced to industrial activity around Seattle.But for all his hundreds of hours on boats, Tucker will not get wet. He hates to swim, Ms. Seely said. She is not sure why. A trauma from puppyhood, she supposes. It is one thing about which he cannot communicate.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','Mitt Romney has identified Asia as one place where he wants to focus more attention if elected, but the truth is that President Obama has already staked out a forceful position there with his commitment to rebalance American interests from the Middle East to the Pacific.The administration will have a chance to re-emphasize that as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton makes her third trip to the region this year. She will be in Beijing this week, and her final stop will be the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders’ meeting in Vladivostok.There is no lack of weighty topics on her agenda. Chief among them are the disputes among China, Japan, South Korea and several others over numerous islands in the East China and South China Seas, and the mineral, oil and gas rights to these specks of land. While the conflicts date back many years, they have begun to escalate and carry the risk of war, by mistake or by design. The tensions are sowing mistrust, as well as slowing regional cooperation and economic development. Mrs. Clinton plans to warn leaders at the forum against provocative acts.She’s likely to have the toughest time in China, where the state-run news agency Xinhua just published a commentary saying Washington “intends to benefit from stirring up disputes among nations.” Beijing is very anxious that the United States is asserting itself more robustly in the region, including reviving and reinforcing alliances with Pacific Rim nations.Administration officials deny trying to foment trouble. Instead, they are urging that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations adopt a binding framework for dispute resolution, which could be used to manage competing claims to the islands. The conflict over the islands is a symptom of the growing competition in the region and the fears about China’s rise. Washington could play a constructive role, working with both the smaller nations and Beijing.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — Opposition fighters in Syria said early Saturday that they had captured an air defense base in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, taking at least 16 soldiers captive and seizing weapons and ammunition in what appeared to be part of a broader rebel offensive against Syrian military installations in several parts of the country.Rebel fighters in the province also attacked a military air base, according to activist groups, the third attack on an air force site in the past few days. Last week, rebel commanders claimed to have destroyed several helicopters during attacks on two separate military airports in the northern Idlib Province.The latest attacks came as the new Syria representative for the United Nations and Arab League, seeking to revive stalemated diplomacy, said he would travel to Damascus in the coming days. The representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, a veteran Algerian diplomat, also said he intended to base himself in Damascus if that would be more useful.“Damascus is the right, natural place to be,” Mr. Brahimi said in an interview at the United Nations during his first official day on the job. “Whether it will be possible or not is something I’m going to find out.”Videos that activist groups said showed the aftermath of the air defense base attack raised the possibility that rebels had captured shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, known as Manpads, but it was unclear whether some had the components to make them functional. One video, uploaded on Friday, appeared to show a man holding a complete system.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','The strangest package I’ve ever received came in the mail one fall day in 2006, from my cousin Jim in . Inside was a rickety white bathroom cabinet with two doors, one drawer and a new set of brass pulls. I could see that my cousin had given it a fresh coat of paint, but when I bumped it with my knee, the wood gave way like moist cardboard and my nose filled with the smell of swamp.On the underside of a shelf, Jim had written a note in black pen: “ floated me for about 2 ½ weeks. Then it was another 4 months of mud, mold and mildew before I was discarded to a trash pile as my first home was gutted. As a healing labor of love a young man rebuilt me as best he could. . . . My dream is to find a quiet place to rest and serve some good people.”When I was growing up, Jim was my favorite cousin, though he was 15 years my senior. A 6-foot-7 giant of a man, he had a jagged but handsome face and a slightly wicked sense of humor, and I looked up to him. Now, a year after Katrina, Jim was living in a trailer outside a ruined house in a devastated neighborhood called Lakeview. He had taken up an unusual hobby: performing extreme acts of salvage on objects damaged by the storm. It was, it seemed, his way of working through what Katrina had done to his life — a small-scale revolt against the idea of total loss.Before Katrina, Jim lived with his wife and two children in a leafy, genteel neighborhood called Uptown. He worked nights as an intensive-care nurse at Ochsner Medical Center, arriving home in time to pack his kids off to private school. When Katrina was on the way, Jim sent his wife and children upstate with a trusted family friend and then reported for duty at the hospital. The storm knocked out all but emergency power and the windows bowed in, but the floodwaters stopped just across the street.Unlike most other hospitals in the area, Ochsner continued to function throughout the disaster; Jim stayed on duty for weeks. It was some time before he could make it out of the city to see his family, and the reunion did not go well. I got a call from him shortly thereafter. He was in his truck, hurtling back toward New Orleans. “There’s no place for me in that house,” he said in a pinched, ragged voice. “I’ve been replaced.” And then, with alarming conviction: “It’s over.”To Jim, it seemed as if everyone in the house was on vacation: lazy dinners, campfires in the backyard — a jarring contrast with New Orleans. Worse, Jim told me that he felt that an easy rapport had developed between his wife and the man she evacuated with. (His ex-wife and her fellow evacuee later married.)'"

But what I also saw in my work was a working mother who, despite her extreme poverty, kept her apartment spotless and rose before dawn to get her family ready for school and work; and a tenant leader who, despite her organization being dissolved by the housing authority, went to her office each day to continue to help residents. We must not further disempower people by failing to acknowledge the work already under way from within their community. NICKI BAZER, Evanston, Ill.Poor people who want to get ahead soon realize there are forces arrayed against them — from payday lenders to a rapacious justice system.

"'12-09-02,'0','The answers are as striking as they are varied. Mr. Castaing-Taylor’s “Sweetgrass” (2009), which he made with Ilisa Barbash, also an anthropologist and a curator at the Peabody Museum at Harvard, is a visually majestic chronicle of Montana sheep ranchers, filmed over the course of three summer pastures. Véréna Paravel’s and J. P. Sniadecki’s “Foreign Parts” (2010) is a lived-in portrait, tender but unsentimental, of an endangered junkyard neighborhood in Willets Point, Queens.Stephanie Spray has worked extensively in Nepal, producing intricate sound pieces and intimate family portraits like “As Long as There’s Breath” (2009). Mr. Sniadecki’s latest, “People’s Park,” which he directed with Libbie Dina Cohn, is a single-shot tour of a bustling park in Chengdu, China, achieved through careful planning, multiple takes and an evident rapport with the park’s denizens.“Leviathan,” a new film by Ms. Paravel and Mr. Castaing-Taylor, is perhaps the most radical work yet to emerge from the lab and certainly the one that goes furthest in striving for an immersive cinematic experience. Shot entirely aboard a fishing trawler off the Massachusetts coast, largely with small, waterproof digital cameras that were variously tethered to the fishermen, tossed in with their dead or dying catch and plunged into the roiling ocean, the film had its premiere in competition last month at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland, where it won the international critics’ prize. It will be shown next week at the Toronto International Film Festival, in the Wavelengths section for innovative cinema and at the New York Film Festival.A portrait of commercial fishing in the North Atlantic as the written word alone could never render it, “Leviathan” conveys the brutal toll that the enterprise takes on the workers and on the ocean, and it could even be read as an environmental parable in which the sea threatens to exact its revenge on humanity. But none of this is explicit in the film, which avoids exposition and context, unfolds almost entirely in the dark and often verges on hallucinatory abstraction. Where most documentaries prize clarity, this one attests to the power of estrangement.Over dinner in Brooklyn one July evening while in New York to complete the color correction and sound mix for “Leviathan,” Mr. Castaing-Taylor acknowledged that he was still unsure how to describe the film. “It is utterly a documentary, and in the sense that we gave over the camera for part of it, it’s perhaps even more documentary, less mediated by the filmmakers,” he said. “But it also doesn’t feel like a documentary to me. It feels more like a horror film or science fiction.”Mr. Castaing-Taylor, who was born in Liverpool, England, where his father worked in shipping, said “Leviathan” had begun as a broader inquiry into shipping and fishing. He was drawn to the coastal town of New Bedford, Mass., the onetime whaling capital of the world immortalized in Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick,” and the tension between its mythic status and today’s down-at-the-heels reality. The initial idea was to capture the different facets of the fishing industry, and he started by shooting in the local factories that produce dredges, nets and ice.Early last year, after Ms. Paravel joined Mr. Castaing-Taylor on the project and after they had shot some 50 hours of footage on land, the filmmakers were invited out to sea by the fishermen they had befriended. “Once we started filming on the boat, we lost interest in land,” Mr. Castaing-Taylor said. “There was something going on out there that was much more cosmic and profound.”In rough seas and frigid temperatures nearly 200 miles off the coast, perpetually wet and rarely sleeping more than two hours at a stretch, the filmmakers faced constant reminders that fishing has one of the highest mortality rates of any occupation. Mr. Castaing-Taylor was seasick much of the time; Ms. Paravel was so physically battered from the outings that twice she had to be taken to the emergency room upon returning. They made six trips in all, each one lasting up to two weeks.“The film became a physical reaction to the experience of being out at sea,” Ms. Paravel said, speaking by Skype from Brittany. She added that the meaning of “Leviathan,” the title from the get-go, evolved as the film progressed. Originally an allusion to Melville, who used it to refer to great whales, and to the philosopher Thomas Hobbes, for whom it symbolized the state (and who also argued that all thought originates in sensory experience), the word became most apt in its original biblical sense of a sea monster.Melville remained a guiding spirit. “Moby-Dick,” which Ms. Paravel and Mr. Castaing-Taylor took turns reading to each other on the boat, also has a pronounced documentary aspect, as Ms. Paravel pointed out. “He has all these endless descriptions of all kinds of whales,” she said.On the second trip, having already lost one camera to the waves, the filmmakers tried out the GoPro, a compact and durable attachable camera popular among extreme-sports enthusiasts. Part of the appeal of the GoPro footage — especially in the pitch-black night scenes, with movement sometimes registering as ghostly afterimages — was that it lacked the definition of more expensive cameras. “The footage seemed to be much more opaque in a good way,” Mr. Castaing-Taylor said. “It activated the viewer’s imagination much more.”“Leviathan” extends the point-of-view experiments of “Sweetgrass,” sections of which Mr. Castaing-Taylor shot with a torso-strapped camera amid hundreds of sheep, as if part of the herd. This time the small, inexpensive cameras allowed them to “distribute the authorship,” Ms. Paravel said, enabling a collaboration of sorts among the filmmakers, their subjects and nature itself.Mr. Castaing-Taylor recalled the first time he watched the footage from cameras that had been affixed to the fishermen’s helmets as they scrambled about the slippery deck. “It was more corporeal, more embodied than the most frenetic vérité footage,” he said. “There’s this charge of subjectivity. But at the same time it renounces any directorial intent.” The filmmakers also taped the cameras to wooden poles that they dipped into the water, resulting in disorienting shots of bloody fish parts tumbling back into the ocean and upside-down views of swarming sea gulls overhead.As with most Sensory Ethnography Lab films, sound plays an important role in the nearly wordless but often thunderous “Leviathan”; the sound artist Ernst Karel, who teaches in the program, collaborates on the sound mixes and designs for most of the films. For “Leviathan” he and a sound designer, Jacob Ribicoff, combined the industrial din of machinery and engines with the gasping sounds that the encased GoPro cameras produced when submerged.For all its innovations in suggesting new possibilities for the video image, the formal questions behind a film like “Leviathan” are part of a venerable tradition. Its quest to find fresh ways of seeing, to push the limits of cinema as a tool for both capturing reality and heightening the senses, was precisely the one that, as far back as the 1920s, compelled the Soviet master Dziga Vertov to formulate his concept of the camera as an all-seeing, endlessly perfectible Kino-Eye.“Leviathan,” which looks and sounds like no other documentary in memory, is likely to be one of the most talked-about art films of the year; it prompted both raves and walkouts at Locarno. At the premiere Ms. Paravel introduced the film as “a monster.” After the screening, she gamely answered questions about process but declined to be pinned down on meaning.“We still don’t know exactly what the film is about,” she said.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','Carol School Supply, a place that feels as much like a classroom as a retail shop with its primary-colored carpets and inspirational posters, fills 7,000 square feet on Union Turnpike.“We’re like ‘The Last of the Mohicans’ out here,” said Jason Pick, whose parents, Roy and Carol Pick, own the store. He counted on one hand the family-owned educational supply shops that remain in New York; many have folded, he theorized, because of online shopping.But when Carol Pick’s Austrian immigrant father started the business, he sold straight to teachers from the back of his 1955 Dodge station wagon.“I’d ride in the front seat with him,” Ms. Pick remembered, “and he’d drive from school to school selling paper, paint, crayons, glue.”Forty-eight years later, the store still outfits preschool through eighth-grade classrooms and offers everything from No. 2 pencils and marble composition books to homework charts and lost tooth graphs. Parents and children shop there too, especially later in the season when much of the inventory turns to toys.On this Thursday, Teresa Charles, a sixth grader at St. Clare’s School in the Bronx, described a bargain she had struck with her father. “If I get all A’s and B’s, he promised I could go shopping,” she said.Peering into her basket of test prep books, she added, “I mean for clothes, like a real shopping spree.”Nearby, four friends from Junior High School 216 in Flushing quizzed one another with BrainQuest puzzles, while teachers waiting in line lamented the end of their vacations and excitedly exchanged stories of successful teaching moments.For her part, Ms. Pick, a former kindergarten teacher, said she believed that an organized classroom was crucial for a teacher’s confidence. “My motto is,” she said, leaning close between the character-building workbooks, “the way you look is the way you feel. And that’s just how you will perform.”While Ms. Pick pointed a customer toward this year’s decorative themes — owls, monkeys and cupcakes — Jason Pick reminisced about the original shop on 185th Street, a few blocks up the turnpike, where he and his sister, now an education coordinator in Manhattan, got to test new items.“I’d play for hours with the manipulatives,” he said, laughing at his use of teacher’s jargon. “Well, now I call them that; to me, they were just toys.”He never saw teachers as other children did. “I knew how much time and money went into setting up classrooms,” he said.While her grandson, Logan, played at the wooden toy table, Ms, Pick pointed to a poster over the door.“Kids are special people,” she read. “That’s my favorite.”'"
"'12-09-02,'0','“A lot of homeowners are sitting on cash, concerned about the stock market,” said Bob Moulton, the president of the Americana Mortgage Group in Manhasset, N.Y. “They get 3.5 percent-plus by putting it into their home,” he added, referring to the prevailing rate nationwide on a 30-year fixed-rate loan.“If you don’t have a need for the cash — if your cash position is O.K. — then that’s the right decision,” he added.Mr. Moulton says he has had several customers eager to buy down their mortgage balances. “When people are to the cusp,” he said, referring to borrowers’ balances near the cutoff for conventional loans, “I always bring that to their attention.”Cash-in refinancing has remained popular as homeowners work to cut their debt levels. Some 23 percent of homeowners refinancing in the second quarter decreased their mortgage balances, according to Freddie Mac; in the fourth quarter of last year it was 47 percent. The agency provides a guide for consumers on its Web site.Sheila Walker Hartwell, the owner of Hartwell Planning, a financial planner based in Manhattan, says homeowners with a good financial foundation could greatly benefit by moving to a conventional mortgage from a jumbo. She provided one scenario in which a couple pays in $75,000 when they refinance a $700,000 mortgage, and save at least $5,900 a year on interest based on a 0.33 percentage point reduction in their interest rate.  They would need to earn almost 7.5 percent a year on that money to net the same amount from savings or investments, she said.But Ms. Hartwell cautioned that when homeowners pay into their mortgages to build up equity, “the money’s not liquid,” or readily available. She said that she would prefer that her clients develop a savings and spending plan and make sure that they have a “contingency fund” with at least six months’ and sometimes up to 12 months of living expenses. (The 12-month fund is worthwhile when the economy is uncertain or if your job or industry seems less than solid, she said.) It’s not a good idea to deplete those funds to pay down your mortgage, even if the funds are earning next to nothing, Ms. Hartwell said.Especially, Mr. Moulton added, “if they anticipate big expenses — college expenses, home improvement — or have other debts at a higher interest rate. Then they don’t want to do this.”Another drawback, Ms. Hartwell said: Unless the length of a loan is reduced, each time you refinance, the mortgage starts again at the beginning and initial payments are almost all interest.'"
"'12-09-02,'0','The case began when Mr. MacDonald called the military police at Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, to his home and told them that a band of marauding hippies, including a woman in a floppy hat, beat and stabbed his family while chanting, “Acid is groovy, kill the pigs.” Mr. MacDonald’s pregnant wife and daughters, Kimberley, 5, and Kristin, 2, died in the violence, and Mr. MacDonald was injured but survived.Coming, as it did, in the months after the Manson murders and during a period of civil unrest and burgeoning drug use, the crime created widespread suspicion and worry. But soon after the murders Army investigators began to focus on Mr. MacDonald, believing that he had killed his family in a rage and staged the scene to mimic the Manson murders.Mr. MacDonald eventually found himself not only convicted and sentenced but also rendered as a calculating sociopath in “Fatal Vision,” a 1983 book by Joe McGinniss that has sold over 2.5 million copies, and in a matching NBC mini-series, which was watched by an average of around 30 million people on each of its two nights. Without the car chase and acquittal, he was the O. J. of his time.The MacDonald story, populated by disheveled hippies and ramrod military types, generated a legal controversy that never seemed to be settled and the tantalizing possibility that an imprisoned man might be innocent. Through the decades there have been books, magazine investigations and endless reconsiderations. The case’s lurid details fed public fascination, and the coverage sparked a further debate about the nature and morality of journalism itself.“A Wilderness of Error” may not exonerate him, but it makes a forceful argument that his conviction was riddled with shortcomings. The case will be the subject of a new hearing on Sept. 17 in United States District Court in Wilmington, N.C., after the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last spring that the lower court had failed to consider the entire body of evidence.That body of evidence just got a little bigger. “A Wilderness of Error” is a more than 500-page book of enormous investigative heft, with page after page deconstructing fibers, flower pots, hobby horses and source documents. What it does not have is a neat little ending where the reader comes to believe that a wronged man is in jail. Mr. Morris is, however, convinced.“I believe he is innocent. I don’t see any evidence to suggest that he is guilty,” said Mr. Morris, sitting in his office on a rugged retail stretch in Cambridge, Mass., in the former Globe Department Store. “One thing we do know is that evidence was lost, some of it went uncollected, and some of it was contaminated. One of the reasons we can’t prove he is innocent is that so much of the evidence is unavailable to us.”That did not stop Mr. Morris from trying. Now 64, Mr. Morris is a contrarian by nature and practice. A graduate in history from the University of Wisconsin and a trained investigator who worked on Wall Street cases for a private detective agency, he accepts nothing at face value. In his film “The Fog of War” (2003) he recast Robert S. McNamara, a much-reviled architect of the Vietnam War, as a careful thinker who made some grievous yet altogether human mistakes. In “Standard Operating Procedure” (2008) the military police personnel who took photographs at Abu Ghraib that horrified the world were recontextualized as a logical extension of United States military and foreign policy.He observes few strictures of documentary film, paying his subjects when he chooses and creating re-enactments as he sees fit. He is eccentric in his pursuits but is equable in person, careful in his speech and a fan of civilized but endless argument.In the MacDonald case he says that investigators and journalists latched on to a theory that Mr. MacDonald had snapped, and that they disregarded evidence to the contrary. “That story held that Jeffrey killed his family in the heat of an argument and then came up with this cockamamie story about hippies to cover up what he did. I decided to look at the flip side.”After prosecutors focused on Mr. MacDonald, he did himself no favors, admitting he had been unfaithful to his wife, lying to members of her family and coming off as uncaring and arrogant in news media appearances. “If you are accused of slaughtering your whole family, what is the appropriate way to act?” Mr. Morris said.Mr. Morris had a precocious interest in capital crimes and Edgar Allan Poe as a young boy, so it may be no surprise that he ended up burying himself in a decades-old crime. He was undaunted that many of the material witnesses were dead.“That is actually what I like about it,” he said, giving a pat to one of the sibling bulldogs, Ivan and Boris, who accompany him to his office every day. “It is on the borderline between journalism and history. In history everybody is dead or heading in that direction, yet new understandings emerge.”His interest in a kind of frozen history is etched by a horse’s head that seems to have rammed itself through a wall above his desk, a desk that hosts the head of a monkey. Mr. Morris said he likes shopping at the Paris taxidermy store Deyrolle, although it’s hard not to see the animal heads as totems of his preoccupation with the morbid.In matters MacDonald he was schooled by Harvey Silverglate, a friend and lawyer who lives in Cambridge and was lead counsel in the MacDonald case for many years. “I didn’t mean to get him interested, but he was fascinated by what happened because of his background as an investigator,” Mr. Silverglate said. Mr. Morris said he didn’t have much luck pushing a movie on the subject, even after he won an Oscar for “The Fog of War.”In the new book he outlines his plans for a studio executive, and she stops him cold. “ ‘We can’t make that.’ I asked why. ‘Because he’s guilty,’ she said. ‘The man killed his family.’ And I said, ‘But he might be innocent.’ And she said, ‘No, he killed his family.’ ”Mr. Morris, who often writes for the opinion pages of The New York Times, then proposed a multipart serial on the case. He was rebuffed, eventually deciding to write the book instead, one that adds more questions than it answers.“With ‘The Thin Blue Line’ there was a feeling of closure,” he said, pointing out that Randall Dale Adams, sentenced for the murder of a Dallas police officer, was exonerated and released from prison a year after the movie came out. But for the MacDonald case, “the more I investigated, and I investigated for years, you would see the evidence pointing in one direction rather than another,” he said. “I know what happened. In this case it’s not that it became muddier. There is always a hope. I felt so close, but I couldn’t bring it to some satisfactory resolution.”He does argue convincingly that a witness, Helena Stoeckley, a known drug user, confessed repeatedly that she was the woman in the floppy hat mentioned by one of the investigators, who spotted her in the area on the way to the crime scene. But when she was called to testify in the case, she said she was never there. (Ms. Stoeckley died in 1983.) Mr. Morris uncovers an episode of her supposed intimidation by prosecutors, which may be part of the evidence presented this month at Mr. MacDonald’s hearing. “It would be wonderful to have interviewed her and so many others on film,” Mr. Morris said wistfully.If the dead aren’t talking, some of the living take a beating in Mr. Morris’s book. Although he says he holds the tenets of journalism in high regard — the pursuit of truth and the music of fact — he finds two of its practitioners highly wanting with respect to the MacDonald case. In the book he suggests that Mr. McGinniss, who lived and worked next to the defense team, was callow and opportunistic, a writer who traveled “a slippery slope of tergiversation, opportunism and self-interest.” This is famously well-covered territory, of course, in Janet Malcolm’s New Yorker article and later book, “The Journalist and the Murderer” (1990), which both begin with this indelible line: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible.”Mr. Morris finds some of the basis of her critique — that journalism itself is morally compromised and built on deception — appalling. “Janet Malcolm wrote about Joe McGinniss as if he were representative of journalism per se, and I respectfully disagree,” he said. “There was something very pathological in the relationship between McGinniss and his subject.”“I despise versions of postmodernism that suggest that there is no such thing as truth, that the truth is up for grabs, relative and subjective,” he added. “Narrative does not trump all; it does not trump the facts. The facts are immutable. You may not be able to apprehend them or they may be elusive, but they are there.” (Ms. Malcolm declined to comment because she has not read Mr. Morris’s book.)Mr. McGinniss said that Mr. Morris did not attempt to contact him, and Mr. Morris said that Mr. McGinniss did not respond to his e-mails. But Mr. McGinniss, whose book “Fatal Vision” is about to be reprinted and issued for the first time as an e-book, said he is comfortable with his conduct and conclusions.“There is no question in my mind that he did it, and that it was proved in a court of law, and that every court that has looked at that jury verdict has upheld it,” he said, adding that he has been subpoenaed to appear at the hearing this month in North Carolina and that he “looks forward to going wherever I need to to play whatever small role I can play in keeping him where he belongs.”When Mr. Morris was informed that Mr. McGinniss will be testifying, something he had not known, he was visibly excited by the prospect. “I will be there.”Of course he will be, even though he is done with the book and now on to “The Unknown Known: The Life and Times of Donald Rumsfeld,” a documentary about the former secretary of defense.After giving me a short peek at some of the 35 hours of interviews with Mr. Rumsfeld, he dived back into the MacDonald case, offering a 15-minute soliloquy on a children’s hobby horse from the crime scene, a mysterious piece of evidence that has lodged itself in his mind. On the way out, the same model of hobby horse stands like a sentry in an office full of curios, dead animals and obsessions. “You can ride it if you want,” he said cheerfully.That isn’t going to happen — it’s too small, for one thing. But if anybody will be riding that hobby horse, it will be the man who found it on eBay after hours of searching.'"

"'12-09-03,'0','There was a connection, in Smith’s opinion, a bridge between London and New York. Not only did Robson team with Murray at the Olympics, she was chosen by him over 20-year-old Heather Watson, who had the higher ranking. Murray’s reasoning was based on Robson’s size, 5 feet 11 inches, and her left-handed serve and forehand.“You can just see that it’s given her a lot of confidence,” Smith said, and the packed crowd at Armstrong received more than a sampling of Robson’s game and grit. Had she capitalized on break-point chances in both sets with looks at second serves, she might have found herself in the quarterfinals.Still, this was just an introduction. “She’s going to be at the top of the women’s game,” Smith said.His hiring by the Lawn Tennis Association almost three years ago was, in effect, an attempt to sprinkle the Murray stardust over the rest of Britain’s long-suffering program. Smith coached Murray as a youngster in Scotland, so it was no coincidence that he hired Judy Murray, Andy’s mother, as Britain’s Fed Cup captain.Though Smith insisted that Murray “is too good not to win” a Grand Slam title, he said the Olympic breakthrough had already made him the motivational figure that Britain has been waiting for.“It’s not just his world standing but the way he’s transformed his body over the last four or five years,” Smith said.The message to Robson being: if quickness and footwork are her greatest challenges, something can be done about if she puts in the work. And if a body can be transformed, so can the fatalism that had long ago attached itself to Britain’s ability to produce — first and foremost — a Wimbledon champion.“I think already Laura is in much better shape than she was,” said Virginia Wade — the name Robson should get used to hearing if she uses this summer’s results as a springboard from her current ranking of 89. Wade was the last British woman to win Wimbledon, in 1977.As for Murray, even should he prevail in New York, he will next summer again confront the pressure of producing the first British Wimbledon men’s champion since Fred Perry in 1936.Wade, for her part, has no interest in the preservation of her distinction for as long as Perry’s. But as the years have passed, she knows, as a BBC broadcaster, the suffering has become much worse for young British players than for her having to watch them fail.“We’ve had good junior players, but the problem has been making the jump to the senior level,” Wade said. “The record has been so bad that you start to feel like it’s become a war you can’t win. If you don’t know what the experience of winning feels like, you start to say: If only I wasn’t injured. If only the wind wasn’t blowing against me.”Britain’s standard excuses have been related to the rainy climate that curtails the sport’s outdoor recreational appeal and Wimbledon’s grass courts that are part of tennis lore but are not the ideal developmental surface.That is why Robson’s success on the Flushing Meadows hard courts could be the impetus that drives her to join Murray in a more permanent partnership of regular contention.“When you’re 18 and on a high like she’s been on here, it’s inevitable that you come down,” Wade said. “You plateau and then you go up again.”Robson’s story is just beginning to be told, so there is no way of knowing if she can get to where Murray has gone, or how high is up. But here is the biggest news break so far of the long tennis summer: the sky over Wimbledon is no longer falling.'"

"'12-09-03,'0','But next week, the tech event calendar is largely blank — with the exception of an Apple news conference that is said to be scheduled for Sept. 12, where the company will reveal its latest iPhone, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who declined to be named because those plans had not yet been made public.“It seems that the rumor of an Apple announcement is having an effect on competitors’ announcements, unless it’s an amazing coincidence” that several events are scheduled this week and none the next, said Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst at Gartner.“It does make you wonder if Apple has thrown the industry a little bit off balance and taken away a little bit of their confidence,” he said.In past years it was common for technology companies to deliver product news at trade shows like the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Now some major companies have scaled back their presence at those conventions and followed Apple’s lead in running their own elaborate news conferences, hoping to grab the news media’s undivided attention.Fall product introductions are important to companies seeking to generate excitement ahead of the holiday shopping season. The fall has become especially jam-packed with news in recent years as both the number of companies involved and their product lines have grown, with the addition of players like Amazon and its Kindle products as well as all the companies building mobile devices based on Google’s Android operating system.This year is particularly intense because, in addition to Apple’s anticipated news, Microsoft is releasing a new version of its flagship Windows operating system, as it does roughly every three years. Along with a wave of new traditional-looking personal computers, the introduction of Windows 8 will bring with it an array of tablet computers powered by the software, including Microsoft’s own Surface tablet, due for release Oct. 26.And later this fall, Apple is expected to unveil a smaller version of its iPad with a 7.85-inch screen.“You’re getting all sorts of maneuvering by companies around the time they have to have Christmas products out there,” said Michael Mace, a former marketing executive at Apple and Palm who has a new start-up called Zekira. “I’ve got to have everything in shops in mid-November. Do I get more attention if I announce before other guys or after? How long before? If I do it in September, does stuff look like it’s gotten old?”With Apple’s record of success now, the dates of its announcements are to be avoided — much as it is best to schedule around the debut of a surefire blockbuster from a competing Hollywood studio. Products announced after Apple’s could be subject to uncomfortable comparisons or accusations of copying, if they are noticed at all.“I would personally want to stay away from it unless I thought I had some killer product that I thought was going to be a devastating winner,” Mr. Mace said.Google, which owns Motorola Mobility, has already tried to upstage Apple. In June it scheduled an event about its mapping services just five days before Apple presented mapping software for the iPhone that will replace Google’s technology. But Google drew some criticism for not actually having much new to say.This week is especially important for Nokia, whose newer Lumia mobile devices have had tepid sales despite an aggressive marketing campaign. Accompanied by its partner Microsoft, Nokia will be showing smartphones with software that will let users swap files among phones, according to a person briefed on the company’s plans, who declined to be named because the plans were not yet public.Tero Kuittinen, an independent mobile analyst and vice president of Alekstra, a company that helps consumers reduce their phone bills, said it was crucial for Nokia to get ahead of Apple in order to send the message that its smartphones look and behave very differently from the iPhone.“The only possible vulnerability that Apple has is that the look and feel of its phones is starting to stagnate,” Mr. Kuittinen said. “What Nokia’s hoping to do is shape the discussion and have consumers ask, ‘Do I really want to have yet another look-alike device?’ ”'"

This is the third consecutive time that the cap has been reached, and the earliest.These visas, known as U visas, grant victims and their close relatives temporary legal status and work eligibility for at least four years. The program, which has built-in safeguards against fraud, has proved a valuable tool for encouraging immigrant victims to come forward and testify against their attackers.Victims’ advocates and law enforcement officials are worried that the suspension in issuing visas until the new fiscal year begins on Oct. 1 could discourage some women from speaking out and put some victims who have pending visa applications in further jeopardy.This dilemma is a direct consequence of the Congressional logjam over reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, the landmark 1994 law central to the nation’s efforts to combat domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. A strong bipartisan reauthorization bill approved by the Senate in May includes provisions to raise the yearly U visa cap from 10,000 to 15,000.Instead of embracing the Senate’s work, unfortunately, House Republicans pushed through a regressive measure that omits the Senate’s U visa increase, along with new protections for gay, bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse. The House bill also calls for eliminating the existing ability of U visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three years, reducing the incentive for frightened victims to come out of the shadows.Speaker John Boehner and his Republican colleagues blame the Democratic-led Senate for the stalled reauthorization. The real problem remains the refusal of House Republicans to let their chamber vote on the Senate bill and their insistence on an approach that puts politics and prejudices before the needs of domestic violence victims and public safety.'"
"'12-09-04,'0','Attendance at the Open on Friday was a tournament-best 62,362, with a record 37,688 people attending the day session and 24,674 for the night session. The crowds this year are on track to outpace last year’s daily average of 27,768 fans and are a far cry from the 24,590 average in 2001 and 19,305 fans in 1991, before Arthur Ashe Stadium opened.This year’s record attendance has been fueled by increased bleacher seating on the outer courts, which now all seat at least 340 spectators each, and Court 17, the fourth-largest court at the Open, now accommodating 2,800 fans.The Open is the marquee event for the United States Tennis Association, the national governing body for the sport, which relies heavily on its revenue from ticket sales and deals with sponsors to fund its activities year round. U.S.T.A. officials are happy to announce record attendance figures, but they are aware that the tennis center in its current form is too confined for the tens of thousands of fans who attend each session during the two-week tournament.“There are times during the day when it can be uncomfortably crowded, and we’ll change that because we want our fans to have a great experience,” said Gordon Smith, the executive director of the U.S.T.A. “They love to come — 700,000 a year come — and if we can make it better, we will.”The U.S.T.A. has approval from the city to allow thousands more fans on the site now, but Smith said, “We self-limit ourselves because we know it’s not comfortable if we were to do that.”Don’t expect any quick fixes to the crowding. In addition to exploring how to put a roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium, the U.S.T.A. is waiting for approvals from various city agencies so it can undertake a six-year, $500 million overhaul of the tennis center. Renovations will allow an additional 10,000 fans to attend day sessions during the first week of the tournament and relieve the crowding around the East Entrance and the main thoroughfare to Arthur Ashe Stadium.The plans include knocking down the 6,000-seat grandstand court near the busy East Entrance and building a new 8,000-seat grandstand court with a food court in the little-used southwest corner of the property. Some outside courts’ seating capacity will swell to 1,500 spectators, and Louis Armstrong Stadium will be rebuilt with 15,000 seats, up from its current capacity, about 10,000. Several courts will be shifted in order to create wider walkways.These changes — the new grandstand, the larger Armstrong Stadium, the wider promenade and so on — will allow yet more people to attend the Open, Smith said, though not for a while. If all goes well, the U.S.T.A. will not get final approval to start construction until the fourth quarter of 2013.Although most New Yorkers and sports fans are accustomed to thick crowds, the Open is a rare sporting event known for its pleats, Champagne offerings, luxury brand-name sponsors and leisurely pace. It is normally remembered as being more salmon than sardine can.“It’s hard enough with a stroller,” Saritha Muthuswamy said Saturday, leaning on said baby carrier as her 2-year-old relaxed and her 7-year-old scampered around the grounds. Muthuswamy, who was visiting from Boca Raton, Fla., said that she had to check her stroller at many of the stadiums and tote her bags and children in separately.“It gets really bad when it gets hot,” she added, as it was Saturday when the temperature approached 90 degrees.Her friend Anu Ramasamy, who visited the Open with her two children, nodded in agreement and suggested the inclusion of sprinklers and water stations, similar to those in large theme parks.“But it’s kind of like Disney World,” said Ramasamy, of Short Hills, N.J. “You expect it to be crazy.”In previous years, the families attended evening sessions, and they said this was the first year they had braved the day matches with their children in tow.“I think we’ll stick to the nights,” Ramasamy said.Others are less concerned. The expansions thus far have aided the experience, said Carrie Zegarski, an architect in Warren, N.J., who has attended the Open since she was a child.“It’s much, much better than it used to be,” she said Monday.Ann Sayer, from Santa Cruz, Calif., has visited all four Grand Slam tournaments but said that Friday’s record crowd was awful.“There were lines for food, for water, for the ladies’ room, for everything,” Sayer said. “And when it gets into the 90s, you just want to bail.”Sayer was at the Open with her daughter, Caroline, an undergraduate at New York University. As the two stood in front of Arthur Ashe Stadium, they agreed that in spite of the plethora of people, they had been able to see great tennis.“But once you sit down, you’re scared to get up,” Caroline Sayer said. “There are just so many people.”Ann Sayer added: “I don’t see how they’re going to be able to add more people. It might be too many rats in the maze.”Some fans said that while sometimes a pain, the crowds at the Open are indicative of a positive trend: more interest in the sport of tennis.“I feel like the more the merrier,” said Jessica Verdicchio, a social worker from Montclair, N.J. “This is such a great facility, and they’ve been adding different things to it to make it more and more of an event. It’s great for people to be able to see tennis in person rather than just on TV.”She added, “It’s all part of the experience.”'"
"'12-09-04,'0','He sought emergency medical attention in Miami and underwent extensive tests. On May 23 in Los Angeles, he had a heart procedure — a cardiac catheter ablation — in an attempt to resolve a form of arrhythmia.Fish has been open about the psychological challenges that he is facing. The possibility of his heart racing can also create anxiety that makes it more difficult to control the condition.“He’s one of my good friends,” said Justin Gimelstob, the former player who is now a commentator and a board member on the ATP Tour. “I know that it’s part physical, part emotional. One works from the other. You get stressed, the heart races. The heart races, it stresses you out.”Fish returned to the circuit in late June at Wimbledon, where he reached the fourth round, and skipped the London Olympics to focus on the summer hardcourt circuit and the United States Open. But his Open came to an abrupt halt Monday.“He arrived here this morning with every intention of playing, but at some point he had some sort of weird feeling and because of his history, he went in and saw the doctor and the doctor didn’t want even to risk it,” Fish’s agent, John Tobias, said.Fish’s coach, Mark Knowles, said they were scheduled to practice in the late morning at Flushing Meadows but never made it to the practice court because of Fish’s concerns.“There was a lot of conversation with the medical team,” Knowles said. “But ultimately no matter how big the match is or how special the occasion, health comes first.”Knowles said he was “not comfortable” discussing the particulars of Fish’s condition.“I think it’s for Mardy to talk about that,” Knowles said. “But obviously I’m his coach and more importantly I’m his friend, and I can tell you that this was a match he’s been looking forward to and a match he has been working toward. And when you get the chance to play arguably the greatest player of all time on Labor Day Monday, this is the Super Bowl of our sport. So he’s obviously very disappointed.”According to Tobias, Fish was deeply conflicted about his decision to withdraw.“He was like, ‘I can’t believe I’m not going to be able to do this,’ ” Tobias said. “He was like, ‘I could walk out there right now, and I think I could play fine.’ He couldn’t even talk about it.”Fish’s withdrawal leaves his close friend, the retiring Andy Roddick as the only American man left in singles. Fish’s decision caught several people by surprise, including Jim Courier, the United States Davis Cup captain.“I haven’t spoken to Mardy since yesterday, and I was as surprised as anyone else he wasn’t able to play today,” Courier said. “I think it was a big scare for him. I think he’s in a period where he has to figure out how to be at peace with his medical condition and how to be comfortable going out and putting himself in a stressful situation. But I think we’ll see plenty more of Mardy Fish.”Fish will not, however, be part of the Davis Cup team that will travel to Spain next week for the semifinals in Gijon. The team, which was picked before Fish withdrew, is expected to be composed of the singles players John Isner and Sam Querrey and the doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan.Beating Spain on clay in Spain is perhaps the toughest task in tennis, but it will certainly be less daunting without Nadal, the world’s leading clay-court player and seven-time French Open champion. Nadal, who has not played competitively since losing in the second round of Wimbledon to Lukas Rosol, said Monday that doctors had advised him to take an additional two months off to allow his ailing left knee to heal.But Spain should still have excellent clay-court players, No. 5 David Ferrer and No. 12 Nicolas Almagro, in singles.“Look, Spain beat us last year without Rafa, so we know we’re the heavy underdogs,” Courier said, referring to the United States’ loss to Spain last year in Austin, Tex. “Either way you look at it they have a lot of depth, but he’s the greatest clay-court player in the last 30 or 40 years, so of course, it’s a better look on paper for us. But having said that, I was looking forward to our guys lacing it up against Rafa and seeing how we do because we’ve had success against great players on the road this year.”The United States team, with Fish and Isner playing singles, upset Federer and Switzerland in the first round this season and then, with Isner sweeping both his singles matches, upset Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and the host French in the second round. But Isner was not nearly that sharp at the Open, losing very late in the evening in the third round in five sets to Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany.“I think fatigue makes cowards of us all and causes bad choices,” said Courier, who attributes much of Isner’s struggles to an overpacked schedule. “I’m not saying John played cowardly tennis, but I think his shot selection has been slightly too erratic. I think when you have a tired mind and tired legs, you make poor choices.”It is likely that Nadal will not play again until next season, but his announced timeline leaves open the possibility that he could return in November for the elite eight-man ATP World Tour Finals in London or perhaps the Davis Cup final if Spain can defeat the United States without him.“We might not see him until 2013,” Courier said. “But the main thing for him is just to think long term and make sure he’s 100 percent healthy and confident. It’s a parallel to Mardy. He needs to think long term, too. It’s tougher for Mardy because he’s older than Rafa, but the equation is the same.”'"
"'12-09-04,'0','Politics seemed always in sight for Mr. Kilpatrick, who as a young child dreamed of living in Detroit’s mayoral mansion. His mother, Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, was a seven-term congresswoman and a chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus; her career was seen as a casualty of her son’s troubles when she lost re-election in 2010.Mr. Kilpatrick was 26 years old when he joined the Michigan Legislature in 1996. When he was elected mayor of Detroit in 2001, many hoped that he would lead the economically depressed city toward revival. He landed speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention in 2000 and 2004. Some talked about him as a future senator or vice-presidential choice, said Steve Hood, a political consultant in Detroit whose brother, Nicholas Hood III, ran against Mr. Kilpatrick in his first mayoral race.“They bought into the whole package,” he said of voters’ faith in Mr. Kilpatrick back then. “They thought the sky was the limit.”But many of Mr. Kilpatrick’s achievements were overshadowed by scandal and the perception by some that a collision of youth and power had sent his career spiraling.At times, his bodyguards numbered nearly two dozen. He was dogged by rumors about wild parties. There were questions about a Lincoln Navigator leased for his wife with city money and accusations that he dismissed police officers who were investigating his security team.“They brought him up from the minor league too soon,” said Adolph Mongo, a political consultant in Detroit who worked on Mr. Kilpatrick’s successful re-election campaign in 2005. “He should have got some more seasoning. And now he’s in a fight for his life.”In 2008, Mr. Kilpatrick resigned after text messages, obtained and published by The Detroit Free Press, showed that he had had a romantic relationship with his chief of staff. He had testified to the contrary amid whistle-blower lawsuits against the city that were later settled for $8.4 million in his effort to keep the affair secret. Mr. Kilpatrick pleaded guilty to state obstruction of justice charges, agreed to pay $1 million in restitution to the City of Detroit and served 99 days in jail.In 2010, Mr. Kilpatrick was back in court on charges of violating probation by hiding assets and asserting that he could afford only $6 a month in restitution payments. For that, he served 14 months in prison.Then came the bombshell. While Mr. Kilpatrick was still behind bars, Barbara L. McQuade, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, announced an indictment against him and four members of his inner circle — including his father, Bernard Kilpatrick, and a city contractor, Bobby Ferguson. It asserted that the group, referred to in the indictment as the Kilpatrick Enterprise, had for years been financially enriching itself through shakedowns, kickbacks and bid-rigging schemes.Mr. Kilpatrick was also accused of spending donations to a charity, the Kilpatrick Civic Fund, on personal expenses like golf equipment and yoga lessons.Mr. Kilpatrick, who now lives with his wife and three children in the Dallas area and has been making a living by speaking at churches across the country, has called the accusations a “classic federal shotgun case where we’re just going to shoot everything we possibly can at you and see what sticks.”When asked at the August event with journalists whether he was preparing himself for the possibility of a guilty verdict, Mr. Kilpatrick replied: “My problem has never been how to handle loss. I think what I have to prove to Kwame Kilpatrick is how to handle success.”'"
"'12-09-04,'0','Moody’s Investors Service cut the European Union’s credit outlook to negative on Monday, reflecting the risks to Germany, France, Britain and the Netherlands, the four countries in the group with AAA ratings, which account for about 45 percent of the group’s budget revenue.Moody’s lowered the outlook on the union’s AAA long-term bond rating from stable, according to a statement released late Monday in Frankfurt. It also changed to negative from stable its outlook on the provisional AAA rating for the European Union’s medium-term note program.The change “reflects the negative outlook on the AAA ratings of the member states with large contributions to the E.U. budget,” Moody’s said. “The creditworthiness of these member states is highly correlated, as they are all exposed, albeit to varying degrees, to the euro area debt crisis.”Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany told a crowd of beer drinkers in Bavaria on Monday that Germany must show solidarity with Europe, and indicated that she would back a more active role for the European Central Bank to fight the debt crisis. Her nation shoulders the largest cost of bailing out weaker governments.Risks of a downgrade to the European Union’s sovereign debt rating come from a “deterioration in the creditworthiness of E.U. member states,” Moody’s said. “Additionally, a weakening of the commitment of the member states to the E.U. and changes to the E.U.’s fiscal framework that led to less conservative budget management would be credit negative.”'"

"'12-09-04,'0','BILLY JOEL The moment is ripe to re-evaluate and shamelessly mine this man’s work. I heard you use the word “uptown” on “She’s So Mean,” and I got shivers, Rob! And “Radio,” what a number that one is. What radio station isn’t going to want to play a song named for them? (Do you guys have one called “Person”? Just checking! Doing what a manager does.) But “Radio” bops hard, and, Rob, you’re not singing too tensely. Besides, that sock-hop energy is what’s missing right now.DANCE-ROCK So you guys finally found a pulse! Nice to feel the shoulders moving this time out. “Put Your Hands Up” is that classic disco-rock I miss, and “Our Song” — well, let me just say Rick Springfield meeting the Strokes at the Jersey Shore. That’s some party!ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC Shorten the name to M20, take the microphone out of Rob’s hand and get him a vocoder. Of course all of these songs would have to be scrapped.Or, barring all of that, Serletic’s available to do the usual and polish these bad boys up. Drop a line when you’ve given it some thought. JON CARAMANICAAnimal Collective’s music contains a great deal: stereo-panning electronic strafes, tom-toms, charismatic nonsense chants and polyrhythms, crosshatched bursts of energy everywhere. Possibly no person’s perception of this group is like the next person’s. So I ask: Does your attention wander from “Centipede Hz,” the band’s particularly dense 10th record? If so, when, and why? Is it because, at nearly an hour, it is so long? Or is it because there’s too much of it in another sense?I won’t speak for you, but I can get along with “Moonjock,” the first track, which begins with a whomping electronic beat in seven, jumps to an open-throated, harmonized chorus about a family drive (“In the back of our old car, never going to far/In the back of our old car, I think we’ve gone too far”), changes briefly to a faster tempo in a different rhythm, moves through an eight-bar break with insane layers of echo and vocal traces, and eventually arrives at a new strain where the vocal repetition kicks in: “And then we ran out again and then we ran out again! We ran it out, ran it out!” That’s the basic sound of this group: coordinated joy in odd rhythm, as if all its songs began as complicated summer-camp clapping games. The band members inhabit their music, or it inhabits them; it’s bursting out of them.But by the next track, “Today’s Supernatural,” I feel fatigued by the grasping weirdness. I need this drum-circle to go somewhere else. Or at least one quadrant of it. Different Animal Collective albums have used different groupings of its four members; everyone’s on hand for this one, which has not been the case since “Strawberry Jam,” two studio albums ago, in 2007. And different sonic or vocal elements float to the top and dominate: sometimes the balance tips toward one of the two principal singers, Avey Tare and Panda Bear, a k a Dave Portner and Noah Lennox.The last studio album, “Merriweather Post Pavilion,” had comparatively more open space, medium tempos, and a lot more Panda Bear, who restricts himself emotionally as he tries to make his limited voice beautiful. This record is dominated, even saturated, by Avey Tare, who does not. With the exception of a few tracks sung by Panda Bear and one by Deakin (Josh Dibb) — Panda Bear’s almost reggaelike “Rosie Oh” being the one song in which I hear a creditably new wrinkle on the band’s formulas of weirdness, and will return to — this is Avey Tare’s album.Mr. Portner, generally, sings louder, more continuously and more hyperactively than he needs to. His pitch is true, and he works to make his vocal melodies jump over harmonically static backgrounds, but he uses a woozy-sounding digital filter to destabilize the experience of hearing him; he jabbers and shouts, stuffing syllables into the lines, childlike outsider-art logorrhea about fruit (“Applesauce”) and long-distance communication (“Mercury Man”).He’s a ringleader, an inviter. And as the album progresses, as if he’s afraid of losing you, he keeps singing questions, lots of them, rhetorical or specific: “Does solidarity breed from a good foundation?” “Why am I still looking for a golden age?” “Where exactly is my heart and where does it start?” “Can I always be like mercury?” “Like-minded people, do they feel afraid?” “What if I should wake up and find dudes waiting in lines and scrounging for berries?” “I’m going hiking, are you coming hiking?” I’m sorry. Not this time. BEN RATLIFFThe most inviting thing about the electro-acoustic composer Jason Lescalleet’s new album, “Songs About Nothing,” is its framework. It has been constructed on top of another one: the aggressive final record by the American indie band Big Black, from 1987, whose title was two-thirds the same but unprintable. The cover of the new record uses the same pink lettering on lime-green background; its 13 tracks — on the first of its two discs anyway — all run to precisely the same length as Big Black’s, and its titles play obscurely on Big Black’s through word games and perfect or near-anagrams. Listen closely: In a few places you will hear a couple of syllables of the singing, or one guitar downstroke, or four notes of a bass line, sampled from the earlier album.So it’s kind of a tribute? No. Despite its cross-references or para-paraphrases, despite some comparable aggression, this music has nothing to do with Big Black’s spasmodic guitar rock, or its misanthropic lyrics. (This music has almost no words.)And no again to almost every other question you might ask as you seek the album’s organizing principle. Mr. Lescalleet makes his work out of decaying analog tape and corrupted, often slowed-down samples, feedback and field recordings; it represents a categorically mixed and definitely post-John Cage idea of music. Sonically and structurally he doesn’t make it easy for the listener, and the first time around you may wonder what there is to hold on to, in the absence of musical landmarks that even Big Black, transgressive as they may have been, obeyed — intros and outros, crescendos, interludes, defining rhythms or tonal centers or moods. It can seem a little random or artless.The second time you’ll know more what to expect. You may come to admire, especially, Mr. Lescalleet’s counterintuition and seeming lack of fear, the clarity and strength of his gestures. This record is at least as bold as what it builds on.During stretches of “Songs About Nothing” there can seem to be a meditative or sacred or philosophical subtext, as you hear stretches of breathing organized into a music-concrète loop, birds and crickets in the woods, or some Gregorian chant.But the breathing, in “The Loop,” is interrupted, through a hard edit, by the sound of a woman coming home and yelling, in a tired voice, “I’m back. You look cute!” The birds in the woods, in “I Killed Another Day,” are allowed to be themselves for about a minute until a car slowly approaches, tearing into the peaceful sound-space, and stops. (Its wheels seem to park right on the microphone.) The Gregorian chant is heard under dripping sounds and then, as the track “Friday Night in a Catholic Home” switches over to “10 Amp Waves,” aggressive digital distortion, slowed down and reverbed.Mr. Lescalleet will not let your perceptions and definitions rest. He will give his music a certain character and then rip it away from you. By the way: “10 Amp Waves,” in the track ordering, corresponds to Big Black’s “Pavement Saw.” (Think about it, anagrammatically.) “Friday Night in a Catholic Home” corresponds to “Fish Fry”; it begins with what sounds like the crackling hiss of something in a pan.That’s the first disc. There’s a lot of action on those tracks, so dynamically aggressive that you should not listen to it with headphones. The second is more measured. It is a single 43-minute track, “The Future Belongs to No One,” including slow pitch-shifts and rumbles, mysterious and beautiful; church bells, burning wood, humming engines and chants from political rallies; and decelerated samples of two songs with bummer messages, enfolded into and growing out the music’s atmosphere: Terry Riley’s “You’re No Good” and Depeche Mode’s “It’s No Good.” Is Mr. Lescalleet telling us something?

"'12-09-04,'0','AMMAN, Jordan — King Abdullah II of Jordan moved quickly to block a recent increase in fuel prices after angry protesters took to the streets over the weekend, raising the specter of renewed social and political unrest in the cash-poor kingdom.Already shaken by protests inspired by other revolts in the region, Jordan, a country of six million, is now contending with an influx of refugees from Syria, putting further strain on the country’s finances and stability.The Jordanian government had mandated a 10 percent increase in the price of 90-octane gasoline and diesel fuel as part of an effort to reduce the subsidy burden on the state budget, in line with International Monetary Fund recommendations. The increase went into effect on Saturday.By Saturday night, about 600 people, led by the Muslim Brotherhood, were demonstrating here in the capital. About 3,000 people staged demonstrations in Irbid, a large city north of Amman, and protests took place to the south in the cities of Maan and Karak. Some of the demonstrators displayed strong antigovernment slogans.On Sunday, 89 members of Jordan’s 120-seat Parliament signed a motion of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh over the fuel prices and “because of recent appointments in top posts based on nepotism,” according to Petra, the official Jordanian news agency. King Abdullah then ordered Mr. Tarawneh to “freeze” the government’s decision to raise fuel prices, immediately canceling the 10 percent increase, Petra reported.Early last year, Jordanians presented the first serious challenge to the rule of King Abdullah, a crucial American ally who inherited the throne 13 years ago, staging street demonstrations to demand democratic reform, more subsidies and an end to corruption.'"
"'12-09-04,'0','Priory Hall is only the worst example. More than 2,000 developments begun during that period have turned into “ghost estates,” unfinished or vacant housing projects with 10 or more units that were meant to create communities but are now quietly rotting. Others, built under a system that allowed developers to “self-certify” — meaning that they could unilaterally declare, with only minimal government oversight, that their properties complied with building codes — are now falling apart, even while residents live there.But Priory Hall stands apart because of the outrageousness of its inhabitants’ plight. Temporarily staying in housing provided by the Dublin City Council, its residents are still required to keep up mortgage payments on their deteriorating apartments. Meanwhile, the council, which was ordered by a court to take responsibility for the tenants and has already spent more than $2 million housing them, has gone back to court to avoid paying any more.A spokesman for the council said he could not comment on a pending court case.Meanwhile, Priory Hall’s developer, Tom McFeely, a former Irish Republican Army hunger striker from Northern Ireland who became a real estate mogul, recently had his $12 million house in Dublin seized after he defaulted on his mortgage. He has been declared bankrupt (against his will), given suspended sentences, fined and repeatedly ordered by a judge to make repairs to Priory Hall, to little avail.Mr. McFeely has referred to his tenants as “begrudges” and “jumped-up Hitlers.” They do not like him much, either: in a confrontation outside court one day this spring, one resident snarled that Mr. McFeely could not even “build a snowman.”Neither Mr. McFeely nor his lawyers responded to e-mail and telephone requests for interviews. But in previous interviews, he has presented himself as a victim of anti-Northern Ireland snobbery and declared that what he did was no different from what every other Irish developer did.“A lot of the other developers are bad-mouthing me because they think I’m bringing the heat on them,” he told The Guardian. Using Northern Irish slang for “informant,” he added, “But I’m no tout.”The one thing that no one disputes is how bad things are now at Priory Hall, about as forlorn a place as you could imagine. Waist-high weeds sprout from cracks in the sidewalks. Holes seem to be punched into walls randomly. Ripped-up tarpaulins covering unfinished repair work flap in the breeze. A skittish security guard barks something into a walkie-talkie before warning visitors to beware of the rats.Back in 2005, his head turned by a glossy brochure and an attractive showroom apartment, Mr. Usher, an accountant who is now 33, put down a deposit before the complex was even built. “That was kind of standard practice back then,” he said, leading the way into his apartment, now eerily empty and dank (there is no electricity), with rubble on the porch, a ripped-up bathtub and a large hole over the front door.In 2007, he moved in, with the complex still under construction and rife with problems. “It was an absolute eyesore,” Mr. Usher said, “and we had problems with the plumbing, the heating, the boiler that you wouldn’t expect to happen in a new home.”One morning, the family living below woke him up, frantic: water was pouring through the ceiling in their toddler’s room. Another resident, Stephanie Meehan, found that all the windows in her duplex apartment had been installed incorrectly and that whenever it rained, the apartment flooded.Though the place was full of workers, they seemed to be the sort of workers who placed blame for the problems on work done by other people. “The talk about taking shortcuts — this was one big shortcut,” Mr. Usher said. “But we had a large mortgage on the house and nowhere to go.”In 2009, the City Council, which owned 26 of the apartments for low-income tenants, moved its tenants out, saying it had concerns about fire safety. In 2011, the company that had been insuring Priory Hall said it was withdrawing its policy. “There were so many problems — fire defects, problems with the roof materials, fungus growth — that nobody would insure us,” Mr. Usher said.That October, the council ordered everyone to evacuate, saying that Mr. McFeely had failed to adhere to fire codes and that Priory Hall was a fire waiting to happen. “It was a Dunkirk-type situation,” Mr. Usher said.In a written response to questions, a spokesman said it was not the council’s responsibility to ensure that the complex conformed to fire and building codes.“The responsibility in Ireland for the safety of new buildings rests with the builder/developer,” the spokesman wrote, explaining that developers receive “fire safety certificates” and adding that “if the building is built in accordance with the information filed in the application, then the building will conform with the regulations.”Mr. Usher’s bank has not been sympathetic to the fact that he can neither live in nor sell his house, and he is required by law to make good on his mortgage. He does not know what to do.“We planned to start a family here, and our life’s been put on hold,” Mr. Usher said. He got back in his car, and the security guard locked the gates behind him. “To be honest, I despise the place at this stage,” he said. “It’s more a noose around my neck than a home.”'"
"'12-09-04,'0','Even before the British bank Barclays admitted in June that its employees had tried to manipulate Libor, there were a number of lawsuits filed by cities and municipal agencies seeking damages from large banks for manipulating Libor. But while those cases were filed by private sector lawyers, the public officials are looking at bringing more wide-ranging lawsuits on behalf of the states. The Justice Department has coordinated with the states and is leading its own investigation.The government officials are hoping that their cases will be bolstered by new settlements between regulators and individual banks that are suspected of participating in the manipulation. Most of the more than one dozen banks involved in setting Libor have said in official filings that they are in discussions with regulators about their involvement in the Libor process.Libor is supposed to represent how much banks are paying for short-term loans from other banks. It is determined by the British Bankers Association after a daily poll of the world’s largest banks. It then serves as a benchmark for rates paid by consumers and businesses on everything from mortgages to derivatives to student loans.Barclays said in its settlement that it and other banks pushed Libor down artificially during the financial crisis to appear more healthy. Barclays also admitted that its traders tried to manipulate Libor at other points in order to sweeten particular financial deals. Barclays paid $450 million to settle the charges.The financial products used by states and local governments are especially vulnerable to an artificially lowered rate.Ms. Cowell, a 44-year-old Democrat and former business consultant who is running for another four-year term, was aware of the potential implications of the Libor case for North Carolina almost as soon as the Barclays settlement was announced on June 27. The next Monday, at her weekly staff meeting, she asked her office’s lawyers and investment officers to begin looking into it.The inquiry has focused primarily on two areas of the state’s finances.One was the state’s public pension plans, which in North Carolina are overseen by the treasurer. A state money manager began identifying bonds held by the state pension fund and money market fund investments that derived their value from Libor.In July, lawyers from the treasurer’s office took part in a conference call on the topic with pension funds in other states. Ms. Cowell and members of her staff have found a few investments held by the $76 billion pension fund that were tied to Libor, but they have now determined that the losses were most likely “pretty small.”The other, more significant area where Ms. Cowell began looking for losses was in a kind of financial contract that many states use, known as an interest rate swap. States use swaps when they want to issue a bond at a floating interest rate but protect themselves from future swings in rates. In a standard swap, a state makes a regular payment to its bank and gets a payment back that is determined by the level of Libor. If Libor was lower, the payments will be, too.North Carolina had two major swaps at the time the benchmark was suspected of being rigged. Together, the two swaps were tied to $1.3 billion of bonds that were issued in 2002 and 2005. The banks on the other side of these contracts included Bank of America, of Charlotte, N.C., and JPMorgan Chase & Company based in New York, both of which are involved in setting Libor.The challenge facing North Carolina and other states is that there is no agreement yet on how much the banks actually manipulated Libor, and for how long. The lawsuits that have already been filed have estimated that the banks held Libor down by at least 30 basis points, or 0.30 percent, for three years. By one method of calculation, that could have meant losses for North Carolina of around $10 million on their swaps.Ms. Cowell said she assumed that as more banks settled with regulators, those numbers would become clearer. In the meantime, the treasurer’s office is working out formulas for losses that they can plug numbers into if and when new settlements are made public. At that point, Ms. Cowell also plans to share her work with other municipal agencies in North Carolina that held about 40 swaps during the period in question.“This is an unprecedented level of analysis, and an unprecedented wide spectrum of financial impact,” Ms. Cowell said.The inquiry could provide a political bump for Ms. Cowell, who is seeking another term as anti-Wall Street sentiment is running high. A graduate of the Wharton School of Business, she served on the Raleigh, N.C., City Council and then the state Senate before taking office in 2008. She cites among her accomplishments the state’s maintaining its status as one of eight with a AAA rating from the major credit rating agencies.North Carolina’s attorney general will make the final determination on whether the state will join existing lawsuits, proceed with its own case or take no action at all. The attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.But the office has been involved in many of the discussions with the treasurer’s staff, people involved in the meetings said.'"

"'12-09-05,'1','“He believes that when you’ve worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you,” Mrs. Obama said, her impassioned delivery drawing the crowd to its feet as it waved red, white and blue placards. “You reach back, and you give other folks the same chances that helped you succeed.”It was one of the few times Mrs. Obama came close to even a subtle reference to the very direct argument being made against her husband’s opponent here. She argued that Mr. Obama’s experience as president had taught him that “no amount of data or numbers will get you the right answer.” Her portrait of her husband was the inverse of the one that other Democrats have sketched of Mr. Romney, who former Gov. of said viewed the “American worker” as “just numbers on a spreadsheet.”As someone with whom she was “so young, so in love, and so in debt,” Mrs. Obama said, her husband believes “success isn’t about how much money you make. It’s about the difference you make in people’s lives.”Mrs. Obama’s was almost the only voice lacking an explicit anti-Romney edge, conveying a personal tone and touch after speeches that were personal in a different way when it came to the president’s opponent. As the other speakers undertook a program that amounted to a thundering response to the Republican convention last week in , Fla., they went after Mr. Romney on just about every conceivable issue.The keynote speaker, Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio, offered the overarching argument against Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative of Wisconsin.“Their theory has been tested. It failed. Our economy failed,” Mr. Castro said in what seemed to be the second-most rousing speech of the night for the Democratic audience. “The middle class paid the price. Your family paid the price. Mitt Romney just doesn’t get it.”After what has at times been a tentative approach to promoting the , perhaps Mr. Obama’s signature legislation, the program included a full-throated defense of the overhaul and the ’s decision to uphold it.And an woman, Stacey Lihn, took the stage with her toddler, Zoe, who has a , and said her daughter’s would run out if Mr. Romney won and followed through with his promise to get Mr. Obama’s health care law repealed. “But we’re also scared,” she said. “Governor Romney repealing health care reform is something we worry about literally every day.”The Democrats even got the spirit of Senator of into the act in a tribute video. It showed Mr. Kennedy in his 1994 debate with Mr. Romney during their Senate race, mocking Mr. Romney for his shifting position on rights and calling him “multiple choice.”The program never addressed the disappointment of many wavering Obama voters in the president’s handling of the economy, as Republicans will note. But the speakers pounded Mr. Romney on , on health care, on , on foreign policy, on the 2009 auto bailout and on his policies, which they said would benefit the rich at the expense of the working class and cause the kind of economic damage that they said Mr. Obama had worked to undo.Mr. Romney’s wealth was given full attention, with Gov. of referring to the Swiss bank account Mr. Romney no longer has by saying: “Swiss bank accounts don’t put cops on the beat or teachers in our classrooms. Swiss bank accounts never created American jobs.”Apparently concerned about alienating voters with too much negativity, Mr. Obama’s strategists were careful to ensure that speakers always included a positive element about Mr. Obama.“Mitt Romney is walking away from us,” Representative of New York said. “He walks with people who disrespect us and people who divide us and people who do not believe that the American dream means all of us. President Obama has walked with us for the last 12 years — in good times and in tough times — and right now we are going to walk with the president to the polls and onward to victory.”Mindful of the need to address a sometimes deflated group of liberal, grass-roots supporters, speakers stressed core party social issues like abortion rights and the president’s support for gay marriage.A group of Democratic women in the House of Representatives came to the stage together — led by Representative of , the minority leader — to criticize Republican moves against the so-called Fair Pay Act, which would make it easier for women to press discrimination cases, and various elements of the president’s health care overhaul, including its coverage of .When Mayor of Newark gave a speech introducing the party platform and its first-ever declaration of support for ,” the delegates broke into a standing ovation and cheers of “Cory!” and “U.S.A.!”“No matter who you are, no matter what color or creed, no matter how you choose to pray or who you choose to love,” Mr. Booker shouted, “if you are a citizen of the United States of America, you should be able to find a job that pays, you should be able to afford health care for your family, you should be able to retire with dignity and respect, and you should be able to give your children the kind of education that allows them to dream even bigger, to go ever farther and accomplish more than you could ever imagine.”'"

"'12-09-05,'1','Supporters credit him with bringing thousands of units of affordable housing and valuable services to the elderly and low-income families. “His interest was serving his constituents, and he liked power,” said Stephen B. Kaufman, a former Bronx Democratic assemblyman and a close friend of Mr. Lopez, who describes Mr. Lopez as “a tough guy who fought like a tiger for his cubs.”But others fault his tactics. “He in essence runs a plantation operation,” said Michael McKee, a Brooklyn tenant advocate. “If you kiss the ring and say, ‘Yes Vito, Yes Vito, Yes Vito,’ he may find an apartment for your relative or find you a job. But if you cross him, you’re the enemy.”Over the years, Mr. Lopez patched together three foundations of power.As head of the Assembly Housing Committee, he attracted campaign contributions from real estate developers and landlords. As Brooklyn Democratic boss, he had great sway in picking candidates for judgeships and filling vacant political offices. And as the de facto head of the multifaceted Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council, a nonprofit agency whose $120 million budget makes it one of the borough’s biggest providers of services and jobs, he had a plentiful reservoir of faithful voters and campaign workers.Now, though, scandal has darkened Mr. Lopez’s future.After he was accused of sexually harassing two women in his district office, the Assembly censured him and removed him as head of the Housing Committee. Then reports emerged that the Assembly had earlier approved a $135,000 settlement of harassment claims brought against him by two other women.With party leaders, including the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, clamoring for his resignation, he has surrendered his role as borough party leader, though he has denied the allegations against him and vowed to remain an assemblyman.Mr. Lopez did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this article. Gerald B. Lefcourt, his lawyer, declined to comment about the episode between Mr. Lopez and Mr. Sander, the former transportation official.After the transportation authority’s inspector general learned of the episode in 2009, it conducted an inquiry and then referred its findings to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, which declined to bring charges against Mr. Lopez.Mr. Sander did not dispute the interactions with Mr. Lopez, which were described by five people with direct knowledge of the investigation, but would not discuss them further.Mr. Lopez has long been circumspect about his personal background. He has said his paternal grandfather was born in Spain before moving to Italy. Many constituents think Mr. Lopez is Hispanic, a handy identity in what is now a heavily Hispanic district. He is actually of predominantly Italian heritage and speaks little Spanish.Growing up in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, the son of a photojournalist, Mr. Lopez went to Long Island University, telling some friends in all seriousness that he had received an athletic scholarship — in bowling. He earned a master’s degree in social work at Yeshiva University.Taking a job with the city, he was sent to a new senior center in Bushwick, an impoverished area. Before long, he was urging the creation of a political party for the elderly, declaring, “When you start to vote, then the politicians start to worry.”In 1973, he founded the Ridgewood Bushwick Senior Citizens Council. In 1984, with the Assembly seat open in the 53rd District, encompassing Bushwick and Williamsburg, he was elected and has served in the Assembly since.It is widely accepted in his district that he controls the Ridgewood Bushwick council. Until this year, Christiana Fisher, his campaign treasurer, ran the council. Angela M. Battaglia, his longtime girlfriend, is the housing director as well as a member of the City Planning Commission.The council has mushroomed into a vast network that embraces senior and youth centers, low-income housing and health care, among other programs, and employs close to 2,000 people. It receives millions of dollars in government contracts, many helped along by Mr. Lopez and his political allies.Over the years, various federal, state and city investigations have examined the organization and Mr. Lopez’s relationship to it. In 2010, the city’s Department of Investigation found that the Ridgewood Bushwick council had overlooked some fraudulent activity and suffered from a weak board. The council is contesting the suggestions of fraud.In agreements with the city and state, the organization overhauled its board in January and replaced Ms. Fisher with James Cameron, who had been chief operating officer. No criminal charges have been filed against the organization or Mr. Lopez.But the Rev. John Powis, who was pastor of St. Barbara’s Roman Catholic Church in Bushwick in the 1990s and worked to develop affordable housing, said it was almost impossible to get vacant sites because Mr. Lopez secured them for the senior council. “He wanted to rule an entire neighborhood,” the priest said.In 2005, after the Brooklyn Democratic leader, Assemblyman Clarence Norman Jr., was convicted of corruption charges, Mr. Lopez replaced him, giving him control of nominations for judicial candidates. Those familiar with his choices said that many were worthy, but that Mr. Lopez also found judgeships for friends and relatives, among them the brother of his girlfriend; the sister of Ms. Fisher; and one of his own daughters.He built good will for himself through Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners sponsored by the Ridgewood Bushwick council, as well as an annual taxpayer-financed picnic for the elderly at Sunken Meadow State Park.The senior council’s monthly newspaper, The Bushwick Observer, includes articles gushing about Mr. Lopez. One cover story showed his picture beneath the headline, “A Living Legend.”It has long been a practice that the organization closes on Election Day, so employees can vote for Mr. Lopez and his candidates, and get people to the polls.Nicole Marwell, an associate professor of public affairs and sociology at Baruch College, studied the Ridgewood Bushwick council for several years for a book she wrote. “They provide many worthwhile programs,” she said, while noting that “Mr. Lopez has an unusual degree of involvement for an elected official.”“I think Vito has done a lot of good in the community,” she added. “But he believes he’s right about everything. He doesn’t like to have discussions.”There are many stories of his punishing those who rejected his requests.In 2005, when Mr. Lopez was up for election as Brooklyn Democratic leader, Ralph Perfetto, a district leader, ran against him. He said Mr. Lopez never forgave him. One day, though, Mr. Lopez called him and asked him to vote for a Supreme Court judge Mr. Lopez was backing. Hoping to mend fences, he agreed to vote for Mr. Lopez’s choice.Even so, Mr. Perfetto was not forgiven. He said that if he raised his hand at meetings, Mr. Lopez would ignore him. “If you weren’t his little rubber stamp, you were nothing,” he said.Mr. Lopez often hangs out at his district office or at a drab clubhouse called the Bushwick United Democratic Club, which occupies space rented from the Ridgewood Bushwick council.Questions have long been raised about whether Mr. Lopez lives in his district, as required. He lists a Brooklyn address, but many people who know him say he resides with Ms. Battaglia at her Queens apartment. Mr. Lopez is separated from his wife, though they are not divorced.Some staff workers speak of his ceaseless demands. The Assembly’s censure report addressed to Mr. Lopez, in addition to substantiating the sexual harassment accusations, found that he required employees “to write to you about how much they loved their jobs and cared about you, and that you criticized their notes for being insufficiently effusive.”Four years ago, a young lawyer named Matthew Cowherd, who lived in Bushwick, dropped in on Mr. Lopez. Mr. Cowherd was accompanied by a fellow political volunteer, and they were looking to get involved with Mr. Lopez after starting a group called New Kings Democrats.Apparently perceiving potential competition, Mr. Lopez told them to go work in soup kitchens. Then he turned icy. “He let me know he knew the building I lived in, and that he knew it was zoned commercial,” Mr. Cowherd said, and that all he had to do was pick up the phone to have Mr. Cowherd evicted.“He proceeded to berate us,” Mr. Cowherd said, “and he told us we were not welcome.”'"
"'12-09-05,'1','So Mr. Ryan led the multiday, coordinated efforts to lash President Obama to the legacy of the last one-term Democratic president, Jimmy Carter.Even as the Democratic National Convention prepared to show a tribute video to Mr. Carter on Tuesday night, Mr. Ryan told supporters in Westlake, Ohio: “I remember a convention speech — I was a pretty young guy at the time. Remember Ronald Reagan talking about Jimmy Carter, asking, ‘Are you better off now than you were four years ago?’ ”The congressman spoke at a lectern adorned with a new sign asking, “Are You Better Off?” By the time he arrived in Iowa, the same message was repeated on two giant signs.“If we fired Jimmy Carter then, why would we rehire Barack Obama now?” he asked.A spokesman for the Obama campaign said the Romney-Ryan economic plan would return to policies that led to the financial crisis.“While Romney and Ryan may want to revise the past, they can’t make up their own facts,” the spokesman, Danny Kanner, said.Mr. Ryan’s visit to Ohio was the latest of many to a state of crucial importance to the Republican ticket; he has gone to lengths to emphasize his connections as a graduate of an Ohio college, and he added a new wrinkle on Tuesday, saying that Ohio and his native Wisconsin are economically “in the same boat.”“You know, we fish out of similar boats in the Great Lakes for great walleye,” Mr. Ryan riffed. “You’ve got bigger walleye here in Lake Erie than we do up in Lake Michigan, I’ll tell you that. I wouldn’t say yours is better tasting, but walleye is the best freshwater fish to eat bar none.”The crowd of about 2,000 was highly enthusiastic, giving Mr. Ryan sustained applause as he entered and shouting out throughout his speech.A pro-Obama voter also shouted out, after Mr. Ryan pinned responsibility on the president for last year’s downgrade of the nation’s credit rating.“Read the S&P report!” the man yelled, referring to the rating agency that issued the downgrade. “They blamed Republicans!”In three television interviews with network morning shows, Mr. Ryan was peppered on this issue and others from his convention speech that have drawn scrutiny. He responded with a repertoire of studies and counterpoints to bolster his case.Asked about Democratic accusations that the Republican ticket’s plan to cut taxes by 20 percent and make up lost revenues by ending deductions would mean a $2,000 tax increase for the middle class, Mr. Ryan rejected that conclusion, which was reached by a nonpartisan tax research group.He said lower tax rates would spur the economy. “Economic growth is the key to this, and one of the keys to economic growth is tax reform,” Mr. Ryan said on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”'"
"'12-09-05,'1','WASHINGTON — With the worst drought in half a century withering corn across the Midwest, agricultural experts on Tuesday urged international action to prevent the global spike in food prices from causing global hunger.The directors of three major United Nations food and agriculture programs sounded the alarm both on the immediate problem of high food prices and the “long-term issue of how we produce, trade and consume food in an age of increasing population, demand and climate change.”Agricultural production has fallen in a number of major crop exporters this summer. Sweltering heat and a severe drought have damaged the corn crop in the United States. Droughts have also hit Russia and Ukraine, hurting the wheat harvest, as well as Brazil, affecting soybean production.Low yields have translated into high prices. Last week, the World Bank reported that food prices climbed 10 percent from June to July, with the price of both corn and wheat jumping 25 percent to records. Soybean prices climbed 17 percent over the same period, and rice prices declined moderately, the Washington-based institution said.“We cannot allow these historic price hikes to turn into a lifetime of perils as families take their children out of school and eat less nutritious food,” Dr. Jim Yong Kim, who became president of the World Bank in July, said in a statement. “Countries must strengthen their targeted programs to ease the pressure on the most vulnerable population.”'"
"'12-09-05,'1','PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — Smarck Michel, a businessman who served for almost a year as Haiti’s prime minister after the United States restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power in the mid-1990s, died at his home here on Saturday. He was 75.The cause was a brain tumor, his son, Kenneth, said.Mr. Michel became prime minister in 1994 when a multinational military force led by the United States restored Mr. Aristide to the presidency after three years in exile. Mr. Aristide’s first term was cut short in 1991 when the army ousted him in a coup.The choice of Mr. Michel was seen as an effort to placate business leaders and members of Haiti’s middle and upper classes who felt threatened by the return of Mr. Aristide, a populist, left-leaning former Roman Catholic priest. Mr. Michel resigned almost a year later over opposition to his economic proposals, which included a privatization plan that was unpopular with Haiti’s poor majority.During Mr. Aristide’s first term, Mr. Michel served briefly as commerce and industry minister. He was dismissed from that post amid criticism of the government for not lowering the prices of food and other basic goods. Mr. Michel had instituted price controls, but they were widely ignored.Smarck Michel was born on March 29, 1937, in St. Marc, a port city north of Port-au-Prince, and moved around Haiti as a child because his father was serving in the Haitian armed forces.'"
"'12-09-05,'1','Creating a plan to develop idle buildings and vacant land in the four communities of East Granby, Windsor, Windsor Locks and Suffield that surround the 2,400-acre airport was a priority for Dannel Malloy, who became governor in 2011.“Somebody should have done this 20 years ago, 10 years ago, five years ago,” Mr. Malloy said of the decision to move management of the airport from the state’s Department of Transportation to the 11-member airport authority.A zone like the one created in Connecticut last year is hardly a new idea. Communities across the United States have begun aggressive programs to encourage development around airports, taking a cue from booming airports like Amsterdam’s Schiphol and Washington Dulles in Virginia. Recently, Atlanta successfully wooed the German automaker Porsche with $14 million in incentives to open its North American headquarters near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, at a site formerly used by Ford.“Leaders recognize the airport and its built-up areas are primary business assets to compete in the 21st century,” said John D. Kasarda, a co-author of “Aerotropolis: The Way We’ll Live Next,” a book about the urbanization of airports.Pittsburgh, though, is an example of the potential risks when a community relies too heavily on the fortunes of airlines. US Airways removed its hub from Pittsburgh in 2004 and reduced service again in 2008. Flights dwindled to 150 from 600 a day.During the hub’s heyday, 90 percent of the airlines’ travelers were changing planes at Pittsburgh International. Now most users begin or end their trips there. Much of the land that was part of the airport’s long-term economic plan remains unused. Only 250 acres have been developed and there is no airport business incentive program.“There are parallels between Bradley and Pittsburgh,” said Greg Lindsay, who wrote “Aerotropolis” with Mr. Kasarda. Both airport communities were onetime commercial linchpins and are now “worried about drifting into obscurity as service is cut back,” Mr. Lindsay said. “Pittsburgh had it worse, however, because it planned for the future on the basis that US Airways would always have a hub there.”These days Bradley is served by seven airlines, and the governor says he is personally involved in campaigning for new flights. The state is considering offering a reduction in landing fees and other fees to airlines willing to bring transcontinental and international service to the airport.“We are targeting specific routes to make it more lucrative for a carrier to offer service at Bradley,” said Kevin A. Dillon, the airport’s executive director. “We’re trying to get business that will generate travel and also generate employment in the area.”Airports Council International, an industry association, has reported that airport growth can create jobs and spur economic development beyond airfields. Colin Spear, assistant director of airport development for the International Air Transport Association, said the largest airport cities have common characteristics. They tend to be megacities with a large population; they are close to a primary world transfer route; and they have an airline either based at the local airport or operating a hub there. In short, Mr. Spear said, size matters.“Cities that lack a sufficient number of the characteristics,” he said, “clearly will face a bigger challenge in realizing their goals.”This might be disheartening news to boosters of Bradley Airport, wedged between New York and Boston — two cities that meet many of the association’s described criteria.But Governor Malloy said he believed the airport could overcome its deficits.“We know that the marketplace in New York and Boston is saturated,” he said. “Our traffic problem is that we don’t have enough traffic. That leaves us on the plus side of that equation.”Connecticut’s effort to join other cities in a march to add airlines and build up the acreage around the airport could create what Mr. Lindsay called “the virtuous circle” seen elsewhere, in which business spurs more air and cargo service, which in turns spurs more business.But it is no sure thing. “Not every airport can be an airport city,” he said. “Does it make sense to pursue air service with scarce resources?”At Nufern, Mr. Seifert said his company would spend $360,000 this year sending products via airfreight from Bradley and an additional $150,000 on air travel.“We are committed to fly out of Bradley as our first choice because it ultimately costs us less to do so,” Mr. Seifert said, adding that being in Connecticut had its own value, including the availability of trained workers and the quality of life. “You might as well locate in China if it’s only cost that matters to you.”'"
"'12-09-05,'1','The names read like a who’s who of diet tycoons.There was David Burwick, the president of Weight Watchers North America; Dana Fiser, the chief executive of the weight-loss program Jenny Craig; Dr. Arthur Agatston, the inventor of the South Beach Diet; Dr. Howard Shapiro, the founder of Picture Perfect Weight Loss; Dr. Pierre Dukan, the creator of the protein-based Dukan Diet that has taken France by storm; and Bob Greene, the founder of the Best Life diet regimen, who is best known for being Oprah Winfrey’s personal trainer.Like movie stars lining up to endorse the next big celebrity workout, the weight-loss specialists have all thrown their support behind Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s proposal to limit sales of big sugary drinks.Announced a little more than a week before the New York City Board of Health is to vote on the restriction, the endorsements are the latest sally in the mayor’s public relations offensive on behalf of the proposal, which has reignited a national debate over obesity and drawn criticism from soft-drink industry officials who say the ban would deprive consumers of free choice.On Tuesday morning, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Mr. Bloomberg at a news conference at Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, there was Mr. Burwick, declaring, “There’s been a lot of hand-wringing about obesity but very little action.”There was also Rachelle Conley, a Queens mother of three, who told the assembled audience how she had lost 91 pounds after joining Weight Watchers, exercising at Flushing Meadows and cutting down on sugary drinks. (Before she began dieting, Ms. Conley drank six fruit-flavored juice drinks and several cups of coffee with 25 packets of sugar each and every day — all told, about 78 Weight Watchers points, she said.)'"

The menu will stay brief, at 15 drinks or so, but change every four to six weeks, reflecting the time of year and whatever the bartenders happen to be working on.

The bar’s moniker is a translation of the neighborhood’s original Dutch name: 50 Wyckoff Avenue (Willoughby Avenue), Bushwick, (929) 234-3500.TOOKER ALLEY With this bar, Del Pedro, formerly of Pegu Club, pays homage to the Dil Pickle Club, a largely forgotten bohemian haunt of the early 20th century on Tooker Alley in Chicago. Though the original Pickle lacked liquor, Tooker Alley will not. Mr. Pedro calls it a “brown liquor house,” offering an array of whiskey-shot-and-beer combinations, and “extended garnishes” — side dishes that complement the drinks. Select evenings will be devoted to “the regional, musical, literary or artistic roots of a specific cocktail.” (Early October): 793 Washington Avenue (Lincoln Place), Prospect Heights, (347) 955-4743.THE WELL, THE WICK The Well, a 16,000-square-foot public house (with occasional music shows) from the partners Joshua Richholt and Shay Vishawadia, is inside the former Hittleman Brewery, and includes a huge backyard.

"'12-09-05,'1','LONDON — In a bid to reshape his government halfway through its five-year term, Prime Minister David Cameron shook up his cabinet on Tuesday, but produced only one major surprise: the promotion of a Cameron insider, Jeremy Hunt, to health minister, despite his entanglement in a furor over ties between the prime minister’s inner circle and Rupert Murdoch’s scandal-tainted media empire.The cabinet reshuffle had been billed by Cameron aides as a move to put a “reinvigorated face” on the government at a time when its political fortunes have been in the doldrums. In the face of political miscues and a recession-bound economy, political commentators have grown increasingly doubtful of the prospects for Mr. Cameron’s Conservative Party in a general election expected to be held in the spring of 2015.But Mr. Cameron’s new broom turned out to be a cautious one, with no changes in any of the top ministerial posts held by Conservatives, other than health. George Osborne remains chancellor of the Exchequer, with overall responsibility for management of the economy. William Hague remains foreign secretary, and Theresa May home secretary. Philip Hammond remains defense secretary, Michael Gove remains education secretary and Iain Duncan Smith remains work and pensions secretary, responsible for the government’s sweeping changes in welfare policy.The big message in the reshuffle appeared to be that Mr. Cameron will not be shaken from his course on the economy, in which he and Mr. Osborne have hewed closely to an austerity program that aims at cutting government outlays by an average of 20 percent over four years. With Britain now in the grip of a double-dip recession and some economists saying that the economy could remain stalled for years, critics who favor easing the austerity program with costly job-creation programs had called for the transfer of Mr. Osborne, who was booed on Monday night when he presented medals to athletes at the Paralympic Games.The Conservatives govern in an uneasy coalition with a minority partner, the Liberal Democrats, a union that has become increasingly fractious as the poll ratings of both parties droop, and those of the opposition Labour Party, out of office since its defeat in the 2010 general election, rise. But among the minority posts, too, there was a steady-as-you-go approach. The two top Liberal Democrats in the cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the business secretary, Vincent Cable, remain in their jobs.Mr. Hunt will replace Andrew Lansley as the man responsible for overseeing the sweeping and bitterly controversial overhaul of the $160 billion-a-year National Health Service that Mr. Lansley initiated. A contemporary of Mr. Cameron’s at Oxford University, Mr. Hunt had been seen as a possible future prime minister before he became embroiled in the Murdoch scandal, and his new appointment represents a bold — some Conservatives would say foolhardy — gamble by Mr. Cameron that he has shaken off any taint from the scandal.'"
"'12-09-05,'1','So far this year, auto sales in the United States have increased 14.7 percent over the same period in 2011. The industry sold 1.28 million vehicles in August, bringing the total for the year to 9.71 million.The pace in August was even hotter than earlier in the year, with most major manufacturers posting double-digit percentage increases despite a rise in gasoline prices. Gas hit $3.80 a gallon by the end of the month, compared with about $3.60 in early August, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report.Many of the sales gains came from the continued comeback of Toyota and Honda from their low sales a year ago in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Their resurgence was driven by big gains in sales of their most fuel-efficient models, like Toyota’s Corolla and Prius hybrid and Honda’s Civic sedan.The Detroit auto companies also benefited from the introduction of new high-mileage cars that filled gaping holes in their product lineups.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, said its United States sales grew 10.1 percent, to 240,000 vehicles, in August. The increase was driven by a strong performance by its Chevrolet passenger cars, particularly the new Sonic subcompact model and the even-smaller Spark minicar that G.M. builds in Korea.G.M. also reported one of its best sales months ever for the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid. The company said it sold 2,800 Volts during August, compared with 300 a year earlier.“Although trucks had a solid month, the small-car performance is what’s most impressive about G.M.’s numbers today,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the automotive research site Edmunds.com.The Ford Motor Company said its August sales increased 12.6 percent, to 196,000 vehicles. It reported its biggest gains in the Focus compact car and the new Escape, its smallest sport utility vehicle.Focus sales were up 35 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, and Escape sales rose 36 percent.“As fuel prices rose again during August, we saw growing numbers of people gravitate toward our fuel-efficient vehicles,” said Ken Czubay, Ford’s head of United States sales and marketing.The company also said pickup sales were steadily increasing in conjunction with a slow recovery in the housing market. Sales of the F-series pickup climbed 19 percent during August, with a large percentage of those buyers choosing trucks with high-mileage, six-cylinder engines instead of the less efficient eight-cylinder models.The overall strength of the American market prompted Ford to announce it will build 725,000 vehicles in North America during the fourth quarter, a 7 percent increase from the same period a year earlier.Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit car companies, said its August sales increased by 14.1 percent, to 148,000 vehicles.The increase was attributed in part to sales of the all-new Dodge Dart compact sedan, which is derived from a vehicle platform developed by Fiat, Chrysler’s Italian parent company. Chrysler, which previously lacked a competitive model in the small-car segment, said it sold 3,000 Darts in August.Reid Bigland, Chrysler’s head of United States sales, called the domestic market “incredibly resilient” and estimated that the seasonally adjusted, industrywide annual sales rate was 14.6 million vehicles in August.Toyota said that it sold 188,000 vehicles during August, a 45.6 percent increase from the same month last year. Honda reported a 59.5 percent gain, to 131,000 vehicles.The surge by the two large Japanese automakers seemed to hurt the performance of their Asian rivals. Nissan said its American sales grew just 7.6 percent in August, to 98,000, while the Korean carmaker Hyundai reported a 4.4 percent gain, to 61,000 vehicles.One of the fastest-growing auto companies in the United States, the German carmaker Volkswagen, said it sold 52,000 VW and Audi brand vehicles in August. That represents a 48.2 percent increase from the same period last year.Like other automakers, VW’s results were lifted by fuel-efficient cars like the Jetta and Passat.Analysts said the overall industry results exceeded expectations. The consistent level of demand throughout the year has helped the companies keep inventories stable and sales incentives relatively low.“The more predictable the market is, the better it is for product planning and marketing,” Mr. Toprak said. “The fact is, predictability is what this industry has been lacking for the past four years.”'"

"'12-09-06,'1','A clinic in New York City offered treatment based on the same program to firefighters who responded to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center.But some doctors and researchers questioned whether such a treatment would work to remove toxins like dioxin that can persist in the body for many years.“I would not expect that it would lower the body burden of dioxin in a given person,” said Dr. Marcella L. Warner, a research epidemiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the long-term health effects of dioxin exposure. While unfamiliar with the specifics of the detoxification program in Vietnam, she said that a treatment focused on exercise and sweating would not be an effective way to rid the body of the toxin.Christopher Hodges, a spokesman for the American Embassy in Hanoi, said the United States government was also skeptical of the detoxification program. “We are not aware of any safe, effective detoxification treatment for people with dioxin in body tissues,” he said. “The best way to reduce health risks associated with dioxin is to prevent human exposure to dioxin.”The United States government has not provided any financing for the program in Vietnam, he said.It is unclear if the Vietnamese government knew of such questions when it embarked on the program.Hoang Manh An, the director of the Hanoi 103 Military Hospital, where the program is being carried out, appeared enthusiastic when interviewed last week by Tuoi Tre, a Vietnamese newspaper.“This Hubbard method has been applied in many countries for detoxication and treatment of several diseases,” Dr. An was quoted as saying. “Vietnam is the first nation in the world to apply it to dioxin.”But reached by telephone on Tuesday, he said information about the program would not be available until an official announcement at an undisclosed date in the future.Karin Pouw, a spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology, did not specifically address the use of Mr. Hubbard’s program for dioxin, but said it “has had many applications” and had been used “for more than three decades to handle environmental toxins, exposure to pesticides and drug rehabilitation.”Twenty-four residents of the central city of Da Nang whose blood was found to have high concentrations of dioxin were expected to travel to Hanoi this week to undergo the treatment, according to Nguyen Thi Hien, chairwoman of the Da Nang Association of Victims of Agent Orange.Last month the United States began a program to clean up the soil at a former American air base in Da Nang, the first major program by the United States to address the legacy of Agent Orange since the end of the Vietnam War. Many Vietnamese believe their health problems, and the birth defects of their children, were caused by exposure to the defoliant. The Vietnamese government has cooperated with the Association for Better Living and Education since 2005, when the association provided financial help “to build steam baths and buy the vitamins and minerals,” according to the Vietnamese state news media.Dr. Vuong said Tuesday that the association had helped “transfer technology on detox and purification.”“They are not preaching religion,” he said.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','The trial of Bishop Robert W. Finn and the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph on charges of failure to report suspected child abuse has been moved up to Thursday and will be decided by a judge, not a jury. The change was made public in a court filing on Wednesday, and avoids a lengthy public trial that was set to start Sept. 24. Bishop Finn is the first Roman Catholic prelate in the country to be indicted in the sexual abuse scandals. He and the diocese each face two misdemeanor counts of failing to report hundreds of lewd photographs of young girls on a laptop computer belonging to the Rev. Shawn Ratigan. Father Ratigan pleaded guilty to pornography charges in August.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','Any Israeli military strike against Iran’s nuclear facilities, an option being debated in Israel, would require approval by the 14-member security cabinet.Tuesday’s meeting was held shortly after an International Atomic Energy Agency report said that Iran had accelerated its nuclear program — which it says is for peaceful purposes — even under the weight of intensified sanctions and as Israel engaged in delicate diplomacy with the United States over Iran.Former officials and analysts here cautioned against interpreting the cancellation of the Wednesday session as a signal that a decision to strike was not imminent, or conversely, that the need for utter secrecy indicated that a decision was near.“I would say that you must take the reason given for what it is: that there was a violation of security,” said Efraim Halevy, a former chief of the Mossad spy agency. It should be seen, he said, as “a warning to people to keep their mouths shut.”During the security meeting, Mr. Netanyahu and other ministers were briefed by Mossad; Shin Bet, the nation’s internal security agency; and military intelligence, according to the news media, which said that at least four additional ministers attended as observers.The security cabinet is required by law to have at least six members, but it has become larger for reasons of coalition politics. Mr. Netanyahu consults more often with a tighter group of nine top ministers, but that group does not have the authority to decide on military operations on behalf of the government.Yediot Aharonot’s news Web site, Ynet, quoted a participant in Tuesday’s session, whom it did not identify, as saying, “The information that was presented was very troubling but still not frightening.”The newspaper report on Wednesday dropped the “frightening” reference but said that participants were amazed to find that those bodies responsible for giving assessments presented different views regarding the point at which Israel’s option of striking Iran’s nuclear centers would no longer be effective.Defense Minister Ehud Barak has long spoken of a “zone of immunity,” meaning a vaguely defined point beyond which Iran could potentially produce weapon fuel deep underground in a center immune to an attack by Israel, given its relatively limited military capabilities.Some analysts speculated that the reports may have angered Mr. Netanyahu because they seemed to undermine the sense of urgency he has been trying to convey about the need to stop the Iranian drive toward nuclear weapons capability.Michael Eisenstadt, director of the Military and Security Studies Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the leaks “could undercut the message he is trying to send to the U.S., Iran and the international community.” Comments in the Ynet report were “an implicit criticism of Netanyahu’s approach,” Mr. Eisenstadt added.The meeting’s cancellation comes against the backdrop of quiet contacts between the Israeli government and the Obama administration over the Iranian issue. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak will visit the United States this month for the United Nations General Assembly meeting.Some commentators here have said that Mr. Netanyahu may have overplayed his hand in trying to push the Americans. They cited recent remarks by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who was quoted last week as saying that the international coalition of countries applying sanctions against Iran “could be undone” if Israel attacked it “prematurely.”“The decision on the agenda right now is what Netanyahu and Barak will tell Obama and Panetta when they get to the United States,” said Ehud Yaari, an Israel-based fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, referring to Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta. “They have to decide exactly how to present Israel’s position and what to ask of the Americans.”'"
"'12-09-06,'1','The signs have been changed. The invectives have softened. The products remain, well, unlikely to win any culinary awards.But after several months and increasingly long lines, the proprietors of two pizza parlors on Avenue of the Americas have agreed to end a price war that saw the cost of their slices plummet to 75 cents each.All it took, it seems, was a brush with mutually assured destruction and one meeting of questionable legality.“We make a compromise,” said Pravin Patel, who oversees Bombay Fast Food/6 Ave. Pizza, which sits a few feet south of 2 Bros. Pizza between West 37th Street and West 38th Street. “Both guys agreed. Both guys were losing money.”And so slices returned to $1 about two weeks ago. Two slices and a soda now cost $2.75.A détente did not appear likely earlier this year. One evening in March, when both stores had been charging $1 per slice, Bombay lowered its rate to 79 cents. The next morning, 2 Bros. moved its price to 75 cents, which its neighbor soon matched.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','The performance by Sweden in winning the Open Teams at the Second World Mind Sports Games in France last month was remarkable.In the knockout matches Krister Ahlesved, Jonas Petersson, Peter Bertheau, Per-Ola Cullin, Fredrik Nystrom and Johan Upmark comprehensively defeated Israel (by 79 international match points), Monaco (46 imps) and, in the final, Poland (137 imps). The only close match occurred in the quarterfinal against the United States. With 16 of the 96 boards to be played, the United States led by 4 imps.There were several boards that could have reversed the result, but the diagramed deal, Board 83, was the most sensational. It was instrumental in the fortunes of the United States open and senior teams.At the other table Upmark (North) opened one diamond; Zia Mahmood (East) passed; Nystrom (South) responded one heart; Bob Hamman (West) jumped to four spades; North rebid five diamonds; East competed with five spades; South doubled; and all passed.North led the diamond king. West ruffed and naturally cashed his top trumps to go down one, losing one spade and two clubs.In the given auction Meckstroth (North) opened with a good three-diamond pre-empt, especially at favorable vulnerability. So, after Rodwell (South) responded three no-trump and Cullin (West) overcalled four spades, North rebid four no-trump, which was doubled by East.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE Ken Cauley, founder of a video game news site, Kombo.com, said the hardest part was creating accountability. The company, which he sold to GameZone in 2010, was based in Detroit, but he worked with 10 employees and 30 freelancers in the United States, Australia, Canada, Honduras and Japan, among other places.One frequent problem was missed deadlines. “Grand ideas wouldn’t work out,” said Mr. Cauley, now president and founder of Advanced Media, an online advertising company. “And you always had to figure out what happened after a problem occurred.”His first idea, he said, was to throw money at the problem, thinking that if people were paid more, they would make more time to do the work. That did not help.In 2006, four years after starting his business, Mr. Cauley decided his staff needed a set of black-and-white rules. He and his employees developed the “Kombo Bible,” a 40-page document that detailed every aspect of the company, including what to do when problems arose and the repercussions for making a mistake.Soon after, people stopped missing deadlines and productivity increased. Thanks to the handbook, he said, employees knew exactly what would happen if they slacked off.“If someone ended up getting fired, they knew they were getting fired,” he said. “The accountability issues pretty much dropped to zero.”Kuty Shalev, founder and chief executive of Clevertech, which builds custom software and applications for wholesale distributors, financial companies and start-ups, has also had to deal with missed deadlines. His company is based in Woodmere, N.Y., and has employees in India, Israel, Pakistan and other places.Mr. Shalev has employees post a daily goal on Yammer, an internal social network for businesses. His software developers also have to submit their code at the end of the day. If managers find something odd, they investigate.But missed deadlines are not the worst of his problems. Occasionally, employees do not even show up. He now requires all employees to have cellphones, so he can track them down if they fail to report.MAKE IT VISUAL Entrepreneurs have to understand and be sensitive to cultural differences, Mr. Shalev said. In other countries, for example, people often need days off to attend religious functions. Some of Mr. Shalev’s employees in Moldova and Ukraine deal with frequent blackouts — he has had to buy generators for some — and one Pakistani employee wanted a day off to sacrifice a goat.Argentines, Mr. Dandrea said, really like their holidays. They often get one or two days off every month, and if a holiday falls on a Tuesday, he said, people often stay home on Monday, too. One time, a client had a problem on a Friday night, and no one got back to him until Wednesday because the Argentine project manager had two days off. “The customer was incensed,” Mr. Dandrea said.He has learned to coordinate schedules across countries. If the Argentine office is closed, someone has to make sure colleagues in other countries fill in.Sometimes, simple communication can be an issue. In some cultures, people say yes a lot — “but they don’t mean yes; they mean they heard you,” Mr. Shalev said.He has spent long meetings talking about a project and assigning tasks only to get back work that did not reflect his instructions. The best way to get his message across, he has learned, is to “make it visual.” He uses Jing, a program from TechSmith that allows people to share screen shots, videos and images.“Everyone can understand a photo or video much better than listening to words,” Mr. Shalev said. “That’s even true with staff and clients in the U.S.”CONNECT YOUR PEOPLE When you see your employees every day, it is easy to tell if someone has the blues. But what if you only talk to them on the phone? “I’ve gotten two weeks’ notice and had no idea something was wrong,” Mr. Dandrea said. “There’s no griping at the water cooler that will get back to you.”When employees are off-site, it is easy to ignore the “commitment conversation,” as Mr. Dandrea calls it, which is why he makes sure his managers have regular discussions with staff members. Managers have been taught to give a lot of feedback and even to ask directly how an employee is feeling. “We look for chinks in the armor,” he said.He also uses an online recognition program called Potential Point that allows people to reward others virtually for a job well done. When someone in the United States nominates someone from Argentina for doing good work on a project, the entire company sees the nomination.Michael Brody-Waite, chief executive and co-founder of InQuicker, a company that creates software that displays wait times at emergency rooms and doctors’ offices, often sends his Nashville-based employees to spend three days at the company’s other office — a coffee shop, technically — in British Columbia. “When they visit the guys in Canada, they end up surfing, hiking and snowboarding,” Mr. Brody-Waite said. “The idea is to be more natural with each other.”WATCH YOUR OWN HOURS Perhaps the biggest problem with a far-flung staff is the temptation for the boss to work around the clock.Mr. Shalev said it was hard to turn off when he knew there were employees working as he was getting ready for bed. The first few years running his company, he said, he often got caught up with something and did not go to bed until 3 a.m.To avoid a 24-hour workday, Mr. Shalev asks his overseas employees to work as close as possible to 9 to 5 Eastern Standard Time. That means some people have to start working at 5 a.m. Others start in the afternoon, take time off for dinner and finish at night.As much work as it has taken Mr. Dandrea to run a successful business across multiple countries, he said he had no regrets about his 1998 excursion to Argentina. “Working virtually,” he said, “gives us access to so much more talent.”'"
"'12-09-06,'1','Chinese government officials declined to comment Wednesday evening, saying that they wanted to see first what the European Union would do.The E.U. trade case differs from the American action in that the European case will most likely be limited to an anti-dumping complaint, without including an anti-subsidy charge, the people familiar with the dispute said. They insisted on anonymity, citing the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue.The Union also takes longer than the United States to investigate such cases. Preliminary tariffs could be imposed in Europe next May, and final tariffs would not be set until December of next year.E.U. officials declined to comment on the solar panel issue. Regarding the possibility of Chinese retaliation, they repeated the Union’s standard position that foreign countries should impose trade restrictions only if they follow procedures that comply with the World Trade Organization’s rules.The United States and the Union each follow elaborate, quasi-judicial procedures for anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases, taking voluminous statements from affected companies before acting, and following detailed rules for setting any tariffs. China’s methods for assessing trade penalties are relatively mysterious, and have been the subject of periodic European and American criticism.The Union is preparing to start the investigation in response to a complaint filed by a coalition of about 20 European companies led by SolarWorld, a German maker of solar panels. SolarWorld, which also has operations in Oregon, had previously set up a coalition of solar panel producers in the United States that used a legal filing to force the Commerce Department to file the cases there.Chen Huiqing, deputy director for solar products at the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, said at an industry conference in Guangzhou two weeks ago that the Chinese industry had sent a team of representatives to Brussels in one last bid to talk European officials out of starting a trade case. She warned that Chinese solar panel manufacturers already faced declining profit margins, shortages of capital and weakening foreign demand.Chinese companies played a tiny role in the global solar power industry until five years ago, when they began a surge that has now brought them two-thirds of the global market. That rapid growth has been accompanied by a steep plunge in wholesale prices for solar panels, which have dropped by up to three-quarters in the past four years.Retail prices have fallen much more slowly, as the bulk of the cost of a solar panel system lies in installation, and those costs have not fallen nearly as fast.Chinese industry officials and regulators have periodically denied allegations that they are selling solar panels below cost in foreign markets, insisting that their huge investments in big new factories have brought down costs. But big Chinese solar companies have been posting heavy losses, particularly in the second quarter.Frank Haugwitz, a solar industry consultant based in Beijing, said that if the Union imposed tariffs, it would be a serious blow to a Chinese industry already suffering from overcapacity. But the Chinese government is strongly committed to having a large solar panel industry, and is starting to use subsidies to expand the modest domestic market for solar panels.“Beijing is very committed; it will not let them down,” Mr. Haugwitz said.Milan Nitzschke, the president of European Union ProSun, the industry coalition assembled by SolarWorld to seek tariffs on Chinese competitors, expressed skepticism that China would actually levy steep tariffs on imports of polysilicon from the United States or Europe, which are among the world’s largest producers.Chinese solar panel manufacturers buy a lot of imported polysilicon because domestic producers cannot make enough. So tariffs on European and U.S. polysilicon would have to be paid by Chinese solar panel makers that are already struggling, said Mr. Nitzschke, who is also a vice president of SolarWorld.China is rapidly expanding its own polysilicon production. But environmentalists are skeptical, because making polysilicon requires huge amounts of electricity, and nearly four-fifths of China’s electricity comes from burning coal, which produces air pollution and global warming gases.It takes up to two years for a solar panel to generate enough electricity to match the electricity that went into manufacturing it, mostly for the polysilicon.Chinese retaliation against European wines could be more politically feasible in Beijing. Tales of lavish spending on expensive wines by the wealthy and by government officials periodically surface on the Chinese Internet, and feed public anxiety about the wide gap between rich and poor.China exports over 90 percent of its solar panels. It has done so to tap into billions of dollars in subsidies from government agencies and other electricity users in the United States and Europe for homes and businesses to install solar panels. W.T.O. rules have discouraged Western countries from banning the use of their subsidies for the purchase of Chinese solar panels.The exception has been government procurement of solar panels, for which the United States has some “buy American” provisions. China has not joined the W.T.O. side agreement on government procurement, as many Chinese provincial governments have been leery of being required to accept foreign bids for local and provincial government contracts. So Western governments also have the option not to entertain bids from Chinese companies, though this option has seldom been exercised.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','Mr. Wang seems to have escaped being charged with the more serious crime of treason, which often results in the death penalty. Ms. Gu received a suspended death sentence, which is tantamount to life in prison.Separately, four top police officials who served under Mr. Wang were convicted of aiding the cover-up, although the courtroom proceedings raised more questions than they answered.Wednesday’s announcement is part of a slow but steady mopping-up operation ahead of a crucial Communist Party congress expected to take place next month. At the conclave, a new group of leaders will formally be granted the authority to take control of the country, the first such transition in a decade.“Beijing had to clean it up before the 18th Party Congress,” said Li Datong, a well-known Chinese journalist and political commentator. “It can’t leave this administration’s affair for the next administration.”The report said that Mr. Wang bent the law to help Ms. Gu cover up her crime, although it did not specify how.The report also contended that Mr. Wang abused power by illegally spying on people. Sources have said the tech-savvy Mr. Wang wiretapped a wide range of people, including top government leaders, with Mr. Bo’s approval.Lawyers and businesspeople also say many innocent people were convicted as part of a campaign against organized crime in Chongqing. Some think this charge will make it hard to entirely shield Mr. Bo, who took credit for the crime sweep.Li Weidong, a political commentator in Beijing, said that the charges against Mr. Wang open the door for the government to criminally charge Mr. Bo and possibly redress some allegations of abuses of power in Chongqing.“If they say that Wang Lijun committed so many crimes and Bo Xilai did not commit any, no one will believe it,” Mr. Li said. “Over all, this means that the chances of Bo facing criminal prosecution are growing. He was Bo Xilai’s main aide, after all.”But Mr. Li projected that Wang would face a jail sentence of more than 20 years or possibly life in prison. The charges of bribery and abuses of power also indicated that corruption cases in Chongqing could be redressed, he said.Documents circulated internally in the spring regarding the case credited Mr. Wang for exposing Mr. Heywood’s murder. But there were no such positive points for Mr. Wang in the news report of the indictment. This indicated that the party’s assessment of the case had evolved as leaders negotiate ahead of the congress, Mr. Li added.He also noted that the party had yet to announce Mr. Wang’s expulsion from it, as it often does in cases where members are indicted. He did not rule out that Mr. Wang might have already been expelled internally.The case is to be tried in Chengdu; a date was not announced. Mr. Wang was sidelined by Mr. Bo after the two men clashed over Ms. Gu’s crime, perhaps hoping to silence him. But that move prompted Mr. Wang to drive to Chengdu in early February and enter the United States Consulate there according to people in Chongqing and party findings that are not part of the government’s public case.Mr. Wang stayed about 24 hours and was arrested when he exited the building. It is not clear what he hoped to achieve by fleeing to the consulate, although the American diplomats are thought to have forwarded Mr. Wang’s information about Mr. Heywood’s killing to their British counterparts and the allegations eventually became public.Previously, the two men had been tightly linked. Mr. Wang had been known as a martial-arts expert who helped Mr. Bo crack down on crime in another province. Mr. Bo brought him to Chongqing to take on the city’s notorious mafias.The effort was part of a high-profile campaign by Mr. Bo to improve his chances during the coming leadership transition, during which Mr. Hu will first step down from his party post and retire from his government position, handing over the reins to Vice President Xi Jinping.'"
"'12-09-06,'1','PORT CHESTER, N.Y. — The Capitol Theater here, built in 1926 for movies and fondly remembered by many who saw bands perform there from 1970 through 1976, officially reopened as a rock hall on Tuesday night with a Bob Dylan concert.Mr. Dylan, who has used the Capitol as a rehearsal space, was in a jovial mode, which is not to say that tidings of apocalypse were absent. Smiles broke through as he sang, and every so often he abandoned his instruments — piano, organ, electric guitar — to step forward as an unencumbered lead singer, sauntering downstage and gesturing with a cocked hip or a hand on his heart, for a little bit of old-fashioned show business.Although Mr. Dylan’s 35th studio album, “Tempest,” is due for release next week and can already be heard online, he didn’t perform any new songs. But his reworking of older ones was sly and transformative: sometimes backdating the music to well before the original recordings, sometimes viewing his past selves with avuncular pride and amusement, sometimes staring into the abyss, sometimes tempering youthful spite with empathy.A current Dylan concert is always a matter of shifting expectations. At first his voice sounds impossibly ramshackle, just a fogbound rasp. But soon, at least on a good night, his willful phrasing and conversational nuances come through. While he has — for decades — rearranged many of his songs so that only the words are immediately recognizable, his musical choices aren’t exactly arbitrary. They lead listeners, and Mr. Dylan as well, to grapple with the songs anew.He’s not courting new fans with anything that’s easily appealing. Nowadays Mr. Dylan is singing, and cackling, to loyalists, especially those who appreciate a good in-joke. “What’s the matter with you/I don’t have much to say,” he sang in the concert’s opening song, “Watching the River Flow”; the song’s original lyrics ask, “What’s the matter with me?” He took even more liberties with “Tangled Up in Blue,” switching from first person to third and replacing whole lines at whim.His band — Tony Garnier on bass, George Recile on drums, Charlie Sexton and Stu Kimball on guitars and Donnie Herron on pedal steel guitar, violin and other instruments — can deliver blues, country, R&B and whatever other Americana Mr. Dylan decides to invoke. Mr. Dylan is now a full participant in instrumental passages too, framing songs with his piano parts or picking insistent guitar lines. Meanwhile no old melody or arrangement is inviolable.'"

"'12-09-07,'1','So what accounts for the collapse?Though Republicans in Congress have generally sided with the mutual fund industry, and the reforms emerged from a Democratic administration, several people I spoke to said it was a mistake to view the outcome through the prism of partisan politics. “It’s not Republicans versus Democrats,” a person involved in formulating the proposals told me. “It’s the mutual fund industry and its allies versus the American taxpayer.”For many in the mutual fund industry, 2008 seems both a distant memory and the equivalent of a 100-year flood, something unlikely to be repeated. But just four years ago, on Sept. 16, 2008, shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the Reserve Fund, the nation’s oldest money market fund, “broke the buck” and set off a run on the global money fund industry.Money market funds — convenient, higher-yielding and supposedly ultrasafe alternatives to deposits at banks — are a mainstay of the mutual fund industry, offered by all the major fund families. They typically invest in short-term, low-risk assets (like United States Treasuries and highly rated commercial paper), and with the blessing of regulators, each day they report a stable net asset value of $1 a share. That’s convenient for tax purposes (there are never any reportable gains or losses), and it promotes the idea that these funds are risk-free because the reported value never fluctuates.In reality, this has always been an illusion, or what Ms. Schapiro calls a “fiction.” Even short-term assets may fluctuate as interest rates change, even if the moves are very small. And they can also fluctuate because of credit risks. That’s what happened to the Reserve Fund: it owned $785 million in Lehman Brothers’ commercial paper. When the value of Lehman Brothers debt collapsed, there was no way the Reserve Fund could claim that its shares were worth $1, even using generous rounding and averaging tactics to mask shifts in value. When the Reserve Fund admitted its shares weren’t worth $1, investors panicked and began a run on the fund. The Reserve Fund froze its assets and no one could get their money out, even though the actual net asset value was only a few cents less than $1.The run quickly spread to other money market funds. Funds were frantically trying to unload commercial paper and other assets to raise cash. Major corporations that rely on commercial paper to cover day-to-day operations found themselves unable to issue new securities as the market teetered on collapse. Secretary Paulson fielded phone calls from chief executives alarmed that they might be unable to meet their payrolls. The run on the Reserve Fund and other money market funds took the financial crisis straight from Wall Street to Main Street.I remember that week vividly because I relied on a money market fund for cash. When I needed some, I went to an A.T.M. and tapped in my access code. I didn’t even have a conventional bank account and prided myself on my modern approach — until I woke up the morning after the Reserve announcement to face the prospect that I might not have access to any of my money. In the many years I’d been relying on my money market account, such a calamity had never crossed my mind. Those old-fashioned government-insured bank accounts suddenly looked appealing.Like many others, I was saved by Treasury and Federal Reserve officials who concluded that money fund assets would be backed in their entirety by the full faith and credit of the United States. The move stopped the run in its tracks. The commercial paper market came back to life, borrowing costs eased, and A.T.M.’s kept dispensing money to people like me. Though largely unsung at the time, it was an important step that staved off a global financial collapse.It also made American taxpayers liable for over $3 trillion, the total assets held by money market funds at the time. It dwarfed the size of the subsequent TARP bailout, which was $750 billion. And even though policy makers across the political spectrum vowed that such a thing could never happen again, the failure of the S.E.C.’s draft proposals last month means that American taxpayers could again be liable for trillions of dollars in assets.To prevent this, the S.E.C. proposed two major reforms. The first was to report money market fund values the way every other fund does, which is the actual net asset value, or N.A.V., not something rounded to $1. The idea is that investors would become accustomed to and comfortable with slight changes in values. The net asset values of many short-term bond funds fluctuate modestly, and there aren’t any panics or runs just because their value declines a penny or two.The second was to require fund sponsors, if they wanted to maintain the stable $1 value, to start holding cash reserves.The mutual fund industry rallied against the proposals and lobbied fiercely to defeat them. The industry’s self-interest is obvious: the proposals impose costs and additional regulations. More fundamentally, why wouldn’t the industry and money market fund customers love the status quo? They get all the benefits of an implied government guarantee while taxpayers assume all the risk. Several people compared the situation to the way the mortgage industry fiercely supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the financial crisis made the government responsible for them.But is it only naked self-interest that explains the industry’s opposition? I spoke to John S. Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, which is the largest mutual fund company and, as a nonprofit company, can usually be relied upon to act in the best interests of its customers. Vanguard has strongly opposed the S.E.C.’s reform efforts.“We believe the proposals, if implemented, would end money market funds,” Mr. Woerth told me. “Our clients want a stable N.A.V. They write checks, pay their bill from these accounts. Would every one of these now be a taxable transaction based on gains and losses? That’s untenable.” As for the capital requirement, “It would be onerous and raise costs, which would have to be passed onto our clients.” He noted that Vanguard’s Prime money market fund this week was yielding just 0.04 percent and additional costs would bring it close to zero. He noted that many fund companies were already waiving expenses to keep the funds’ yields above zero, and said that additional costs were not sustainable.Vanguard has also argued that the 2008 crisis set off by the Reserve Fund was a liquidity crisis, and that reforms already adopted in 2010 address that issue.The S.E.C. counters that its job isn’t to ensure the survival of money market funds, but to protect Americans from another Reserve-type crisis, which remains possible unless there are further changes. Even John C. Bogle, Vanguard’s 83-year-old founder and former chairman, broke ranks with the company and offered support for the S.E.C.’s proposed reforms. In a recent interview, he told The Associated Press that the stable $1 value is an “illusion” and that money market funds pose “one of the major risks in the mutual fund industry.”Mr. Woerth responded: “John Bogle speaks his mind on any issue and always has. He’s an iconoclast and a rabble-rouser.”Ms. Schapiro told me she won’t raise the issue again with the current commission. So the debate now shifts to the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Financial Stability Oversight Council for further study. But any action could be years away. And given the recent fate of the S.E.C.’s four-year effort and the fund industry’s clout in Washington, it may never happen until the next crisis is upon us.'"

"'12-09-07,'1','In the process, he also set an impossibly high bar. Only under this odd set of circumstances could two Slam victories in one season — Djokovic’s total should he win the Open — be considered an off year.When Djokovic regressed (relatively) in 2012, Federer took Wimbledon and retook the No. 1 ranking. Andy Murray made the Wimbledon final and seized an Olympic gold medal. Djokovic again shifted to the back burner, the back page, the background.Even Nadal, who skipped the Open with a knee injury and recently announced plans to take the rest of the year off, factored into the early Open buzz more than Djokovic. Even though Nadal never set foot in New York.On Thursday, in the final match of the final weeknight session, Djokovic turned his attention to del Potro, the U.S. Open champion in 2009. They call del Potro the Tower of Tandil, both for his height (6-foot-6) and his hometown in Argentina.The Tower boomed three speeds of serves at Djokovic: fast, faster and fastest. In the first set, del Potro placed 83 percent of his first serves in — and Djokovic, perhaps the most brilliant returner in modern tennis, still broke serve twice.“Sometimes, it’s difficult when you have to play in front of a warrior,” del Potro said.He obtained his own break in the first game of the second set, and Djokovic spent the rest of that set trying to scratch back in. His chance came when del Potro served for the set, ahead by 5-4. On break point, Djokovic stabbed a backhand return that somehow landed in. He chased shots that seemed out of reach, one after another, his shoes, squeak, squeak, squeaking across the court. Del Potro sailed a forehand long.The match quality only improved from there. Del Potro fought off three set points to send the second set into a tiebreaker, where Djokovic again proved impenetrable. He won with defense, with long slides, with backhands hit flat and hard up the line that managed to land inside. In one long rally, Djokovic lobbed a volley, chased down a return and won the point with a drop shot.The crowd gave the combatants a standing ovation after that. Del Potro looked at his box and shook his head, as if to say, What am I supposed to do?In the semifinals, Djokovic will play David Ferrer, a player nicknamed Little Beast. Ferrer outlasted Janko Tipsarevic on Thursday afternoon, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4), in a contest that may have been the most entertaining of the tournament. Ferrer, in the midst of a career season at age 30, holds a 5-8 career mark against Djokovic.On Saturday, the semifinalists will make history, and not the kind that drives television ratings. This will mark the first time both Federer and Nadal failed to advance to the semifinals of a major tournament since 2004. The last 33 Grand Slam events have featured at least one of them.It mattered little Thursday, when Djokovic looked like Djokovic, circa 2011 — the same guy who faced match point in last year’s semifinals against Federer and ripped a return that was all moxie and guts. That loss made such an impression on Federer that he admitted this week he still thought about it.Even after all that, after the historic season and the Open title, Djokovic sailed through the first week here so far under the radar fans could be forgiven for wondering if he actually had played. His first-round victory, a 6-1, 6-0, 6-1 thumping of Paolo Lorenzi, took 73 minutes.To his credit, Djokovic never seemed unsettled by his afterthought status. Instead, he settled in the background, waited, worked and won. The draw opened up perfectly for him, with Murray, the most serious remaining threat, on the opposite side, with Nadal absent and Federer gone now, too.Should Djokovic repeat in New York, the biggest surprise would not be that he won again. It would be that it took everyone nearly two weeks to notice that he could.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','Like Pandora, Apple’s radio service would have advertising, carried through Apple’s iAd platform. Whether Apple would then share part of the ad revenue with labels, or pay them some other licensing fee, was unclear. It was also unclear whether the service would be free or require a subscription. Pandora with ads is free, although its users can pay $36 a year for a service that eliminates the ads.An Apple spokesman, as well as representatives of Sony Music, EMI and the Warner Music Group all declined to comment. A spokesman for the Universal Music Group could not be reached.Apple’s plans were first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday evening.Apple’s service did not seem to be imminent; indeed, given the length of time it can take to negotiate licenses with the major labels, it could be months away. On Wednesday, Apple is expected to introduce its newest smartphone, the iPhone 5, but the people briefed on the company’s plans said it was unlikely that the custom radio feature would be part of that presentation.Further complicating the process of licensing negotiations is the fact that much of the highest-level business of the music industry has ground to a near-halt this summer as the labels await decisions by government regulators in Europe and the United States about the Universal Music Group’s $1.9 billion takeover of EMI Music.The move by Apple perplexed some analysts, who noted that the Internet radio business seemed too small — accounting for less than $1 billion a year in revenue, by some estimates — for Apple to bother with. Established players like Pandora also already distribute their services through apps on Apple’s devices.“What’s in this for Apple?” asked Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. “Pandora already does a great job, so does iHeartRadio, so does Last.fm. Why do we need another one?”But Apple’s clout in music, which began building when the company introduced the iPod in 2001, could face threats as more consumers choose to stream music over the Internet, rather than purchasing it. Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s late chief executive, many times dismissed calls for Apple to offer music subscription services, saying that most consumers did not want to rent songs.In recent years, though, with the proliferation of smartphones, iPads and wireless Internet access that perpetually connects those devices to online sources of music, Apple’s iTunes approach to selling songs for $1 or so apiece has come to seem antiquated in comparison with music streaming services like Spotify and others.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','“It is a settlement about which no government officials associated with Central Falls should be proud,” said Matt McGowan, the lawyer who represents retirees. “In an example of abject irresponsibility on the part of its elected officials, its pension plans were persistently and habitually underfunded for a decade or more.”The plan imposes a 4 percent property tax increase in each of the next five years while the number of city employees has fallen. There were 174 city workers in May 2010, and there are now 118, said Theodore Orson, the lawyer for Central Falls’s receiver.“Every stakeholder except the bondholders is suffering here,” Mr. Orson said.The City of Vallejo, Calif., emerged from Chapter 9 bankruptcy last year after three years of protection. Efforts by other bankrupt local governments, including Jefferson County, Ala., and Stockton, Calif., to shore up their finances have been hampered by legal uncertainties.Central Falls is Rhode Island’s densest city, with nearly 19,400 people squeezed into 1.2 square miles. It is a poor city, too, with a median income of just $34,389 per year, according to the Census Bureau.But the city promised pensions commensurate with those offered in much wealthier communities and by last year found itself with a structural budget deficit of about $6 million, and with no way to pay the roughly $80 million it owed in pension and health insurance benefits to more than 200 police officers and firefighters. The city went into receivership in 2010 and declared bankruptcy on Aug. 1, 2011.“We’re taking a city that was completely dysfunctional and making it fully functional,” Mr. Orson said of the final debt-adjustment plan, which is dated July 27.In 2011, the Rhode Island State General Assembly enacted a law giving bondholders the right to place liens on tax revenue, hoping that guaranteeing the repayment of city debt would prevent additional credit problems and contagion in this tiny state.“Without this statute, bondholders would not be paid in full, and we would default on our bond obligations,” Mr. Orson said. “It would have been extremely expensive to continue to access the capital market.”Indeed, Moody’s Investors Service said this year that Central Falls’s credit rating might be raised.But giving the bondholders preference over other creditors was controversial, and there were questions about whether the Rhode Island law would be binding in a bankruptcy, where similarly situated creditors are supposed to be treated equally.The new normal for Central Falls may well be evident in places like the Fire Department, where Lt. Mike Andrews, who is the union president for the city’s firefighters, said the minimum number of active-duty firefighters per shift has been reduced to seven from nine, straining an agency that goes on about 5,000 runs per year.The receivership is currently targeted to end on Dec. 31, although the state’s director of revenue, Rosemary Booth Gallogly, has said she will have final say over whether the city’s elected officials are ready to carry out their responsibilities under the plan. They will have to sign quarterly statements attesting that city finances stick to the plan.“It looks like the Germans occupying Paris, that’s what it looks like,” said Lawrence Goldberg, who acts as special counsel to some of the members of the Central Falls City Council.After the court hearing on Thursday, Ms. Gallogly acknowledged the difficulty of the Central Falls case, though she allowed herself a small moment of celebration, high-fiving a member of the receiver’s legal team.“There have been a lot of people hurt from the bankruptcy,” she said, adding that the agreement was “an accomplishment that will help us bring the city forward and begin that healing.”'"
"'12-09-07,'1','More akin to political theater, the article does not depict the true state of chemical security and doesn’t acknowledge the widespread concern with misusing the Clean Air Act.The business of chemistry provides the building blocks that are needed every day to produce food, disinfect water and create innovative technologies.Because of this critical role and the need to protect its employees and communities, the chemical industry has invested billions of dollars to enhance security.Over the last decade, the federal government has put several programs in place to regulate all aspects of chemical security.According to administration officials, these programs continue to deliver results and have made America safer.Pursuing a flawed approach that has been rejected time and again by policy makers across the political spectrum and that runs counter to the president’s call to use the best regulatory tools is hardly good policy or politics.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','But he concedes the obvious.“I’m not going to lie to you; I did grow up with them,” he said, waving toward the Yankees’ dugout. “Do you ever forget where you went to elementary school or high school?”And there is more if you choose to see it. Showalter was not just pushed out the door in 1995 by George Steinbrenner, the team’s principal owner, in a dispute over who got to pick the assistant coaches; he was also ignored in the search for a new manager after Joe Torre left the team following the 2007 season.Showalter was available, and while his résumé had been blotted by imperfect stays in Arizona and Texas, it seemed odd that he was never even mentioned as a possible candidate for the job given to Joe Girardi. That is not to suggest that Showalter would have been the better choice, but it is naïve to think that Showalter was not miffed about never entering the picture. He had a 313-268 record as the Yankees’ manager after inheriting a 71-91 team.Showalter, hired to lead the Yankees 20 years ago this year, won’t go back that far.“I have found a home in Baltimore; it is a good fit,” he said. “And I approach every job as if it’s my last.”He is delighted that Camden Yards will be packed for the entire Yankees series — mostly with Orioles fans for a change. First place is at stake, an amazing turn of events for the disaster of a team he was handed last season.“I’m happy for the players; I didn’t do this,” he said. “All I did was create an atmosphere of accountability. When you see something done the wrong way, you say, ‘Hey, that ain’t good enough.’“And after a while you get the players to do that for each other. It’s about helping them take ownership of their own team.”Showalter’s ties to the Yankees remained in view Thursday night. He recalled that a 21-year-old Derek Jeter sat at the end of the bench a bit wide-eyed during Showalter’s last game managing for New York, the defeat against Seattle in Game 5 of the 1995 A.L. division series.Out of sight but not mind was Andy Pettitte, a looming factor in this year’s pennant chase who pitched in that Seattle series, as did Mariano Rivera. If Showalter is reminded, he has a wealth of stories about how tenuous the development of those now-famed late 1990s Yankees championship teams really was.Showalter was the manager of the Yankees’ Class AA team in Albany-Colonie, N.Y., when Steinbrenner insisted on trading Bernie Williams. The owner was fed up with Williams’s progress, while others wondered if Williams should stop switch-hitting. Showalter strongly advised against both steps.Other prospects were nearly sent off, something that had been very much in vogue with the franchise for a decade. Showalter and Gene Michael, the team’s former general manager, stood firm. Many of those players eventually played key roles, and others became crucial in less remembered ways. Two players Showalter escorted through several years in the minors, pitcher Sterling Hitchcock and third baseman Russ Davis, were traded for Tino Martinez and Jeff Nelson in 1995.Showalter said he recently had time to sit down and talk informally with Torre.“It was really the first time for something like that,” Showalter said. “And I told him how proud I was of the high levels they had taken it to. So much success.”And with that Showalter jogged to the outfield to talk to some of his young Orioles. The first-place Yankees were in town, and that made it a big game.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','A handful of Mr. Borker’s victims were summoned to testify about calls and e-mails they had received, which turned out to include a threat to slice off the legs of one customer. Federal District Judge Richard J. Sullivan said, at the end of one day of testimony, that he found the victims credible and so disturbing that he revoked Mr. Borker’s bail, which had allowed him to live at home under restrictions.In court on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Borker, who is roughly 6 feet 5 inches tall, was dressed in a jail-issued dark blue suit and looked heavier and grayer than he did in late 2010. Given the opportunity to speak, he rose and tearfully read from a statement.“As I stand here before you today, I am genuinely and deeply sorry for the threats that I made,” he said. “To say that I am ashamed of myself is an understatement.” He added that his father had died after his arrest and lived his last days with the shame of his son’s crimes.“I had a big mouth and I couldn’t control it,” he continued. Through sobs, he closed by saying he would never commit another crime and prayed for the opportunity to return to his family.Before that, his lawyer, Dominic F. Amorosa, argued that Mr. Borker deserved leniency because he is mentally ill — a doctor hired by the defense said he has “a bipolar mood disorder characterized by impulsive and manic mood symptoms” — and was frequently under the influence of marijuana and alcohol.Mr. Amorosa also contended that only a tiny fraction of Mr. Borker’s customers were threatened and that his business was otherwise a thriving enterprise. DecorMyEyes had thousands of repeat customers, he said, and millions of dollars in revenue.“He threatened, horribly, 25 people,” Mr. Amorosa said, suggesting that was a small number, given the scale of the company.Judge Sullivan was unmoved. He said that he knew from testimonials of family and friends that there was some decency in Mr. Borker. But even if he threatened only 25 people, those were 25 people who sincerely feared for their lives. In some cases, they contacted the police or installed security systems.“The fact is, these were vile threats,” he told Mr. Borker. “You were terrorizing people.”As Judge Sullivan was describing some of these threats, Mr. Borker started shaking his head, as if to say, “I never did such things.” The judge noted the head shaking and added that this proved that he still had not grasped the gravity of his action.In addition to four years in prison, Mr. Borker was told he would be on probation for three years after his release, during which he will not be allowed to use a computer. He was also told to receive psychiatric and substance-abuse counseling.As Mr. Borker left the courtroom, he turned to his wife, and looking surprisingly serene, gave her the “I’ll call you” gesture with one hand.The four-year sentence was on the low side of the guidelines, which Judge Sullivan described as a range of 46 to 57 months. But the United States attorney, Preet Bharara, said that sentence would serve as a deterrent.“Vitaly Borker was an Internet shopper’s worst nightmare,” Mr. Bharara said in a statement released Thursday afternoon. “Borker operated behind the veil of the Internet and aliases to first defraud his victims and then, if they complained, terrorize them with threats, intimidation and harassment.”'"
"'12-09-07,'1','There isn’t much to go around.In Utah, officials are hoping to cull part of the state’s elk herd this fall to prevent wintertime competition over the shrunken and brittle patches of grasses. They have issued an additional 1,450 hunting tags for female elk, in the hopes that smaller herds of elk, which are relatively hardy, would enable more of the deer to survive.“It’s kind of an emergency,” said Lowell Marthe, a state wildlife biologist. “If there’s not enough food on those winter ranges, we’re looking at potential for heavy die-offs in our deer.”Bears are even more visible. One wandered through a farmer’s market in downtown Aspen, Colo., this summer. Others have broken into cars after sniffing out fast-food leftovers, or ransacked people’s kitchens. One woman in Eagle, Colo., told ABC News that her home had been bear-burgled five times.Officials at the Grand Canyon made a rare black bear sighting this summer. In Kentucky, officials closed two campsites in late July after a family spotted a young bear rummaging through a trash can — an unusual sight for the area.“It’s just been bear call after bear call,” said Perry Will, the wildlife manager in Glenwood Springs, Colo. “Right now, they’d eat about anything.”And there is little relief in sight.The remnants of Hurricane Isaac soaked parts of the Midwest enough that the federal government was able in its weekly drought report Thursday morning to downgrade much of Missouri from extreme to severe drought. But the same report elevated wide swaths of the central and southern Great Plains to extreme drought, and said that roughly 63 percent of the continental United States remained in a state of moderate to extreme drought.The rash of drought-related bear encounters is part of a long trend of increasing run-ins between humans and wildlife (which, it should be said, was here first). States passed more restrictive hunting regulations and natural predators dwindled at the same time that homeowners built deeper and deeper into the forests, their homes climbing from valley floors to elevations where mountain berries ripen and animals like bears find their food.Wildlife officials in Colorado said that they had to euthanize 133 “problem bears” last year and that they have killed 80 so far this year. With autumn approaching, the run-ins are growing more common as the bears race to find the 20,000 daily calories they need for hibernation.Local residents sometimes protest the state’s “two strikes” policy for bears that wander into civilization (first encounter, it’s tranquilized, tagged and released; second time, it’s bear meat) but wildlife officials say they have few other options.“We don’t have this utopia tucked away that we can take all our problem bears to,” said Renzo DelPiccolo, the wildlife manager in Montrose, Colo. “It’s tough.”In Choteau, Mont., Lane Yeager settled things himself. He came home one recent night to find a 2-year-old black bear eating peanut butter, bread and flour from his pantry. The bear had apparently climbed a fence outside Mr. Yeager’s house and pushed a window open. Mr. Yeager got his gun and shot the bear twice — once to kill it and once, he said, to make sure.“This is private property,” he said.Towns have urged homeowners to minimize the allure for bears by storing their dog food inside and taking down bird feeders. Several require that all garbage be kept in bear-proof trash cans, which have thick sides and lockable lids. But homeowners and officials say people still find claw marks and gouges in the trash cans, and paw prints under their kitchen windows.Or at a local bar. One evening last month, Peter DePrez was working the door of the New Sheridan bar in Telluride when he noticed “the biggest dog I’d ever seen in my life.” Just after he realized it was a 400-pound black bear, the animal made a run at the door.“I think it just wanted to come in,” he said.Mr. DePrez slammed the door and began yelling and clapping to shoo the bear away from the bar, and from an unlucky beagle that was tied up just outside. The bear complied, he said, and wandered west down the main drag, toward another saloon at the other end of town.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','An American who fled the United Arab Emirates while on bail appeared in court on Thursday after being deported back to Dubai and will be charged with leaving the country illegally, the public prosecutor said. The American, Zack Shahin, former chief executive of a Dubai-based property developer, was detained in 2008 on embezzlement charges and went on a hunger strike in May this year in protest against being held without a ruling on his case. He was released on $1.4 million bail in July after the United States expressed concern about his health. He then fled to Yemen but was soon sent back to Dubai. His lawyers had hoped he would be deported to the United States. The court canceled his bail and he will remain in jail to face the embezzlement case, Dubai’s attorney general, Essam al-Humaidan, said in a statement.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','Collaboration is one of the hallmarks of feminist art and scholarship. The art system doesn’t really accommodate this, however. Instead, criticism, art history and institutions are set up to canonize (historically male) individual artists. And for curators, it’s considerably easier to work with one artist than a hundred.Even the Brooklyn Museum’s showcase feminist work, “The Dinner Party” (1974-79), has a complicated attribution: it was made collaboratively, although the museum stresses that Judy Chicago “began it alone.” Hundreds of volunteers helped create the piece, but only 129 are acknowledged in a series of photographic panels, which are not displayed along with the work.In many ways the current project on view at the museum by Ulrike Müller, an Austrian-born artist based in Sunset Park, Brooklyn — she is also a co-editor of LTTR, a self-described “independent gender queer feminist art journal” — serves as an update, rejoinder and response to Ms. Chicago’s landmark work. Spearheaded by one woman, it is nevertheless collaborative. And like “The Dinner Party,” with its use of mediums like ceramics and textiles, it celebrates what have often been considered “minor” arts in the West, even as it also strives for a level of transparency and egalitarianism around authorship and a formal simplicity that is somewhat lacking in Ms. Chicago’s theatrical and bombastic installation.To make the work Ms. Müller provided written descriptions of T-shirts collected by the Lesbian Herstory Archives in Park Slope and distributed them to feminists, queer artists and “other interested New Yorkers” (according to a news release). The participants then created two-dimensional objects based on these descriptions. The results are hung on the walls just off the elevator on four different floors.The responses range from poignant to political, hilarious to heartbreaking. A wonderful drawing made by Ginger Brooks Takahashi and Dana Bishop-Root from the description “A graphic of the island of Lesbos with icons depicting different sites and tourists activities” includes a lovely truncated quote from Sappho, the bard of Lesbos: “Let me tell you this, someone in some future time will think of us.”A more contentious relationship between object and description can be seen in Fox Hysen’s rendition of “Ronald Reagan with Day-Glo shocking pink eyes” on a “chartreuse background.” For the work Ms. Hysen simply wrote the words “Elizabeth Warren” in dark-pink cursive, replacing the Republican president with the Democratic Senate candidate from Massachusetts and critic of his economic policies.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','“You take when a high note comes through, lifting and going and then stopping because there’s no place else for it to go,” the saxophonist Sidney Bechet explained some time in the 1950s. “That’s stepping music — it’s got to rush itself right off your voice or your horn because it’s so excited.”It’s still near the beginning of the relationship between the German saxophonist Peter Brötzmann, an elder of free jazz at 71, and the Chicago vibraphonist Jason Adasiewicz, who at 34 is not even half that age. But pretty early in this set of free improvisations on Wednesday night at Le Poisson Rouge in Greenwich Village, they dived into a system, with intuitive dimensions of tone, rhythm, energy and narrative, in which it seemed that nothing could possibly go wrong. They were rough bosses of their own sound, attacking their instruments, almost extorting music out of them. They were making their own kind of stepping music.This was the fourth time they’ve played together. The first was in New York, too, at last year’s Vision Festival. It went well: they’re touring the country for a bit more than two weeks, and the small label Eremite has just released a recording of their initial meeting, “Going All Fancy.” (Their set was preceded by another duo with a new record on Eremite: the bassist Joshua Abrams and the drummer Chad Taylor.) If they repeated some of their strategies from that first night, what they played on Wednesday was also rich, complete and urgent.For a while Mr. Adasiewicz, instead of mallets, used cello bows. He drew them up and down along the edges of the bars of the vibraphone, making an icy, chordal, planing sound; he ended the down strokes with a bump, falling on the bars, smacking them with the heels of his hands. Then he held the bow horizontally and began to mash it on the instrument, fiberglass on aluminum, straight across the row of bars or at angles to it, producing clattery tone clusters of different sizes. (He kept the sustain pedal down almost the entire time: in his playing, all sorts of dissonance rings out unapologetically and sticks around for a while.)It was convincing and strangely beautiful. I’ve never heard those sounds from that instrument, and never seen anybody sweat on it that much.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','“For all I know, his desire to work out a solution is quite sincere,” Mr. Putin continued. “I met him recently on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, where we had a chance to talk. And though we talked mostly about Syria, I could still take stock of my counterpart. My feeling is that he is a very honest man, and that he sincerely wants to make many good changes. But can he do it? Will they let him do it?”Mr. Putin mentioned the American military establishment and the State Department as obstacles to a compromise, and he said he faced similar challenges working with Russia’s own generals and career diplomats.With a reminder of Mr. Romney’s remark about Russia, Mr. Putin was asked if he could work with a Romney administration.“Yes, we can,” he said. “We’ll work with whichever president gets elected by the American people. But our effort will only be as efficient as our partners will want it to be.”He added a sharp rebuke, accusing Mr. Romney of using inflamed language for political gain.That criticism might seem curious coming from Mr. Putin. His own campaign for office made use of some pointed anti-American talk, including criticism of the missile plan, claims that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had sent “a signal” to prompt antigovernment demonstrations after a disputed parliamentary election, and accusations that the American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, was meddling in Russian domestic affairs.“As for Mr. Romney’s position, we understand that this is to a certain extent motivated by the election race,” Mr. Putin said in the televised interview. “But I also think that he was obviously wrong, because such behavior on the international arena is the same as using nationalism and segregation as tools of U.S. domestic policy. It has the same effect on the international arena when a politician, a person who aspires to lead a nation, especially a superpower like the U.S., proclaims someone to be an enemy.”He then circled back to Russia’s concerns about the missile defense program. “Our American partners keep telling us, ‘This is not directed against you.’ But what happens if Mr. Romney, who believes us to be America’s No. 1 foe, gets elected as president of the United States? In that case, the system will definitely be directed against Russia, as its infrastructure looks to be configured exactly for this purpose.“And you also have to think about its strategic character — it’s built not for a year or even a decade — and the chances that a man with Romney’s views could come to power are quite high. So what are we supposed to do to ensure our security?”'"
"'12-09-07,'1','The rivalry and the drive for redemption made Dallas the logical opponent for the annual champions’ unveiling, but don’t think that Jones wasn’t raising his hand and calling out like the late Ron Palillo’s Horshack from “Welcome Back, Kotter” when Commissioner Roger Goodell asked for volunteers.Given Jones’s Texas-size ego, along with his Republican leanings, he no doubt preferred a ratings showdown with President Obama in the opening game’s normal Thursday night slot. He settled for Wednesday night’s featured speaker at the Democratic National Convention, Bill Clinton, who just last spring had the ear of N.F.L. owners on a variety of issues at their meeting in Florida.“I’m a great fan of Bill Clinton’s speeches,” Jones said. “But we hope we had a good enough plot, story and, if you will, dynamics to have a lot of people tune in to watch this one.”To begin with, there was tight end Jason Witten suiting up after missing most of the preseason with a lacerated spleen and perhaps moving the national anthem performer, Queen Latifah, to patriotically mimic a broken record when she reached the closing line, “home of the brave,” which she sang three times.Witten caught only 2 passes for 10 yards but considered himself more of a necessary stimulus to a team trying to recover from competitive recession.“When they saw me put the uniform on, they were getting excited and high-fiving,” Witten said. “That’s what this game is about.”Yes, the elements of risk and danger have helped make the N.F.L. the unchallenged dictator of all television programming, unscripted or otherwise.For dramatic appeal, there was the Cowboy from Queens, Kevin Ogletree, who did much of the damage on the receiving end of Tony Romo’s passes. Ogletree had earlier in the day kept vigil with his older brother, Calvin, the survivor of a recent shooting, and proceeded to grab 8 passes for 114 yards and 2 touchdowns, along with a 13-yard reception that allowed Dallas to kill the last two minutes.A career backup, Ogletree grew up a Knicks fan but wore a Brooklyn Nets cap in the locker room, where he said that his brother’s misfortune made him “look in the mirror and dig deep and find out what I want to be.”Inspiring stuff, though time will tell if Ogletree’s performance foretold a Victor Cruz coming-out season or was more the result of the Giants’ battered and vulnerable secondary.Then there was Romo, the statistically endowed quarterback who had always seemed to make his most glaring mistakes in the worst possible moments but outplayed a shaky Eli Manning by throwing for 307 yards and 3 touchdowns; there was Dez Bryant, the team’s deep threat, who caught 4 balls for 85 yards and afterward spoke for the first time since the Cowboys imposed stringent lifestyle rules on him (he had no comment on them).Finally there was Jones, who pounded the gavel in the buildup to the big show by predicting that the Cowboys would perform a time-honored act with their collective feet in relation to the Giants’ posterior.Mission accomplished, Jones decided: “I’m not so sure that this was as big a deal to the Giants as it was to us” — not that the Giants weren’t trying but because the Cowboys, he said, had to “make amends.”And what did it mean, beyond the renewal of the visceral contract the league has with America to provide weekly allocations of semicontrolled violence (for now by replacement officials) while Clinton & Co. were reading from their teleprompter?Beyond the narrow victory Nielsen reported for Clinton over the N.F.L., not much in the grand scheme of the long race ahead.“We have seen that they can go to the end and then turn it on at the end and win the whole prize,” Jones said of the Giants.Bridge or no bridge, the season’s narrative has only just begun.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','The markets have been rallying since Mr. Draghi announced his intention in late July to do “whatever it takes” to save the euro zone. Since then, the euro zone’s blue-chip index, the Euro Stoxx 50, has risen nearly 10 percent, bringing it up over 20 percent for the summer. The index leapt 3.4 percent on Thursday.The plan Mr. Draghi announced was not much different from what investors had been expecting. But the full details he provided displayed the breadth of measures he was ready to take.“It is sufficient to make people think that the E.C.B. has the tools and the willingness to keep all the balls in the air until the political leaders manage to arrive at an agreement,” said Michael Hood, a market strategy for JPMorgan Chase’s asset management division.Several hurdles, however, could stop the rally in its tracks. Most immediately, a German court is set to rule next week on the constitutionality of the European stability fund that Mr. Draghi built his own strategy around.If the fund passes muster, Spain and other countries that want to take part will have to agree to take steps to rein in their budget deficits for the E.C.B. to agree to buy their short-term debt in unlimited amounts in the secondary market.Beyond all of those short-term obstacles, it is not clear that the bond-buying program will help ease basic economicweakness in several Southern European countries.“This is a good short-term step, but it’s not clear that the ultimate results that people want are deliverable by the E.C.B.,” said Carl Weinberg, the founder of High Frequency Economics.Spain and Italy are the most likely candidates for the new strategy, and the news helped push down the interest rates on short-dated Spanish and Italian bonds. The yield on the two-year Spanish bond, which rose to nearly 6.5 percent earlier this summer, fell to 2.78 percent, from 2.97 percent.But the broader optimism in the market was apparent in that investors also bought the longer-term bonds issued by Spain and Italy, pushing the yield on the 30-year Spanish bond down to 6.60 percent from 6.99. Because the E.C.B. will not be targeting these bonds, they are likely to gain in value only if investors gain faith in the economic prospects in those countries.Mr. Baumohl and other optimists said the central bank program could relieve the pressure on Europe’s banks and free them up to make loans that will support economic growth.“In the final analysis, what the governments and the institutions have to do is convince the private capital markets that it is safe to invest in Europe,” Mr. Baumohl said.Leading stock indexes were up 3 percent in France and Germany, while Spain’s stock market leapt 5 percent.If Europe does become less of a concern, it will allow the attention to shift more fully to the American economy. The economy showed signs of weakening earlier this summer, but several recent reports have suggested that it may be strengthening.On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management said that nonmanufacturing sectors grew faster in August than in July.Ahead of Friday’s monthly jobs report, the Labor Department said Thursday that the number of people filing for jobless benefits last week fell 12,000 from the week before. The payroll company Automatic Data Processing announced that private companies added 201,000 jobs in August.The employment numbers coming Friday are expected to influence the Federal Open Market Committee when it meets next week. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said last week that more monetary stimulus might be necessary. Investors have been betting on this, but improving economic data could dissuade the Fed from more action.The S.& P. 500 rose 2 percent, or 28.68 points, to 1,432.12. The last time it was that high was on Jan. 3, 2008. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1.9 percent, or 244.52 to 13,292.00, a level last reached in December 2007. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.2 percent, or 66.55 points, to 3,135.81.Interest rates were higher for a third straight session. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 24/32, to 99 17/32, and the yield rose to 1.68 percent from 1.60 percent late Wednesday.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','Ms. Merkel, who faces re-election next year, has recently supported the central bank’s intention to intervene in the bond markets, if requested, to help reduce the borrowing costs being paid by countries like Spain and Italy. Ms. Merkel, though, has also argued that such aid needs to be accompanied by greater fiscal and political integration within the euro area, to hold member nations more jointly accountable for the fate of the monetary union.The report by the economic development organization, based in Paris, also stressed the need for greater coordination at the European level to stem the crisis in the currency zone.“With the euro area crisis still the most important risk for the global economy, further policy action is needed to instill more confidence in the monetary union,” said the report, prepared by Pier Carlo Padoan, the organization’s deputy secretary general and chief economist.Janet Henry, chief European economist at HSBC in London, said the estimates were in line with the growing body of evidence indicating that the third quarter of the year would bring the crisis to Germany’s door.“It’s hard to argue strongly against this type of forecast,” she said. “It is increasingly clear that Germany will see a contraction in the third quarter.”Ms. Henry said that statistics on gross domestic product alone did not always give a comprehensive indicator of economic sentiment within a country. Because Germany has the euro zone’s biggest economy, many politicians and taxpayers there have continued to worry about having to pick up the tab for euro zone bailouts or bond-buying programs.But now, Ms. Henry said, “if Germany is feeling the pressure, there will be a greater willingness to support greater easing of policy.”Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, director of the Europe program at the German research institute Bertelsmann Stiftung, said the estimates from the O.E.C.D. were consistent with other economic data emerging from Germany.“This confirms the views of those in Germany who said that, although over the last couple of years we have had big export successes, particularly in Asia, around two-thirds of our exports are still within the European Union and most are to the euro area,” he said. “So when the euro zone catches a cold, Germany suffers as well.”Mr. Fritz-Vannahme said that, politically, Ms. Merkel was still bound by many of her past policy statements, which urged budgetary and monetary discipline in the euro zone. But he noted that the Merkel government, feeling the economic pinch, was now giving the European Central Bank more political leeway to intervene in the sovereign debt markets.“There is more room for maneuver,” said Mr. Fritz-Vannahme, who added that the hawkish president of the German central bank, Jens Weidmann, who has made clear his opposition to bond-buying by the central bank was now “isolated.” Mr. Weidmann, a member of the bank’s governing council, dissented against the central bank’s new bond-buying program on Thursday.The O.E.C.D study highlighted the extent to which the economic situation was continuing to deteriorate throughout the euro zone.Considered together, the three largest euro zone economies — Germany, France and Italy — will contract by 0.2 percent this year, the organization estimates. Dragging down the curve is Italy, which will be in recession for the whole of 2012, contracting by 2.4 percent, the O.E.C.D. predicts.The agency also estimated that the economy of Britain, which is outside the euro zone, would shrink by 0.7 percent in the third quarter of this year. The organization, though, acknowledged that its forecast might not account for the effect of the Olympics or the likely shift of activity into the third quarter pegged to a public holiday in June, the queen’s diamond jubilee.Britain will emerge from recession with growth of 0.2 percent in the last quarter of the year, the agency estimated.More broadly, the report said the Group of 7 industrialized nations would grow by 1.4 percent this year, the same figure as 2011, with the United States economy expanding by 2.3 percent.“The loss of momentum at the G-7 level may persist through the latter half of this year, with the recession in the euro area and associated trade and confidence headwinds enduring,” the report said.“The United States is an exception, with comparatively stronger growth,” reflecting “progress in balance-sheet adjustment and improving housing market conditions,” among other factors, it said.'"
"'12-09-07,'1','1. To cook the red rice, combine with 2 cups water in a saucepan, add salt to taste and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover and simmer 30 to 40 minutes, until all of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice. Remove from the heat, remove the lid from the pan and place a dish towel over the pan, then return the lid. Let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.2. Put the stock or broth into a saucepan and bring it to a simmer over low heat, with a ladle nearby or in the pot. Make sure that it is well seasoned.3. Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a wide, heavy nonstick skillet or saucepan. Add the onion and a generous pinch of salt, and cook gently until it is just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes and the red bell pepper and continue to cook, stirring often, for another 5 minutes, until tender.4. Stir in the arborio rice and the garlic and stir until the grains separate and begin to crackle. Add the wine and stir until it has been absorbed. Begin adding the simmering stock, a couple of ladlefuls (about 1/2 cup) at a time. The stock should just cover the rice, and should be bubbling, not too slowly but not too quickly. Cook, stirring often, until it is just about absorbed. Add another ladleful or two of the stock and continue to cook in this fashion, stirring in more stock when the rice is almost dry. You do not have to stir constantly, but stir often. After 10 minutes, stir in the broccoli stems and flowers and continue to add broth and stir the rice for another 10 minutes or so, until the broccoli is crisp-tender. When the rice is just about tender all the way through but still chewy, add another ladleful of stock and the red rice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir together for a couple of minutes, until the stock is just about absorbed, and add another ladleful of stock, the Parmesan and the parsley, and remove from the heat. The mixture should be creamy (add more stock if it isn’t). Stir for about half a minute, then serve in wide soup bowls or on plates.Advance preparation: You can begin up to several hours before serving: Proceed with the recipe and cook halfway through Step 4, without adding the broccoli. The rice should still be hard when you remove it from the heat, and there should not be any liquid in the pan. Spread it in an even layer in the pan and keep it away from the heat until you resume cooking. If the pan is not wide enough for you to spread the rice in a thin layer, transfer it to a sheet pan. Fifteen to 20 minutes before serving, bring the remaining stock back to a simmer and reheat the rice.

"'12-09-08,'0','“I wasn’t sure what to expect,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “You never know: a guy could come back really hot, or you’re not sure what you’re going to get with a guy when he comes back. With the hand healing, right now he’s swinging the bat pretty good.”The Yankees need Rodriguez to help jump-start the offense, and while he was not the first (or even the second) Yankees player to homer Friday, his drive represented something that reverberated beyond this game itself.“It’s huge,” catcher Russell Martin said. “He just extends the depth of our lineup. When he’s up against anybody, he matches up well — especially once he gets going a little bit.”How much Rodriguez can still get going is a legitimate question. It is clear that, at age 37, he is not the hitter he once was. His numbers this season are nearly identical to what they were a year ago. In 99 games in 2011, he hit .276 with 16 home runs and 62 R.B.I. This year, in 99 games: a .277 average, 16 home runs and 48 R.B.I.But the Yankees had been desperate for a dangerous right-handed bat — especially after the switch-hitting Mark Teixeira went down with an injury — and Rodriguez provides that. If he gets hot, he can still carry a lineup.In May, a lot of attention was placed on Rodriguez’s diminishing power numbers — he had hit seven homers in the first 49 games — and there were doubts about whether he would regain the explosiveness he once possessed. Rodriguez responded by hitting six home runs in June.But his season had stalled even before Felix Hernandez fractured a bone in his hand with a pitch in a July 25 game against Seattle. Still, the injury was a big blow, and Rodriguez was unable to take batting practice until Aug. 30. After a few days, he zipped down to Tampa, played on back-to-back nights and then was in the lineup batting cleanup on Monday.“I’m just having a lot of fun,” Rodriguez said. “I’m so happy to be back playing and messing with the boys. The bottom line is, it’s going to come down to the guys that have done it before, guys in the middle of the order, to get big hits and drive in big runs.”He has fresh legs for a September surge, which is a hopeful sign for the Yankees and for Girardi, whose concern now is keeping him that way.“He is fresh,” Girardi said. “There’s no doubt about it. But I don’t want to run him into the ground by playing too much defense right away.”Rodriguez said he had given up looking at individual numbers at this point in the season — his homer Friday was his 300th as a Yankee, and the 645th of his career — and he again seemed to advocate a more situational hitting approach, although he backed off slightly from the master plan he had spoken of.The rest of the Yankees can bunt away, but it is clear they hope Rodriguez’s bat can provide some more big hits down the stretch.“It’s going to come up to us, the veterans, the guys in the middle of the order, to show us the way,” Rodriguez said. “We relish this opportunity. It’s the way it should be.”'"
"'12-09-08,'0','But on Friday a judge declined to halt construction on the store, which began in July, until that case is heard. As a result, the Chinatown Walmart now looks more likely than ever to open as scheduled early next year.Christilily Chiv, 24, said she worries that Walmart’s arrival in the neighborhood where she was born and raised could mark the start of a major transition in Chinatown, which remains a first stop for many Asian immigrants, into a historic district where immigrants no longer live and work.“Chinatown is a cultural community,” Ms. Chiv said. “I want to preserve what is there. And I fear what’s going to happen is that by having commercial corporations come in, they are going to erase the cultural community and what it stood for in the first place.”Still, the storefront where the Walmart Neighborhood Market plans to open has sat vacant for two decades, and many residents are eager to see it filled.“This community has not had a mainstream grocery store in 74 years,” said George Yu, executive director of the Chinatown Business Improvement District, noting that all grocery stores in the area close by 7 p.m. “What if you want yogurt or cheese? What if you want dog food? Those are pretty basic needs that every community has.”“Ninety-nine percent of the community supports this market,” Mr. Yu added. “The opposition is coming from outside Chinatown.”Labor unions have for years criticized Walmart for hiring nonunion workers and paying low wages. And some of the unions and workers’ rights advocates that have helped lead the charge to keep Walmart out of Chinatown also fought to limit Walmart’s influence in other parts of the region.This year, three of the top candidates in the 2013 Los Angeles mayoral race all vowed not to accept any campaign donations from Walmart, after unions sent a letter urging them to return contributions from the retail giant.In addition, the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, which helped organize the protest in Chinatown, also helped push through an ordinance that makes it more difficult to open large superstores here.“We’ve been organizing to try to make sure that neighborhood small businesses are protected,” said Allison Mannos, a spokeswoman for the alliance. “And also to make sure that there are not poverty-level jobs coming in.”The Walmart Neighborhood Market planned for Chinatown would offer mainly grocery items and a pharmacy. Steven V. Restivo, a spokesman for Walmart, said the company had received largely positive feedback from the community.“The day our store opens, thousands and thousands of local residents are going to shop at that Walmart Neighborhood Market,” Mr. Restivo said. “Those are people who probably never attended a council meeting or wrote a letter to the editor. They just want to have more options close to where they live and work.”He added, “In terms of the cultural impact, there is literally a Burger King across the street from our location, and a Subway next door.”Local residents remained evenly divided, according to a spokeswoman for City Councilman Ed P. Reyes, who represents the area. And even some of the local business owners are not yet sure how Walmart might affect them.Richard Lam owns an import business, selling clothes and other accessories. He showed off a Walmart app on his smartphone. But he was nervous about the arrival of the store.“I shop online with Walmart all the time,” he said. “I buy phone. I buy camera. It’s cheap.”But he added, “If they don’t open, I’m happier.”'"
"'12-09-08,'0','His sister, Debbie, and their mother, Jocelyn, were sitting on the porch when they arrived. Nearly a decade had passed since Jocelyn, a vivacious, headstrong woman, had made her husband leave for good, ending their on-again, off-again dance. She believed in her family and thought she had no other choice.There, on the porch, Franklin’s father apologized. After that, Franklin recalled, his mother let go of any bitterness toward his father. His sister would regret not showing him more compassion in the final months of his life. Franklin does not go into great detail about that day on the family’s porch, saying he wanted to respect the privacy of his parents, both now dead. But just before the start of this season, he spent 15 minutes telling his Vanderbilt team about his past.For weeks, he had asked his players to stand and talk about their families, their role models, their challenges. Players opened up. They learned each other’s histories, shed tears, perhaps because they trusted Franklin. Now it was his turn.“I just talked about why I am the way I am,” Franklin said.Franklin had been the offensive coordinator at Maryland and Kansas State before becoming the Commodores’ coach before last season. He did that despite people warning him, “You can’t win at Vanderbilt.”To a point, Franklin listened — about the 4 bowl appearances in 121 years, the 2 winning seasons in the last 35 years — so he could understand and learn from the past. Then he stopped, so his own optimism would not be poisoned. He hired young assistants, who would not put much credence in the program’s moribund history.If given the time and resources, Franklin believed he could win at Vanderbilt, the only private institution in the Southeastern Conference.“This university had to get comfortable with athletic success,” David Williams, the athletic director, said. “When I came here, there was some people who thought that being successful in athletics said something negatively about your academic success. I never got that.”In 2003, E. Gordon Gee, then the university’s president, restructured the athletic department and redefined it as a division of student life. Gee had Williams, then a vice chancellor, serve as the “quasi-athletic director,” and the university’s general counsel, so neither job received his undivided attention.When Franklin arrived, however, he sought it. He needed only one meeting to persuade Williams to build a $31 million indoor practice facility. After Franklin went 6-6 in his first regular season, earning a bowl berth, he made personal visits to donors, and Vanderbilt raised $17 million in four months, a figure previously unheard of.In July, the athletic department was reassembled as its own entity and Williams was named athletic director.“You get wrapped up in his excitement,” Williams said of Franklin. “And his excitement is not naked excitement. It’s not just excitement to be excited. It has a purpose to it. It has a beginning and an end to it, and it’s infectious. And you get caught in it. And you understand things that you may have forgotten, like, you can power success through a lot of other things.”  When Franklin arrived at Vanderbilt, he said that nobody wanted to take responsibility for the condition of the football program. “Well, that had nothing to do with me,” was what he heard again and again. The negativity overwhelmed him: there were doubters on the team, on campus, in his own athletic department.Franklin began working to change that. He came up with a slogan, “Anchor Down,” and popularized a symbol, “V-U,” made by holding one’s thumb, index and middle fingers spread apart. He featured the anchor as the team’s symbol and painted everything he could black and gold.Those cosmetic changes and Franklin’s demanding style were easier to accept once the Commodores won six games, quarterback Jordan Rodgers said.Before, it had been common for Rodgers to go unnoticed on campus.“It was such a joke if you went to the games,” Paige Cahill, a senior, said. “It was sad, because I’m a football fan, to hear somebody laughing, ‘Oh, you’re going to the game?’ ”Undeterred, Franklin visited every fraternity and sorority three times, telling them to take pride in the team, their university. It became cool to go to games, and Rodgers is now hounded by his fellow students. Still, Rodgers said, “Coach Franklin’s the rock star on campus.”Many students watched the YouTube videos Franklin posted of him surprising the team with a dodge ball tournament or with a bowling outing. The videos humanized the coach and his team. Recruits saw the videos and the success, and now they listened when Franklin visited their homes. He presented what he called a logical argument: why wouldn’t they want to play right away in the SEC, receive a quality education and make history at Vanderbilt?“He has a way with words, not in a way to trick you, but he makes you realize there are bigger things in life than football,” said Caleb Azubike, who chose Vanderbilt over Alabama and Georgia and is a member of the highly ranked 2012 recruiting class.Franklin said: “I’ve been told that we’re not doing a whole lot different than what’s been done in the past around here. But maybe our conviction and our passion and maybe the way we’re telling our story, people can visualize it a little easier.”On the night Franklin explained his past to his team, he did not have time for every intimate detail. As how in high school, when his mother separated from his father, he was, perhaps like some of them, talented, but immature. His mother cleaned other people’s homes and worked in his school as a hall aide, but found time to cheer for her son at his football games.In school, Franklin used his way with words to get out of doing homework. He would always have a tale to spin when he had dinner with his teammate Jason Bowman, who lived nearby. The Bowmans could not tell anything was amiss at home, certainly not by the stories that spilled out of Franklin or the jokes he told.“No one pushed or taught this character — he just had it,” said Gary Bowman, Jason’s father, and the superintendent of the school district Franklin attended. “If you want a story retold, he could embellish it to make it the funniest story around.“He had such a wonderful personality that he almost made it realistic.”On the night Franklin explained his past to his team, he did not have time to explain how his mother left her home in Manchester, England, to elope with a member of the United States Air Force. They moved to Pennsylvania to start a family. And when she summoned the courage to leave the man she had invested everything in, she was alone, except for her daughter, who stayed to help pay the bills, and her son, who left to play quarterback at East Stroudsburg, less than two hours away.At home during the summer, Franklin worked multiple jobs to contribute. But when he left, he felt guilty, had a sense of homesickness, his mother and sister left behind and trying to stay afloat. They once had to hide their mother’s car in a neighbor’s backyard so it would not be repossessed, and the Bowmans once paid his mother’s taxes so she would not lose the house.With that in mind, Franklin matured. He majored in psychology and then carved out a career coaching football. He put his head down and plowed ahead, as his mother had, because even if Franklin shared a name with his father, and looked more like him each year, he was his mother’s voluble, driven son.On the night the 40-year-old Franklin explained his past to his team, he worried. He asked his wife, Fumi, if he had been too vulnerable. She said no. His players would respect him for it, perhaps play harder for him because of it, and James agreed.Two days later, he stood in Vanderbilt Stadium pointing out the physical progress of his first 20 months here. Over there was the new turf, and the new scoreboard, and the new lights for prime-time games on national television, and then there was the new, grassy hill in the north end zone.Fumi and their youngest daughter, Addison, ran around the field. Their oldest daughter, Ava, had started kindergarten. This felt like home. Often Franklin and his family eat together in the renovated athletic dining hall, because he wants to be the father he never had.His daughters have chased each other through the new football meeting rooms. Already, Franklin has achieved a status that if he requests something reasonable, Williams said, there is no pushback. It is the same with Franklin’s players, who understand that once his sentimental side is gone he expects effort.“You can be hard on people, as long as you love them hard too,” Franklin said.But Franklin’s optimism and patience, his energy and his words, can only power Vanderbilt for so long. Last season’s 6-7 finish, after a bowl game loss, was still a losing season. And last week’s close call, a 17-13 loss to No. 9 South Carolina, was still a loss. The Commodores get another chance Saturday night at Northwestern.Just as he did for his father, Franklin has strengthened his team’s conviction and driven it to where it needs to be. Taking the final steps, staring down the past, and following through will now be Commodores’ most formidable act.'"

"'12-09-08,'0','Re “Race for Gas by Cypriot Rivals Adds to Tensions” (news article, Aug. 31):Turkey’s illegal occupation of Cyprus is at the root of any tension or potential friction on the island. Its army prevents the Turkish Cypriots from sharing with the Greek Cypriots the dream of building a prosperous, peaceful future for themselves and future generations.From an international legal point of view, the Republic of Cyprus has sovereign jurisdiction in its exclusive economic zone and over its continental shelf as enshrined in the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea and in domestic law.Any exploration activities by Turkey or its local administration in occupied Cyprus have no legal basis; neither do they prejudice the rights of Cyprus in any way.NICHOLAS EMILIOU Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the United Nations New York, Aug. 31, 2012The discovery of significant gas reserves off Cyprus need not be a source of instability in the region.The offer made by the Turkish Cypriot president to Secretary General Ban Ki-moon last September is still valid. With the participation of the United Nations, the two sides on the island can establish a committee to make decisions jointly for future drilling activities on and around the island.The Greek Cypriot side has yet to respond positively to this proposal, which is aimed at the settlement of the issue in an equitable manner.'"
"'12-09-08,'0','So what accounts for the collapse?Though Republicans in Congress have generally sided with the mutual fund industry, and the reforms emerged from a Democratic administration, several people I spoke to said it was a mistake to view the outcome through the prism of partisan politics. “It’s not Republicans versus Democrats,” a person involved in formulating the proposals told me. “It’s the mutual fund industry and its allies versus the American taxpayer.”For many in the mutual fund industry, 2008 seems both a distant memory and the equivalent of a 100-year flood, something unlikely to be repeated. But just four years ago, on Sept. 16, 2008, shortly after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the Reserve Fund, the nation’s oldest money market fund, “broke the buck” and set off a run on the global money fund industry.Money market funds — convenient, higher-yielding and supposedly ultrasafe alternatives to deposits at banks — are a mainstay of the mutual fund industry, offered by all the major fund families. They typically invest in short-term, low-risk assets (like United States Treasuries and highly rated commercial paper), and with the blessing of regulators, each day they report a stable net asset value of $1 a share. That’s convenient for tax purposes (there are never any reportable gains or losses), and it promotes the idea that these funds are risk-free because the reported value never fluctuates.In reality, this has always been an illusion, or what Ms. Schapiro calls a “fiction.” Even short-term assets may fluctuate as interest rates change, even if the moves are very small. And they can also fluctuate because of credit risks. That’s what happened to the Reserve Fund: it owned $785 million in Lehman Brothers’ commercial paper. When the value of Lehman Brothers debt collapsed, there was no way the Reserve Fund could claim that its shares were worth $1, even using generous rounding and averaging tactics to mask shifts in value. When the Reserve Fund admitted its shares weren’t worth $1, investors panicked and began a run on the fund. The Reserve Fund froze its assets and no one could get their money out, even though the actual net asset value was only a few cents less than $1.The run quickly spread to other money market funds. Funds were frantically trying to unload commercial paper and other assets to raise cash. Major corporations that rely on commercial paper to cover day-to-day operations found themselves unable to issue new securities as the market teetered on collapse. Secretary Paulson fielded phone calls from chief executives alarmed that they might be unable to meet their payrolls. The run on the Reserve Fund and other money market funds took the financial crisis straight from Wall Street to Main Street.I remember that week vividly because I relied on a money market fund for cash. When I needed some, I went to an A.T.M. and tapped in my access code. I didn’t even have a conventional bank account and prided myself on my modern approach — until I woke up the morning after the Reserve announcement to face the prospect that I might not have access to any of my money. In the many years I’d been relying on my money market account, such a calamity had never crossed my mind. Those old-fashioned government-insured bank accounts suddenly looked appealing.Like many others, I was saved by Treasury and Federal Reserve officials who concluded that money fund assets would be backed in their entirety by the full faith and credit of the United States. The move stopped the run in its tracks. The commercial paper market came back to life, borrowing costs eased, and A.T.M.’s kept dispensing money to people like me. Though largely unsung at the time, it was an important step that staved off a global financial collapse.It also made American taxpayers liable for over $3 trillion, the total assets held by money market funds at the time. It dwarfed the size of the subsequent TARP bailout, which was $750 billion. And even though policy makers across the political spectrum vowed that such a thing could never happen again, the failure of the S.E.C.’s draft proposals last month means that American taxpayers could again be liable for trillions of dollars in assets.To prevent this, the S.E.C. proposed two major reforms. The first was to report money market fund values the way every other fund does, which is the actual net asset value, or N.A.V., not something rounded to $1. The idea is that investors would become accustomed to and comfortable with slight changes in values. The net asset values of many short-term bond funds fluctuate modestly, and there aren’t any panics or runs just because their value declines a penny or two.The second was to require fund sponsors, if they wanted to maintain the stable $1 value, to start holding cash reserves.The mutual fund industry rallied against the proposals and lobbied fiercely to defeat them. The industry’s self-interest is obvious: the proposals impose costs and additional regulations. More fundamentally, why wouldn’t the industry and money market fund customers love the status quo? They get all the benefits of an implied government guarantee while taxpayers assume all the risk. Several people compared the situation to the way the mortgage industry fiercely supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the financial crisis made the government responsible for them.But is it only naked self-interest that explains the industry’s opposition? I spoke to John S. Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, which is the largest mutual fund company and, as a nonprofit company, can usually be relied upon to act in the best interests of its customers. Vanguard has strongly opposed the S.E.C.’s reform efforts.“We believe the proposals, if implemented, would end money market funds,” Mr. Woerth told me. “Our clients want a stable N.A.V. They write checks, pay their bill from these accounts. Would every one of these now be a taxable transaction based on gains and losses? That’s untenable.” As for the capital requirement, “It would be onerous and raise costs, which would have to be passed onto our clients.” He noted that Vanguard’s Prime money market fund this week was yielding just 0.04 percent and additional costs would bring it close to zero. He noted that many fund companies were already waiving expenses to keep the funds’ yields above zero, and said that additional costs were not sustainable.Vanguard has also argued that the 2008 crisis set off by the Reserve Fund was a liquidity crisis, and that reforms already adopted in 2010 address that issue.The S.E.C. counters that its job isn’t to ensure the survival of money market funds, but to protect Americans from another Reserve-type crisis, which remains possible unless there are further changes. Even John C. Bogle, Vanguard’s 83-year-old founder and former chairman, broke ranks with the company and offered support for the S.E.C.’s proposed reforms. In a recent interview, he told The Associated Press that the stable $1 value is an “illusion” and that money market funds pose “one of the major risks in the mutual fund industry.”Mr. Woerth responded: “John Bogle speaks his mind on any issue and always has. He’s an iconoclast and a rabble-rouser.”Ms. Schapiro told me she won’t raise the issue again with the current commission. So the debate now shifts to the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Financial Stability Oversight Council for further study. But any action could be years away. And given the recent fate of the S.E.C.’s four-year effort and the fund industry’s clout in Washington, it may never happen until the next crisis is upon us.'"
"'12-09-08,'0','Intel, the world’s largest maker of semiconductors, said its third-quarter revenue would be $13.2 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Its previous forecast has been for revenue of $13.8 to $14.8 billion. Intel also said the worsening market meant its gross profit margins would fall to 62 percent, from an earlier expectation of 63 percent.“The company is seeing customers reducing inventory in the supply chain versus the normal growth in third-quarter inventory, softness in the enterprise PC market segment and slowing emerging market demand,” Intel said.The PC market has been weak for much of the year, but until recently analysts had expected a recovery in the last quarter of the year, after Microsoft releases a new version of its Windows operating system, called Windows 8.Two weeks ago, however, analysts at the International Data Corporation projected that the worldwide PC market would grow by just 0.9 percent this year, to 367 million units. It blamed weaker demand in the usually strong Asia-Pacific market and consumer uncertainty in developed markets.Intel has fought back against the popularity of tablet computers by investing in a category of very lightweight laptops called ultrabooks. The ultrabooks, which can have both the keyboard of a laptop and a touch screen like a tablet, were expected in large volumes in the market by the middle of this year.Instead, only a few models have come out, and consumers’ reactions have been tepid. Dell, H.P. and other manufacturers are expected to have many new ultrabooks on the market in coming months.These products, however, are likely to face a crush of new competition not just from Apple, which may announce a new tablet soon, but Amazon, which on Thursday showed off new models of its Kindle e-readers and tablets. Microsoft is expected to have its own tablet, called the Surface, in late October. Several new models of tablets using Google’s Android operating system are also expected before Christmas.With all that on the market at once, along with new kinds of smartphones from Apple, Microsoft, Samsung Electronics and others, consumers may just ignore the late-season ultrabooks.Intel’s problems are “a combination of tablets and a late launch of Windows 8,” said Douglas Freedman, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. “Ultrabooks should have been out in volume in the first quarter. If you want to fend off the tablet onslaught you don’t try to release products in the third quarter.” He said manufacturers were now uncertain about what products they needed to make.Among the PC makers, H.P. appeared to have the most to lose from the slowdown Intel was signaling. Meg Whitman, H.P.’s chief executive, spared workers in China from companywide layoffs this year because China was seen as a good growth area. A slowdown there, even as H.P. is facing renewed competition from the Chinese computer maker Lenovo, could affect H.P.’s financial results.Dell, which sells fewer machines in China, would not be as affected by a slowdown there. Dell has also been making efforts to sell more servers for data centers, which remain an area of market strength.Both H.P. and Dell declined to comment on changes in their businesses.'"
"'12-09-08,'0','But in the 1990s, the family decided that the land was being mismanaged and sought advice on how to develop it, Mr. Schleicher said. Since then, they have turned a quarter of the land into Lakewood Ranch, a planned community with 7,500 homes, four million square feet of commercial space and amenities that include golf courses, soccer fields and a polo field.“We’re taking great pride in doing this project,” said Mr. Schleicher, who is a board member of Schroeder-Manatee Ranch or SMR, the family holding company that owns Lakewood Ranch and other businesses on the property. “It’s not about squeezing the last nickel out of the thing. It’s about creating a really first-class community that we can all be proud of, and it’s our legacy, really, as a family.”This, of course, is the reason people leave property in trust. Cash can be spent and so can stocks and bonds, after they are cashed in. But land is meant to keep everyone together generation after generation. So why, then, do these plans often fail?Not surprisingly, many of them are hatched too quickly or without any advice from the people who are going to benefit from the property but also have to manage it.“When parents don’t communicate well, that’s when things don’t work out,” said Peter E. Lang, a managing director at HighTower Advisors, a wealth management firm. “The more complicated the asset, the more planning; that’s when you need to get the kids involved.”This particularly applies to property, whether it is a vacation home, undeveloped land or a vast planned community. It comes with the obligation to manage it, whether providing simple upkeep or making larger economic decisions.Scott J. Cooper, managing director in the wealth structuring group at Merrill Lynch, said there had been a lot of interest in putting vacation homes in trust to take advantage of the gift tax exemption, but he said homes were not always an ideal asset, particularly when several children and spouses would use one house.“Anyone who has ever shared a dorm room with another person probably has a point of view on this,” he said. “First of all, there is the issue of, do the kids really want it? Then, you have all the challenges of a time share. When it’s time to remodel the kitchen, do you go with granite countertops or Formica? That gets pretty dicey.”Mr. Lang said that even when clients navigated these issues smoothly, there was usually compromise.He recalled a client who left her Cape Cod beach house to her twin daughters. One lived around Boston and used it all the time; the other lived outside New York and had little interest in making the five-hour drive. But they agreed to own it jointly and split the expenses because the New York daughter worked in the family business and benefited from that in a way her sister could not.“They were just very open about it,” Mr. Lang said.With a property like Lakewood Ranch, which generates income but also requires investment to keep building it out, the intrafamily discussions are bigger and carry greater financial consequences.“Real estate is very personal,” said Michael E. Papierski, senior vice president at Northern Trust and a board member of SMR. “People don’t look at it anything like stocks and bonds. They look at how it’s going to be managed in the future.”His firm manages various properties owned in trust, including a ski resort, a Manhattan office building and a recreational complex in Michigan. He said a big issue that divided families was whether the property should be run to generate income in the short term for current beneficiaries or managed so that its value increased over time.The answer usually depends on what kind of beneficiaries they are. A second spouse who receives only the income from a trust is not going to feel the same about managing the property as children from the first marriage who will pass it on to their children.In the case of Lakewood Ranch, Mr. Schleicher said the families used a combination of cash flow and borrowing to build out the community. Doing so required agreement not just among the 12 board members but also among the larger family.“The family generally has a unified opinion that this is a legacy asset,” Mr. Papierski said. “They see the long-term benefits and value that can come from this property.”But that also raises the question of what happens when the number of descendants increases over time and there are more, but smaller, ownership stakes. Mr. Schleicher said that two or three families controlled Lakewood Ranch and that he had involved his children so they would know what was going on when their generation took over.This is not the norm. Mr. Papierski said Northern Trust used to manage an office building that was owned in trust with 25 beneficiaries who often disagreed. In that case, he said the beneficiaries got lucky: they were able to sell the building back to the developer, allowing the trust to simply distribute cash to the beneficiaries.More often, family members will struggle to sell their stakes in a property. Mr. Cooper at Merrill Lynch said he advised clients to put provisions in trusts so that children could sell their shares to other family members.“The trust also needs the mechanism to buy a beneficiary’s interest out, if everyone has a different position in life and there’s a disparity in income,” he said. The rich brother, he said, “should be able to find a way to buy out his brothers’ interest.”“But it’s hard to force people to do it,” he said.On an income-generating property, Mr. Cooper said, the same issues can arise when siblings or cousins are seeking money from the trust. “I don’t care who you are, if your brother is getting a $25,000 distribution because there was some excess cash in the building, everyone wants a $25,000 cash distribution,” he said.When it works out well, though, property can indeed keep a family together. Mr. Schleicher said he thought the family had succeeded in sticking together because no one depended on the income from the property.“It sat there for 70 years,” he said. “There wasn’t any income there. So this is kind of like a newfound income stream, if you will.”In the 10 years that he has been involved in managing the property, he said the family had gotten along. “We’re all in the same boat and pulling in the same direction,” he said.But he said it would take an additional 30 or 40 years for Lakewood Ranch to be completed. And that’s a long time for any boat to stay the course — something for others to keep in mind.'"
"'12-09-08,'0','ROME — Rescue teams on Friday were searching the waters off a southern Italian islet for survivors of a boat loaded with migrants that apparently ran into difficulties a day earlier while crossing from Africa.Italian and NATO vessels rescued 56 people, including a pregnant woman, and recovered one body, but passengers on the ill-fated craft said that dozens of people were missing.Survivors have given varying versions of the passenger count, so “it’s unclear how many were on the boat,” said Commander Filippo Marini, a spokesman for the Italian Coast Guard. Initial reports suggested that the migrants were Tunisian, he said, but their nationalities would only be confirmed after primary assistance had been issued.Several Italian and NATO ships and aircraft were involved in the rescue operations, Commander Marini said. A plane used for marine surveillance by Frontex, the European Union border security agency, was also searching the waters.A passenger on the boat used a mobile phone to issue a distress call early Thursday evening, the spokesman said, and rescue ships were immediately mobilized, but the moonless night made the search difficult. The first survivors were tracked down in the early hours of Friday, after telephone operators were able to pinpoint the location from which the call had been made. Some migrants were rescued at sea, others had managed to swim to the small islet of Lampione, south of Sicily.Commander Marini said that the boat transporting the migrants had not been found, and officials have not declared it a shipwreck. Prosecutors in Agrigento, Sicily, have opened an investigation into the episode, the Italian news agency Ansa reported.'"

"'12-09-09,'0','“Sometime you wonder if the umpires are trying to get out of there,” Teixeira said. “They don’t want you to make a comeback. They want to go home. Those were terrible calls.”Yankees Manager Joe Girardi came a few steps out of the dugout to argue, but as the Orioles streamed out of the dugout to celebrate, blocking his path, he gave up the fight, at least for the moment.“What good is it, I mean really, what good is it?” Girardi said of arguing. “All I’m going to do is get fined. They’re going to watch it and know he missed it.”Although he did not engage with the umpires, Girardi did get into a heated argument with the New York Post reporter Joel Sherman after the game that was so loud and potentially physical that the two had to be separated by members of the coaching staff and security personnel.It was not the first time Girardi has had a confrontation after a loss. In Chicago last month, he yelled at, and approached, a fan who heckled him during a postgame interview.This particular argument stemmed from questions about the health of C. C. Sabathia.Sabathia did not pitch well again, giving up five runs and eight hits, including consecutive home runs by Mark Reynolds and Lew Ford and another by J. J. Hardy. Staked to a two-run lead, he gave that back and more and walked off the field trailing by 5-2 in the seventh. It was the third straight game in which Sabathia has surrendered a lead, and the Yankees have lost all three.At 13-5 with a 3.56 earned run average, his overall numbers appear impressive. But in the midst of a close divisional race, Sabathia is 0-2 with a 4.43 E.R.A. in his last three starts. Both he and Girardi insist his left elbow is not sore, but something seems to be wrong.In a crowded interview after the game, Girardi, clearly upset from the loss and the bad call, was asked several times if Sabathia was healthy, in part because it was difficult to hear. Upon the third time, he grew irritated and was then told by Sherman that it was part of the job of being the Yankees’ manager to answer questions.Girardi seemed to think the repeated questions were more about getting him to tell the truth than the difficulty hearing, and he did not want to be told his job description.“No, I’m not lying,” he said. “One time is sufficient.”Later, he invited Sherman into his office to discuss the situation, and it quickly escalated and could be heard throughout the clubhouse by players, reporters and clubhouse attendants. But the room was already simmering.There was Sabathia in one corner, taking responsibility for another disappointing outing.“I feel like I’m letting everyone down,” he said. “No one is more disappointed than I am in myself.”His velocity was not quite as high as it has been, but he said it was not because of lingering soreness in his elbow.“I feel good,” he said. “I can’t sit here and make excuses and say I’m hurting. I went out there and pitched and just didn’t pitch well.”In another corner stood Teixeira, ice wrapped up the length of his lower leg, fully expecting to be fined for his comments as he recounted the events that began after Alex Rodriguez’s towering home run in the eighth that made the score 5-3.The Yankees opened the ninth inning with singles by Ichiro Suzuki and Eric Chavez, who was replaced on the basepaths by Dickerson. Derek Jeter then dropped a surprise bunt, reaching safely to load the bases. Suzuki scored on Nick Swisher’s fielder’s choice and then Teixeira hobbled to the plate and grounded to second baseman Robert Andino, who started the decisive double play.Teixeira said he had never dived into first base before, but he had to this time because of the calf.“We’re out there fighting, and I’m out there playing on one leg,” he said. “I wish it would have gone my way.”The Orioles’ leadoff hitter, Nick Markakis, sustained a broken left thumb when he was hit by a pitch from C. C. Sabathia and is expected to miss six weeks. ... Andy Pettitte threw three innings of a simulated game Saturday and came through declaring he was well on his way to returning to game action. Pettitte, who is recovering from a broken bone in his lower left leg, will visit doctors in New York on Monday and then throw another simulated game during the week in Boston, where he hopes to increase his pitch count to 70 to 75 pitches. It could be his last tuneup before pitching in a major league game in 10 days or so. ... Ivan Nova (shoulder) was activated from the disabled list and sent to the bullpen. ... With his home run, Alex Rodriguez passed Tris Speaker for 10th place on the career runs list with 1,883.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','The boom in property values means more money for Dilley, where 78 percent of the students qualify for free and reduced school meals, a benefit that is based on family income. And as fast as its fortunes have risen, Dilley is still in a position to raise money locally and to get money from the state. Property values will have to increase by another $140 million or so before the state comes asking for money. It’s not impossible, Mr. Rodriguez said. “Last year,” he said, “we went up $100 million.”Cotulla, off the next major exit ramp from I-35 as you go south, is in a more difficult situation. Values there have jumped to $2.3 billion from $877 million, according to the school superintendent, Jack Seals. The district will bring in more money this year and won’t have to write the state a big check — there’s a one-year lag before the new local values are plugged into the state’s formula. Next year, however, Mr. Seals estimates, Cotulla will be writing the state a $15 million check.It doesn’t mean that the district is rich or the people in it are wealthy — just that the land it taxes has gone up quickly and dramatically in value. In Cotulla, 85 percent of the students were from economically disadvantaged families in 2010.But more money in revenue can mean more money for the schools, as is the case in Dilley. In Cotulla, it’s an issue for the accountants, who will need to set aside enough of this year’s windfall to help cover next year’s check to the state. Theoretically, they’ll have about the same amount of money to spend per student each year.But booms make the schools nervous. Right now, construction is at a crazy pace, and there are big trucks on all the roads. Out-of-town workers outnumber rooms and beds and have to sleep in trailers, new hotels, portable buildings or the backs of their trucks.It’s a classic boom. People are getting rich and working hard, and the dirt is flying.Since 2010, more than a dozen school districts — mostly small ones like North Zulch, Carrizo Springs and Karnes City — have seen property values rise rapidly, with more than half the growth coming from mineral properties, according to an analysis by Moak, Casey & Associates, a consultancy in Austin.If the boom stops, property values will drop. If oil and gas prices fall — even if the production and construction continue — property values will fall. In the Dilleys and Cotullas, that would mean less money. Dilley gets to keep its windfall now without sending it to the state, but would not see it replaced should values drop.Cotulla would be able to get state money again. But remember that one-year lag that’s working for them now? It would work against them in a year of declining values.“I worry about declining values in the future,” Mr. Seals said. “If values drop, we’re going to be well behind the eight ball.”'"
"'12-09-09,'0','A boy, a girl, a car, and a gun. The formula lies deep in American mythology. Imagine the appeal: you and your love object are desperadoes on the run, death the only possible outcome. It’s a suicide mission, the sort of fantasy that emerges when people are trapped. To go on the run is to chase the dragon of some other life, in full knowledge of the futility of the effort and the inevitability of the end. With sex, speed and ballistics stirred together, you simply have to accept that you will explode.The formula was already traditional by the time Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate hit the road in 1958. Its principles were established by Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow before they were gunned down in 1934. They were accomplices, not a couple, but they were married in blood — Bonnie took 23 bullets and Clyde 25. The cultural echoes began soon: Edward Anderson’s novel “Thieves Like Us” and Fritz Lang’s film “You Only Live Once,” both 1937. After the war, Mr. Anderson’s novel was filmed by Nicholas Ray as “They Live by Night” (1949) and Joseph H. Lewis made “Gun Crazy” (1950), another variation on the theme.Charles Starkweather needed only to have been alive in the 1950s to have absorbed this legacy. Bullied throughout his childhood and adolescence, he had the rage of the beaten-down, a suicidal rage that might have gotten him killed before he ever went on the rampage. Mr. Starkweather killed Robert Colvert, a gas station attendant, in Lincoln, Neb., on Dec. 1, 1957. On Jan. 21, 1958, he killed his young girlfriend’s mother, stepfather and 2-year-old sister. Then he killed August Meyer, a family friend; Robert Jensen and Carol King, who had offered the couple a ride; C. L. and Clara Ward and their maid, Lillian Fencl, whose house he invaded at random. Fleeing Nebraska, the two drove to Douglas, Wyo., where Mr. Starkweather killed Merle Collison, asleep in his car. They were captured almost immediately. Miss Fugate, 15, was sentenced to life in November 1958 (she was paroled in 1976). Mr. Starkweather, 20, died in the electric chair at the Nebraska State Penitentiary the following June.In his book “Redheaded Peckerwood,” Christian Patterson situates the actions of Mr. Starkweather and Miss Fugate in their time and place. He followed their trail, seeking out material remnants of their lives and actions. His photographs are of actual settings, actual artifacts, symbolic landscapes and metonymic objects; there are also archival photos and reproductions of documents. Mr. Patterson is attempting something that hasn’t been done much: subjective documentary photography of the historical past. This requires that pictures stick close to the physical details while remaining ambiguous; each of the pictures, no matter how innocuous its contents may be, is unsettling and anxiety-producing. The accumulation thrusts the viewer into the emotional center of the story, in a way you could call novelistic. It’s a disturbingly beautiful narrative about unfathomable violence and its place on the land.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','That eighth person camped in the wilderness in the park’s high country and stayed in a tent cabin at the Tuolumne Meadows Lodge, according to park officials. His symptoms were mild, the officials said, but after he learned of the outbreak he went to a local hospital, and laboratory tests confirmed he was infected. He is expected to make a full recovery, the officials said.There is no known cure for the hantavirus. Since the disease was first discovered in the United States in 1993, there have been 602 reported cases of infection, resulting in 216 deaths, giving it a mortality rate of 36 percent.Dr. Pierre Rollin, one of the lead investigators for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helping in investigating the outbreak, said that the virus itself was the same as had been seen in past years.“What is unusual is to have an outbreak concentrated in one area like this,” he said.Hantavirus is common in deer mice. A survey by the California Department of Public Health in 2010 found that 18 percent of the mice tested in Yosemite carried the virus.However, transmission to humans remains rare. A person can be infected if they come into contact with the feces or urine of mice carrying the virus.The type of hantavirus in the United States is not believed to be transmissible from person to person.People infected with the virus generally begin to show symptoms one to five weeks after exposure, according to the C.D.C.Early symptoms include “fatigue, fever and muscle aches, especially in the large muscle groups — thighs, hips, back and sometimes shoulders,” according to the C.D.C.“There may also be headaches, dizziness, chills and abdominal problems, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain,” according to the agency.In as little as four to 10 days, the symptoms can become more severe. Patients can suffer shortness of breath and coughing as the lungs fill with fluid. The C.D.C. Web site quotes one survivor as saying that it felt as if he had a “tight band around my chest and a pillow over my face.”Park officials at Yosemite have set up a hot line for visitors concerned that they may have been exposed. Since the first warnings were issued, it has been flooded with thousands of calls.Health officials warned that more infections could be reported. Some four million people from around the world visit the park each year.The outbreak prompted the World Health Organization to issue a global alert of its own for travelers to any country to avoid exposure to rodents.Dr. Rollin said that doctors in other countries were investigating possible infections, but no one was confirmed to have the virus.Despite the lack of a cure, Don Neubacher, the superintendent of Yosemite, said in a statement that it was important for people who think they might have been infected to get medical care.“We want to make sure that visitors have clear information about this rare virus and understand the importance of early medical care,” he said. “We continue to work closely with state and national public health officials, and we urge visitors who may have been exposed to hantavirus to seek medical attention at the first sign of symptoms.”'"
"'12-09-09,'0','Q. How was this person a bad manager?A. There were sort of the big and obvious things. I remember being regularly publicly humiliated. I’d send out an Excel spreadsheet that didn’t have first and last names broken out into separate fields, and he sent a “reply all” to the entire company telling me how stupid I am and how bad I am at Excel. There were so many situations where I remember being just made to feel inferior and stupid, no matter how hard I worked. I was a kid out of college and I was not qualified to do some of the work I was being asked to do, but I did my best. And when my best wasn’t good enough, I was told I was very stupid, essentially.And I just remember saying: “I never want to make anybody feel this way. This is horrible.” And it made me think; I don’t want to be in a situation like this again. I want to create a better situation for myself. So we really try to do that. And I think we succeed more than we fail on a person-by-person basis.Q. What insights have you had about culture as the company has grown?A. Within the last year, there was sort of another turning point — there’s always that moment when you go from knowing everyone to not knowing everyone. As a C.E.O., that’s a big one — when people start getting hired and I didn’t write the offer letter for them. Or people start getting hired when you literally have never met them and they walk through the office and I’ll say to someone, “Who is that guy?” That happens now, since new people are joining us every week.But right now I’m actually in the middle of a process, sort of a personal exercise, to actually shrink the company. Not in terms of head count. But it’s about communication. I’m working really hard to make this something where it doesn’t feel like this unwieldy beast. I know this might sound like a contradiction, but I want to be able to micromanage without micromanaging. I want to come in and really understand the goals of a team, how all the teams are communicating, where are we duplicating our efforts, who are the weak links.And what are we doing — devoting resources to, and keeping alive, from a product perspective, a tech perspective, a culture perspective — that we shouldn’t be doing anymore? And where can we cut the fat? I don’t think of this as a situation where every year, as a matter of policy, you carve off the bottom 10 percent. But it may manifest itself that way, not necessarily in staffing, but just by focusing on what we want to do as a company. So I’m really trying to shrink it down for myself and getting it to something that’s manageable, where I feel like I have a real handle on everything that’s happening.Q. Let’s talk about hiring. How do the conversations go when you’re interviewing job candidates? What questions do you ask?A. When we were just starting out, I was incredibly gut-driven when I was interviewing people. And that was because, as a start-up, we weren’t really able to hire people with good résumés. There was never anyone with good experience we could attract at that point, so you hired the person you felt better about. And I think we made a shift as we grew to start looking much more for specific skills. We need a seller with three years of experience, et cetera. But now I don’t think that was the right way to do things, and we’re making a good shift back to gut-driven hiring.You sit across the table from someone and usually you know in about 10 or 15 minutes if this person is going to work out. Now you never know the work ethic until they actually start working for you. But I’m making very gut-driven decisions right now. It’s actually the way that I invest at Lerer Ventures, the fund I run with my father, as well. The point is, you’re investing in a person. Yes, they might have a product, and yes, they might have a business. But is it going to evolve and pivot? And do I want to be business partners with this person? That’s the hurdle you need to get over.And the hiring at Thrillist is very much the same. You sit across the table from someone and talk to them. Does it feel right or doesn’t it feel right? And if it feels right, it is right a vast majority of the time, I’m finding.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','The tactics have given more visibility to a problem long considered largely a private matter.“Things are changing; the girls are becoming bolder, they are continuously taking steps, and they are not afraid to die,” said Mahnaz Rahman, resident director of the Aurat Foundation, a women’s rights organization active throughout Pakistan. “They know that they will be killed, but even then they are taking these steps because they can’t conform to the values of their parents. They are the girls of this modern age.”When a woman disagrees with her parents’ choice of husband, she has few options, Ms. Rahman said. If she wants to marry someone else, the two must elope and leave the family home behind. By leaving the home, though, the daughter is considered to have dishonored her family, and that is where culture, custom and the legal system intersect with retribution.Parents frequently press kidnapping charges to regain control of a renegade daughter. Such cases can engulf entire families, as the police will often seize property and detain relatives of the accused man.When they met and fell in love, Ms. Mochi and Mr. Bhatti were neighbors in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, a section of Karachi. The complication was evident from the start. Ms. Mochi had been promised since birth to her father’s cousin, 15 years her senior. Her family refused to end the engagement.Her parents have since moved back to their ancestral home, a village in the Rajanpur district of Punjab Province, and could not be reached for comment.The couple secretly married in a Karachi city court on Aug. 11, 2007, then waited until Mr. Bhatti was able to save money and secure a home for them in another part of the city before making their escape the following year.Ms. Mochi’s father soon began harassing Mr. Bhatti’s father for the return of his daughter or some monetary compensation. Eventually, the family charged Mr. Bhatti with kidnapping for ransom.In court, Ms. Mochi was able to testify that she had not been coerced and could produce the affidavit she had signed on their wedding day declaring that the decision to marry was her own.Such affidavits have become crucial tools in conflicts over freewill marriages. Not only are they produced in court to validate these unions, but they are also presented by women to local Sindhi-language newspapers as “freewill marriage notices,” subverting the traditional concept of the marriage announcement to fend off accusations of abduction and adultery.The sanction against freewill marriage “has neither to do with law nor with religion,” Ms. Rahman said. “It has to do with culture. It has to do with lack of education.”Most of the cases Ms. Rahman sees come from rural, impoverished areas of Sindh Province, where tribal councils, or jirgas, hold more influence than state courts. For women who have married without the consent of the family or who have refused the spouse picked for them, community justice is often worse than a long court battle.Pakistani newspapers routinely carry articles about couples who faced violence as a result of marrying without their families’ consent. In one recent case, The Express Tribune reported last month that a couple, Almas Khan and Shamim Akhtar, were killed in Chakwal, Punjab, over the weekend of Id al-Fitr, the holiday ending Ramadan.Ms. Akhtar’s father had registered a kidnapping case with the police after the couple eloped. The family contacted their daughter and her husband, saying the pair would be forgiven if they returned. When they complied, they were shot and their bodies strung from a tree.These killings, called karo-kari in Sindhi, are a constant threat for women who enter into freewill marriages. The women are considered dishonorable, or kari, and become the targets of male relatives looking to restore family prestige. The men, too, can be targets.Even when such cases are investigated, the killers often escape prison sentences. Under Islamic criminal law, which applies to murder cases in Pakistan, victims’ heirs or family members are entitled to pardon a perpetrator in exchange for monetary compensation. Since most karo-kari killings are committed by close relatives, there is often pressure to forgive the perpetrator, who then goes free.In its 2011 annual report, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent organization, found that, according to news and field reports, at least 943 women were victims of so-called honor killings that year, 219 of them because they wanted to choose a spouse.Such realities did not discourage Ms. Mochi from making her choice. She was, she said, too consumed by anger on the day she left home. “If they are not allowing me to get married, than I will do it,” she recalled telling herself.Mr. Bhatti is trying to negotiate an end to the feud so the couple can live in peace, but his wife’s family is demanding 200,000 rupees, or $2,110. He earns 200 rupees a day. Still, he says, he and his wife are content. “We are happy with our every decision,” he said.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','In this or any election year the candidates can be counted on to make regular references in their campaign speeches to “the issues.” It’s important to realize that in doing so they are not actually alluding to the real-world challenges facing Americans. They are alluding to “the issues” — just that, that actual two-word phrase.The issues, of course, are what we all know elections are supposed to be about. In theory we want our public servants to be like those in Thucydides, appealing to our intellect with long, detailed, well-defended elaborations of their positions on those economic and geopolitical questions upon whose answers the future of our nation depends. But in practice, you were yawning by the end of that sentence.Most of us just aren’t built to endure that much debate. (And they weren’t in ancient Greece either. Thucydides was the Aaron Sorkin of his day — a great writer who used current events as the basis for inspiring and thought-provoking speeches no real person would or could ever actually say.)No: we are human beings. We like personalities and ad hominem attacks and sex scandals and gossip. This is how Homo electorus rolls. But the Homo sapiens part of us feels guilty about this. We know we should be talking about the issues. We just don’t wanna. Luckily, the candidates are just as uninterested in getting wonky as the electorate is, and the two sides have evolved an ingenious, mutually beneficial arrangement to make structuralists proud: Turn signifier into the signified. Like:“I care about the issues facing this country.”“The issues facing this country are far too urgent for me to spend the next 10 minutes outlining them.”“I want this debate to be about the issues. The economy. Our future. How to make America great. [Pause.] I’ll tell you what else is great — the fried dough here at the Iowa State Fair!”'"
"'12-09-09,'0','Indian and Pakistani officials have offered optimistic statements about the nations’ relations. “We must learn from the past,” Mr. Ashraf said Friday in his meeting with Mr. Krishna. “We cannot change our neighbors.”Pakistan’s foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, called the new visa agreement “the first step in normalization of relations with our neighbor.”Mr. Krishna and Ms. Khar covered a broad range of issues in their talks, but it was not immediately clear if they made headway in addressing mutual irritants.The most volatile issue, Kashmir, remains at the center of discord between the countries and shows no signs of resolution. Officials say they are continuing their discussions over the disputed Himalayan territory, which has led to wars in the past.On Saturday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India — who supports the visa changes — made clear that security remained a big concern. According to the Indian news media, he said there had been increased attempts by militants to infiltrate the de facto border that divides Kashmir.Frictions also continue over the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, for which India has blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba militants based in Pakistan. India wants swift prosecution of suspects arrested in connection with the attacks. A trial of seven Lashkar-e-Taiba suspects is under way in Pakistan, but critics say its progress has been stalled by frequent adjournments.For its part, Pakistan wants India to move quickly on disputed territories beyond Kashmir, including the Siachen Glacier. Pakistan also is pressing for India to remove nontariff barriers to trade.Despite continued tensions, Pakistani politicians and Indian officials said that a step-by-step approach to repair ties was essential.“We will not be held hostage to history,” Ms. Khar said.Pakistan has sent a strong message to India by increasing trade ties, she said. Bilateral trade between the two countries was only $300 million in 2004, but increased ninefold to $2.7 billion in 2011, and is expected to grow further.In his remarks, the Indian foreign minister stressed that terrorism was dangerous to both countries.“We agreed that terrorism poses a continuing threat to peace and security,” Mr. Krishna said. “The Pakistani side reiterated its commitment to bring all perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice expeditiously.”He said Mr. Singh would visit Pakistan when “he feels something worthwhile will come out of the visit.” There is speculation that Mr. Singh might go to Pakistan by the end of the year.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','Aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo said they hoped that the 11th anniversary, on Tuesday, might create pressure for a last-minute deal. Late last week, the two sides began circulating proposals to resolve the yearlong impasse.Still, earlier agreements have fallen apart.“It would be catastrophically sad if they can’t find a solution,” said Ira M. Millstein, a board member of the Sept. 11 foundation and a prominent commercial lawyer. “They really ought to sit down in a room and look at each other. It can’t be solved with e-mails.”Other members of the board, whose relatives died in the attacks, said they would hold a demonstration on Monday if the officials did not break the deadlock.Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo tried to bridge their differences last month when they agreed to establish an advisory committee to address disputes over the memorial, the museum and access to the site. But then a new dispute erupted over how much money the foundation would contribute to the museum’s operating costs, and the plan for the advisory committee has not moved forward.Last week, in a break with custom, Governor Cuomo and Governor Christie did not attend the foundation’s annual fund-raising dinner at Cipriani Wall Street, where the comedian was the host.Port Authority officials bought a table for the event, but hesitated to attend because they were concerned about the reception they would receive from foundation executives, given the looming anniversary and the tensions over the negotiations, according to authority and foundation officials. Ultimately, at least two midlevel authority executives did go.The first hint of tensions occurred after the 10th anniversary commemoration, when reports surfaced that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie were annoyed at Mr. Bloomberg and the foundation over restrictions on access to the memorial and the ceremony. The reports were later denied by aides to the two governors.The dispute entered a new stage in June with a struggle over who would control the overall memorial.The conflict over what many New Yorkers regard as a hallowed site carries political risks for the mayor and the governor.Mr. Bloomberg has raised tens of millions of dollars for the museum and has contributed $15 million of his own money, but he may leave office at the end of 2013 with a legacy project in disarray. And Mr. Cuomo may be blamed for the standstill as talk of political dysfunction and a failed museum dominates news media coverage of the 11th anniversary.The foundation, which has collected $450 million in private donations, estimates that it will take another year of construction work to complete the museum and two or three more months to install the exhibits and prepare for an opening.Asked to explain the reasons for the impasse, Mr. Bloomberg’s aides would say only that negotiations were continuing.“The delay is hugely disappointing to family members of victims and the many stakeholders who have worked hard to curate the museum,” said Julie Wood, a Bloomberg spokeswoman. “But we are confident that the finished product will be the definitive historical accounting of that terrible day.”Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said, “They are working through complex financial and economic issues, but we are cautiously optimistic” about an agreement.The delay contrasts with advances on the rest of the site. The new signature skyscraper has reached its zenith at 104 floors, the mezzanine for the transportation hub is essentially complete, and the vehicle security center is nearing street level.Officials say 4.5 million people have visited the Sept. 11 memorial since it opened a year ago. (The memorial covers eight acres at street level, while the 100,000-square-foot museum is seven floors below ground.)The dispute over the museum represents a return to the political squabbling, delays and inaction that characterized the rebuilding of the 16-acre trade center site before 2008, when new leadership at the Port Authority forged an agreement on a construction plan.But it also reflects the extraordinary costs of nearly every project at ground zero, including the skyscraper at 1 World Trade Center and the transportation center.Under a 2006 agreement, the foundation was to raise $700 million to build the museum, including from private donations and state and federal money.The Port Authority was responsible for building it and paying for hundreds of millions of dollars in related expenses. The authority is also required to formally lease or transfer the parcel to the foundation.There has long been friction between the foundation and the authority over the rising costs of the project. The authority largely stopped construction after the 10th anniversary, arguing that the foundation owed it $150 million to $300 million.Cuomo aides contended that the full cost of the museum had ballooned to $1.3 billion. The foundation countered that the Port Authority owed it more than $100 million because of the authority’s failure to complete the museum in 2009, as originally promised.Subsequent negotiations between the mayor’s office and authority officials appointed by Mr. Cuomo reached what they thought was a tentative agreement in April 2012 in which the foundation agreed to pay the authority an additional $75 million and rent space at 1 World Trade Center.But then Mr. Cuomo sought assurances that the foundation had a plan to cover the museum’s $60 million operating budget, saying that he did not want the authority saddled with additional costs in the event of a shortfall.In recognition of the enormous public investment in the museum, the governor also sought some oversight of the memorial and the museum.Executives at the foundation viewed Mr. Cuomo’s moves as a slap at Mr. Bloomberg, who became chairman and chief fund-raiser for the foundation in 2006.Late last week, foundation board members said they were trying to step up pressure on Bloomberg and Cuomo officials to resolve the impasse.“People walk up to the doors of the museum, and the doors are locked,” said Christine A. Ferer, a board member whose husband, Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, died in the attack. “Locked inside is the full story of 9/11.”'"
"'12-09-09,'0','VLADIVOSTOK, Russia — Gazprom, Russia’s state-controlled gas monopoly, signed an accord on Saturday with the government of Japan to move forward with plans for the construction of a $13 billion natural gas terminal here that would propel the Kremlin’s ambitions to multiply its business and trade ties in the Far East.While the ultimate deal still hinges on reaching an agreement on the price Japan will pay for the natural gas, the accord is a crucial step toward increasing Russian energy exports at a time when Japan is eager to find alternatives to its largely shuttered, and politically embattled, nuclear power industry.The agreement was signed by Aleksei Miller, the chairman of Gazprom, and Ichiro Takahara, a senior Japanese trade official, on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting, which is being held in Russia for the first time.Gazprom already sells natural gas to Japan, but another major deal would further reduce Russia’s reliance on Europe as its primary market.In a statement, Mr. Miller said that the Asia-Pacific market was “the most capacious in the world” and that within the next few years, sales by Gazprom to Asia would exceed its sales in Europe, where the company fills roughly a quarter of the Continent’s demand.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','“It was an aesthetic that came out of the only way we knew how to make music, which was live,” Mr. Smith said last month, in the bar of the Bowery Hotel in the East Village, on a damp afternoon in between area concerts.“There was only ever three or four things that could actually be going on at the same time,” he continued. “We didn’t want to add anything in the studio. If anything, in the studio we’re always just taking things away.”The xx is all negative space, reminiscent of how some early Rick Rubin productions were billed as “reduced,” not produced. All the parts can be heard, nothing competes for attention.It’s respectful, almost ethical. This is how friends treat one another, allowing one another to be heard. In person the band members are quiet and gentle, in keeping with their music. The three — now all 23 — have played together since they were in their teens: Mr. Sim and Ms. Croft have known each other since they were 3, and knew Mr. Smith since they were 11.When they were still in school, they would play pubs and clubs in London, gigs they didn’t tell their friends about, lest some of them actually showed up. In characteristically British fashion, the xx went from Myspace demos to winning the Mercury Prize for its self-titled 2009 debut album in very short order.And yet the xx never became big — popular, yes, but not king-size. If you didn’t know any better, you would think the members of the xx were hoping you wouldn’t notice them. There’s the lowercase band name, and the all-black-everything style sense, and the quiet, retreating style of conversation. They leave a light footprint. On “Coexist” 9 of 11 song titles are single words, the other 2 have just 2.They are the right ones, though, short words that evoke long sentiments: “Reunion,” “Sunset,” “Missing” and, best of all, “Unfold.”Unfold is what the songs do, beginning as pointillist sketches and ending up as huge, blurry color blocks. Even the vocals defy clean shape. Mr. Sim is the more confident singer, with a little of the sweaty, louche urgency of Michael Hutchence. He idolizes another smooth, economical singer, Sade: “She’s what I want to be when I grow up.”By contrast Ms. Croft sometimes still sounds shy, though her reticence is also its own creative strategy. When the two began singing, they were reluctant to do so in front of the other; their interplay still has a nervous edge.When they come together, it sounds almost accidental, two trucks rolling down the highway in the dead of night, side by side. It happens on “Sunset,” which Ms. Croft begins with toughness:I saw you againIt felt like we had never metIt’s like the sunset in your eyesHad never wanted to riseWhat have you doneWith the one I loveWhen Mr. Sim enters, it’s with just as forceful authority, and the interplay is a grim face-off, Ms. Croft’s anger rubbing up against Mr. Sim’s regret:When I see you againThat we did all we couldMr. Smith is working hard here too, in his way, ensuring the backing track has propulsion but not heavy muscle. He’s a perfectionist. “He’ll spend a couple of days making a change that I won’t actually hear,” Mr. Sim said. When Mr. Smith recently moved into a new apartment, he designed the furniture to his specifications.Others have been taking notice. “I always think of the xx as what I do and everything else as what I’m able to do because of the xx,” Mr. Smith said. That everything else has included remixes (as Jamie xx) for Radiohead, Adele, Florence and the Machine and others, as well as “We’re New Here” (Young Turks/XL), an album of pastiche productions using vocals by Gil Scott-Heron.It also put him on the radar of the hip-hop star Drake, who met with him in London. Mr. Smith played him tracks by Jai Paul and SBTRKT, both of which Drake ended up rapping over. Drake also used “I’ll Take Care of U,” from “We’re New Here,” as the base of the Rihanna duet that served as the title track of his platinum-selling 2011 album “Take Care” (Young Money/Cash Money/Universal Republic)Where Mr. Smith goes, so goes the xx as a whole. “It sounds like us, us as people,” he said of “Coexist,” “like what we’ve been doing in the past year.” You can hear flickers of his recent interest in techno — it makes up the bulk of the D.J. sets he’s recently been playing — but, he insists, “we’re not looking to make people dance.” Even at its most lush “Coexist” has so few moving parts it’s almost perverse. If that means that the album becomes labored in its second half, when an existential fatigue seems to replace the careful pacing, so be it; it remains a wonderful experiment in the power of absence.The group’s first album, which was in style not so different from the new one, had a real kinship with the British dubstep scene emerging at the time — not the pneumatic-intensity version that became American pop, but the savage, craterous low-end wobble that took British dance music and stripped out the flash. The xx’s musical strategy went hand in hand with what was almost a return-to-values idea about performance — don’t make records that can’t be reproduced live — that’s unusual in the realm of electronic music.But from just a handful of pieces the xx fills rooms with ease. The members are restrained, never wanting to use too much of the stage, but are confident that the sound will bleed into the furthest corners of the room. It’s like a mass auditory experiment, aided by technology. “We bring a lot of different speakers with us to suit the room,” Mr. Smith said.None of the three are completely acclimated to live performance yet. When you can see them through the haze, they still don’t look 100 percent comfortable. Mr. Smith says he’s been thinking about ways to tour without actually being onstage: “ridiculous ideas, like doing it on Skype.”And yet fewer live shows are more resolute than the xx’s. It achieves a stillness that’s multidimensional. In part that’s because of the emotional declamations of Mr. Sim and Ms. Croft, who sing love songs, or broken-love songs, but not duets — at least, not in the sense that Mr. Sim and Ms. Croft appear to be singing to each other.“We’re kind of singing outward, so it doesn’t matter, having that disjointedness,” Mr. Sim says. “We’re not the conventional male-female duet — Ike and Tina, Cher and Sonny.” More like Xanax and Klonopin, washed down with Mr. Smith’s cough syrup.Each person is playing a part, staying out of the way of the others, trusting in the bigger picture while absorbed in their individual roles: three people who trust one another enough to work alone, together.'"
"'12-09-09,'0','VENUS AND SERENA AGAINST THE WORLDWith only one or two exceptions, Venus and Serena Williams have proved to be not only great athletes but also the personification of grace under pressure. As for Richard Williams, I agree with him — those of us who were raised by African-American parents in the South in the ’40s and ’50s know what it’s like to steel ourselves emotionally against Indian Wells-like situations and decide, as Serena did, that we don’t need to go back there. As a New Yorker and a tennis fan, I hope Serena and Venus continue to play the U.S. Open. It just wouldn’t be the same tournament without them. ROBIN ROBINSON, New York, posted on nytimes.comPeople used to say they did not like Venus and Serena because of Richard. Yet they were kids. Nobody liked the fathers of Andrea Jaeger, Jennifer Capriati, Steffi Graf, Maria Sharapova, or Mary Pierce, yet none of that dislike followed their children. Richard and Oracene did a great job raising their daughters. As for Serena’s outburst at the U.S. Open, the lineswoman was wrong. Serena apologized. Move on. APRIL, New York, posted on nytimes.comIn the days before the stadium’s electronic signs, my father used to spend vacations hand-lettering the names on the brackets at the U.S. Open. My twin brother and I would go with him after the matches were over to watch as he updated who had advanced toward the finals each day. While he worked, my brother and I played in the empty stadium that was filled to capacity just hours before. We hunted stray tennis balls and often returned home to Brooklyn with shopping bags full of those discarded treasures. While we never saw any tennis matches played in the stadium, we still have our own vivid memories of the greatness of Forest Hills. MARVIN S. MEDOW,Yorktown Heights, N.Y.If these people are really atheists, then why do they feel the need to proclaim their (non) faith? If God doesn’t exist, why is it so important to deny his existence and to do so publicly? Do they feel the need to publicly deny the existence of Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny (to say nothing of the Great Pumpkin)? This seems to be a case of “You can take the man out of evangelicalism, but you can’t take evangelicalism out of the man.” A.N.S., Alexandria, Va., posted on nytimes.comWhat I miss from these “new atheists” is any engagement with deeper thinkers and spiritual leaders who have wrestled with matters of faith. If they have a look at Heschel and Fackenheim, at C. S. Lewis, at St. John of the Cross, at Bonhoeffer, Niebuhr and Tillich, they will discover that genuine religious faith frequently embraces uncertainty and that prayer is neither as simple nor as facile as we might think it to be. It may also be that God sometimes speaks through what is claimed to be a purely secular voice. THE REV. ROBERT CARROLL WALTERS, Worcester, Mass.Saying that agnosticism is “safer” than atheism or theism sells it short. Atheists and theists are identical in one respect: they both assert something about which they know nothing. Agnostics, on the other hand, have the courage, intellectual honesty and common decency to admit that they don’t know. BILL SCHLISE, Milwaukee'"
"'12-09-09,'0','It is no surprise that the bizarre jeremiad “The Victims’ Revolution” (Aug. 26) dismisses Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s work as that of someone trying to “show off,” whatever that means. What does surprise and dishearten me is the tacit approval Andrew Delbanco gives to this remark in his otherwise lucid review. Referring to Sedgwick’s offending choice of words, including “liminal,” Delbanco seems to say not to worry: “This kind of thing is a shrinking sector of academic life.”At a time when airing out an artist’s biography in academic discourse was the equivalent of professional hara-kiri, Sedgwick situated her reading of texts at the dangerous crossroad where messy, often closeted, life experiences seem to intersect with the created spaces of literary texts. Her work, later considered one of the main foundations of various expressions of “queer theory,” opened the door — it certainly opened mine — to new ways of reading, understanding and writing about literature. Eve was a gifted scholar and an amiable, generous colleague at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. If she belongs “to a shrinking sector of academic life,” as Delbanco says, we are the worse for it.OSCAR MONTERONew YorkThe writer is a professor of Latin American literature at Lehman College and the CUNY Graduate Center.'"

"'12-09-09,'0','Travis Porter’s first concert was in a strip club called Roosters, when the group members were still in their midteens; Ali’s mother was a manager there. They didn’t have money to give them, Ali said of the strippers who were dancing during their performance. “My mom gave us ones.” Later, Ali was chatting up a dancer wearing a neon green slingshot, while Strap lurked in a corner, a naked woman pressed up against him with intense familiarity as he whispered in her ear. The rules about touching appeared to be flexible.The D.J. spotted the R&B singer Ne-Yo in the crowd and gave him a shout-out. A few minutes later the D.J. pointed out Cam Newton, the Carolina Panthers quarterback. Late in the night, the Atlanta superstar Young Jeezy arrived with a big entourage, and sat, buddahlike, as the D.J. cued up his song “I Do,” with its flirty opening line: “I said I see some ladies in here tonight I might marry.” Again, the room got cloudy with dollar bills.But by 1 a.m., there were signs of fatigue. The strippers were attractive, sure, but to the hip-hop elite in attendance they were familiar, too — friends, former flings, sometimes both. For a while, it looked as if Ali might not make it through the stack of bills in his hand. Quez was doing a lot of talking, grabbing the attention of a curvy woman with glow-in-the-dark barbells through her nipples. In other words, it was just another night in Atlanta.Magic City, Blue Flame, Cheetah, Diamonds of Atlanta, Follies: the way some cities are known for their restaurants or their museums or their turn-of-the-century architecture, Atlanta’s landmarks are strip clubs. In the way that people in Los Angeles or Miami might ask you if you’ve visited the beach, in Atlanta, you’re asked if you’ve seen any strippers. And in Atlanta more than in any other city, hip-hop culture overlaps heavily with this world. The strip club is where new music is tested out, where stars go to be seen or to relax, where the value of a song can be measured by the number of dollars that fly skyward when it plays.But for rappers seeking to make names for themselves beyond the city limits, this venerable strip club scene has turned into something of an albatross. Atlanta’s newest club champions — acts like Travis Porter, Future and Cash Out — all made their bones in places like Follies but have been fighting for the mainstream with more tenacity than their predecessors. In a way, they are running away from history.From the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, Atlanta had a worthy bass music scene that rivaled the bigger and better-known one in Miami, with local stars like Kilo Ali, DJ Smurf and MC Shy-D making music for, and about, the strip club. The club’s centrality receded, somewhat, as the city moved away from that sound to the earthier, eccentric post-funk of groups like Outkast and Goodie Mob.In the mid-2000s, though, the clubs rose to renewed prominence at the intersection of several emergent movements in the city — there was the city’s arrival as the center of hip-hop innovation, its rising black celebrity class and the pernicious influence of the crime syndicate BMF, which was known for its flamboyant and extravagant strip club outings. These were huge transactional scrums — rappers, dancers, criminals, bottles of alcohol, tens of thousands of dollars in the air.While the last decade has seen several hip-hop superstars come out of Atlanta — T.I., Young Jeezy, Ludacris — it’s also fostered more than its share of club-friendly onetime crossover wonders like Dem Franchise Boyz or Shop Boyz. Acts like these “were making songs to try to get played at Crucial and the Poole Palace, and they ended up on Billboard,” said DJ Drama, a mixtape D.J. who’s a fixture in Atlanta’s rap world. When success caught them unprepared, they fizzled.That’s a fate that Future, for one, has been trying to avoid. Future, who released his major-label debut, “Pluto” (A1/Freebandz/Epic), in April, is perhaps the least typical rapper to ever emerge from Atlanta’s strip clubs. He not only raps but sings, and often manipulates his voice digitally on songs, giving him a spooky, post-human presence. His mixtapes have been a striking blend of grimy street realism and outer-space-focused fabulism. It’s a blend suggestive of some of the extravagantly strange music made in Atlanta in the 1990s, including the debut albums by Outkast and Goodie Mob, which were produced by Organized Noize. (Rico Wade, one of Organized Noize’s anchors, is Future’s cousin and mentor.)Future was grateful but blunt about his success among the G-string set. “My goal was never that,” he said in the small studio in Atlanta in which he does all his recording. “I just knew I had to start with that. You gotta go through the front door to get to the back of the house.”Future had just flown back from San Francisco, where he performed his breakthrough hit “Tony Montana” at the N.F.C. Championship Game. Even though it was the regular night of his own D.J., DJ Esco, at Magic City, Future came off the plane, went to the studio, and then home.In fact, during my two trips to Atlanta, it proved impossible to get him to a strip club, any strip club, despite the fact that one of his hits at the time was “Magic,” as in Magic City. For days, his representatives hemmed and hawed, eventually declining on his behalf. Future had meetings about brand partnerships to attend, and a dinner to celebrate the Steve Harvey film “Think Like a Man” — Future had a song on the soundtrack — but no time for strip clubs.“I don’t go to clubs for fun, I go to clubs for business,” he said. “I’m going to connect with the D.J.’s, or I’m going making sure I pay the girls, make sure they good and make sure we throw the money.” Travis Porter echoed the sentiment. “They’re your promoters,” Quez said of the dancers and D.J.’s. “You’re just paying your promoters — strip club payola, even though you can’t write that off.”But years of patronage and torrents of dollars can’t guarantee smooth passage from the club scene to the mainstream. Future’s ambitious and eccentric first album, “Pluto,” sold only 40,000 copies in its first week, a middling debut. Meanwhile, on the heels of “Make It Rain,” Travis Porter signed to the pop powerhouse label Jive, a tough fit. Jive followed “Make It Rain” with “College Girl,” an almost comically tame love song with a video featuring the group dressed like neo-preps, neutering its rowdy charm. It didn’t work out. Jive has now dissolved, and Travis Porter was reassigned to RCA. (The cover art for its latest hit, “Ayy Ladies,” features a woman sprawled facedown across the three members’ laps.)But by the time of the BET Awards, in July, neither Travis Porter nor Future were invited to strut their stuff on the main stage. Instead, the nasal-voiced Cash Out acted as the ambassador from Atlanta’s strip clubs, performing “Cashin’ Out,” his breakthrough single. It was originally released late last year, and its grass-roots success eventually earned Cash Out a record deal with Epic. The song went on to top the Billboard rap songs chart and even crack the top 40 on the Hot 100 pop chart.The popularity of “Cashin’ Out” had a lot to do with the Internet — the video now has more than 5 million YouTube views — and its viral success suggests that rappers might not need to be tossing dollars five nights a week just to get their songs played outside of Atlanta. “Why would you give that money away?” asked Sonny Digital, the producer of “Racks” by YC featuring Future, another unavoidable strip club anthem. “When you break a song on the Internet, that’s happening for free.”Cash Out may have broke out on the Internet, but he began his campaign the old-fashioned way. After his song was recorded, for “three or four weeks straight, he was [at the clubs] politicking with the D.J.’s and the dancers,” said his producer DJ Spinz.While the strip club remains the most reliable way to rocket-boost a song out of Atlanta, the scene competes increasingly with other hip-hop micromovements, including the country-rap of DJ Burn One and younger, tamer acts like Rich Kidz, who suggest something like a PG-13 version of Travis Porter. Then there are the bleak, intense street rhymes of Alley Boy and Trouble, whose Duct Tape Entertainment label feels miles removed from the showy dollar tossing of the clubs.I met both Alley Boy and Trouble in the Wallpaper-worthy midtown Atlanta apartment of a colleague. We talked about their recent jail sentences and about making street-oriented music in a city known for its joyous club anthems. Alley Boy was emphatic that, as a musician, he had no use for strip clubs. Which is why it surprised me when, before he left, he pulled me aside and warmly asked if I had seen any strippers while I was in town. The precise way he phrased that question was unprintable, but it felt like it was his civic duty to ask it: “You really can’t come to Atlanta and not see any.”'"

Officials say they are continuing their discussions over the disputed Himalayan territory, which has led to wars in the past.On Saturday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India — who supports the visa changes — made clear that security remained a big concern. According to the Indian news media, he said there had been increased attempts by militants to infiltrate the de facto border that divides Kashmir.Frictions also continue over the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, for which India has blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba militants based in Pakistan. India wants swift prosecution of suspects arrested in connection with the attacks. A trial of seven Lashkar-e-Taiba suspects is under way in Pakistan, but critics say its progress has been stalled by frequent adjournments.For its part, Pakistan wants India to move quickly on disputed territories beyond Kashmir, including the Siachen Glacier. Pakistan also is pressing for India to remove nontariff barriers to trade.Despite continued tensions, Pakistani politicians and Indian officials said that a step-by-step approach to repair ties was essential.“We will not be held hostage to history,” Ms. Khar said.Pakistan has sent a strong message to India by increasing trade ties, she said. Bilateral trade between the two countries was only $300 million in 2004, but increased ninefold to $2.7 billion in 2011, and is expected to grow further.In his remarks, the Indian foreign minister stressed that terrorism was dangerous to both countries.“We agreed that terrorism poses a continuing threat to peace and security,” Mr. Krishna said. “The Pakistani side reiterated its commitment to bring all perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice expeditiously.”He said Mr. Singh would visit Pakistan when “he feels something worthwhile will come out of the visit.” There is speculation that Mr. Singh might go to Pakistan by the end of the year.'"

Lenaya Rotklein, said in an e-mailed statement that the training missions had methods in place to work out the fuel needs of the Afghan forces, but that they would work with the agency to make them better. “We make funding recommendations based on military requirements,” she said. “We are committed to stewardship of our taxpayer dollars and take seriously the responsibility entrusted to us by the Department of Defense.”The American Embassy in Kabul and coalition officials declined to comment.The inspector general’s agency, known by its acronym, Sigar, was created in 2008 and has had a troubled few years. In 2011, a former inspector general, Arnold Fields, a retired major general, resigned after he was criticized by some members of Congress who said that he had not been aggressive enough in tracking how American money had been spent in Afghanistan. Now, Mr. Sopko has told his staff he wants to bring a new aggressiveness to oversight of spending in Afghanistan.Last month in another report, the inspector general criticized lack of progress by the Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund in building American-financed infrastructure projects. A handful of these projects were meant to build popular support for the Afghan government, but the inspector general found that in most cases no significant construction work had yet begun.'"

"'12-09-10,'0','“A Wanted Man” is Lee Child’s 17th Jack Reacher novel and the last to be published before Reacher goes Hollywood with “Jack Reacher,” a big Christmas movie based on book No. 9, “One Shot,” and starring — can’t say it ain’t so, because it is — Tom Cruise. Mr. Cruise seems such a wrong choice to play this jumbo vigilante that this is a good moment to contemplate the essential Reacher: not just what he looks like but also what he really is.Perhaps in sly response to a movie that will feature a lot of action, Mr. Child begins “A Wanted Man” by confining Reacher to very close quarters. The first 125 pages of this new novel are about a car trip. After waiting exactly 93 minutes on the eastbound ramp of a Nebraska highway, he successfully hitches a ride. The car contains two men and a woman, and Reacher knows nothing about them. Being Reacher, he will spend those first 125 pages observing every detail, watching every move, trying to deduce as much as he can.His enormous size counts for nothing during this part of the book. Nor does his appearance, although he has a busted nose and is said to resemble a very un-Cruise-like “gorilla with its face smashed in.” And he has no opportunities to resort to his tactic of choice, extreme violence. So he rides along an endless straight road through Iowa thinking about codes and signs and numbers and letters (“Reacher had no patience with people who claimed that y was a vowel”). He is a math guy at heart, and he isn’t likely to meet anyone equally wonky until this series takes him through Silicon Valley.On the road Reacher gradually figures out that the men, Alan King and Don McQueen, are kidnappers. Their hostage is Karen Delfuenso, a terrified waitress whose car they have hijacked. Reacher arranges to drive the car with Karen in the seat behind him so that they can make eye contact in the rearview mirror. Improbably Karen starts blinking and twisting her head to deliver some kind of secret message. Even more improbably, Reacher cracks her code almost immediately and finds out what she is trying to say.A third of the way into “A Wanted Man,” his only acts of violence have been hypothetical. “It was technically challenging to take out a guy in the front passenger seat while driving at 80 miles an hour,” he muses while at the wheel. Also, the 6-foot-5-inch Reacher has arms so long that he would need to keep his elbow bent: he wants to slug his passenger, not punch out the car’s side window. In any case, it’s time for Mr. Child to get him out of the car and unleash him on the book’s assorted evildoers.Outside the car, meanwhile, “A Wanted Man” has been developing one of the best female characters in the whole Reacher series: Julia Sorenson, an F.B.I. special agent from Omaha who is called in to investigate a potential interstate crime. Once Reacher is sprung from the car, he encounters Sorenson, who ought to be his natural adversary. But she, like all the women who interest Reacher, is as smart and methodical as he is, and he impresses her with his irrefutable, conveniently self-serving logic. He easily convinces her that whatever is unfolding, he and she should be on the same side.'"

Judge Lisa Wood in Savannah held that the Navy complied with federal law in analyzing the impact on the whale and its only known calving grounds. Although North American right whales have been protected from commercial whaling since 1935, their badly depleted population numbering as few as 313, Judge Wood wrote. Environmentalists say the training ground is too close to the waters where females and calves migrate in winter. But the judge noted that the Navy has developed procedures to mitigate harm to the whales, including requiring ships to slow down during calving season and, when practical, to travel near critical habitat only during daylight and when visibility is good.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','Whether this was fact or fancy, a marked affinity for the opulence of the Mughal era became a hallmark of Mr. Kasliwal’s style.“Gem Palace was like the den of Ali Baba, and you could never leave with empty hands,” said the designer and socialite Muriel Brandolini. “Unlike certain famous jewelers who act like it’s a favor for them to open the door, he was a seducer — of men, women and children. He could intuitively understand the personality of a person and capture it in the designs.” His work, said Julie Gilhart, the former fashion director of Barneys New York, was “spectacularly rich in technique and heritage.”An eclecticist, Mr. Kasliwal drew inspiration equally from geomorphic Modernist forms and India’s rich though occasionally fusty jewelry traditions. Knowing that virtually anything he dreamed of could be realized by the skilled craftsmen in his workrooms in Jaipur, he both flouted and enlarged the conventions of his craft, designing pearl torsades that knotted like bolos, earrings with gems mounted on miniature springs so that they quivered, and variations of the opulent kundan sets that barnacle Indian brides.Mr. Kasliwal developed his affinity for nature’s rarest minerals in childhood, when he was given sacks of semiprecious gemstones to play with, and he readily shared his delight with visitors to the Gem Palace in India and his velvet-upholstered showroom on East 74th Street in Manhattan.Beckoned into a private chamber at the Gem Palace in Jaipur, clients were invited to pull up chairs while Mr. Kasliwal, dressed in his customary white linen kurta, sat cross-legged before a cloth-covered table and spilled onto it the contents of small cotton sacks. As casually as though he were cleaning grains of rice, he sifted through his fingers Colombian emeralds, pigeon blood rubies, old-mine diamonds, tourmalines, citrines, labradorite or pearls.In addition to his son Siddharth, Mr. Kasliwal is survived by his mother, Vimla Kasliwal; his wife, Kalpana; another son, Samarth; and his brothers, Sudhir and Sanjay.Mr. Kasliwal reveled in sleuth work, pursuing great stones at international salesrooms and gem fairs as well as in the now-depleted treasuries of princely families.Once, in pursuit of an old gem from the mines of Golconda, he drove through the deeply potholed roads of the impoverished state of Bihar, risking automotive disaster and highway robbery, to reach the palace of an erstwhile nobleman.When at last he arrived and the palm-size gem was produced from a dirty old cloth, it was a dull disappointment. “It looked like a hunk of glass,” Mr. Kasliwal said.Experience and instinct guided him to bring the diamond outdoors, where, by the rays of the setting sun, the subtly faceted old stone revealed itself.“That is why people shouldn’t hide their jewels away in vaults or save them for special occasions,” Mr. Kasliwal said. Having been freed from the grasp of the earth, he explained, “gems only come alive in the light.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','The New York Times has updated its assessment of the Senate races. Indiana, where the Republican nominee, State Treasurer Richard E. Mourdock, is competing against Representative Joe Donnelly, has turned from a safe Republican seat to one that leans Republican. Connecticut has moved from a safe Democratic seat to one that leans Democratic, and Wisconsin, which was a tossup, now leans Republican.Republicans need a net gain of four seats to win control of the Senate, but what was once a good bet that they would do so is now a coin toss.“A year ago, I thought the Republicans were certainly more likely than not to net four seats and win control,” said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. “It increasingly looks like they have to run the table here.”Some of the campaign missteps and unexpected turns are well documented. In Maine, Senator Olympia J. Snowe’s surprise retirement this year almost certainly removed a seat from the Republicans’ column.Representative Todd Akin’s comments about “legitimate rape” may well have robbed Republicans of a Missouri Senate seat they had counted as theirs, and have improved the chances that Senator Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, will win re-election.Broader political forces have conspired to seemingly move some seats out of the Republicans’ reach.With former Representative Heather Wilson, the Republicans in New Mexico got the moderate veteran candidate they wanted. But Ms. Wilson appears to be getting no help from Mitt Romney in the state, where the Hispanic vote can be decisive. This month, the National Republican Senatorial Committee quietly canceled advertising there to shift those resources elsewhere.Taking advantage of that move, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has cautiously followed suit, according to an official familiar with the group’s moves. On Monday, the committee canceled a week’s worth of advertising in New Mexico. It still has about $1.8 million in reserved advertising time this fall in case Ms. Wilson mounts a comeback.In other races, the candidates themselves have become a problem. In Indiana, Mr. Mourdock, a Tea Party favorite, defeated Senator Richard G. Lugar in the Republican primary for a seat that he had held since the mid-1970s. But Mr. Mourdock has struggled, and Mr. Donnelly has gained traction, drawing support from some of Mr. Lugar’s backers. Mr. Donnelly will have to rely on a brew of support from conservative Democrats, independents and disaffected Republicans who would never think of voting for President Obama but who might be turned off by Mr. Mourdock’s anti-compromising attitude, which has not mellowed much during the general election.“Going back 25 and 30 years, there is a history of ticket-splitting in the presidential year with Hoosiers,” said Dan Parker, the chairman of the Indiana Democratic Party.Democrats have their own issues. In Wisconsin, they were hoping a tough Republican primary would beget a Tea Party-aligned conservative who would have trouble winning statewide.Instead, Tommy Thompson, the former Wisconsin governor and health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush, prevailed. His Democratic opponent is Representative Tammy Baldwin of Madison, the state’s liberal bastion, and many predict she will be a tough sell in more conservative parts of the state. Polls have given Mr. Thompson an early lead, and Mr. Romney’s decision to choose Representative Paul D. Ryan of Janesville, Wis., as his running mate has complicated the Democrats’ campaign, though Mr. Obama’s popularity should help Ms. Baldwin.Then there are the candidates whose early promise has faltered, even in states where party registration favors them.In Massachusetts, the Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard University professor and creator of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has raised record amounts of money. Yet in a state that is likely to vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Obama, she cannot pull away from Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, whose personal appeal remains strong among voters.Similarly, in North Dakota, where Mr. Romney will win in a walk, likability is a major factor in Representative Rick Berg’s struggles with his Democratic opponent, Heidi Heitkamp, whose name has not appeared on a ballot since losing the governor’s race 12 years ago.“Republicans would have said North Dakota is done by Labor Day,” said Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “Democrats would have said the same thing in Massachusetts.”Nebraska Democrats pressed Bob Kerrey, a Vietnam War hero, to run for his old Senate seat. He has made little headway.In Connecticut, Ms. McMahon, who lost badly in her 2010 Senate race despite spending millions of dollars of her own fortune, is gaining more traction this time as she seeks the seat being vacated by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. In late August, a Quinnipiac University poll of likely voters put her slightly in the lead over her Democratic opponent, Representative Christopher S. Murphy.Ms. McMahon emphasized her business expertise two years ago. She has sought to soften her image this time around, stressing her role as a mother and grandmother. At the same time, Mr. Murphy is weathering a spate of bad headlines for failing to pay his mortgage and rent in the past.“It’s a big thing for women in this state to see themselves in their candidate,” said Todd Abrajano, a spokesman for Ms. McMahon’s campaign.If nothing else, Ms. McMahon is forcing Democrats to spend precious resources in a state that is part of the expensive New York media market. Representative John B. Larson, a Connecticut Democrat, said he had secured assurances from Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a senior member of the Democratic leadership, that Mr. Murphy would have the money he needed.Money is the great unequalizer. In Ohio, Senator Sherrod Brown seemed far ahead a few months ago, but at least $15 million worth of advertisements paid for by outside groups on behalf of his Republican opponent, Josh Mandel, is tightening up the race. The story is similar for Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat who maintains a lead that money may cut into.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','It will help if some important members of an already-thin secondary are back. Amukamara, drafted in the first round before last season, emerged as a key figure when cornerback Terrell Thomas was forced onto injured reserve with problems with his right knee for the second consecutive year.But then Amukamara hurt his ankle in the preseason game against Chicago, forcing him to miss the final preseason game and the opener.After being sidelined for the first nine games last year with a broken foot, Amukamara is understandably eager to reassert himself.“There is always a sense of urgency in my head trying to get back on the field,” he said. “Of course, with our cornerback situation and guys going down, I’m trying to get on the field that much more. It does put more pressure on me to get back on the field. If there’s a magic pill, I’ll take it.”Amukamara acknowledged that he was still unable to run at top speed and that he was not able to plant his feet as he usually would.“I felt some pain, but not enough to where I told the trainers, ‘I’m done,’ ” he said.The lack of depth at cornerback became readily apparent against Dallas when Michael Coe, making the first start of his six-year N.F.L. career as Amukamara’s replacement, was forced to leave in the third quarter with a strained left hamstring. The five-year veteran Justin Tryon, signed last October after being released by the Indianapolis Colts, was beaten by Miles Austin for a 34-yard touchdown pass from Tony Romo that gave Dallas a 24-10 lead in the fourth quarter.Coe, in another hopeful sign for the Giants, said that he ran at three-quarters speed Monday and was able to make turns without having any discomfort. He expects to practice on Wednesday.Amukamara said that he was not being entirely selfless in returning to a depleted secondary faster than many expected from an injury that can sideline players for many weeks.“For sure, I’d still be pushing myself,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s still my job that is at stake. I was taught to have that mind-set. They are always trying to bring in somebody to replace you, so you always have to stay on top of your game.”Safety Kenny Phillips (back) sat out practice as a precaution Monday but is expected to return Wednesday. ... Although left tackle Will Beatty (back) is showing he can handle an increasing workload, it is unclear whether he will rejoin the starting lineup against Tampa Bay. “He’s got to make up for a lot of lost time,” Tom Coughlin said. ... Defensive tackle Marvin Austin, a second-round draft choice last year who missed all of his rookie season with a torn pectoral muscle and has dealt with nagging back problems this summer, said he believed he might finally be ready for his regular-season N.F.L. debut.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','WASHINGTON — Out on the campaign trail, President Obama talks about Medicare (Republicans would gut it), tax cuts (Mitt Romney wants to give them to rich people like himself) and Osama bin Laden (Did you know? He’s dead.).He even talks about the unemployment rate (it is still too high, but job growth has increased 30 straight months after the economic mess that greeted him when he took office). And he talks about Congress (lawmakers should get moving and pass his jobs bill).But what the president never talks about is getting more of his party members elected to the House and the Senate. And, for that matter, neither does Mr. Romney.It is the survival of the fittest on the presidential campaign trail these days. With a close election expected and a dog-eat-dog fight for swing states, who has time to spend stumping for other politicians? Certainly not the president or Mr. Romney, despite the stakes in this year’s Congressional elections.Instead, each is focused on his own fate. Unlike the 2010 midterm elections, when Mr. Obama campaigned heavily for Democrats all over the country, this year he is focusing almost exclusively on the eight swing states where his own political fortune is believed to be up in the air: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','On Friday, in response to concern over the scope of the ethics investigation, Mr. Cuomo threatened to install a special panel to investigate the scandal, and a member of the ethics commission, Ravi Batra, complained about political interference in the commission’s work and resigned.On Monday, Mr. Batra sent an eight-page letter to the governor — whom he likened to “the ‘prince’ in Mark Twain’s ‘Prince and the Pauper’ ” — in which he said the commission’s functioning seemed “to lack basic integrity.”He compared his experience on the panel to “watching a glorious diamond being crushed by a sledgehammer.”At a special meeting on Monday, commission members spent more than an hour in public session lamenting how the panel had been criticized in the news media and debating whether its deliberations should be open to the public — a proposal that one commissioner, Marvin E. Jacob, presented as a means to “restore the public’s confidence.”“I make this motion only because I think this whole experiment is going to fall apart,” Mr. Jacob said. “We’ve already, as I said, lost one commissioner, and others have indicated a desire that they don’t need the aggravation.”The commission rejected Mr. Jacob’s motion but agreed that it would disclose, after going into executive session, what, if anything, it had voted on.After the panel went behind closed doors for about 90 minutes, its chairwoman, Janet DiFiore, a Democrat who is the Westchester County district attorney, announced that the commissioners had voted unanimously to start a full-scale investigation, but she would not disclose its subject or scope.Mr. Silver, however, told reporters in New York City that he was pleased with the panel’s action.“We believe a full investigation will show that we acted in good faith, pursuant to law, in what we believed was the best interests of the women,” the speaker said.In a radio interview on Monday before the ethics commission met, Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, repeated his threat to impanel his own investigatory panel, describing it as a “Plan B” if the ethics panel “did not work.”But Mr. Cuomo also offered a defense of the ethics commission, asking people to “take a deep breath” before criticizing it.“It’s been a good-faith effort, I believe, by all parties involved,” he said on WGDJ-AM. “Obviously it’s going to be a learning process, and to the extent we need to make some tweaks, we’ll make some tweaks.”Two commissioners appointed by Mr. Silver objected to the governor’s warning that he might investigate on his own. Mr. Jacob said it was “coercive and threatening,” and another commissioner, Ellen Yaroshefsky, said she was “very offended.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','The moments of silence. The musical interludes. The honor guards of policemen and firefighters, colleagues of those who died rescuing others on Sept. 11, 2001. And the reading of names, whether to honor the three victims from Nutley, N.J., or the nearly 3,000 others from around the world who died in the attacks.Across the country, the elements of a Sept. 11 anniversary commemoration have become familiar, from the World Trade Center site in Manhattan to the Pennsylvania field where United Flight 93 crashed to the dozens of New Jersey towns with neighbors to mourn. After the commemorations reached a peak of sorts for last year’s 10th anniversary, a sprinkling of communities have decided to scale back — prompted, they say, by a growing feeling that it may be time to move on.Nearly every ceremony will be smaller this year, even at the epicenter of the attacks. In a move that has drawn some controversy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has stripped the New York ceremony of its presidents, governors and other politicians, who have in the past read literary or religious passages. Instead of Yo-Yo Ma, James Taylor and Paul Simon, bagpipers and a youth chorus will provide the music.The National Cathedral in Washington hosted President George W. Bush, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama for prayer services in the two years after the attacks and in 2011 held a three-day commemoration featuring President Obama. This year, it will simply offer prayers during regularly scheduled services on Tuesday.“The cathedral’s mission is to serve a spiritual role for the nation, and part of that role is to help the country heal and move past the tragedy,” said Richard M. Weinberg, a cathedral spokesman, echoing a statement from the Rev. Dr. Francis Wade, the cathedral’s interim dean. “I think it’s fair to say that 11 years later, we all felt that it was important still to commemorate it, but to do so in perhaps a less overt, a less somber way — to do so maturely and look forward.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','Foxconn, in a statement, said that students made up just 2.7 percent of its 1.2 million-person work force in China — about 32,000 workers — and that schools “recruit the students under the supervision of the local government, and the schools also assign teachers to accompany and monitor the students throughout their internship.”A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the recent cases, but he said Apple’s code of conduct tells suppliers to follow local labor laws when dealing with interns and other workers.Foxconn has come under intense scrutiny in recent months over working conditions inside factories that manufacture smartphones, tablet computers and other electronic devices for Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other technology giants. Investigations by newspapers, outside groups and companies like Apple itself have revealed illegal amounts of overtime, crowded working conditions, under-age workers, improper disposal of hazardous waste and, in some cases, industrial accidents that have killed four people and injured more than 100 at Foxconn and other Chinese factories that supply Apple.Earlier this year, following highly publicized reports of such problems, Apple asked an outside organization to audit working conditions inside the plants where the bulk of iPhones, iPads and other Apple products are built. In the wake of that audit, Foxconn announced it would significantly raise wages for many of its employees and reduce overtime hours to come into compliance with Chinese law.In August, the Fair Labor Association — the group hired by Apple to audit Foxconn — said Foxconn had made progress at cutting employees’ hours and improving working conditions, but that those shifts would require Foxconn to recruit “tens of thousands of extra workers.” The group also said that Foxconn and Apple had adopted policies to make sure that student interns knew they could resign from Foxconn and still graduate, and to link the jobs they performed inside Foxconn with their studies.“I am concerned about these recent reports, and we’re following up,” said Auret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, in an interview. “If there have been any breakdowns in policies, we expect changes to be made.”Worker advocates say Foxconn is under intense pressure at critical moments — like leading up to the release of a new product, like the iPhone 5 — to fill huge orders quickly.“When students enroll in vocational schools, they should receive a genuine education,” said Debby Chan Sze Wan with Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehavior, the other group that spoke to interns. “Standing in a factory, doing the same motion for 10 hours a day, this is not an education. And they are told they cannot leave, that they must work or they will be dismissed from school.”Articles in the Chinese press reported that some schools in Huai’an were closed so that students could work in Foxconn plants, and that students said they were forced to work 12 hours a day. Some of the students are said to have come from the law and English departments.Foxconn has strongly defended its labor practices, complaining that the company is unfairly scrutinized because it is the biggest manufacturer for Apple, the world’s best-known consumer electronics company. Analysts say labor abuses — including improper use of student labor — also occur at factories producing goods for Samsung, Nokia and other brands.Last week, Samsung promised to improve management and conditions at some Chinese suppliers after a labor rights groups issued a report that said the suppliers were using underage workers.No company, however, has received more attention than Foxconn. A few years ago, a rash of suicides were reported at its factories. While the suicides were a tiny fraction of its employees, labor experts began questioning what they called a militarylike atmosphere within the company.Apple responded soon after by sending a team to China, including a delegation led by Tim Cook, now the company’s chief executive, to look into labor conditions.Within a year, explosions at several Apple supplier factories in China highlighted the need to improve worker safety. More recently, recurring reports about how local governments and Chinese vocational schools coordinate with the company to fill worker vacancies have alarmed some labor groups.After the recent allegations, local officials in Huai’an issued a statement ordering higher education institutions to strictly follow policies and correct any “violations.” The Huai’an government also said many vocational students had ended their work at Foxconn and returned to school.“The university told us it’s a good way to experience corporate culture,”a 19-year-old student told China Daily newspaper. “Even though many of my classmates are reluctant to go to Foxconn, our teachers still asked us to work there starting in August.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','Instead of “planning to be flooded,” as he put it, city, state and federal agencies should be investing in protection like sea gates that could close during a storm and block a surge from Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean into the East River and New York Harbor.Others express concern for areas like the South Bronx and Sunset Park in , which have large industrial waterfronts with chemical-manufacturing plants, oil-storage sites and garbage-transfer stations. Unless hazardous materials are safeguarded with storm surges in mind, some local groups warn, residents could one day be wading through toxic water.“A lot of attention is devoted to Lower , but you forget that you have real industries on the waterfront” elsewhere in the city, said Eddie Bautista, executive director of the New York City Environmental Justice Alliance, which represents low-income residents of industrial areas. “We’re behind in consciousness-building and disaster planning.”Other cities are also tackling these issues, at their own pace.New shoreline development around San Francisco Bay must now be designed to cope with the anticipated higher sea levels under new regional regulations imposed last fall. In , new lanes and parking spaces are made of permeable pavement that allows rainwater to filter through it. , N.C., and Cedar Falls, , are restricting development in flood plains. is pressing shoreline property owners to plant marshland instead of building retaining walls.Officials in New York caution that adapting a city of eight million people to climate change is infinitely more complicated and that the costs must be weighed against the relative risks of flooding. The last time a hurricane made landfall directly in New York City was more than a century ago.Many decisions also require federal assistance, like updated flood maps from the that incorporate sea level rise, and agreement from dozens of public agencies and private partners that own transportation, energy, telecommunications and other infrastructure.“It’s a million small changes that need to happen,” said Adam Freed, until August the deputy director of the city’s Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability. “Everything you do has to be a calculation of the risks and benefits and costs you face.”And in any case, Mr. Freed said, “you can’t make a climate-proof city.”So city officials are pursuing a so-called resilience strategy that calls for strengthening the city’s ability to weather the effects of serious flooding and recover from it.Unlike , New York City is above sea level. Yet the city is second only to New Orleans in the number of people living less than four feet above high tide — nearly 200,000 New Yorkers, according to the research group Climate Central.The waters on the city’s doorstep have been rising roughly an inch a decade over the last century as oceans have warmed and expanded. But according to scientists advising the city, that rate is accelerating, because of environmental factors, and levels could rise two feet higher than today’s by midcentury. More frequent flooding is expected to become an uncomfortable reality.With higher seas, a common storm could prove as damaging as the rare big storm or hurricane is today, scientists say. Were sea levels to rise four feet by the 2080s, for example, 34 percent of the city’s streets could lie in the flood-risk zone, compared with just 11 percent now, a 2011 study commissioned by the state said.New York has added bike lanes, required large buildings to track and reduce their energy use, banned the dirtiest home heating oils, and taken other steps to reduce the emissions that contribute to global warming. But with shoreline development that ranges from public to towering high rises — and a complex mix of rivers, estuaries, bays and ocean — the city needs to size up the various risks posed by rising seas before plunging ahead with vast capital projects or strict regulations, city officials argue.Yet the city’s plan for waterfront development dismisses any notion of retreat from the shoreline. Curbing development or buying up property in flood plains, as some smaller cities have done, is too impractical here, city officials say, especially because the city anticipates another million residents over the next two decades.Rather, the city and its partners are incorporating flood-protection measures into projects as they go along., the utility that supplies electricity to most of the city, estimates that adaptations like installing submersible switches and moving high-voltage transformers above ground level would cost at least $250 million. Lacking the means, it is making gradual adjustments, with about $24 million spent in flood zones since 2007.Some steps taken by city agencies have already subtly altered the city’s looks. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, a buffer between the East River and neighborhoods like Dumbo, porous riprap rock and a soft edge of salt-resistant grass have been laid in to help absorb the punch of a storm surge. Sidewalk bioswales, or vegetative tree pits that can fill up with rainwater to reduce storm water and sewage overflows and also minimize flooding, are popping up around the city.Over all, the city is hoping to funnel more than $2 billion of public and private money to such environmental projects over the next 18 years, officials say.“It’s a series of small interventions that cumulatively, over time, will take us to a more natural system” to deal with climate change, said Carter H. Strickland, the city’s environmental commissioner.Planning experts say it is hard to muster public support for projects with uncertain or distant benefits.“There’s a lot of concern about angering developers,” said Ben Chou, a water-policy analyst at the .New York planners have proposed requiring developers to assess the climate-change risks faced by new buildings so they can consider protection like retractable watertight gates for windows. But no such requirements have been imposed so far.While some new buildings are being elevated or going above current required flood protections — like a new recycling plant on a Brooklyn pier and the Port Authority’s transit hub at the World Trade Center site — most new construction is not being adapted to future flood risks yet, industry representatives said.Some experts argue that the encounter with Hurricane Irene last year and a flash flood in 2007 underscored the dangers of deferring aggressive solutions.Klaus H. Jacob, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, said the storm surge from Irene came, on average, just one foot short of paralyzing transportation into and out of Manhattan.If the surge had been just that much higher, subway tunnels would have flooded, segments of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and roads along the Hudson River would have turned into rivers, and sections of the commuter rail system would have been impassable or bereft of power, he said.The most vulnerable systems, like the subway tunnels under the and East Rivers, would have been unusable for nearly a month, or longer, at an economic loss of about $55 billion, said Dr. Jacob, an adviser to the city on climate change and an author of the 2011 state study that laid out the flooding prospects.“We’ve been extremely lucky,” he said. “I’m disappointed that the political process hasn’t recognized that we’re playing Russian roulette.”With more rain and higher seas, some envision more turmoil — like mile after mile of apartment buildings without working elevators, lights or potable water.“That’s a key vulnerability,” said Rafael Pelli, a Manhattan architect who serves on a climate-change committee that advises the Department of City Planning. “If you have to relocate 10,000 people, how do you do that?”Some New Yorkers argue that the answer lies not in evacuation, but in prevention, like armoring city waterways with the latest high-tech barriers. Others are not so sure.At a recent meeting of Manhattan community board leaders in Harlem, Robert Trentlyon, a resident of Chelsea, argued for sea gates.A 2004 study by Mr. Hill and the Storm Surge Research Group at Stony Brook recommended installing movable barriers at the upper end of the East River, near the Throgs Neck Bridge; under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge; and at the mouth of the Arthur Kill, between and . During and northeasters, closing the barriers would block a huge tide from flooding Manhattan and parts of the , Brooklyn, , Staten Island and New Jersey, they said.City officials say that sea barriers are among the options being studied, but others say such gates could interfere with aquatic ecosystems and with the flushing out of pollutants, and may eventually fail as sea levels keep rising.And then there is the cost. Installing barriers for New York could reach nearly $10 billion.There is more agreement on how to protect the subway system. Several studies have advised the to move quickly to increase pumping capacity at stations, raise entrances and design floodgates to block water from entering.In 2009, a commission warned that global warming posed “a new and potentially dire challenge for which the M.T.A. system is largely unprepared.”Five years ago, a summer-morning deluge brought about 3 1/2 inches of rain in two hours and paralyzed the system for hours, stranding 2.5 million riders.That prompted the transit agency to spend $34 million on improvements like raising some ventilation grates nine inches above sidewalks and building steps that head upward, before descending, at flood-prone stations. All the money came from the agency’s capital budget, which also pays for subway cars and buses.“This is a vicious circle of the worst kind,” Projjal Dutta, the transportation agency’s director of sustainability, said of the financial effect. “You’re cutting public transportation, which cuts down greenhouse gases, to harden against climate change.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','The Colorado Supreme Court on Monday refused to reinstate Ward L. Churchill as a University of Colorado professor despite his longstanding contention that he was dismissed because of his controversial political views.Upholding two lower court decisions on Mr. Churchill’s case, the court affirmed that the university’s Board of Regents had essentially acted as judges in firing him for academic misconduct in 2007 and was therefore legally immune to his attempts to win his job back.Mr. Churchill, 64, an ethnic studies professor, created a national uproar when he described some victims of the Sept. 11 attacks as “little Eichmanns” in an essay that first appeared in 2001, referring to Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi who helped carry out the Holocaust. But the essay did not draw attention until 2005. Shortly thereafter, several scholars came forward accusing Mr. Churchill of committing plagiarism in his research on American Indians, which eventually led to his dismissal.He has been trying to get his job back ever since, maintaining that his political views were the real reason he was fired and accusing the university of violating his free speech rights.“The Colorado State Supreme Court spends 55 pages saying the regents are above the law,” said David A. Lane, Mr. Churchill’s lawyer. “Regents at universities all over the country should feel emboldened to feel free to violate the First Amendment any time they want, as long as there is some sham due process that is given before they do it.”Mr. Lane said he planned to appeal to the United States Supreme Court.The ruling, which came just one day before the 11th anniversary of the attacks, is the culmination of years of bitter legal battles between Mr. Churchill and the university. In 2009, a Denver jury agreed with Mr. Churchill’s assertion that he was wrongfully fired but awarded him only $1 in damages. And the district judge in the case, Larry J. Naves, refused to return him to the classroom, ruling that the regents’ actions were quasi-judicial and legally protected. The Colorado Court of Appeals agreed.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','ATHENS — Greek officials had another day of tough negotiations Monday with representatives of its so-called troika of European lenders, trying to agree to an €11 billion package of budget cutting measures that would enable Greece to receive its next allotment of bailout money.The negotiations were “tough,” the Greek finance minister, Yannis Stournaras, said afterward.Greece’s government is trying to find a big part of the savings through cuts to state administrative costs, rather than making even deeper reductions in civil service salaries and pensions. But foreign auditors are not yet convinced the proposed measures are enforceable.Besides persuading the troika — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary fund — of the soundness of its proposal, the Greek prime minister, Antonis Samaras, is also trying to reach agreement with the partners in his shaky coalition government.Over the weekend those partners — the Socialist leader, Evangelos Venizelos, and the moderate Democratic Left chief, Fotis Kouvelis — made it clear that they still objected to some of the measures outlined by the prime minister and finance minister. Mr. Venizelos repeated his party’s objection to cuts to low-level pensions and social benefits like disability allowances, noting that “there are limits to tolerance.”But he suggested that the objections would not cause a rift in the government. “The main goal,” he said, is “for the country to move on to the next stage.”He repeated Greece’s demand for a two-year extension to the country’s budget and spending overhaul.Mr. Kouvelis, too, insisted that some of the more onerous austerity measures be substituted with softer alternatives. “Europeans must understand that the Greek people cannot take anymore,” he said. “The troika must realize that their measures and demands are aimed at a society that is broken.”'"
"'12-09-11,'1','Mr. DeHart said in an interview that BlueToad was voluntarily disclosing the theft. “We decided to come forward to apologize to our customers, partners and the public in general that this got out there,” he said. “We face thousands of attacks every day that we’ve been successful at defending. This one happened to get through.”A security researcher first tipped the company off last week to the fact that hackers might have posted its data, Mr. DeHart said. David Schuetz, a researcher at the Intrepidus Group, a New York-based mobile security firm, mined the data in the hackers’ file for clues to its origin. He noted that several of the identification numbers were linked to device names that referenced Blue-Toad.After Mr. Schuetz contacted BlueToad, the company verified the data breach and alerted law enforcement and Apple.Apple’s unique device identifiers — known as U.D.I.D.’s — are 40-character strings that are tied to a particular device. The company began discouraging app makers from using U.D.I.D.’s last year because developers and advertisers were taking advantage of them to track users as they moved from app to app, compiling a profile of user behavior that could be sold or used for ad targeting.Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, said Apple recently introduced a system to replace the use of the U.D.I.D. and would soon be banning apps that tried to exploit them.“As an app developer BlueToad would have access to a user’s device information, such as U.D.I.D. device name and type,” she said. Ms. Muller noted that developers would not have access to more confidential information like passwords or credit card information, “unless a user specifically elects to provide that information to a developer.”Mr. DeHart said BlueToad collected U.D.I.D. information to keep count of how many people used its services, but stopped collecting it after Apple discouraged its use last year. He said the stolen file contained identifiers collected by older BlueToad mobile apps, and that BlueToad had “nowhere near” the 12 million identification numbers that hackers claimed to have stolen.Security researchers debate how much harm can be done using someone’s U.D.I.D. Most say the release of identifiers and device names poses little risk. They said that without more information about device owners — like their e-mail addresses or date of birth — it would be hard for someone to use the data to do harm.But some researchers disagree with that assessment. Aldo Cortesi, a New Zealand security researcher, has called U.D.I.D.’s a “privacy catastrophe.” Last year, he demonstrated how, in some cases, U.D.I.D.’s could be used to find a person’s identity, determine their location and even hijack their Facebook profile.Mr. DeHart said in an interview his company thought the data release posed little danger. “We’re aware of the differing opinions out there,” he said. “We have never associated these numbers with other account information and never used them for authentication purposes. We think the overall risk is very low.”Mr. DeHart said law enforcement officials were still investigating the attack, but suspected that the hackers responsible were different from the hackers who claimed credit for the attack online. “The way we understand it, somebody got into our systems, took the information and, to prove themselves, handed it to this other group who exploited it for their own purposes,” he said.Peter Donald, an F.B.I. spokesman, declined to comment on BlueToad’s announcement.AntiSec, the hacking group that said it had taken the file from the F.B.I., is a subset of the loose hacking collective known as Anonymous. The group has frequently gone after the F.B.I. But the frequency of such attacks tapered off in March after several members of Anonymous, and a spinoff group, were arrested.Messages sent Monday to the Twitter accounts of hackers who had claimed credit for the attack went unanswered.'"
"'12-09-11,'1','As a result of the dispute, Lt. Gen. Keith M. Huber, the American commanding general of the prison, did not attend the transfer ceremony, which featured at least seven generals, two cabinet ministers and other dignitaries from the Afghan side. No one from the American Embassy or the State Department was present.There were reports that General Huber was going to send his deputy, Brig. Gen. VeraLinn Jamieson, but she, too, was a no-show. The only Americans on the dais were the Parwan task force commander, Col. Robert M. Taradash, and his bodyguard.“Today, I affirm that we have fulfilled the agreement,” Colonel Taradash said in a brief speech that drew polite applause. “We transferred more than 3,000 Afghan detainees into your custody” and made sure that those who were still a threat “would not return to the battlefield.”American officials have been concerned that the Afghans would release detainees too readily, turning the prison into a revolving door and speeding captured insurgents back to the battlefield. A joint review board has sorted through their cases, recommending some for prosecution and others for release — reportedly, more than half of those reviewed. During the ceremony on Monday, 15 detainees were freed, without objection from the American side.American officials say the transfer agreement calls for the Afghan government to continue to hold some detainees even if there is not a formal legal case against them, reviewing their cases administratively rather than judicially. The Americans say it is impossible to build legal cases against all prisoners arrested in battlefield conditions.Afghan news media reported that a dispute over the practice led to a falling-out between Mr. Karzai and Gen. John R. Allen, the American military commander in Afghanistan, over the weekend and apparently prompted the downgraded American presence at the event on Monday.“From now, no foreigners will have any prison in any place in Afghanistan,” said Gen. Mohammad Zahir Azimi, the spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry.Despite such vows, and whatever the amount of real control that the Afghans may have inside Parwan, the Americans are not going away soon. In addition to processing a steady stream of prisoners caught in night raids, the United States will continue holding 50 non-Afghan prisoners — mostly Pakistanis, but also some Arabs and Chechens — at the base, something the Afghans have not contested.American military guards also remain a very real presence around the perimeter of the prison, even at gates to the Afghan section — despite the assertion of Col. Jalaludin Dehaty, the spokesman for the Bagram prison commander, who said, “You can enter now without ever seeing an American.”At one of the Afghan gates, however, an American guard on duty, Staff Sgt. Michael Tantillo, said, “All of the gates remain dual service,” meaning that they will have both Afghan and American guards.Inside the prison, Americans are still present in the completely Afghan-run section as well, Afghan and American officials said, though they say those Americans serve only as advisers.The ceremony itself was dominated by sweeping oratory, echoing the emotion and urgency that Mr. Karzai has invested in the prison issue.“This is an extremely important and historical day,” the acting defense minister, Enayatullah Nazari, said at the ceremony.In a statement, Mr. Karzai said, “I consider the transfer of Bagram prison to the Afghan government a victory for the people of Afghanistan and a big step toward consolidation of the government’s sovereignty.”Even that wording, however, showed another point of difference: the Americans built a new detention complex near the old Bagram Prison in 2009, and they refer to it as Parwan — after the province it is in, and apparently in an attempt to break the associations brought by accusations of waterboarding and deadly beatings at the old prison. Afghan officials still refer to the place as Bagram.On the sidelines, Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi, the Afghan chief of staff, acknowledged that misunderstandings had arisen. “The interpretation of the memorandum of understanding is confusing; everyone is translating from their own version,” General Karimi said. “These are small issues in the relationship of the international community and the government that will be solved, no problem.”'"

"'12-09-12,'1','Whether this was fact or fancy, a marked affinity for the opulence of the Mughal era became a hallmark of Mr. Kasliwal’s style.“Gem Palace was like the den of Ali Baba, and you could never leave with empty hands,” said the designer and socialite Muriel Brandolini. “Unlike certain famous jewelers who act like it’s a favor for them to open the door, he was a seducer — of men, women and children. He could intuitively understand the personality of a person and capture it in the designs.” His work, said Julie Gilhart, the former fashion director of Barneys New York, was “spectacularly rich in technique and heritage.”An eclecticist, Mr. Kasliwal drew inspiration equally from geomorphic Modernist forms and India’s rich though occasionally fusty jewelry traditions. Knowing that virtually anything he dreamed of could be realized by the skilled craftsmen in his workrooms in Jaipur, he both flouted and enlarged the conventions of his craft, designing pearl torsades that knotted like bolos, earrings with gems mounted on miniature springs so that they quivered, and variations of the opulent kundan sets that barnacle Indian brides.Mr. Kasliwal developed his affinity for nature’s rarest minerals in childhood, when he was given sacks of semiprecious gemstones to play with, and he readily shared his delight with visitors to the Gem Palace in India and his velvet-upholstered showroom on East 74th Street in Manhattan.Beckoned into a private chamber at the Gem Palace in Jaipur, clients were invited to pull up chairs while Mr. Kasliwal, dressed in his customary white linen kurta, sat cross-legged before a cloth-covered table and spilled onto it the contents of small cotton sacks. As casually as though he were cleaning grains of rice, he sifted through his fingers Colombian emeralds, pigeon blood rubies, old-mine diamonds, tourmalines, citrines, labradorite or pearls.In addition to his son Siddharth, Mr. Kasliwal is survived by his mother, Vimla Kasliwal; his wife, Kalpana; another son, Samarth; and his brothers, Sudhir and Sanjay.Mr. Kasliwal reveled in sleuth work, pursuing great stones at international salesrooms and gem fairs as well as in the now-depleted treasuries of princely families.Once, in pursuit of an old gem from the mines of Golconda, he drove through the deeply potholed roads of the impoverished state of Bihar, risking automotive disaster and highway robbery, to reach the palace of an erstwhile nobleman.When at last he arrived and the palm-size gem was produced from a dirty old cloth, it was a dull disappointment. “It looked like a hunk of glass,” Mr. Kasliwal said.Experience and instinct guided him to bring the diamond outdoors, where, by the rays of the setting sun, the subtly faceted old stone revealed itself.“That is why people shouldn’t hide their jewels away in vaults or save them for special occasions,” Mr. Kasliwal said. Having been freed from the grasp of the earth, he explained, “gems only come alive in the light.”'"
"'12-09-12,'1','In two instances, Mitchell redacted portions of checks he included in the report to show that the former major league catcher Paul Lo Duca had secured drugs. The redacted information showed that the drugs were paid for from a joint account controlled by Sam Levinson and Lo Duca, according to a person with direct knowledge of the Mitchell team’s work.In a written statement, a spokesman for Mitchell said he had no comment on the matter.“Since our report was published, we have received many requests for comment on specific persons or allegations contained in, or omitted from, the report,” said the spokesman, John J. Clarke Jr., of the firm DLA Piper, where Mitchell, a former United States senator, served as chairman. “Some of these requests were based on subsequent developments or the revelation of new allegations concerning the use of performance-enhancing substances by players in Major League Baseball.“When the report was published, we adopted a policy, which we have maintained, not to comment on such matters,” Clarke added. “In accordance with that policy, Senator Mitchell has no comment.”The questions about the Levinsons arose after it was revealed that a person associated with their agency had hatched a bizarre cover-up scheme to get one of their most prominent clients, the slugger Melky Cabrera, out from under a suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs this year.The scheme was uncovered by investigators for Major League Baseball, and Cabrera, an outfielder for the San Francisco Giants and the National League batting average leader, is now serving a 50-game suspension.The Levinsons and their lawyers have denied any role in providing players with drugs and said that the checks were signed by Lo Duca without their knowledge.For several weeks, M.L.B. investigators have been gathering information on the Levinsons, according to a person with knowledge of the probe. The commissioner’s office, the person said, is trying to build a case that the players union should sanction the Levinsons. The union is conducting its own investigation.For many years, baseball officials have been suspicious about whether agents might have facilitated the use of performance-enhancing drugs by their clients. The scheme to fabricate a cover story for Cabrera has stoked that suspicion.Most recently, Lo Duca, who was named by Mitchell for his links to drugs, has told investigators for baseball that the Levinsons provided him with the illegal substances, according to a person with knowledge of baseball’s investigation.Mitchell, in his report, included copies of cashed checks to help establish that players had purchased drugs. In doing so, he redacted information on many of the checks, often because they included the home addresses of players.Mitchell, for reasons he now will not explain, also redacted the information on checks written by Lo Duca to purchase drugs. Those checks belonged to an account Lo Duca jointly had with “Samuel W. Levinson/ACES” and also included the address of the Levinsons’ office in Brooklyn.ACES is the name of the Brooklyn based agency that the Levinsons — who represent some of the game’s most well-known players, including David Wright of the Mets — have owned and operated for nearly three decades.The true identity of the account holders for the checks included in the Mitchell report was first disclosed by USA Today.A lawyer for the Levinsons, Jay K. Reisinger, said that Lo Duca invented the story about the Levinsons’ providing him with drugs “as some measure of revenge” for the Levinsons’ continuing to seek money they say Lo Duca owes them.Lo Duca, through a third party, said he would “go to the media and state that ACES supplied him with steroids” if the agents continued to seek money from him, Reisinger said.Lo Duca threatened to “write a book” about his steroid use and “who supplied him with steroids during his career,” the lawyer said.“Senator Mitchell said that all of the credible evidence was contained in his report and we weren’t named,” the Levinsons said in a statement.The convicted steroids dealer and the former baseball trainer whose testimony anchored the Mitchell report were compelled by federal prosecutors to cooperate with Mitchell in exchange for not being charged with steroid distribution. Virtually everything the dealer and the trainer told the prosecutors about drug use in baseball was included in the report, but it did not include information about the Levinsons.As far back as June 2007, the trainer, Brian McNamee, told the prosecutors that the Levinsons were obtaining drugs from the dealer, Kirk Radomski, and providing them to their client, the reliever Mike Stanton, according to a person briefed on the federal investigation. McNamee said that Radomski was good friends with Seth Levinson.McNamee said that he had discussed with Stanton the advantages and disadvantages of using human growth hormone, the person briefed on the investigation said. McNamee later told prosecutors that Radomski had asked him in 2002 to talk to Stanton about using human growth hormone, and that Radomski had told him that he was already providing H.G.H. to Stanton through Seth Levinson.In 2010, McNamee again met with prosecutors. He was set to be the star witness in the federal government’s perjury case against Roger Clemens. McNamee told the prosecutors that Stanton had told him that his agent had provided him with the substances, according to the person briefed on the federal case. Stanton has admitted he has used performance-enhancing drugs, but he has said that the Levinsons did not provide them to him.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','Gendarmes questioned the former prime minister Dominique de Villepin on Tuesday on suspicion of involvement in fraud that investigators believe was committed by a friend, the businessman Régis Bulot. It was unclear whether charges might be brought against Mr. de Villepin, who was released after several hours of questioning, a police spokesman said. Investigators believe that Mr. Bulot, the former president of Relais et Châteaux, a luxury hotel and restaurant network, embezzled more than $2 billion from the company. In a recorded telephone conversation from 2010, Mr. de Villepin, who was no longer in government, appears to tell Mr. Bulot that he pressured managers at the company to keep the fraud a secret, according to French news media reports. Mr. Bulot’s lawyer told the newsmagazine Le Nouvel Observateur that his client had embezzled about $640,000, but that Mr. de Villepin had been unaware of it.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','Mr. Romney, though, stayed true to his chinos and the Vietnam War, even joining a counterprotest against the occupation of the office of the university president, Wallace Sterling. Forty-six years later, some classmates remember his pro-war stand as principled and heartfelt; others say he merely championed the worldview of his father, George Romney, then Michigan’s governor, a war supporter and a future contender for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. Still others say he sailed through the most schismatic moral and political issue of that time — and perhaps of any period since in the United States — with neither much angst nor introspection.On his own for the first time, Mr. Romney finished his freshman year as he began it: conventionally patriotic and faithful to the traditional values of the time. “He was loyal to his family beliefs, his church beliefs and his country’s beliefs without trying, really, to understand what qualifications they had,” said Karl Drake, another Rinconada freshman and an antiwar activist who sometimes clashed with Mr. Romney.It is unclear whether Mr. Romney’s hawkish Vietnam stance in 1966, when he was 18 years old and first exposed to the larger world, presaged his hawkish foreign policy stance as a presidential candidate in 2012, in which he has promised more confrontational approaches toward China, Iran and Russia than those adopted by President Obama. But just as Mr. Romney’s views on some other issues evolved over the years, his public assessments of the Vietnam War shifted markedly.His pro-war sympathies at Stanford changed four years later, when he recanted and called the war a mistake. After saying in an interview during his failed bid to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts in 1994 that he had no interest in military service as a youth, Mr. Romney said in 2007 during his first run for the Republican presidential nomination that he had sometimes longed to join the troops in Vietnam.At Stanford, Mr. Romney was exempt from the draft, holding the 2-S student deferment then given to most undergraduates. He kept it but one year; like his older brother, Scott, Mr. Romney left Stanford early to serve for 30 months as a missionary abroad, as is customary for devout Mormon men.During that period in France, from 1966 to 1968, he held another draft exemption as a missionary — a controversial one, as critics complained that it disproportionately excluded Mormon men from service.The Selective Service eventually limited church districts to one religious deferment every six months, sharply reducing draft exemptions in Utah. But in Michigan, where Mr. Romney grew up, the small Mormon population made it unlikely that others competed for the mission that Mr. Romney accepted, said Barry Mayo, a counselor at the time to the district bishop. (After returning from France, Mr. Romney transferred to Brigham Young University and again secured a student deferment.)When Vietnam and the draft did come up at Stanford, several former dorm mates said, Mr. Romney did not evade the issue. But his pro-war views seemed both deeply held and tightly bound to those of his father.Mr. Roake, who came to disagree with those views, said Mr. Romney nevertheless “had real integrity in his beliefs.”Wayne Brazil, now a private mediator in California, was the upperclassman adviser on the third floor of Rinconada, where Mr. Romney spent that year. “I have a sense of him being in what was then the political and philosophical minority” on the war, he said, “and standing his ground — not running or hiding from the debate.“But whether real listening was occurring,” he added, “I don’t know.”Tall and good-looking, Mr. Romney impressed fellow freshmen with his enthusiasm and self-confident bearing. Robert Mardian, now a California restaurant owner who lived on Mr. Romney’s floor, called him “unpretentious, very easygoing, very fun-loving — a not-so-serious, happy-go-lucky guy.”In Mr. Romney’s dorm closet hung parts of a Michigan state trooper’s uniform, apparently cadged from his father’s security detail. Some were amused by his boast that he had donned the uniform and slapped a flashing red light atop his vehicle to dash at high speed to the San Francisco airport for a late flight. Others said it underscored what they saw as the bubble of privilege he occupied — a scion of a powerful family who was not necessarily bound by the usual rules.Like many of Mr. Romney’s friends, Mr. Mardian, whose family was solidly Republican, stood apart from Stanford’s tilt to the social and political left. Several were in the Reserve Officers Training Corps.Yet the war and the draft were all but unavoidable issues in Rinconada Hall that year. Mr. Harris, a passionate and charismatic radical and the future student president, was one of the dormitory’s three upperclassmen advisers.Mr. Harris’s first-floor room became a hothouse for budding antiwar activists: a debating hall fueled by drugs and songs by his girlfriend (and later wife), Joan Baez, where students thrashed out the war’s morality and legality long into the night.“David was someone who would always be willing to talk,” said Mr. Roake, who was attending Stanford on an R.O.T.C. scholarship. “He used to give me a bad time because I’d be in my little uniform, and he would make comments about it.” But Mr. Roake said those discussions began a process that led him as a junior to seriously consider becoming a conscientious objector. (He instead became a Marine medevac pilot in Vietnam, saying he wanted to change things from the inside.)He said he recalled Mr. Harris’s urging Mr. Romney and other Rinconada students to begin thinking about the war and other social issues. “If anybody could turn you, it was he,” he said. “But Mitt resisted his blandishments.”For his part, Mr. Harris, now an author, said Mr. Romney “made no ripple on my pond.”“The most remarkable thing I see is that he was at Stanford for a year during that period, with all that’s going on in the Bay Area during that time,” he said. “And then he goes to Paris, where the students take over the city” — a protest, demanding sexual and academic freedom, that brought France to a standstill and ousted the autocratic President Charles de Gaulle.“He missed them both,” Mr. Harris said. “He was going in exactly the opposite direction.”Mr. Romney stood — conspicuously — at the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Harris. In that first year of the antiwar movement, Stanford was divided between war critics and supporters. Mr. Romney’s strongly held views were all the more prominent by virtue of his father’s national standing as a backer of the war.In November 1965, returning from a tour of Vietnam sponsored by the Pentagon, George Romney stopped at Stanford for dinner and remarks on Vietnam with Rinconada’s freshmen.The students were split over whether to honor a war supporter with a formal dinner, Mr. Drake said. Some urged the residents to forgo coats, ties or even shirts to show their displeasure. Others boycotted the meal.For the governor’s son, however, “it was Mitt’s finest hour in the dorm to have his father, the governor, come and visit our group,” said Peter Davenport, a Rinconada resident. Others described the younger Romney as beaming with pride.Afterward, Mr. Drake said, he argued heatedly with Mr. Romney over whether the government had given his father and others on the trip a true picture of the conflict — something he said Mr. Romney found nearly inconceivable.“I remember trying to convey this to Mitt — that you can’t necessarily believe what the government is telling you,” he said. “He really got quite angry about this. My sense very much was he felt it was unpatriotic to question the information we were being given. He felt the criticism was a personal attack on his family’s integrity.”As Mr. Romney’s freshman year waned, Mr. Harris won a landslide victory as student body president. Anti-draft demonstrators soon took over the Stanford president’s office.Mr. Romney demonstrated as well — outside, in khakis and a sport jacket, picketing the occupiers with a sign that read “Speak out, don’t sit in.” Within three months, he was bound for France, never to return to Stanford.Four decades later, in 2007 during his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Mr. Romney told The Boston Globe that while in France, “I longed in many respects to actually be in Vietnam and representing our country there.”“In some ways,” he said, “it was frustrating not to feel like I was there as part of the troops that were fighting in Vietnam.”That frustration may have been short-lived. In August 1967, as Mr. Romney proselytized in the south of France, his blunt-spoken father abruptly turned against the Vietnam War, calling himself a victim of “brainwashing” by officials from the State Department and the Pentagon, comments that helped doom his already faltering presidential candidacy. Not three years later, after George Romney had become the housing secretary in the Nixon administration, a journalist interviewed children of top administration officials about their views on the war.“If it wasn’t a political blunder to move into Vietnam,” the 23-year-old Mitt was quoted as saying, “I don’t know what is.”'"
"'12-09-12,'1','Nearly two months after the shooting spree in Colorado that left 12 dead and 58 wounded, survivors, civic leaders and generous citizens are confronting the victims’ traumas and a future of costly care. This is the painful challenge that communities across America typically have to face after the national spotlight moves elsewhere. It is a little-noticed part of the repetitious ritual of gun tragedy — the reckoning in fuller measure of the damage shooters inflict in the absence of sensible gun controls.Donations have poured in after the Aurora shootings, topping $5 million. But no one can tell what the true cost will be for gravely wounded survivors like Ashley Moser, a 25-year-old mother who was pregnant and had sought a night’s fun at the movies. Ms. Moser’s 6-year-old daughter, Veronica, was shot to death. The mother miscarried at the hospital where she was treated for severe neck and abdomen wounds. She is paralyzed, with doctors hoping she can regain use of her arms, according to her family.Other victims were also permanently disabled, some without medical insurance, and might need millions of dollars to survive. A man with a severed spine has been on a ventilator. A woman who lost her spleen and a kidney is rehabbing a shattered leg. Angry and confused, needy victims — some in wheelchairs — have suffered the added pain of open discord, voiced in local meetings, over how the charity funds should be distributed. This, too, is part of the shooter’s damage to the community.Rich Audsley, a civic leader, has been appointed as an adviser to the 7/20 Recovery Committee, the charity dispersal group, on the basis of the sobering expertise he gained in aiding survivors of the 1999 Colorado gun massacre at Columbine High School.The grim prognoses of Aurora victims struggling beyond the mayhem should be required reading for all the many politicians who mouth sympathy but ritualistically genuflect to the gun lobby. There are innocent citizens bearing such wounds all across the nation; there will be more after the shootings next time.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','But it is not yet apparent that the ferries can become a daily habit for enough people to keep New York Waterway, which operates the ferry, from losing money, as it has on some other routes. Hunters Point in Long Island City and Schaefer Landing in southern Williamsburg contribute even fewer passengers than Greenpoint, while northern Williamsburg and Dumbo, Brooklyn, are the ridership leaders.The service, which at peak hours runs boats every 20 minutes at each pier, functions especially well for residents of Brooklyn and Queens who live a short walk from the ferry and have jobs or attend schools near the ferry’s two stops in Manhattan. Riders pay $4 a ride, almost double the subway fare, though an unlimited $140 monthly pass reduces the expense. (Having to add subway fare on top of the ferry cost deters many riders, experts say.)A three-year effort to run a five-stop ferry service on the East River foundered in 2011 because without city subsidies, the revenue ridership was not sufficient to pay for the costs, said Tom Fox, former president of New York Water Taxi, which ran the service. Most transit services, like the subways, buses and the Staten Island Ferry, operate with some sort of government subsidies, but the current East River subsidy is assured for only three years.“It’s difficult to tell what a break-even point would be, but to be successful waterborne transportation would have to have some kind of subsidy because you’re competing against a $2.25 subway,” Mr. Fox said.Paul Goodman, the chief executive of BillyBey Ferry Company, the division of New York Waterway that operates the East River service, acknowledged that the subsidy had “enabled frequency of schedule and a price point that makes the service very accessible.”Seth W. Pinsky, president of the Economic Development Corporation, compared the new service’s use to the early days of the subways when lines were built in sparsely populated farmland and the development of apartment houses gradually followed to pack those lines. In cultivating ridership, he said, it was important to have predictable, regular service, so he plans to work with the City Council to extend the ferry service beyond the three-year contract until sufficient ridership is developed.“If you look at earlier experiments, the service was sporadic and infrequent,” he said. “People didn’t become habituated.”The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who is expected to be a leading candidate for mayor in 2013, has been a booster, calling the response by riders “nothing short of a tidal wave.”At the India Street pier, riders said they had heard about the service through word-of-mouth or by chance. That means many other residents of the neighborhoods it serves may not understand that it is indeed a viable and far more peaceful alternative to the subway. (In these areas, the G is the only subway line and it does not go into Manhattan.)Greenpoint is a neighborhood of old row houses and warehouses whose population of 40,000 is a mixture of immigrant Poles, hipsters and, increasingly, people who wear business attire to work. Like Williamsburg before it, the neighborhood has suddenly acquired a counterintuitive cachet and, as a result of a 2005 zoning change, thousands of new condominiums are expected to replace idle or underused industrial buildings. City leaders are hoping that these newcomers take the ferry.Noah Kraft, a broad-shouldered, redheaded 25-year-old who describes himself as a media entrepreneur, called the ferry a “lifesaver” because it made his frequent business trips “incredibly easy.”“You get the homeyness and neighborhoodness of being in Greenpoint and still have the city at your fingertips,” he said. “Having that dichotomy is really beautiful, not to mention that there’s great joy in being on the water and not underground.”'"
"'12-09-12,'1','The four players whose suspensions for their suspected roles in the New Orleans Saints’ bounty program were vacated by an appeals panel on Friday will meet with N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, as he prepares to determine what new discipline he will impose.Saints linebacker Jonathan Vilma, whose earlier suspension was to last the entire season and who has filed a defamation lawsuit against Goodell, will meet with him early next week, said his lawyer Peter Ginsburg. George Atallah, a spokesman for the players’ union who is representing the other three players, said Tuesday that the union was involved in establishing conditions for the meeting. The players will not be disciplined until the meetings are completed, the league said.The appeals panel on Friday instructed Goodell to reconsider if any part of the suspensions he gave to the players was because the payments were a violation of the salary cap. That would fall under the purview of an arbitrator for discipline. But the panel also affirmed Goodell’s power to discipline the players for violations deemed conduct detrimental to the game.The players have maintained that they never participated in a program with the intent to injure opponents, but merely put money into a pool to reward teammates for big hits.It is unclear when the other three players who were suspended — the Cleveland Browns’ Scott Fujita, the Saints’ Will Smith and the free agent Anthony Hargrove — will meet with Goodell. The four have been reinstated, but only Smith played last Sunday. Hargrove is not with a team, and Vilma is on the physically unable to perform list because of a knee injury.Vilma had scheduled a meeting with Goodell in August, but when the sides could not agree on the parameters of the meeting, it was canceled. None of the four have shared information with Goodell and none participated in an appeal with Goodell.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','That fashion editors tend to go bonkers for Marc Jacobs should be obvious by now. You could peel them off the floor of the armory on Lexington Avenue, where he stages his shows, so many have fallen at his genius feet.There is a reason for all this madness: nobody but nobody does it better than Mr. Jacobs. Even when he is bad, he is often better than most. He simply puts his chips out there in a way that others, lacking in talent or zeal, do not. And while he may not be comparable in avant-garde stamina to Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons, or in mood to the late, great Alexander McQueen, he has enormous feeling for what is contemporary.Of course, there are designers who make contemporary-looking clothes, like Olivier Theyskens at Theory, or Wes Gordon, a young New Yorker who has grown in ability and on Monday presented sleek separates, like pants and vivid scarf-print tops and a patent-leather coat in petrol blue. Donna Karan is certainly contemporary. Her show contained many beautiful things, especially skirts in airy oyster-gray linen worn with pared-down cutaways or vests, and a slim suit in pale blue stretch linen that defined modern comfort.But the difference with Mr. Jacobs is that he has no aspirations to make nice or luxurious clothes, though they might be that. Rather, he is interested in breathing meaning into fashion — about sex, art, celebrity, the past or just something personal to him — and doing so in a way that produces a nerve-tingling connection with his audience.From the very first, his show on Monday pointed to a cleaner look than in recent seasons. It opened with a girl in a T-shirt and black briefs. She was followed by a spree of suits with below-the-knees skirts pulled low on the hips, so the midriff and hipbone were often well exposed.Many of these outfits came in wide stripes, black, maroon and taupe, with matching purses and dippy little shoes with low heels. Conventional office attire. The models’ hair was ratted at the crown and pulled into a low ponytail, while their eyebrows were penciled thick.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','Every Monday streams of would-be visitors climb the grand stairs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art only to discover that it is closed. Now the museum’s director is proposing to open the doors on Mondays, starting next July, so that the Met would be open every day for the first time in more than 40 years.“We turn away thousands of people every Monday,” said the director, Thomas P. Campbell. “We’re not really serving our audience.”The museum started closing on Mondays in 1971 to save money, and the proposal to reopen is partly driven by financial considerations as well. Mr. Campbell said rising tourism had brought so many new potential visitors that the economic balance might have changed. According to NYC & Company, the city’s marketing and tourism organization, tourism to New York City has grown 16.2 percent in the last five years, to nearly 51 million visitors in 2011 from 43.8 million in 2006.The Met’s attendance has been rising too, to a record-breaking 6.3 million visitors in the fiscal year that ended in June, about 600,000 more than the year before. Met officials say they are calculating how many more staff members would be needed to open on Mondays, and at what cost, and how much revenue the increased traffic would bring in admissions charges (the suggested amount is $25), retail sales and restaurant receipts.“When you start drilling into it, it seems as though we’ll be ahead,” Mr. Campbell said. He said the proposal was being discussed this week at staff and board meetings, and that a decision was expected in the coming months.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','“The guidelines around spousal consent can vary by retirement account, so investors should be aware of the specific requirements for their account,” said Thomas J. Hohl, vice president and associate general counsel of Fidelity Investments.“Defined-benefit plans always require spousal consent to change a beneficiary, and defined-contribution plans require spousal consent most of the time, but not always,” Mr. Hohl said. He is familiar with both types because Fidelity is the nation’s largest provider of retirement accounts for individuals but also oversees many corporate accounts.Under the law, a pension plan is allowed to specify that the spousal protection applies only after a year of marriage, but most do not do so, one pension specialist said.And the law does not apply to pension plans for state or local government employees, although a minority of the plans follow it.Because the spousal-protection law is federal, it does not apply to same-sex couples, whose marriages are not recognized for federal legal purposes. The law also does not cover Individual Retirement Accounts, or I.R.A.’s, Mr. Hohl said, although in some states, a state property law might give a spouse some protected interest.Under the Retirement Equity Act, the consenting spouse’s signature on the required form has to be either notarized or witnessed by a plan representative. Many people come across such rules when they retire and choose a payment option, or when they want to change the beneficiary of a defined-contribution plan.That could happen, for instance, when someone entering a second marriage wants his or her pension benefits to go to children from the previous marriage, and the new spouse is perfectly comfortable with that decision.Or an estate planner might want to make an entity other than the spouse the pension’s beneficiary, with a spouse’s approval, for tax or estate-planning reasons, according to Gloria S. Neuwirth, a trusts and estates lawyer at Davidson, Dawson & Clark in New York.One example Ms. Neuwirth gave involved a couple who want to give money to charity. “If you name an individual as beneficiary, then when they withdraw that money they have to pay income tax,” she said. “But a charity obviously doesn’t pay any income tax. So this would be advantageous where the couple wants to make a charitable gift” of a lump sum pension distribution.Another example Ms. Neuwirth gave was a couple who will not need the money from a specified pension in their lifetimes. They might want to use the assets to set up a trust for one or more children, either minors or adults.Because of the wording of the pension law, there are pitfalls in well-intentioned maneuvers if a lawyer is not supervising them. For example, Mr. Hohl at Fidelity said, “the definition of ‘consent’ and ‘beneficiary’ can vary depending on an individual’s situation, so investors should be very clear on these terms in order to ensure they are accomplishing their intended objective.”A waiver of a spouse’s rights must make clear that it is irrevocable, court cases show. When a spouse challenged her waiver, on the grounds that the form she signed had not made clear that it was irrevocable, a federal court agreed with her and held the waiver invalid. In another case, a waiver contained in a prenuptial agreement was deemed invalid because only a spouse — not a spouse-to-be — can waive his or her rights.That is why, Ms. Neuwirth said, prenuptial agreements that she prepares have a clause that provides the parties will waive pension rights and an agreement to sign an additional waiver immediately after the marriage.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','HOYLAKE, England — Roughly 23 hours after her par putt spun out of the cup at Kingsmill Resort in Williamsburg, Va., Paula Creamer stuck her tee in the ground on the fourth hole at Royal Liverpool Golf Club on the Wirral Peninsula.“I’m a little tired,” said Creamer, who traveled all night Monday from Washington to England, distancing herself from her loss to Jiyai Shin at the Kingsmill Championship in the longest playoff — nine extra holes — between two players in L.P.G.A. history.Creamer’s commercial flight touched down in Manchester midmorning on Tuesday, a full day later than originally scheduled. Creamer, who had to give up her seat on a Sunday night charter flight when her playoff with Shin spilled over into Monday, dropped her luggage off at the house where she is staying this week for the Women’s British Open, then continued on to the course.Creamer, 26, missed her pro-am time but teed off with the group headlined by her friend Natalie Gulbis. She found the fairway with her drive, hit her approach into greenside rough, chipped to 12 feet and picked up her ball.Creamer got enough putting practice in her last 27 holes at Kingsmill. She three-putted the final green of regulation to fall into a tie with Shin at 16-under par, two strokes clear of the field. With darkness descending Sunday, Creamer made a 5-footer for par on the seventh extra hole to extend the playoff, which was suspended after eight holes. When the action resumed Monday morning, she missed a 5-foot comeback putt to open the door for Shin, who made a 3-footer for par and the victory.“I took a lot of positives from it,” said Creamer, whose last tour victory was the 2010 Women’s United States Open.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','“This keeps me sane,” Cedric Aaron, a Humboldt State alumnus and season-ticket holder, said as he watched the game against Colorado Mesa.Two other Cal State campuses, San Francisco and Sonoma, also dropped football in the mid-1990s after the 23-campus university’s agreement with the National Organization for Women to abide by gender-equity laws. With more than 100 men per football roster, it became too difficult for some universities dependent on state money to offer enough women’s sports to meet the requirements.Humboldt chose a different path, keeping football and adding women’s soccer and rowing. The rowing team was honored at halftime against Colorado Mesa after winning its first national championship this year.With the nearest metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay region, more than five hours away, Humboldt’s leaders have stuck with football, in part, to give residents behind the Redwood Curtain something to cheer. Arcata’s population barely tops 17,000 when school is in session.“There’s a sense of pride in your team and your small town,” said Pete Ciotti, a season-ticket holder and pizzeria owner who moved to Arcata from Ithaca, N.Y., 15 years ago. An entire row of Humboldt seats includes Big Pete’s Pizzeria plaques.“Everyone’s just really excited about it,” Ciotti added. “We all sat through terrible seasons, getting rained on. We knew things would get turned around.”Rain still falls on Redwood Bowl, one reason an old-growth forest abuts the 7,000-capacity stadium, but the Lumberjacks bear little resemblance to the 2008 team, which went 2-9 in Rob Smith’s first season as the coach. The squad has improved significantly since then, culminating in last year’s 9-1 record and two home sellouts, which was new ground for Humboldt, which has traditionally had a loyal but small following.Not including scholarships, Humboldt spends slightly more than $650,000 a year on football, about $213,000 more than the university spends on men’s basketball, the second most expensive sport. Football also costs about $380,000 more than Humboldt’s most expensive women’s sport, basketball.Amid a financial crunch that has devastated the state university system’s academic and student-support programs, Humboldt administrators emphasize that the university spends no state money on athletics. The program is financed through a student fee and private money.Humboldt’s president, Rollin Richmond, concerned about athletics’ future, raised the fee in 2010 over students’ objections and faculty concerns. In an advisory vote that year, students overwhelmed by quickly rising tuition opposed Richmond’s increase by a 2-1 margin.“People here were somewhat divided on it,” said Richmond, a biologist who came to Humboldt a decade ago. “That was a challenge. Students, rightly so, feel like the state has abandoned them.”The university system has staggered under a series of budget cuts that have more than tripled tuition in the past decade, forcing its 430,000 or so students to shoulder the country’s fastest-rising prices.But animosity over Humboldt’s higher athletic fees appears to have decreased while the football team’s success has grown. Few Humboldt students seem to know or care that they pay hundreds of dollars a year each to keep the athletic department running.“I don’t really mind,” said DeAndre Crenshaw, 20, as he sat on a bench on Humboldt’s central quad. Other students pay for his extracurricular activities, he noted.University leaders say the student fees are crucial to football’s survival. Even with that money, the team can afford the equivalent of only 14 full scholarships, they say, far fewer than the 36 the N.C.A.A. allows for Division II universities.The team is inventive when it comes to making its money go as far as it can. Athletes from other sports clean up Redwood Bowl after games to save money, which is why the university’s cross-country and track coach was carrying a leaf blower around the stadium after the opening game.Humboldt has sponsored football since the mid-1920s, when it avoided travel costs by playing local high schools. The team still tries to limit travel expenses, sometimes taking 15-hour bus trips to road games.Travel costs are one major reason Azusa Pacific, a private university of 5,200 students near Los Angeles, has decided to join Humboldt in Division II and the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. In 2007, the university’s football team traveled 18,000 miles, more than any other team in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, said Gary Pine, Azusa Pacific’s athletic director.Humboldt’s football team came into the 2012 season ranked as high as No. 17 in national polls, and has moved up to No. 11 after starting 2-0. The Lumberjacks’ resurgence has led to recent, albeit short, N.F.L. stints for former players like Taylor Boggs (Jets) and Lyndon Rowells (Carolina Panthers).The inviting confines of Redwood Bowl have come as something of a relief to Smith, who in 2005 left a job as Western Washington’s coach, frustrated by what he saw as a lack of respect for football on campus. Citing the shortage of Division II teams on the West Coast, Western Washington dropped football in 2009.“It’s been very difficult for someone like me, who has given his life to this sport,” said Smith, who played in a Rose Bowl with Washington. “But football is always a target.”During eight straight losing seasons from 1996 to 2003, the Humboldt football team sometimes had trouble attracting fans. But at the season opener, with a victory assured, Stephanie Lane, an assistant athletic director who grew up nearby as a Humboldt fan, proudly looked over bleachers filled with students.“This is our N.F.L.,” she said. “I don’t miss football games. It’s just in my blood.”'"
"'12-09-12,'1','“We don’t know if health care premiums and costs will shoot back up and by how much when the economy improves,” Mr. Altman said. Insurers generally base the premiums they charge on what they expect the health care costs of their members will be.Analysts generally agree that the deep recession and the sputtering recovery have helped keep health care spending — and insurance premiums — lower than the double-digit increases experienced in 2004 and before. In 2002, for example, Kaiser reported a 13 percent jump.Part of the reason, they say, is that many consumers have decided not to go to the doctor or have elective surgery during the downturn because of higher out-of-pocket costs.About half of workers covered by employers now have a deductible of at least $1,000 for individual policies. In 2007, only 21 percent of workers had deductibles that high, according to Kaiser. The study is being published online by the journal Health Affairs.The report also looked at differences between how much employees are paying for premiums in companies where at least 35 percent of workers earn $24,000 or less a year, compared with how much employees are paying where at least 35 percent of workers earn $55,000 a year.Employers typically ask workers to pay some share of the overall premium cost out of their paychecks.Kaiser found that workers at places with more low-wage employees paid on average $1,000 more in premiums than those working at places employing more higher-earning workers. The low-wage employees paid, on average, nearly $5,000 for their share of premiums, while higher-earning individuals paid about $4,000, on average.Paul Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group, cautioned against reading too much into survey results for any one year, especially since last year’s findings by Kaiser may have been high.But, over all, he said, health care spending seemed to be relatively stable. “Recession and the slow recovery are probably the principal factor,” he said.Some insurance executives are also cautious about predicting that health care spending will not rise rapidly, once the economy recovers. Many have been surprised at how much people have reduced their doctor visits. “I didn’t think I would see utilization this low, either,” said Janice Knight, an executive for Health Care Service Corporation, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans in states like Illinois and Texas.Others speculate that there could be something more going on as both patients and doctors adapt to changes stemming from the federal health care law and a determination by private insurers to keep spending down.When asked to share more of the cost of a branded prescription drug, for example, consumers were more willing to use generic medications, and the Affordable Care Act has numerous provisions that help rein in costs, said David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard University. “The slow economy is only part of it,” he said.“Every data point makes me more likely to believe that this a fundamental change rather than just a temporary change,” said Mr. Cutler.'"
"'12-09-12,'1','The Pentagon wrote off the report as pedestrian. Richard Lehner of the Missile Defense Agency, an arm of the Pentagon that erects the ground-based interceptors, called the panel’s alarm bells about the system’s limitations “an old story” and the need to focus more on enemy countermeasures unsurprising and “totally logical.”In its highly technical, 260-page report, the panel recommended an overhaul that would make the antimissile system “far more effective,” including adding new sensors and interceptor rockets, as well as an additional base in or upstate New York from which interceptors could be fired. The nation’s two existing bases are in and . The report called the plan affordable, saying it could fit within current antimissile spending — which runs about $10 billion a year — if the military eliminated what the panel described as costly and unneeded systems, like a $28 billion constellation of satellites meant to track enemy warheads.The assessment is a major blow to Mr. Obama’s strategy of playing down the long-range defenses he inherited from Mr. Bush and focusing instead on defenses in against shorter-range Iranian missiles. He articulated the shift in September 2009, calling the envisioned system “stronger, smarter and swifter.”But the report, released Tuesday, faulted the results. It said the domestic defenses in place could probably handle crude missiles fired from , but nothing more sophisticated. It called the current generation of antimissile arms “fragile” and full of “shortcomings that limit their effectiveness against even modestly improved threats.”Mr. Obama’s European shift is still a work in progress, and the report gave it conditional approval provided that the technical advances planned for the next six years, like improved sensors and interceptor rockets, actually materialize. But it recommended that the plan’s final phase — intended to protect the United States from long-range Iranian missiles — be scrapped in favor of the stronger domestic system.In short, the panel would undo part of Mr. Obama’s shift and strengthen Mr. Bush’s antimissile approach, creating more of a hybrid.The report comes as worries rise over and fears take hold that Tehran might one day decide to develop warheads for its rapidly growing fleet of missiles. Today, Iran’s missiles are short and medium range. The report looks ahead a decade or more to what it calls the “likely development” of Iranian missiles designed to rain warheads down on the United States.Since the 1980s, when President began the modern hunt for defenses against long-range missiles, Washington has spent more than $200 billion devising ways to hit incoming enemy warheads that move at speeds in excess of four miles per second. Critics have long faulted the goal as delusional, saying that any country smart enough to make intercontinental ballistic missiles could also make simple countermeasures sure to foil any defense.In a nod to critics, the new report identifies enemy countermeasures as the main challenge for the domestic system, with many of its recommendations aimed at improving ways to distinguish between decoys and real warheads.“For too long, the U.S. has been committed to expensive missile defense strategies without sufficient consideration of the costs and real utility,” said L. David Montague, the panel’s co-chairman and a retired president of Missiles and Space. The Pentagon must strengthen its technical analyses, he added, so it “can better evaluate new initiatives.” Mr. Montague, an engineer by training, is an independent consultant and one of the few members of the panel whose roots lie in the defense industry.It was 2002 when Mr. Bush announced plans to deploy a limited system designed to protect the United States from missile attacks. Today, the rudimentary system consists of 30 ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California. They are designed to zoom into space and destroy enemy warheads by force of impact.In September 2009, Mr. Obama switched the focus from protecting the continental United States to defending Europe and the from short- and medium-range Iranian missiles. New intelligence, he said, had made Tehran’s more modest accomplishments the more pressing threat.The report called for developing a new generation of interceptor rockets that would be smaller and more capable, as well as five new radars at existing early warning sites. The panel said these radars, combined with sensors aboard the interceptors, would provide more time to identify enemy warheads and shoot at them repeatedly if the first shots failed.The East Coast site, the report said, would require 50 of the new interceptors — 30 for operations and 20 for testing and evaluation.On Tuesday, a number of experts faulted the new plan. Theodore A. Postol, a physicist at the and a prominent antimissile critic, called the calculations behind the proposed radars “completely wrong and unrealistic.” He continued, “They’re claiming they can do things that are not physically possible.”Tom Z. Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, a private group in Washington, said the report made clear that the current domestic interceptors are woefully deficient and that developing new ones for an East Coast site “might take a decade or more.”At a news conference Tuesday, Mr. Montague defended the report and said the large panel had its own skeptics and proponents. “What we’ve agreed on,” he said, “is what we said in the report.”Outside critics, he added, tended to overstate the skills of enemies of the United States seeking to build long-range missiles to develop ways to foil defenses. People in the aerospace industry who have made countermeasures for the warheads of United States missiles, Mr. Montague said, “know it’s not as simple as a PowerPoint chart.”'"
"'12-09-12,'1','FOR years, I thought brisket was by nature a somewhat stringy, dry and chewy cut of beef. No matter how exacting the recipe or how careful the cook, the leanness of the meat dictated the texture.So for the Jewish holidays, I gave up and served short ribs instead. No one complained because short ribs are delicious.Then I tasted something called the second (or the deckle) cut of brisket. For lovers of fatty meat, this is brisket nirvana. It’s juicy, it’s succulent, it falls apart under the fork with barely a nudge. It’s also as tasty as short ribs but less expensive, which is what you want when you’re cooking for a large family dinner.You can’t find the second cut in many supermarkets, but butchers have it if you ask; they usually grind it up for hamburger. The high fat content, coupled with the cut’s inability to slice neatly, has made it undesirable to the majority of home cooks in our fat-phobic culture. So the first cut became the standard cut; it’s what you get if you just buy “brisket.”Once you get hold of a second-cut brisket, you can cook it exactly like the first cut, with one exception. It’s really much better if made the day before so you can remove the thick white cap of fat that will rise to the surface of the liquid as it chills. Lift it off with a slotted spoon, then reheat the meat and sauce in a 300-degree oven before serving.'"

"'12-09-13,'1','BOSTON — The Yankees have been sitting precariously atop the American League East standings for a week. One misstep could cast them into second place for the first time in three months. That misstep appeared to have cropped up Wednesday night when Derek Jeter landed awkwardly on first base while trying to beat out a double play ball in the eighth inning.It was a worrisome sight for the Yankees when he came up limping and had to be removed from the game. So important is Jeter to the Yankees’ chances of winning the division that some of his teammates shuddered when he left the field, even if they knew he had been dealing with a bone bruise in his left ankle for more than a week.“That’s the last guy you want to see go down,” Robinson Cano said. “One hundred percent I was worried.”But good news was the theme of day for the Yankees, who avoided a serious injury to Jeter as well as a dip into second place. They held on to beat the Boston Red Sox, 5-4, at Fenway Park, and most important, Jeter declared unequivocally that he would play Thursday.“I just jammed my ankle,” he said. “It’s not a big deal.”Jeter believes that if you play, there is no need to discuss injuries, and since he said he would play Thursday in the final game of the series, he refused to provide more details. He said he tried to convince Manager Joe Girardi that he should remain in the game, but Girardi was not hearing it.“I tried to stay in,” he said, “but he’s the manager.”As the trainer Steve Donohue escorted Jeter off the field, Jeter’s limp faded away with each step. Afterward, Girardi said Jeter told him the ankle felt great.'"
"'12-09-13,'1','And now with a strike pitting two of Mr. Obama’s most prominent allies against each other — the teachers’ union and Mr. Emanuel — the president could face many land mines if he steps into this battle.“It only gets more complicated for him if the strike drags on for a long time,” said Joe Williams, executive director of Democrats for Education Reform, a national advocacy group that has often battled teachers’ unions. “President Obama really has to thread the needle here.”On Monday, the day the Chicago walkout began, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, moved quickly to seek to brand Mr. Obama as a close ally of teachers’ unions. “Teachers’ unions have too often made plain that their interests conflict with those of our children,” he said in a statement. “President Obama has chosen his side in this fight.”Mr. Obama’s aides took pains to say that he was not taking sides in the Chicago showdown. His education secretary, Arne Duncan, issued a careful, anodyne statement: “I hope that the parties will come together to settle this quickly and get our kids back in the classroom.”Michael J. Petrilli, a former official in President George W. Bush’s administration and executive vice president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education policy group, sees only a downside for Mr. Obama in the Chicago fight. “There’s no doubt that this hurts President Obama,” Mr. Petrilli said. “He needs teachers to be energized and to go out and knock on doors and man phone banks for him. Right now they’re watching his former chief of staff go toe to toe with the teachers’ union in Chicago. This is not a position that the president wants to find himself in.”Some conservatives have suggested that Mr. Obama can emerge a winner, with more support from independents, if Mr. Emanuel gets the teachers’ union to accede to some of the changes he is seeking, like relying heavily on student test performance to determine whether teachers should be dismissed or receive raises.But Mr. Petrilli said that if Mr. Emanuel wins the battle, his victory might at the same time enrage and alienate many rank-and-file teachers across the nation, making them less enthusiastic about knocking on doors and making phone calls on behalf of Mr. Obama and other Democrats.“It’s hard to see how this can translate into any kind of advantage for Obama,” Mr. Petrilli said.Teachers in nearby Wisconsin, an increasingly important swing state, are keeping a close eye on the Chicago battle. Mary Bell, president of the main teachers’ union there, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, insisted that the Chicago confrontation would not detract from her union’s efforts on behalf of Mr. Obama this fall.“We’re going to have differences of opinions with some big-city mayors,” Ms. Bell said. “But every presidential race is a choice, and the choice is pretty clear here because there’s such a contrast between what President Obama believes about education and what Romney is proposing in terms of eliminating unions and privatizing a significant segment of the public schools.”G. Terry Madonna, director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., said the strike was not of great concern or consequence to many of the people in swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. Instead, people are much more worried about issues like the economy and being able to pay for college for their children.Mr. Madonna said the president would not be hurt much by the Chicago fight, partly because he was deliberately keeping his distance from it. “There won’t be much of a carry-over that will hurt the president,” he said. “If the president was to be actively involved on one side or the other, then it might have an effect. But he’s dealing with it with benign neglect.”'"
"'12-09-13,'1','“I know there are differences, and I know if you don’t adjust quickly in this league, you are not going to have the time to get it right that I did at Rutgers,” he said Wednesday. “I don’t know if there is such a thing as building years in the N.F.L. I think everybody is win now.”The history of college coaches who move into the N.F.L. is decidedly mixed. For every Tom Coughlin, who left Boston College to coach an expansion team in Jacksonville in 1995, led the Jaguars to the American Conference championship game in his second season and now has won two Super Bowls with the Giants, there is a Nick Saban. After winning a national title at Louisiana State, Saban went 15-17 with the Miami Dolphins in 2005 and 2006 before returning to college at Alabama, where he has won national championships two of the last three years.For every Jim Harbaugh, the former Stanford coach whose enthusiasm proved to be infectious last year in his first season in San Francisco as the 49ers won the N.F.C. West with a 13-3 record and reached the conference championship game, there is a Bobby Petrino.Petrino jumped from Louisville to Atlanta and then to Arkansas after going 3-10 with the Falcons. He informed players of his in-season departure by having a four-sentence note left at each locker.Buccaneers General Manager Mark Dominik was willing to gamble on Schiano because he said he was impressed with his ability to develop players at Rutgers like Gary Brackett, an undrafted linebacker who excelled for the Indianapolis Colts, and Ray Rice, a star running back for the Baltimore Ravens.“It looked like they were predeveloped to perform in the N.F.L.,” Dominik said.Dominik said he also believed Schiano would be able to develop strong working relationships with his players, something he was known for at Rutgers. He continues to offer support to Eric LeGrand, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a 2010 game against Army at MetLife Stadium.Schiano arranged for LeGrand to receive a nonpaying contract from Tampa Bay so he could fulfill his dream of reaching the N.F.L. He said his devotion to LeGrand stemmed from a promise made to parents of young men he recruited. “I did tell them I’d treat them the way I’d want my sons to be treated,” he said.Cornerback Prince Amukamara, who missed the Giants’ season opener after sustaining a high ankle sprain in the third preseason game, practiced Wednesday on a limited basis. “He does have some issues,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “He’s just fighting his way through them.” ... Although left tackle Will Beatty was taken off the injury list after missing the preseason with a back injury, Coughlin was noncommittal about whether Beatty or Sean Locklear would start Sunday. ... Coughlin said he thought the rookie running back David Wilson had responded well after fumbling on the second carry of his career and not carrying the ball again against the Cowboys. “He’s a little bit out of the doghouse,” Coughlin said.'"
"'12-09-13,'1','Accessories for Apple products are already a vast and lucrative business. In the last year, iPad, iPod and iPhone add-ons, including speakers, cases and power chargers, generated $2 billion in sales in the United States alone, according to the NPD Group, a research firm.To stay on top of the market and avoid building products that will soon be out of date, accessory makers have to watch Apple as attentively as any technology journalist or analyst. Apple, which is known for its culture of secrecy, generally keeps accessory makers in the dark before it unveils its new hardware. The companies rely instead on leaks from Apple’s manufacturing partners in Asia, or on rumors about the devices that surface on Apple-focused blogs. On the day of an Apple hardware announcement, they watch reports of the event and wait for data sheets to come from Apple with details on the devices before they crank up manufacturing in China.Griffin Technology, a company in Nashville that makes Apple accessories, said that moments after Apple introduced the iPhone 5, its employees were making final design tweaks in its prototyping shop, where 3-D printers turn out mock-ups of future products. Many Griffin employees had already traveled to China from the United States to be there when the iPhone 5 was introduced.“Kind of like everyone else, we’re at the same starting line in the race to the peg,” said Mark Rowan, Griffin’s president.Similarly, employees of Incase, a maker of iPhone cases based in San Francisco, crowded into a conference room to watch online reports of Apple’s presentation, said Dave Gatto, the chief executive. Employees in China were waiting at factories for final design specifications so they could start making cases.Occasionally a rare few in the business get a peek at an Apple prototype, according to Jeremy Horwitz, editor in chief of iLounge, a Web site that reviews Apple accessories. Much as some software developers get to use a new Apple product in advance so they can have software ready to show off on Apple’s stage, he said, some accessory makers have had access to Apple devices before their unveiling. Mr. Horwitz said these devices were typically locked down to prevent theft or leaks.Some companies take unsanctioned routes to get ahead of the game. Hard Candy Cases, a case maker, sent iPhone 5 cases to journalists before Apple even introduced the phone. Tim Hickman, chief executive of the company, said manufacturers in Shenzhen, where his cases are made, sent around design information for unreleased iPhones to attract case makers like himself.“The factories have gone from, ‘Shhh, hey, buddy, look at what I have for you,’ to making it part of their presentation,” he said.Mr. Hickman said he did not buy information from leakers in Asia. Instead, he said, he made a deal with a factory that had told him it could make cases for the iPhone 5 and asked him to send designs that it would then modify to fit the new phone. He said his iPhone 5 cases for sale to customers would arrive in the United States in about three days.IHome, a New York company that is one of the biggest makers of iPhone clock radios and other Apple audio accessories, tries to plan for Apple’s announcements but does not assume anything is fact until the company unveils its new hardware, said Ezra S. Ashkenazi, its chief executive. He called the Lightning change “a unique circumstance” because it was the first time Apple had changed the connector since it was introduced.There are already iPhone clock radios made by iHome and other companies in hotel rooms around the world. Kathy Duffy, director of public relations for the Marriott hotels in New York, said that if many patrons seemed to be getting the iPhone 5, the company would probably stock up on adapters or buy new accessories. “We’d have to evaluate it and see what the demand is,” she said.'"

"'12-09-13,'1','Mr. Sudeikis had been rumored to be part of this year’s “SNL” diaspora: Andy Samberg, Abby Elliott and Kristen Wiig have all departed. “Right now the idea is that Jason will go through at least until January,” Mr. Michaels said, though he did not rule out getting a full season out of Mr. Sudeikis.That leaves the question of whom Mr. Sudeikis will face in debate sketches. Fred Armisen has been the show’s President Obama since 2008, but Mr. Michaels said he would be relying on Jay Pharoah, who joined the cast in 2010.“Jay has been doing Obama in his act this summer, and Jay is coming into his own,” Mr. Michaels said. “I just thought it might be time to shake it up.”Mr. Armisen will still have an enormous amount to do, Mr. Michaels said, describing that 10-year player as “the backbone of the show now.”That might also describe Seth Meyers, a cast member and the show’s head writer who was also the subject of rumors this summer that he would replace Regis Philbin as Kelly Ripa’s sidekick on “Live.”“I personally didn’t think I’d be losing Seth,” Mr. Michaels said, “though I read that I could be.”With three vacancies Mr. Michaels was compelled to recruit new players. He turned to the Second City troupe in Chicago, long a pipeline to “SNL.” Several performers were invited to audition on the “SNL” stage, where they get about seven minutes to perform characters, deliver impressions and be funny. “Part of it is just how they stand on that stage,” Mr. Michaels said. “Can they take the stress of that?”He came up with three survivors: Aidy Bryant, Cicely Strong and Tim Robinson. They will join the holdover cast and the guest host Seth MacFarlane (creator of “Family Guy” and the man behind the film “Ted”) for the 38th season premiere on Saturday. “SNL” is returning a week earlier than usual, specifically to jump on the political news. That means references to the conventions, Mr. Michaels said. “We have at least three different takes on Clint,” he said, referring to Clint Eastwood’s memorable colloquy with furniture. (Bill Hader will play him.)Taran Killam, who has been emerging as a breakout player, is Mr. Michaels’s likely choice for Mr. Romney’s running mate, Paul Ryan, though he said that character may or may not appear this week. But Mr. Michaels acknowledged that Mr. Obama has been a challenge. What is his comedy hook? “So far we haven’t found it. My joke is always that he’s the first Canadian president,” said Mr. Michaels, a Toronto native. “He wants to think it through, do it in the fairest way possible and be thoughtful. And be a little distant, which I totally identify with, obviously.”Mr. Romney? “He’s easy to play because of that caution of his.”The show’s overall take on the election will continue to take shape. “We won’t know where we’re going until the first debate,” he said.Mr. Michaels’s input will be more as editor than dictator.“We talk it down,” he said, adding, “If it’s funny, we’ll use it. If it isn’t, we won’t.”'"
"'12-09-13,'1','Apple said the new display offered a bigger canvas for activities like reading books, browsing Web sites and watching movies.The device will also work on the latest variety of high-speed data network with wireless carriers, known as LTE, which other companies have included in their products for some time.Even though the product is not as startling as the original iPhone — the likes of which had not been seen before in the electronics industry — analysts still expect the iPhone 5 to be a hot seller this holiday season.Investors seemed to agree, sending Apple’s shares up $9.20, or 1.4 percent, to close at $669.79 after the event.The device, which will go on sale on Sept. 21, will start at $199 with a two-year wireless contract, a price similar to that of previous versions.In what could be one of Apple’s more vexing moves with a new product, though, the company got rid of the traditional 30-pin dock connector for attaching the iPhone to power cables, stereo docking stations and other peripherals, replacing it with a smaller connector it calls Lightning.The change means owners of existing iPhone accessories will have to buy an adapter from Apple so they can plug the new phone into those devices. The adapters are on sale at the Apple store for $30 for one version and $40 for another.Apple said it made the change because the new connector was more durable, freed space for other technologies inside the iPhone and enabled the iPhone 5’s thinner design. The company said many of the functions of traditional iPhone cables, other than charging, were now handled by wireless connections like Bluetooth.In a brief interview after the event, Philip W. Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said the company was offering the adapter to try to make the shift to the new technology as painless as possible for its users.“At some point you have to move to the next generation,” he saidMichael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, said the iPhone 5 showed how Apple approaches new technologies cautiously until it is sure it can deliver the best experience possible.The first phones that supported LTE, for example, were often criticized for poor battery life, but Apple waited until it could offer a product that could hold a charge long enough, he said.In the new product, Apple also chose not to support near-field communication wireless technology, which can be used to make wireless payments but has been slow to take off.Mr. Cook said the four-inch display was the perfect size because it could be easily held in one hand. Apple made the screen taller, but not wider, than the previous generation of iPhone for that very reason, he said.The new iPhone shows how the dividing line between phones and tablet computers is becoming fuzzier. Apple is developing a new model of the iPad with a 7.85-inch display that it could announce before the start of the holiday shopping season, according to people with knowledge of the project who declined to be named discussing confidential plans. The current iPad’s display is 9.7 inches.Apple’s closest rival in the smartphone market, Samsung, has experimented ceaselessly with screen sizes. Its Galaxy S III smartphone has a 4.8-inch display, while its Galaxy Note tablet has a 5.3-inch screen.The iPhone 5 is a more significant overhaul of the design of Apple’s smartphone than the iPhone 4S. That product was criticized by some for mostly incremental improvements inside a device that looked nearly identical to its predecessor.Even so, the iPhone 4S went on to be a big seller.Apple will still sell its iPhone 4S, dropping its starting price to $99 with a two-year wireless contract. The iPhone 4 will be free with a contract.The new, faster Apple-designed chip in the iPhone 5 will let users open e-mail, load music and interact with other applications more quickly. The game developer Electronic Arts showed a photo-realistic car-racing game running on the new device with graphics that closely resembled those of high-end console systems.The iPhone 5 has a new feature in its camera that will allow users to easily stitch together many images into a panorama, a feature that has been available in some apps and stand-alone digital cameras for some time.Apple also announced a revamping of some products that have received less attention in recent years — its iPod media players and iTunes software.It redesigned the iPod Nano with a bigger screen that supports multitouch gestures. And a new version of the company’s most popular iPod, the Touch, will come with the same four-inch display as the new iPhone. The new iPod Touch will also support Siri, Apple’s voice-activated assistant, and will come in a variety of colors.Anticipation for the new iPhone ran high ahead of the event, as usual. The swirl of rumors was so intense that Apple said they were hurting sales of current iPhones, leading to a rare earnings disappointment from Apple.The iPhone has become a gold mine for Apple, accounting for $16.2 billion in sales, or 46 percent of Apple’s revenue, during the quarter that ended June 30.But the company has faced growing competitive pressure, most notably from Samsung of South Korea, which extended its lead over Apple during the second quarter. Samsung accounted for 32.6 percent of global smartphone shipments in that period, compared with 16.9 percent for Apple, according to IDC, a research firm.Most of Samsung’s share of the smartphone market comes from products that run Google’s Android operating system, which powered 68.1 percent of smartphones shipped worldwide in the second quarter, IDC estimated.Apple’s share of the phone market, though, often gets a big boost over the holiday season and in the quarter immediately after the company introduces a new iPhone. Wall Street analysts expect that pattern to continue with the new iPhone.Apple is also fighting Samsung in courtrooms, contending that the company violated Apple patents.Last month, Apple won a huge victory in the most significant of the legal fights against its South Korean rival when a jury in a federal court in San Jose, Calif., awarded Apple more than $1 billion in damages. Samsung has said it will appeal the decision.'"
"'12-09-13,'1','For all that baseball pennant races offer in extended drama and excitement, they do not always offer much in the way of charm. Sure, the Red Sox and Braves’ collapses last year were oodles of fun for anyone not a Red Sox or Braves loyalist, but the beneficiaries were the Rays and the Cardinals. O.K., the Rays can claim a little bit of charm despite that dreadful ballpark and its empty seats, but they are so four years ago.This year, though, the Orioles have dropped in right out of charm’s central casting to tie the Yankees atop the American League East. Not only had everyone outside of Baltimore forgotten until the second half of the season that they field a team, but they have the added benefit of fielding almost nobody you’ve heard of — and one you have, Jim Thome, is on the disabled list. More players you haven’t heard of keep dropping like flies to injury and the Orioles are winning anyway. And they’re tied with the Yankees. What’s not to love?Mike Knobler of CBSSports.com compares them to the 2008 Rays, who defined underdog charm back then, and Jon Paul Morosi writes on Foxsports.com that they are defying every sort of baseball logic by just being here. They aren’t complaining about the bad timing of their injuries, writes Peter Schmuck in The Baltimore Sun, because it wouldn’t do any good and would cost them serious underdog points. Of course, it does not take much to be an underdog against the Yankees, who as Ken Davidoff writes in The New York Post, are not staging a classic Red Sox-like dive, but they’re wheezing enough to unsettle those rooting for the empire. And the fact that the Yankees’ driver crashed their bus leaving Fenway Park on Tuesday night feels eerily symbolic.O.K., for a moment though, even the Yankees can feel thankful they are not the Rangers’ Joe Nathan, a Giants fan who lost a bet and had to take batting practice in a Tony Romo uniform. Ouch.United States soccer fans could have been in a world of hurt had the men’s national team played a second straight stinker and lost again to Jamaica, but it staved off disaster in a 1-0 victory in Columbus, Ohio, on a goal by Hercules Gomez. It instantly turned its World Cup qualifying prospects brighter, writes Avi Creditor on SI.com, but as Martin Rogers writes on Yahoo.com, it is still hard to tell just where this team is headed.Football, American style, is caught at a bit of a crossroads, too, with the N.F.L. still wrestling with the Saints’ bounty scandal and Commissioner Roger Goodell staging meetings with the four players he suspended. But while enthusiasm still reigns in places like Humboldt State, Matt Krupnick writes in The Times, high school football may be feeling the effects of the concussion epidemic first, Tim Keown writes on ESPN.com.'"
"'12-09-13,'1','For Ms. Merkel, rejection by the court would have been a severe political blow. Her coalition has been weak and fragmented at home. Her leadership in Europe has helped her clamber above the domestic political fray, even if many are leery of the growing financial commitments.The court ruling cheered investors, with the Stoxx 50 index of stocks rising 1.1 percent in morning trading to its highest point since March. The euro rose to nearly $1.29, its highest since May. On Wall Street, the major market indexes were up at the close of the trading day., Germany’s foreign minister, praised the ruling as an “intelligent decision in the pro-European spirit of our Constitution,” and Germany’s European partners expressed relief. , the prime minister of Italy, called the ruling “excellent news that removes the last obstacle for the adoption of the European Stability Mechanism, as well as the fiscal compact.”Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, said he would call the first meeting of the mechanism’s board on Oct. 8, the German news agency dpa reported.But some experts saw the ruling as a step toward the common sharing of debt among members of the euro zone — a step that Ms. Merkel has firmly rejected but that her critics suspect she now quietly approves.“This may stabilize the currency union, but it will change its character,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, contending that the mechanism, combined with the European Central Bank’s bond buying, would lead to looser monetary policy, a weaker euro and inflation in the core countries. “This will be the starting point of what I call the union of mutualized debt.”In explaining the decision, Andreas Vosskuhle, the court’s president, said, “No one can say with certainty which measures will be best for the Federal Republic of Germany and the future of our united Europe in the current crisis.” For that reason, German lawmakers, as elected representatives of the people, should decide, he said. Parliament ratified the establishment of the fund in June.The court was not formally ruling on the constitutionality of the mechanism, but on requests to block the German president, Joachim Gauck, from signing the bill into law. Mr. Gauck’s office said Wednesday that he wanted to sign it as quickly as possible, but no date was set.The question before the court was whether the new fund would weaken the German Parliament’s right to control the spending of taxpayers’ money. Dissenting lawmakers, academics and 37,000 citizens had signed a complaint asking the court to issue a temporary injunction against Germany’s paying into the fund.Opposition to the mechanism brought together the right, which wants to guard German sovereignty and the rights of the national Parliament, with the far left, which opposes the bailouts.A temporary for fellow euro zone members has already promised much of its available money to , and , as well as to the planned recapitalization of Spain’s banking sector. Buying Spanish bonds would quickly exhaust its reserves, let alone trying to help Italy with the cost of financing its enormous debt.With the court’s support for the permanent bailout fund, Europe is moving beyond its common monetary policy toward encouraging its core group of countries to develop a more unified fiscal policy as well.“We are creating an institution that will have its own dynamics, become more and more powerful,” said Guntram B. Wolff, the deputy director at Bruegel, a research organization in . “This would be the start of a new and stronger European core.”'"

The principal means he used to pay low taxes on his hundreds of millions of dollars in income was the technique known as carried interest, which allows managers of private equity funds to treat most of the fees they receive for running the funds as capital gains rather than ordinary income.The technique strikes some — including President Obama — as outrageous, but it is legal under current law. Unless and until the Congress changes the law, Mr. Romney has every right to take advantage of the technique.But there is a related tactic to avoid taxes that is used by some private equity firms, including Bain Capital, whose legality is less clear. The Internal Revenue Service has not challenged it — at least not publicly — but some legal scholars say it is not justified, and some private equity firms have not chosen to use it.The fact that Bain uses the technique became public last month when the Gawker Web site posted annual reports from a number of Bain funds in which Mr. Romney, or his family trusts, have interests. It is clear that some Bain partners saved hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes from its use, but the Romney campaign says he did not benefit from it personally. The technique is complicated — I’ll get to the details later — but the effect is not. It concerns the management fees that sponsors of private equity funds, such as Bain Capital, are paid. Those fees are separate from the fund profits that the managers are able to treat as carried interest.Instead of paying ordinary income taxes on those fees, the partners and employees of the fund sponsors pay taxes at much lower capital gains rates. In fact, they do even better than that. In some cases, they defer paying those capital gains taxes for years, itself a substantial benefit.How good a deal is that? Annual reports from 2009 for four Bain funds showed that over the years the funds converted $1.05 billion in management fees from ordinary income into capital gains.That directly benefited the Bain partners who shared in the management fees. Assuming they paid the capital gains tax of 15 percent, rather than the ordinary income tax rate of 35 percent, they saved about $210 million in income taxes and $28 million more in Medicare taxes.And that reflects what happened at a few funds run by one manager. All told, it is likely that private equity and venture capital fund managers save billions each year.They do this through the technique of waiving the management fees and converting them into a preferred profit standing in the funds. The deals are structured so that they are all but certain to get the payout, assuming the fund makes money in any quarter, even if it loses money over all.If they took the money out then — and some do — they would pay capital gains taxes immediately. But even that is more than many managers are willing to do. At many private equity funds, managers are required to put up more money, along with other investors, whenever the fund makes an acquisition. The managers use the waived management fee to make the required investment, and defer paying any taxes on it.When that investment eventually is withdrawn, perhaps years later when the fund liquidates, the manager owes taxes on the management fee, but at the low 15 percent capital gains rate.Some tax experts think the I.R.S. could win if it challenged the practice.“It is not legal,” said Victor Fleisher, a tax law professor at the University of Colorado, in an interview this week. He noted that different money managers used variations, some of which he said were less likely than others to withstand an audit. “Bain,” he said, “is on the aggressive end of this.”In an article that appeared in the journal Tax Notes in 2009, Gregg D. Polsky, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who formerly worked in the I.R.S. office of chief counsel, said he believed the I.R.S. had good arguments that would be likely to prevail in court.In a statement issued by the Romney campaign, Brad Malt, the trustee for Romney’s blind trusts, said the tactic was “a common, accepted and totally legal practice,” although Mr. Romney had never used it personally.One manager of private equity funds, Apollo Global Management, wants to have it both ways. As a public company, it wants to persuade investors that it has steady fee income. So it shows the waived management fees as ordinary income in the financial statements it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But those same reports disclose that it passes the deferred fees on to its partners and employees, who take advantage of the tax benefits.It is quite possible that the maneuver is legal under current tax law, and that Bain and Apollo acted completely appropriately to arrange their affairs to make the taxes owed by their partners and employees as low as possible. Even if the I.R.S. and the courts eventually concluded otherwise, that would not indicate the funds had done anything wrong in asserting the position.But it is hard for me to see the difference between that and an arrangement under which my employer invested, on my behalf, money that it would otherwise have to pay me for writing this column. Then I would tell the I.R.S. that I owed no taxes until I liquidated the investment, and even then would pay only capital gains rates.If I tried that, I could not get away with it. If the law lets those who work in private equity do it, Congress should change the law.At the same time, it should end the carried-interest dodge. Managers are being paid for their services when they receive a share of profits from the fund. The amount may be based on profits, but that is no different from the situation at normal companies that pay bonuses based on company earnings. It is compensation, and should be taxed as such.Mr. Romney’s former colleagues in private equity may come to regret his candidacy, whether or not he wins. Few in the public understood this particular maneuver before the Bain reports were disclosed. Now many do. If and when Congress decides to reform the tax law, this area is likely to be a prime target.'"

"'12-09-14,'1','After losing its appeals, the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests has turned over about 180 documents that were subpoenaed by lawyers for a Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse. The Survivors Network had argued that the documents, mostly e-mails, should remain confidential because they contained information about victims. The organization, the nation’s largest advocacy group for victims of clergy sexual abuse, was supported by rape crisis centers, news media outlets and several former prosecutors, but the Missouri Supreme Court upheld a judge’s order to comply. The Survivors Network said it had not yet released all of the subpoenaed documents and was considering its options. Among the documents it withheld were those pertaining to the Rev. Shawn Ratigan, a Kansas City priest who pleaded guilty last month to child pornography charges and is still the target of civil lawsuits. The documents are under a protective order and supposed to be viewed only by the lawyers.'"
"'12-09-14,'1','The National Park Service has sent e-mails and letters to 30,000 people who may have been exposed to the virus after staying in the High Sierra Camps or in Curry Village since June 10. Symptoms, including headaches, chills, muscle aches and fever, appear one to five weeks after exposure. On signboards throughout the park, warnings about hantavirus now share space with the usual information about forest fires. Visitors are handed leaflets about hantavirus upon entering the park.Park officials have set up hot lines to field calls from visitors. On social media sites, many have expressed worries about their health. Some have criticized the handling of the outbreak by Yosemite officials as slow, pointing out that they did not close the signature cabins until late last month, even though the first death was made public much earlier.On Aug. 16, health and park officials announced that a man had died and that a woman had become seriously ill from the virus, saying they believed that the guests had become infected while staying in Curry Village in June. But it was not until other cases became known and cleanup crews found evidence of mice activity in the walls of the lodging that park officials closed the 91 tent cabins on Aug. 28.Al Oligino, 69, of Laguna Beach, Calif., and his family stayed in two of the now-shuttered cabins, No. 954 and No. 966, from Aug. 13 to Aug. 16. No one in his family has contracted the virus.Mr. Oligino said that Yosemite and health officials should have alerted potential visitors earlier, since the first infections occurred in June.“You had an outbreak before we got there, but you didn’t tell us,” Mr. Oligino said in a telephone interview. “We wouldn’t have come otherwise. I wouldn’t have taken my 5- and 7-year-old grandsons. I wouldn’t have taken myself, probably, even if it meant losing the money.”“Every step we have taken has been in consultation with and informed by public health officials,” said Vickie Mates, a spokeswoman for Yosemite.Mr. Oligino said he and his wife had visited Yosemite in the past, usually staying in motels just outside the park. But because his son, daughter-in-law and two grandsons were visiting California from Italy, they decided to stay in Curry Village in the insulated signature tent cabins, which were built in 2009 and cost about $10 more per night than standard cabins.Mr. Oligino said he and his family were also worried because they swept the floors of both cabins with a broom that an employee had lent them. Hantavirus is usually transmitted to people through air contaminated with the urine, saliva or droppings of deer mice.Lisa Cesaro, a spokeswoman for DNC Parks and Resorts at Yosemite, the company that has managed Curry Village and other facilities in Yosemite since 1993, said an investigation was under way. But she added that employees were specifically trained not to hand out brooms to guests.Officials from the California Department of Public Health reported finding deer mice infected with hantavirus at several locations in Yosemite from 2007 to 2010, though not in Curry Village. In 2010, a visitor became ill with the virus after coming into contact with rodents in a remote area of the park, the department said.“Inspections for rodent infestation and appropriate exclusion efforts, particularly for buildings where people sleep, should be enhanced,” the department said in a recommendation to Yosemite in a report in 2010 on diseases in the state’s national parks.Though the outbreak has led to some guest cancellations, Yosemite’s power to draw visitors from all over the world appeared largely undiminished.Tom Chu, from Shenzhen, China, a city known for its pollution, was visiting Yosemite with his 9-year-old daughter and a friend from Los Angeles. Motioning to the iPad he was using to take photographs, Mr. Chu said he had read about the outbreak on the Internet but was not worried.“There are more things to worry about in China,” he said.Susan Crawford, a literary agent from New Hampshire, was checking out of her cabin after spending one night in Curry Village. Ms. Crawford said she had visited Yosemite, her favorite national park, many times over the years.She said two rangers she met in another area of the park had reassured her it was safe to stay in Curry Village.“They told me it’s no longer an issue — period,” she said.'"
"'12-09-14,'1','BOSTON — For Glen A. Doherty, being assigned to a high-stakes security detail in Libya was just one of over a decade’s worth of adventurous overseas missions he had participated in as a security contractor and a member of the Navy SEALs.“He’s been overseas many, many times, defending this country,” said Mr. Doherty’s younger sister, Kate Quigley. “He was highly trained and really good.”Mr. Doherty, 42, was with the American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens, in a diplomatic compound in Benghazi on Tuesday when militants stormed the gates. He was killed, Ms. Quigley said, along with Mr. Stevens, Sean Smith and Tyrone S. Woods.A native of Winchester, Mass., Mr. Doherty worked as a ski instructor in Utah in his 20s, and remarked that if he did not settle on a career path by the age of 30, he would join the SEALs.According to Ms. Quigley, Mr. Doherty was a sniper on the rescue mission for Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch when she was held as a prisoner of war in Iraq, and was among the troops who captured Saddam Hussein’s palaces during the invasion of the country.But it was rare, she said, that he would talk about his experiences. “For him, that was his work,” Ms. Quigley said, explaining that her brother preferred to revel in the periods he could spend at home with his family and friends.'"
"'12-09-14,'1','“This single mining project is one of the main reasons for the amazing economic growth in the country,” said Dale Choi, an analyst at Origo Partners, a private equity company that advises investors on China and Mongolia.Mongolia’s gross domestic product grew 17.3 percent last year, and a further 16.7 percent in the first quarter of this year, the latest payoff from the roughly $6 billion spent on developing the isolated site close to the Mongolian-Chinese border over the past few years.“In terms of the basic infrastructure, there were no decent roads, no electricity, no water, no air transport coming in, and the work force we needed was nowhere near the mine,” said Cameron McRae, chief executive of Oyu Tolgoi, at his office in the capital, Ulan Bator, which is about 375 miles from the mine. “Basically we have had to provide everything from scratch.”The economic impact of Oyu Tolgoi is visible on the streets of Khanbogd, the town nearest to the site. The population of Khanbogd, a frontierlike outpost where most residents still live in traditional nomadic tents, has grown from just 2,000 a decade ago to over 7,000 today, not including the 10,000 workers housed at the mine itself.The dusty roads are now crisscrossed with cars and vans, as well as the shuttle buses filled with workers traveling from their nearby camp to the mine and back.Electricity is now available to households for set periods throughout the day, and the mine has promised residents 24-hour electricity soon. Still, life is harsh for many here, with no running water and only five doctors working at the town’s small, one-story hospital, the same number as before the influx of people.“We are looking at the moment at how we can help develop Khanbogd town so it is something better than it currently is, and somewhere where it is attractive for our employees to live,” Mr. McRae said.The development is inexorably altering the area, for good and ill.“The high level of respiratory illness in the southern Gobi is due to the influence of the mining companies, as well as to the influx of people into the region and the subsequent increase in building projects,” said Narantsetseg Logii, a doctor at the Health Sciences University of Mongolia.In fact, the mine is altering the entire country. Once it reaches full production, which is expected to be in 2018, the operation will be among the top three copper-gold mines in the world and is expected to account for more than a third of Mongolia’s economic output.“It will be a huge source of employment,” Mr. Choi said, “and will help to improve the living standards of the whole country.”Some residents in and around Khanbogd fear this nationwide improvement will come at their expense, especially those who continue to herd animals in the dry expanse and who rely, like generations before them, on a delicate relationship with nature.“We’ve been here for a long time,” said Altangerel Uudeg, 31, a local herder who was in the process of moving her family and livestock away from the area near the mine. “The herds are moving all across the land and so are the trucks. It’s very chaotic.”“We don’t have much rain here, and all the water is being sucked up by the big mine for their production,” she added. “Our 1,000 sheep are left thirsty.”Battsengel Lkhamdoorov, 40, a former herder whose animals also once roamed the land the mine sits on, has struggled since being relocated, and he even tried working for the mine at one point.“We don’t need money from mining,” he said. “What we need is water and land.”'"

"'12-09-14,'1','When it comes to security at the State Department’s 275 diplomatic missions around the globe, a number of which encounter some form of attack each year, the lessons have been hard learned.When the American ambassador to Lebanon, Maura Connelly, went to a concert at a Roman temple in the country’s central valley this summer, she traveled in a convoy of five armored sport utility vehicles with smoked glass.The convoy snaked through traffic at high speed during the 90-minute drive over the mountains from Beirut, the capital. It was impossible for others on the road to ascertain which vehicle carried the American diplomat to Baalbek, a town perhaps better known now for Hezbollah and hostages than for its annual music festival. There seemed to be added Lebanese government checkpoints along the way, too.Such protection measures came through bitter experience in Lebanon. After the civil war erupted in 1975, an American ambassador was assassinated after his limousine was hijacked as it crossed a neutral zone in divided Beirut, and suicide bombers blew up the American Embassy twice.Those two deadly attacks prompted an overhaul in security measures at diplomatic missions worldwide — measures that proved inadequate to keep the mobs at bay in Cairo and Benghazi on Tuesday and in Sana, Yemen, on Thursday.“State is operating in locations that in reality are essentially war zones or conflict zones, which in the past they would have evacuated,” said Michael Courts, the acting director of international affairs and trade at the Government Accountability Office, which has issued several reports critical of embassy security measures. “They are operating in much more dangerous environments.”The threat was first addressed in the 1980s with the establishment of the Diplomatic Security Service, essentially made up of bodyguards for diplomats. But it took the terrorist attacks that shattered the embassy compounds in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to spur a multibillion-dollar embassy reconstruction program.Still, a 2009 G.A.O. report said that despite the building program and the hiring of about 40,000 people around the world to provide protection, the measures remained insufficient. Problems included inadequate buildings, foreign-language deficiencies among protection staff members, posts left vacant for long stretches and lack of experience. Some problems were attributed to host countries, with issues ranging from the denial of weapons permits to the refusal to allow trees to be felled to improve sightlines.There has also long been tension among diplomats over whether the “Fortress America” approach of building imposing diplomatic compounds is less productive than allowing personnel to circulate in the countries where they are posted and permitting visitors to arrive at embassies without off-putting body inspections.The latest attacks could threaten a new effort to relax the imperious architecture of the past decade, said Jane C. Loeffler, an architectural historian who wrote “The Architecture of Diplomacy.” She said that when she visited the State Department this week, just before the attacks, to conduct research on the effort, she found officials “excited and upbeat about this incredible change in direction” that would place embassies closer to the middle of cities and generally make them more welcoming by reimagining security features.After the attacks, she said, “my first reaction was, who could argue that architecture matters at all?” But reflecting further, she added that making the embassies less forbidding was as important as ever in reducing America’s image problems overseas.American diplomats in places with a high threat level, like Sana or Peshawar, Pakistan, travel with security details that make mingling difficult and usually live isolated from local populations in heavily guarded compounds.“When I looked at security measures, if I was satisfied, I was always relatively satisfied,” said Edward P. Djerejian, a former ambassador to Syria and Israel. “I used to tell my security guys, ‘O.K., we built a 16-foot wall, but there is such a thing as a 17-foot ladder.’ That is what we saw happen in Cairo.”The facilities themselves are considered just one element in the overall protection.“When you have someone storming the compound, it takes more than just the facility,” said Charles Michael Johnson Jr., the G.A.O.’s director of international counterterrorism and security assistance issues. “It is meant to slow down the attack to give time for the host government to come in with a more adequate response.”The first question that seasoned diplomats asked after the latest attacks was how the host governments’ security officers responded.The security agencies of Egypt, Libya and Yemen have been in disarray since their revolutions started. The slow response by the Egyptian government to protesters’ scaling the high embassy walls prompted concern in Washington over the attitude of the new government there, which is allied with the Muslim Brotherhood, about protecting foreigners. In Yemen, attackers breached an outer wall, but government forces drove them out before they reached the main buildings.The attackers in Benghazi, in what might have been a planned assault, killed Mr. Stevens and three other Americans.“You can protect people where they work by building more fortified embassies,” said Anthony C. E. Quainton, a former assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security. “But how do you protect them all the time, in all places?”Any movement can be particularly fraught. The 2009 Government Accountability Office report noted that the embassy in Baghdad, one of the largest in the world, maintained a fleet of 914 armored vehicles, one-third of the total worldwide, at an average cost of $173,000 per vehicle.In Syria, a police state before the current uprising, it was not unusual to find Margaret Scobey, the American ambassador there from 2003 to 2005, wandering the carpet bazaar by herself on the weekend.In Egypt, with shaky if adequate security even before the revolution, American ambassadors were barred by their security detail from walking anyplace. Ambassadors moved around in an armored BMW limousine, with bodyguards in Jeep Cherokees driving in front and behind.One American ambassador to Egypt, who was traveling with his family through the Sinai Desert before the revolution, apparently annoyed a local Bedouin in a Toyota pickup truck when the security cars would not let him pass. He dropped back, then caught up with the convoy at a gas station, roaring in at such high speed that the Egyptian bodyguards opened fire. They shattered all the windows in the truck but missed the man as he drove away.The Egyptian team raced the ambassador away from the gas station in his limousine, with the Jeeps spinning in rapid circles to haul in wandering family members.Diplomats endeavor to take such attacks in stride as part of their job, although the risks are unpredictable, as Mr. Stevens’s death underscores. “By going out in Benghazi — where the Libyans don’t have full and sovereign control of their territory — then all these security measures fall out of place,” Mr. Djerejian said. “It is not your normal environment for an ambassador.”'"
"'12-09-14,'1','The New York City Board of Health passed a regulation on Thursday that will require consent from parents before an infant can have a form of Jewish ritual circumcision, prevalent in parts of the ultra-Orthodox community, in which the circumciser uses his mouth to remove blood from the incision.In a morning meeting, the nine-member panel of doctors and public health professionals said that though the regulation had been challenged by some Orthodox Jewish religious authorities as an unconstitutional infringement of their religious freedom, the risk of disease from the ancient procedure was serious enough to warrant action.Indeed, some panel members said they believed that requiring consent did not go far enough. “It’s crazy that we allow this to go on,” said Dr. Joel A. Forman, a professor of pediatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.Infectious disease experts widely agree that the oral contact, known in Hebrew as metzitzah b’peh, creates a risk of transmission of herpes that can be deadly to infants, because of their underdeveloped immune systems. Between 2004 and 2011, the city learned of 11 herpes infections it said were most likely caused by the practice. Two of those babies died; at least two others suffered brain damage.While most ritual circumcisers, known as mohelim, no longer use oral contact to pull blood away from the circumcision incision — they use gauze or sterile glass pipettes instead — the practice has been strongly defended by ultra-Orthodox Jewish rabbis who believe the practice is both safe and faithful to Talmudic codes. More than 200 ultra-Orthodox rabbis have ordered their adherents not to comply with the regulation.'"
"'12-09-14,'1','“At that point you’re kind of like, ‘Oh my God, I don’t want to get penalized,’ ” said Ko, who did not appear stressed.Then again, not much appears to faze her, her equanimity on the course winning her raves among veterans like Laura Davies, 48, who described her temperament as brilliant, and said, “She is very calm, and I don’t think a bogey or a double bogey will affect her.”At No. 1, a brute of a par 4, Ko and Thompson hit their tee shots and were standing by their balls by the time Ohe, who had ducked into a portable toilet and had not heard the second warning, arrived at the tee box.After hitting her drive, Ohe sprinted down the fairway to catch up with her playing partners in a scene reminiscent of the games of chase that Wilson used to play with Ko between shots when she was younger to keep the game from being boring.Using her 3-wood, Ko put her drive in the fairway, which is protected by bunkers and looks as narrow as an emery board from the tee box. She hit her 5-wood approach to 10 feet and made the uphill birdie putt to move, temporarily, into a share of the lead, at two under. She was tied with Paula Creamer and Karrie Webb, who have a combined eight major titles, and Charley Hull, a 16-year-old amateur from Britain. Hull finished with a 71, as did Webb, while Creamer posted a 73.Ko and Wilson laughed as they walked off the green, but not at the absurdity of two teenagers atop the leader board of the women’s fourth major, which was pushed back several weeks this year so it would not coincide with the London Olympics. In practice rounds on Monday and Wednesday, which Ko played in heavy rain and howling winds, she had double-bogeyed the first hole.Twice on her second nine, Ko made back-to-back bogeys: on Nos. 2 and 3, and 6 and 7. Her par putt on the sixth, after a bad chip, came up four feet short, and she had a 2-footer rim out on the seventh. She also missed a short putt for par at No. 11, after birdieing her opening hole, the 493-yard par-5 10th.“That’s not good,” Ko said, adding that she found the shorter putts harder than the longer ones.“A 3-foot putt can be more nerve-racking than a 9-foot putt because a 3-foot putt you should be getting in,” she explained. “A 9-footer, there’s a chance it won’t go in. So maybe that’s why that happens.”By the time Ko’s group arrived at the par-3 sixth, play was backed up, and they had to wait awhile for the green to clear.“While that little incident with the clock looks like it affected us, I don’t think we can blame it,” said Wilson, who is taking time out from his coaching duties with the Institute of Golf to shepherd Ko this week.“But it’s difficult,” he added. “As a group we were trying to go as quick as possible, and then you go from running to pretty much crawling.”The fierce winds that were forecast for the afternoon never materialized, and the rain that can make the course trying also stayed away.“Today was probably the easiest it’ll ever play,” Ko said, alluding to the relatively benign weather in the morning.She added: “I think this is one of the hardest golf courses I’ve ever played. Shooting even par, it’s not a bad round, and I think it’s a pretty good start.”Hull, a member of the Britain and Ireland team that beat the United States in the Curtis Cup earlier this year, has played in four other professional events in 2012 and has made each cut.Asked if she knew Ko, Hull said, “Well, I’ve heard of her.”She added, “I think she’s pretty awesome, though, isn’t she?”'"
"'12-09-14,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Producer prices rose the most in three years in August as energy costs surged, but fairly benign underlying inflation pressures should help the Federal Reserve maintain its accommodative monetary policy stance.Other data released on Thursday underscored the weakness in the labor market, a major concern for the Fed. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits touched a two-month high, although some of the increase was attributed to Tropical Storm Isaac.The Fed began another aggressive economic stimulus program, saying it would buy mortgage-backed debt each month until the outlook for jobs improved substantially as long as inflation remained under control. In addition, policy makers said they were not likely to raise short-term interest rates from current rock-bottom lows until at least mid-2015.Economists said the strong rise in wholesale prices last month was unlikely to translate into a sustained increase in prices at the supermarket and shopping mall.“There is little indication that it’s going to pass through to higher consumer inflation,” said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. “We continue to have economic growth that is modest.”'"

"'12-09-14,'1','Commend David Wexler for not going where you expect in ''The Stand Up,'' an oaf-in-kiddieland story, or at least not lingering there when he does. It's too bad that he didn't bring a little more creativity to the predictable tale he does fashion, though.Mr. Wexler, who wrote and directed, gives us Zoe (Jonathan Sollis), a stand-up comic who is sent into a deep funk when his beautiful girlfriend (Julia Dennis) is killed. Determined to shake him out of it, his father (Aidan Quinn) arranges for Zoe to become a kindergarten teacher.Yes, there are ''Kindergarten Cop'' and ''School of Rock'' moments -- Mr. Sollis even has Jack Black's doughy build -- but the focus soon shifts to finding Zoe a rebound romance. Conveniently, a good-looking fellow teacher (Margarita Levieva) is available. (For those keeping score, that's two hot women inexplicably attracted to a moping schlump.)Ms. Levieva, so treacherous-looking as Emily's identity-switching conspirator in the ABC drama ''Revenge,'' shows a different side here and is quite watchable. Mr. Sollis can't always handle the naturalistic acting style Mr. Wexler demands, but the main shortcoming of this film is that the story Mr. Wexler finally decides to tell is utterly ordinary.PHOTO: Jonathan Sollis as a kindergarten teacher in ''The Stand Up.''

"'12-09-15,'0','Peter Lougheed, the Alberta premier who harnessed his province’s vast oil and gas resources to transform its economy, died Thursday in Calgary, Alberta. He was 84.His family attributed his death to natural causes.A former professional in the Canadian Football League despite his slight build, Mr. Lougheed (pronounced LAW-heed) turned Alberta into a major player in oil and gas and a pioneer in the development of oil sands after his Progressive Conservative Party took power in 1971, ending the long reign of Social Credit, a populist farm movement.Mr. Lougheed arrived in office at a time of great political and economic upheaval in Canada. He clashed frequently with Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the country’s Liberal Party prime minister, over pivotal constitutional and economic issues.While Alberta’s oil and gas industry was founded with the discovery of the Leduc well in 1947, Social Credit governments had neglected it, even though, as is generally the case in Canada, most of the resource was owned by the province rather than landowners.Mr. Lougheed raised royalties and channeled their revenues into the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which today holds about $16 billion. As the global oil crisis struck, pushing up prices in the 1970s, the province’s wealth rose with it.The energy crisis led to Mr. Lougheed’s greatest clash with Mr. Trudeau, who tried to introduce greater federal control over energy and who sought a portion of royalty payments for the central government. After Mr. Lougheed cut oil production in Alberta, the prime minister relented, and in 1981 acknowledged that provinces had full control over their resources.'"

"'12-09-15,'0','The prospect that Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, would open its first big-box store in New York City suffered a setback on Friday, with the company saying it would not be a part of a new mall being constructed in Brooklyn.“We were unable to agree upon economic terms for a project in East New York,” said Steven Restivo, a company spokesman. “We remain committed to bringing new economic development and shopping options to New York City, especially in the neighborhoods that need them most.”The project, known as Gateway II, is being developed by Related Companies. Walmart and Related had never confirmed that Walmart was being considered for the location, but local unions, some members of the City Council and community groups had raised alarms at the idea of the retailer’s gaining a foothold in the city.“Walmart’s withdrawal from Gateway II shows that when New Yorkers join arms, even the world’s richest retailer is no match for them,” said Stephanie Yazgi, a spokeswoman for Walmart Free NYC.A ShopRite supermarket is now expected to anchor the site. A company spokeswoman said that it had “been pursuing this location for some time and believe that we will be able to confirm the status of this potential site shortly.”ShopRite is unionized, and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, which will represent ShopRite workers at the new store, said it was “thrilled” with the news.

"'12-09-15,'0','A Columbia graduate student and his adviser have authenticated the student’s discovery of an unknown manuscript of a 1941 novel by Claude McKay, a leading Harlem Renaissance writer and author of the first novel by a black American to become a best seller.The manuscript, “Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem,” was discovered in a previously untouched university archive and offers an unusual window on the ideas and events (like Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia) that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II. The two scholars have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified.McKay, a Jamaican-born writer and political activist who died in 1948, at 58 (though some biographies say 57), influenced a generation of black writers, including Langston Hughes. His work includes the 1919 protest poem “If We Must Die,” (quoted by Winston Churchill) and “Harlem Shadows,” a 1922 poetry collection that some critics say ushered in the Harlem Renaissance. He also wrote the 1928 best-selling novel “Home to Harlem.” But his last published fiction during his lifetime was the 1933 novel “Banana Bottom.”“This is a major discovery,” said Henry Louis Gates Jr., the Harvard University scholar, who was one of three experts called upon to examine the novel and supporting research. “It dramatically expands the canon of novels written by Harlem Renaissance writers and, obviously, novels by Claude McKay.“More important, because it was written in the second half of the Harlem Renaissance, it shows that the renaissance continued to be vibrant and creative and turned its focus to international issues — in this case the tensions between Communists, on the one hand, and black nationalists, on the other, for the hearts and minds of black Americans,” said Mr. Gates, the director of the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research at Harvard.This literary detective story began in the summer of 2009, when Jean-Christophe Cloutier, a doctoral candidate in English and comparative literature, was working as an intern in the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia. He was going through more than 50 boxes of materials belonging to Samuel Roth, a kind of literary pariah who died in 1974 and is best known for being the appellant in a famous obscenity case in the 1950s.'"
"'12-09-15,'0','“It is a beautiful place, and people have a feeling that they have a good life,” said Janez Sustersic, the country’s finance minister. “We were the good pupil of euro entry, also of entry into the E.U., so there was a lot of self-satisfaction that probably made us unaware of the underlying problems.”They certainly know about them now.By financing a construction boom and a spate of ill-advised takeovers, banks accumulated billions of euros in bad debts, according to the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, an independent agency that prepares data for the Slovenian government. Now, with the contraction, once-sound businesses are struggling. Bad loans now account for 6 billion euros, or 12 percent, of Slovenian banks’ lending portfolios.Construction has stalled. Gross domestic product is expected to shrink by 0.9 percent this year, to 35.6 billion euros. And because the government’s borrowing costs are high — yields on its 10-year bonds have been above 6 percent lately — the government’s interest payments are higher, too.Even if Slovenia is nowhere close to actually requesting a bailout, its situation cannot help but be on the radar of the European Central Bank, whose next governing directors’ meeting will be held here in Ljubljana on Oct. 4.Although the government’s borrowing needs are still relatively small — projected at 1.6 billion euros in 2013 — a spike in bond yields could lock Slovenia out of debt markets.So what went wrong?Despite its cold war period as a socialist state, Slovenia, as part of moderately open Yugoslavia, was familiar with market economies. Agriculture was never collectivized, for example. There was extensive trade with Western Europe.But Yugoslavia’s breakup, and Slovenia’s drive to independence, left an inflated sense of national pride and, perhaps, of Slovenes’ own abilities.Having negotiated their transition and accession to the European Union smoothly, and with its banks having little exposure to toxic subprime American assets, Slovenes underestimated both the dangers of the looming euro zone debt crisis, and the extent to which the increasingly global economy was changing around them, according to Professor Marjan Svetlicic, head of the center of international relations at the University of Ljubljana.The country’s subsequent economic disaster echoes those of other countries, with the euro bringing easy credit and fueling a construction bubble that inevitably burst.But here, special factors were at play when the country’s economic elite embarked on a host of management buyouts of companies that were partly privatized when the resources of the old socialist state were divided. That meant Slovenia began looking inward just as globalization was transforming world trading patterns. Worse, many buyouts lacked the robust business plans foreign investors would have required, officials and academics say.“The old boy network is very strong in small countries,” Mr. Svetlicic said. “These kind of connections made bankers blind. They trusted personalities. They said, ‘These managers have performed well in the past, so let them have the money,’ and they did not go through a very precise analysis.”Buyouts and mergers peaked during the first term of Mr. Jansa, who was prime minister from 2004 to 2008. He returned to power this year after his predecessor, Borut Pahor, lost elections after squabbles within his coalition and a failure to push through reforms.Mr. Jansa’s first government was a power broker because state-run funds still held stakes in many companies. One cause célèbre was the so-called brewery wars in which Pivovarna Lasko acquired its rival, Union, in 2005 to avert a takeover by InBev of Belgium.Keeping ownership in Slovene hands was a crucial goal. On its Web site, Pivovarna Lasko still cites a quotation about it from 1940, which begins: “This is not a factory like those built with foreign capital, which came to engulf our land in slavery and misery.”But Pivovarna Lasko then went on a scattershot buying spree, acquiring strategically questionable stakes in both Mercator, the country’s largest retailer, and Delo, a newspaper. The hodgepodge conglomerate became unwieldy, and many of its parts have since been sold.Opponents still accuse Mr. Jansa of meddling back then to consolidate his power.The opposition leader and mayor of Ljubljana, Zoran Jankovic, says he was ousted from the leadership of Mercator at the behest of Mr. Jansa. “I wasn’t on the same side as him — it was just important to be in the right political party,” Mr. Jankovic said.Mr. Jansa’s office, in a statement responding to questions, said he had “never interfered” in appointments at Mercator. “The appointment and the dismissal of the chairman of the management board of Slovenia’s largest food retailer, Mercator, falls within the competence of the owners of the company and not within the competence of the government or the prime minister,” the statement said.In any event Bostjan Vasle, the director of the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development, said many mistakes were made in Slovenia in the period of 2005 to 2007.“Just before the outbreak of the crisis,” Mr. Vasle said, “a lot of people in Slovenia had this idea that it was possible to buy out their companies solely on the basis of cheap loans from a banking sector which had gained from entering the euro area.”Around this same time proposals for structural reforms were largely shelved in the face of opposition from various politicians and interest groups.Foreign direct investment grew more slowly in Slovenia than in other Central and East European countries over the last two decades, limiting the adoption of new technology, thus inhibiting productivity, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Now, with a rising number of bankruptcies and bad debts, Slovenia wants foreigners to recapitalize its big, sickly Nova Ljubljanska Banka. Mr. Sustersic, the finance minister, said investors might be found “in a period of several months, maybe a year.”An austerity budget for 2012 aims to cut about 600 million euros from the previous year’s government spending, and there are plans to adopt labor market reforms by the end of the year.With such efforts under way, Mr. Sustersic said an international bailout would be a last resort. “If we go on with the measures planned, then I think we will be looked at favorably by financial markets and then the likelihood of us needing any financial help will be small,” he said.“Today,” Mr. Sustersic added, “people don’t have the feeling anymore that we are in any kind of sense exceptional or better than the others — which is good because there is maybe also a better understanding of the necessary measures that we have to take.”Slovenia’s gradualism still has some defenders, like Joze Mencinger, professor of economics at the University of Ljubljana and a former finance minister. “Nobody has anything against foreign investments, for example when they are greenfield investments,” he said, “but I don’t understand why you should sell all your companies.”But that view is no longer the consensus.“This idea of gradualism just went a little too far,” Mr. Vasle said. “At the beginning it was appropriate, but at some point in time it became an excuse for postponing all structural reforms.”'"

"'12-09-15,'0','BEIJING — A Chinese official at the center of one of the country’s biggest political scandals in years will go on trial on Tuesday, court officials said Friday.The official, Wang Lijun, the charismatic police chief under the fallen politician Bo Xilai, will be tried in the southwestern city of Chengdu, according to a court official with the Chengdu Intermediate People’s Court who would give only his surname, He. The court official said that the trial would be open, but that all the seats had been taken.In February, Mr. Wang fled to the United States Consulate in Chengdu and stayed there for 24 hours before leaving and being taken into custody. Mr. Wang said he went to the consulate out of fear for his life after crossing Mr. Bo over Mr. Bo’s wife, Gu Kailai, who Mr. Wang said had killed an English businessman.Ms. Gu was convicted of murder, and the scandal forced the downfall of Mr. Bo, who was Communist Party chief of the municipality of Chongqing. No charges have yet been brought against Mr. Bo, who has been held in detention for months.An official state report said this month that Mr. Wang would be tried on charges of defection, illegal surveillance and taking bribes.The trials of Ms. Gu and Mr. Wang are indications that despite a series of political missteps this year, including the recent absence from public view of China’s presumptive new leader, Xi Jinping, the authorities are trying to clear away issues that could complicate the coming Communist Party Congress. While Mr. Xi’s absence has added to the uncertainty surrounding Chinese politics, the conclave is still expected to herald his appointment as Hu Jintao’s successor as head of the Communist Party.'"

"'12-09-16,'0','Mr. Cruz pulled off a political upset in July by defeating Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in a runoff for his party’s Senate nomination. Last month, he was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention.Mr. Sadler, also a lawyer, serves as a paid consultant for the Texas Association of School Boards. Until February, he was executive director of the Wind Coalition, an Austin-based advocacy group for wind energy. He served 12 years in the Texas House, until 2003.“Unfortunately, most people’s political memories just aren’t that good,” said Allen Blakemore, a Republican strategist based in Houston. “Sadler’s dealing with first-time introductions across the state. People in Lubbock, Houston, San Antonio, they never knew who he was.”Mr. Sadler, who said he fully expects Mr. Cruz and his supporters to outspend him, called Mr. Cruz’s views too extreme for Texas. He said Texans usually laugh when he tells them that Mr. Cruz wants to eliminate several federal agencies, including the Department of Education and the I.R.S.“If we in Texas are laughing at the Republican nominee for United States Senate, what do you think the rest of the country is doing?” Mr. Sadler said. “We’ve had enough of politicians standing up on the national stage and everybody else laughing at us.”So far, Mr. Cruz has largely ignored Mr. Sadler on the campaign trail. His campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Texas Democrats have not won a statewide race since 1994. Mr. Sadler is hoping to break the streak, though many pundits see Mr. Cruz’s victory in November as a foregone conclusion. Such predictions will not deter Mr. Sadler, according to Senator Leticia Van de Putte, Democrat of San Antonio, who served with Mr. Sadler in the House.“If something’s easy, don’t expect Paul Sadler to be involved in it,” she said.Indeed, Mr. Sadler had served just four years in the Texas House when he and Senator Bill Ratliff took on an ambitious rewrite of the state’s education code. Mr. Sadler’s quick rise to head of the House Public Education Committee was widely attributed to a razor-sharp intelligence and data-driven focus.“What he said was taken as gospel truth both by Democrats and Republicans because he knew his subject matter so well,” said Representative Pete Gallego, Democrat of Alpine, who is now running for Congress.In his 1999 book “A Charge to Keep,” George W. Bush, who was then the governor, described Mr. Sadler as “a scrappy and fiercely independent trial lawyer, stubborn and known for an insistence on doing things his way.”The Legislature passed the Ratliff-Sadler Act, a landmark overhaul of Texas education policy, in 1995, Mr. Bush’s first year as governor. Mr. Bush signed the bill in Mr. Sadler’s hometown, Henderson, and praised his work.Amid a string of legislative victories, Mr. Sadler also gained a reputation for being biting and, at times, arrogant in dealings with those with whom he disagreed. That same sharpness is often on display on the campaign trail as he criticizes Mr. Cruz, though it immediately falls away when the subject turns to why he left the Legislature.One evening in 2001, Mr. Sadler was presiding over a committee hearing on teacher health insurance when he received word that his 10-year-old son, Sam, had been in a car accident. Mr. Sadler rushed to a Tyler hospital. Sam spent four days in a coma. A brain injury would necessitate years of physical, occupational and speech therapy.Later that year, Sam expressed interest in playing baseball again. Mr. Sadler took his son to their backyard and ventured a game of catch. His son could catch a ball coming toward his left or right. When Mr. Sadler softly tossed a ball over his son’s head, Sam let it pass by.“So I put a helmet on his head and every night we would toss the ball,” Mr. Sadler said.His son played baseball again and later took up golf, feats Mr. Sadler viewed as “an absolute miracle.” Sam is now a senior in the P.G.A. golf management program at Mississippi State University.Mr. Sadler was on the phone with Sam in 2010 as Congress passed the Affordable Care Act. Both of them had long worried that Sam’s brain injury would prevent him from securing health insurance once he got too old to be on his parents’ plan. The new law prevents health insurers from denying coverage because of pre-existing conditions.“We watched the vote together and he said, ‘Dad, I’ve got tears in my eyes. This is probably the most important day of my life,’ ” Mr. Sadler said. Mr. Cruz has called the law unconstitutional and has vowed to file legislation repealing “every syllable of Obamacare.”Those kinds of statements bring back the hard edge to Mr. Sadler’s voice, the same tone unlucky witnesses before the House Public Education Committee would hear as he tore apart their testimony.“These issues are so critical for us as a people, and they are so unbelievably misunderstood by my opponent and that portion of the Republican Party,” Mr. Sadler said. “They either don’t understand it, or they don’t care. I choose to believe they don’t understand it.”'"
"'12-09-16,'0','The scandal appears to have hit the men’s basketball team the hardest, with the senior captains Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry taking leaves of absences for the 2012-13 year, according to published reports. (Harvard will not discuss the reports, citing privacy laws.) The expectation is that they will be able to return for the 2013-14 year after a one-year “requirement to withdraw” penalty from the university.Matt Brown, a junior basketball player who is also a football wide receiver, was not among the more than 100 players in uniform Saturday. The Associated Press counted at least 105 players of the 119-man Harvard team.“We are not able to talk about the kids who aren’t here,” Harvard Coach Tim Murphy said. He said that Brown had not dressed for the game or been on the field. He said that all of the team’s starters were in good academic standing.“I know the question everyone wants to ask, and I’ll just answer it as best I can,” said Murphy, who is in his 19th season of coaching, having also been at Maine and Cincinnati.“You probably can’t get three more different schools than Maine, Cincinnati and Harvard,” he said. “I’ll say this: Harvard kids aren’t good kids; they’re great kids. But they don’t walk on water. And I think it’s important as parents and educators that we have to reinforce that crucial life lesson, that inappropriate behavior won’t be tolerated. Because down the road, later in life, those consequences can be terminal. They can cost you a marriage. They can cost you a career. But I’ve never seen greater character kids than we have here.”The senior running back Treavor Scales said the team was dealing with the effects of the scandal the same way it would if it lost an important player to injury. “Any adversity that comes your way, you put your head down, you bite down and you grind through it,” he said.Scales certainly did not appear to be affected; he rushed for 173 yards on 19 carries, including a clinching 66-yard touchdown with 1 minute 23 seconds to play. He also scored on a 1-yard run with 5:37 left, as Harvard outscored the visitors, 21-0, in the fourth quarter.“You deal with adversity,” Scales said. “It’s something you train for in the off-season. Distractions, adversity, whatever you want to call it, we power through it, and I’m proud of that.”In its 139 years of football, Harvard has had games against Amherst, the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery, the Coast Guard, Britannia and M.I.T. But the meeting with the Toreros (1-2) of the Pioneer League was a first for the Crimson. The teams did not exchange game film for scouting purposes.“We don’t know who they are,” San Diego Coach Ron Caragher had said of Harvard. “We don’t have any film of them.”He has plenty now, and he will have some idea of whom he is facing when the teams meet next year in San Diego. But even as he talked about the uncertainty of playing against the Harvard football team, Caragher seemed to understand something else was going on at one of the nation’s most prestigious universities.“We’ve been looking forward to the football game,” Caragher said, against what he called “a strong academic school like Harvard.”'"

"'12-09-16,'0','But Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, said at a news conference on Saturday that meeting that deadline “will not be possible.”German officials have warned that the proposals as currently drafted would strain the central bank’s resources and could create regulatory black holes.Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Schäuble criticized the plan for creating expectations that such a big change in regulation could be implemented so rapidly, according to two European Union officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussion among ministers was private.Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for financial services who drafted the plan, said at a separate news conference on Saturday that it was both “possible” and “necessary” to implement the plan by the start of next year.Any delays might be felt most directly in Spain, which is already reeling from a wave of street protests this weekend against belt-tightening reforms.The government in Madrid needs the banking rules in place before it can apply to recapitalize its banks directly from a new European bailout fund to avoid piling on more debt, which would increase its borrowing costs still further.“We need to stick to the timetable,” Spain’s economy minister, Luis de Guindos, told reporters on Saturday.The finance ministers were at loggerheads a day after top officials from the central bank and the International Monetary Fund warned European governments not to squander the current period of relative calm in markets by backsliding on promised reforms.Yet some ministers believe that a pledge by the central bank this month to buy short-term debt of vulnerable countries gave countries like Spain the relief they needed because borrowing costs had already fallen to more manageable levels.The Polish finance minister, Jacek Rostowski, said in an interview on Saturday that the European Union could now take more time to modify the banking proposals to preserve the interests of countries like Poland outside the euro area.“We should be grateful to Mario Draghi not only for taking the catastrophic risk off the table, but also giving us the time to get the banking union right,” Mr. Rostowski said, referring the president of the central bank.'"
"'12-09-16,'0','United States-China relations continue to surface as an issue on the campaign trail, particularly in battleground states like Ohio where manufacturing is a major force in the local economy. Now both President Obama and Mitt Romney are running television commercials that trade accusations over who is softer on China, and who is more to blame for sending American jobs there.The Romney campaign ad states: “Under Obama we’ve lost over half a million manufacturing jobs, and for the first time China is beating us. Seven times Obama could have stopped China’s cheating. Seven times he refused.” Then it cuts to Mr. Romney, who declares, “It’s time to stand up to the cheaters and make sure we protect jobs for the American people.”The Obama campaign ad, released a day after the Romney one first appeared, opens on an incredulous note. “Mitt Romney tough on China?” an announcer asks. “Romney’s companies were called pioneers in shipping U.S. manufacturing jobs overseas. He invested in firms that specialized in relocating jobs to low-wage countries like China. Even today part of Romney’s fortune is invested in China. Romney’s never stood up to China. All he’s done is send them our jobs.”Who is right? Mr. Romney’s first claim — that more than half a million manufacturing jobs have disappeared since Mr. Obama took office — is supported by data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show manufacturing employment at 12.5 million in January 2009 and put it at just under 12 million as of August, a net loss because of job cuts during the recession.However, what the ad does not say is that manufacturers have actually added several hundred thousand jobs since early 2010, a bright spot in an otherwise dull economy.'"
"'12-09-16,'0','The smart pick? That might be Denny Hamlin. He almost won the title in 2010 before being beaten by Johnson in a gut-wrenching final stretch that season. A more mature Hamlin has won four races this year, more than any other driver, and has the crew chief who won the 2011 title with Stewart, Darian Grubb.Hamlin enters the playoff in first place in the reset standings based on victories.“I think I handle the tough days better,” Hamlin said. “I don’t think that I let them bother me quite as much. I think that I handle adversity better on the racetrack during the race. Other than that, I don’t know. I think I have more confidence behind the wheel.“I had a lot of confidence then, but I know exactly what I need out of my racecar now. Darian does a good job of asking me the right questions, so it makes my job easier. I think that really we’re just experienced more all around — our whole race team is.”The most intriguing pick in this year’s Chase is Dale Earnhardt Jr., who is considered Nascar’s most popular driver. It has been eight years since he threatened to win a championship, a stretch in which Earnhardt switched teams, fell out of contention and was written off as a serious challenger by some.But Earnhardt ended a 143-race winless streak that dated to 2008 with a victory at Michigan in June. He has been one of the most consistent drivers this year with 17 top-10 finishes, tied with Johnson.Earnhardt also spent a few weeks at No. 1 in the standings for the first time since 2004.“Yeah, I think this is the best chance I have ever had,” he said. “I think even more than 2004.“I think we are a more complete team now where we run good at all the racetracks, the majority of the racetracks with this group we’ve got today. I feel like this is, again, there is no dominant figure in the group that stands out. That really builds our confidence that it’s there for the taking if we can put it together consistent weeks, week in and week out, win a couple of races, that we could be the champion, no question about it.”The Rodney Dangerfield pick would be Greg Biffle, the points leader for 14 weeks and regular-season champion, who was asked about Las Vegas odds that made him a 10-1 long shot to win the title.“We have been at the top of the points the whole time,” he said. “Maybe people just don’t expect us to continue to stay there for another 10 weeks.”Or maybe they remember last year, when the standings meant little and the ninth-place Stewart wrote himself off before winning his third title.“I didn’t have the confidence that was even feasible for our team,” Stewart said. “It just shows you can sit here today and feel confident and it not work, or you can be feeling like you’re going to run dead last and win five races. You just don’t know.”Given that, the safe and easy pick — with the facial hair most likely to win it, Gordon’s mustache notwithstanding — is Johnson, the bearded one who owned the Cup from 2006 to 2010.“It doesn’t mean that we are going to win the championship,” Johnson said, “but experience has meant so much to me in my career, and I’ve learned from my mistakes. I always put previous champions top of the list as a favorite to start off. With the five that we have and the core group that has been a part of all of that, that’s helpful.”'"
"'12-09-16,'0','The event was announced with much fanfare by Fordham, and CNN was considering broadcasting it, Father Martin said. But then the university announced that it was closed to the media, without any explanation. Three thousand students and faculty members filled the Rose Hill Gymnasium, stomping on the bleachers, doing the wave and chanting “Ste-PHEN” like the revved-up audiences for Mr. Colbert’s studio show.Some journalists were admitted as guests, and the cone of silence was shattered when many students and an editor from the Catholic magazine Commonweal sent out live posts on Twitter narrating the most memorable one-liners.Mr. Colbert shed his character for the evening and offered several sincere insights into how he manages to remain a faithful Catholic while making fun of his own religion and most others.“Are there flaws in the church?” Mr. Colbert said, “Absolutely. But is there great beauty in the church? Absolutely.”He said he did not make jokes about the sacraments, or put a picture of the crucifixion on screen. But he said he liked to poke fun at the use and misuse of religion, especially in politics. “Then I’m not talking about Christ,” he said, “I’m talking about Christ as cudgel.”Mr. Colbert is the youngest of 11 children, raised by Catholic parents who both attended Catholic colleges. His father and two of his brothers died in a plane crash when Mr. Colbert was 10. He said that after the funeral, in the limousine on the way home, one of his sisters made another sister laugh so hard that she fell on the floor. At that moment, Mr. Colbert said he resolved that he wanted to be able to make someone laugh that hard.He is raising his children as Catholics, and he teaches Sunday school at his parish in New Jersey. “The real reason I remain a Catholic is what the church gives me, which is love,” he said.Cardinal Dolan introduced Mr. Colbert’s wife, Evelyn, who was sitting in the audience, and brought her up to the stage. The cardinal put his arm around her and gave her a kiss on the cheek, and when Mr. Colbert feigned offense, the cardinal said, in a remark that brought down the house, “I can kiss your wife. You can’t kiss mine.”Mr. Colbert used his time onstage with the cardinal to air his complaints about the new English translation of the Mass, which was just introduced in American parishes this year.“Consubstantial!” Mr. Colbert exclaimed, using a particularly cumbersome word that is now recited in the Nicene Creed. “It’s the creed! It’s not the SAT prep.”The audience sent in questions by Twitter and e-mail, which Father Martin pitched to the two men. Among them: “I am considering the priesthood. Would it be prudent to avoid dating?”Cardinal Dolan responded that, on the contrary, “it’s good” to date, partly to discern whether the celibate life of a priest is what you want. Then he added, “By the way, let me give you the phone numbers of my nieces.”Mr. Colbert said, “It’s actually a great pickup line: I’m seriously considering the priesthood. You can change my mind.”Another question was even more pointed: “So many Christian leaders spread hatred, especially of homosexuals. How can you maintain your joy?”Cardinal Dolan responded with two meandering anecdotes — one about having met this week with Muslim leaders, and another about encountering demonstrators outside St. Patrick’s Cathedral.But Mr. Colbert’s response was quick and unequivocal. “If someone spreads hate,” he said, “then they’re not your religious leader.”'"
"'12-09-16,'0','PLATFORM iPhone and other Apple devices; requires iOS5 or laterIn a city where there are simply too many concerts to choose from, a new iPhone app lets people get quick previews of who is playing nearby.With Timbre, which came out this month, you enter your location and are presented with a simple list of band names, arranged in descending order of when they are playing. Click on a band’s name and the app plays a 30-second preview of its sound. If you like it, another click will send you to a Web site where you can buy tickets.Timbre is pulling music from iTunes, and the app will send users directly to the store to buy full songs if they want to hear more after a 30-second preview. But this also means that users cannot listen to bands that do not have songs for sale on iTunes; at the moment, that’s a fair number of bands. Future versions of Timbre will also connect to services like SoundCloud or Spotify to expand its reach, according to Mark Kasdorf, the founder of Intrepid Pursuits, which created the app. An Android version is due out before the end of the year.Of course, Timbre is hardly the first mobile app to try to help people find concerts to attend.The most interesting services offer personalized recommendations by looking at the type of music you like and suggesting local concerts. Apple announced last week that the next version of iTunes would give users information about coming concerts from artists in their libraries. Other services like Songkick and Bandsintown already do the same thing, while getting a fuller picture of users’ tastes by scanning their accounts on streaming services like Spotify and Pandora.Songkick and Bandsintown both have nice mobile apps. I am especially fond of Bandsintown’s “Concert Cloud,” which presents the bands it thinks you are interested in as little word bubbles. The more confident the app is that you will like a band, the bolder its name appears. A slider lets you decide whether you want to see only bands that are similar to what you already listen to, or whether you want to be more adventurous. While using these services on a phone is perfectly comfortable, it is best to set up accounts on a desktop, because it can get a little involved. The services can also be tripped up by privacy settings on the streaming accounts they are trying to access.Timbre is radically simple by comparison. Users do not have to create an account or link to their Facebook profiles. Then again, there is also no way to narrow a search by type of music, type of concert site or price. The only variables are location, and how far you are willing to travel.The decision to leave personalization out of Timbre was deliberate. After building an app with a lot of features, Intrepid Pursuits stripped most of them away. Mr. Kasdorf said he wanted to give people the opportunity to discover new bands, even if nothing in their past listening experience indicated they might like them.'"
"'12-09-16,'0','But culture and nationality also play a role. American and Middle Eastern women tend to ask for masseuses, while Europeans often don’t care either way, said Sandra Sadowski, the spa director at the Ritz-Carlton in New York, which has a large international clientele.Certain religions also dictate whether a client picks a male or female therapist. The concept of negiah, practiced by Orthodox Jews, restricts physical contact between those of opposite genders who are not related by blood or marriage. Islam also forbids a man to touch a woman who is not in his family, even with a barrier.But in most cases, massage therapists say, clients choose a masseuse because of their own comfort level and biases.Even women who see themselves as open-minded prefer a woman to give them a massage. Bettina Barrow, 31, a recent U.C.L.A. Law School graduate, believed she had no preference, until one experience changed her mind.“I had a massage from a really good-looking therapist,” said Ms. Barrow, recalling an experience in Los Angeles. Being with a man made her nervous. “With a woman, I don’t think about it as much and I’m able to relax,” she added.Robin Duffy, a massage therapist with private practices in North Carolina and New York, points to another reason that women prefer a female therapist. Many of her clients, she said, treat their visit like a chat session among gal pals. “It’s actually their way of relaxing: telling you all of these intimate details of their lives,” she said.Men seem to prefer female therapists for different reasons. Some don’t want another man massaging their bodies, because it brings up uncomfortable associations with being gay. Ken Morris, spa director at the Canyon Ranch Spa in Tucson, Ariz., said that American men have very little physical contact with other men, apart from handshakes in a business setting or contact sports. “When do men physically touch each other?” he asked rhetorically.But there are some instances where both women and men request a male therapist. The most commonly cited reason is that masseurs are stronger and can deliver a deeper massage.Whether that’s true is up for debate. Ben Brown, a massage therapist at a Bliss Spa in New York, said this is a misconception. “Really good massage is about leverage,” he said. “You don’t have to be a male or female. You just have to be good and know how to use your body.”But Jay Anthony, a guest services counselor at the Ashram retreat in Calabasas, Calif., said he had seen guests gravitate toward male therapists over the course of their stay. “Many men will only wish to have a gentle, nurturing female therapist,” he said. “But by the end of the week, they want the strongest possible male therapists that can get into their muscles as deep as possible.”Some women ask for male therapists because they feel competitive around other women. “They want to avoid the judgment they might feel from another woman,” said Mr. Ellsworth, the New York masseur. Other times, he added, “they want the attention of someone who might find them attractive.”Then there is a more embarrassing reason for preferring a male therapist. For heterosexual men, having a guy give the massage may lessen the chances of becoming aroused, Mr. Ellsworth said. “If you’re not sexually attracted to the person, that is less likely to happen,” he added.Not everyone agrees. George Powell-Lopez, general manager of the Red Door Spas Elizabeth Arden in New York, said that arousal during a massage is common, and sometimes has little to do with sexual attraction. “We’re moving blood around very quickly, and this happens sometimes,” he said.When it does, therapists rely on their training. The first step is usually to ignore it. If that fails, they may redirect the massage to a neutral part of the body. And if the therapist senses that the session has taken on an inappropriate sexual tone, they may gently remind the client of the boundaries, saying, “This is not that type of massage.”Therapists can just as easily end the massage, and report the situation to the spa manager or security. Cases of appointments being terminated are few, said Ms. Sadowski of the Ritz-Carlton, adding, “If the therapist is uncomfortable at any moment, they can simply leave the room.”“You don’t want to lose a massage client for the rest of their life because they were embarrassed,” Mr. Powell-Lopez said.The question of masseuse or masseur seems to matter less over time. Experienced spa-goers say they care less and less with each visit.When Allan Share, president of the Day Spa Association, gets a massage, he said, he simply asks for the best therapist available. “I always get a chuckle from the receptionist like, ‘Oh, someone who gets it,’ ” he said.'"
"'12-09-16,'0','That can be an odd situation. The agent must advocate for both the seller and the buyer without benefiting one party over the other, said Neil Garfinkel, legal counsel for the and a partner at the law firm Abrams, Garfinkel, Margolis, Bergson. If, for example, the seller is getting divorced and needs to sell quickly, the agent cannot disclose that information to the buyer even though it could work to the buyer’s advantage, he said. Some brokers have noted that in such circumstances, neither the seller nor the buyer really has the full allegiance of the broker.Exclusive agreements can have exceptions, Mr. Garfinkel said. If someone has expressed interest in an apartment before an agent comes on board, the seller can exclude that person from the exclusive agreement. This means that if that person buys within an agreed-upon period of time, the seller either does not have to pay a commission or the commission is reduced.In addition, if the home has not sold at the end of an exclusive period and the seller chooses a new firm, the first agent can submit a list of up to six people who expressed interest in the property during the time of the exclusive. If anyone on the list signs a contract on the apartment within a given period of time — usually about 90 days — then the first broker gets the commission. If a seller decides to use the new agent for the deal, he or she may have to pay commissions to both brokers.Exclusive agreements usually last for six months, but they can be extended. Since New York City apartments take an average of about five months to sell, this is generally not an issue.When drafting a contract, some buyers ask for a detailed marketing plan. Harold Kobner, an agent with Argo Real Estate in Manhattan, said that his contracts state that he will produce floor plans, hire professional photographers and list where the home will be advertised. “Whatever I tell the person I will do, I put it in my exclusive,” he said.A commission of 6 percent of the purchase price is standard, but sellers can also try to negotiate a lower amount. With the market bouncing back, brokers these days are less likely to compromise, said Eric Benaim, chief executive of Modern Spaces, which focuses on Long Island City. One strategy is to offer to pay 6 percent if the buyer has his or her own broker. But if the buyer is unrepresented, the seller can offer to pay 5 percent to the exclusive broker who acts as a dual agent, said David Maundrell, the president of the firm .Because these relationships can be difficult to get out of, it is important to choose a broker carefully. Micki Lazar says she learned this lesson the hard way. At the beginning of 2010, Ms. Lazar and her husband decided to sell her Greenwich Village studio apartment. They wanted to sell quickly because Ms. Lazar was expecting her first child. She chose an agent with the Corcoran Group because she felt that the well-known firm’s highly trafficked Web site would increase her chances of a speedy sale.But problems ensued. Ms. Lazar said the agent, Beau Nova, promised to hold midweek open houses but held only one, and was late for another, leaving Ms. Lazar to greet prospective buyers. She said buyers who saw that she was pregnant were tipped off that she needed to sell quickly. Ms. Lazar said Mr. Nova pushed her to accept a low offer and to lower her $400,000 asking price. “He was fighting me about the price, the open houses; we just argued and I wanted out,” she said.Corcoran let Ms. Lazar out of her agreement two months early. Mr. Nova sent an exclusion list to Ms. Lazar’s new agent and shortly afterward one of the buyers on the list made an offer. Because of her history with her previous agent and because the buyer was also represented by a Corcoran agent, Ms. Lazar said she wanted her new broker, who was from a different agency, to represent her. Ms. Lazar could have been liable for a 12 percent commission — 6 percent to each broker. But the new broker cut his commission in half and after some negotiation Corcoran agreed to accept 4 percent, meaning Ms. Lazar wound up paying a 7 percent commission. The apartment sold for $380,000.In a written statement Corcoran said that Mr. Nova “vehemently” disagreed with Ms. Lazar’s recollection of events and added that, after researching the matter, the agency believed that “our agent acted ethically, professionally and appropriate to the situation, and that the seller was treated fairly.”When looking for an agent, Mr. Benaim suggested considering those who have already sold properties in the building, as they are likely to be familiar with the board and neighborhood. An agent with experience selling the same kind of apartment is also important, Mr. Maundrell said. “If I sell $3 million properties to celebrities, your $750,000 condo might not get as much attention,” he said.Finally, sellers should also ask how close to the asking price the broker’s previous listings have sold for, to gauge how realistic their pricing strategy is. “Any broker can give you an inflated estimate of your apartment’s value to make you feel good,” said Emily Lundell, a vice president at Corcoran.'"
"'12-09-16,'0','But not even Mr. Bennett can protect her from what is to come. Sugar’s mother has fallen behind on the mortgage payments, and her father has gambled away what little equity they had.Amid this tumult, a neighborhood girl shoves a puppy into Sugar’s arms and urges her to take him or else the girl’s father, who abuses the dog, will dump him at a shelter. Thus begins Sugar’s descent into homelessness, with the emotionally damaged dog, Shush, at her side. Their journey takes them into shelters and parks, group homes and foster care, alongside her mother, who descends into deep depression and involuntary commitment.The central questions that will keep readers turning the pages of this searing story are: Will the broken Sugar find her way home, in both the physical and metaphorical sense, and will she heal and become whole again?In “Buddy,” 12-year-old Tyrone, known as Li’l T, will grapple with similar questions, though the upheaval in his life is caused not by dysfunctional parents but by the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Li’l T lives in a strict but loving home in New Orleans. He desperately wants a puppy, but his parents cannot afford one. Then one Sunday as the family drives to church, a stray dog darts in front of their car and is struck. The boy nurses him back to health, and the two become inseparable.But when Katrina arrives, the family has no choice except to leave Buddy behind as they flee the city. Days turn into weeks and months, yet Li’l T never stops hoping or searching for his canine friend. He learns Buddy was rescued from the flooded home after the storm, but has no clue as to the dog’s whereabouts.What makes “Buddy” memorable is not just the tale of a boy’s fierce love for his dog but its harrowing portrayal of one of this nation’s most traumatic natural disasters. From start to finish, “Buddy” is a testament to the human capacity to endure, to find hope in the sodden ruins of destroyed lives. There is tragedy here — death and displacement and depression, and readers will push forward not just to learn if and how the boy and his dog reunite but also if and how the family will survive.“The Dogs of Winter” is the least sophisticated of the three books, suffering from stilted dialogue and two-dimensional characters. But the story, inspired by news accounts, still packs plenty of punch. Parents should be warned that the subject matter is harsh. Five-year-old Ivan’s mother is beaten to death by her alcoholic lover while the boy huddles in a closet. Ivan then finds himself on the streets, coatless (and eventually shoeless) in subzero temperatures, fending off thugs, addicts and predators of every stripe. He cannot trust the police or social workers, who simply want to eradicate the problem of street urchins. His only allies are the feral dogs that adopt him and, time and again, rush to his defense.At every turn, Ivan learns the same hard lesson: Human beings will hurt you. Only dogs can be trusted. Of course, the reader knows that the “love” of a dog isn’t enough. Children need the love of parents and siblings and friends. The real question hanging over this dark story is whether the young dog boy will find that love and trust in the end.'"

Unemployment, in particular, has been shown to be one of the worst things possible for mental health and happiness, on par with serious illness or death of a family member. Just because the men portrayed are white guys from a Republican part of the country doesn’t mean people should be so indifferent to their suffering. MATTHEW T. MITCHELL, Sacramento, posted on nytimes.comFor nearly 30 years, I worked as a mechanic in various heavy industries. About 10 years ago, I quit my job servicing locomotives on the Norfolk Southern Railway, got an undergraduate degree and a paralegal certificate and haven’t been out of work for more than a month or two since. At least half the supervising attorneys I’ve worked for are women, and I’ve never given it a second’s thought. The work I used to do and the men I worked with for much of my adult life were a whole lot more “macho” than any of the three men profiled in Hanna Rosin’s piece. One of her subjects, who ran an industrial floor-cleaning business, maintained that “a man needs a strong, macho job.” All I can say is, good luck with that job search, buddy. GLENN BALDWIN, Oakland, Calif.Yes, manufacturing jobs are changing, and those used to be part of men’s ability to succeed as the economic providers for a family — a role often chosen by men because of societal pressures or because they enjoyed having that be a part of their identity. But I don’t think this is the alternative: “As the usual path to the middle class disappears, what’s emerging in its place is a nascent middle-class matriarchy, in which women like Patsy pay the mortgage and the cable bills while the men try to find their place.” . . . Gender is not a zero-sum game. Men do not need to be demasculinized every time a woman takes a step forward.

Despite the work by fact-checking organizations, reporters often quote obvious lies and distortions by both sides in their “he said, she said” reporting. Why do journalists choose to highlight these distortions by repeating them? Why spend so much time reporting on candidates’ obvious gaffes, which any human being is bound to commit from time to time, rather than attempting to represent fairly and accurately the real policy positions candidates are attempting to communicate?

They think I’m ; they’re surprised that I smoke. I’ve promised myself I’ll quit for my 52nd birthday.Acting seems like the last profession in which smoking is considered socially acceptable. Yes, a surprising amount of actors smoke. Female actors in particular.Because it suppresses your appetite? It’s even sicker than that. It’s a friendship thing, a companionship thing. An actor’s life is fairly lonely. There might well be more working female actors who live single lives, and that exacerbates the loneliness of being an actor. For me, a lot of it is the companionship of your little friends in a box. It’s reliable.Why do you think male actors are more often in relationships? Because 80 percent of female actors are pretty strong, powerful women, and that’s a very hard relationship for men to have. Even today, in 2012, the guy is supposed to be in charge. I see it in every heterosexual relationship I know, the acquiescence of the female.

"'12-09-16,'0','The most important point, he and other industry experts say, is that consumers re-establish their credit and show that they can manage it responsibly. They can do this by paying rent and utility bills on time, or perhaps by obtaining a secured credit card, according to Mr. Walsh.If a bankruptcy filing was the result of a one-time occurrence, like the death of a spouse, divorce or illness, the waiting period to apply for a mortgage may be reduced. Lenders will often want borrowers to write a hardship letter explaining their situation, backed by documentation like hospital bills or a court-approved divorce settlement.  If the person has paid back 85 to 95 percent of his debts during the bankruptcy process, he will need to mention that in the letter as well, said Bruce Feinstein, a bankruptcy lawyer in Richmond Hill, Queens.But examples of shortening the waiting period through hardship letters are “few and far between, and tough to get,” Mr. Walsh said.Mr. Feinstein says he has seen a few clients qualify for a mortgage only two years after filing for Chapter 7, though generally borrowers can obtain a loan quicker after a Chapter 13 reorganization, because of the partial repayment of debts, he said.As Mr. Walsh noted, “Chapter 13 is a little more responsible” way to go from the lenders’ perspective, so lender guidelines are a bit more lenient.Almost 70 percent of personal bankruptcies are filed under Chapter 7, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, a research organization. The institute data noted that last year there were 1.362 million personal bankruptcy filings nationwide, down from 1.53 million in 2010, and closer to the norm over the last 15 years. At the end of the first quarter of this year there were 311,975 filings, which is 5 percent less than the first quarter of 2011.Rebuilding credit after a personal bankruptcy will take some work. Mr. Feinstein suggests that individuals maintain or take out one or two credit cards and routinely use them. “If the payment’s due on the first, make sure it’s paid by the 25th” of the previous month, he said.A personal bankruptcy filing will have a larger impact on a credit score than any other credit issue, according to a July report by VantageScore, which provides credit scores to lenders. Filing for bankruptcy protection will reduce a credit score by 200 to 350 or more points, it said, compared with a decline of 80 to 170 points for a foreclosure.

"'12-09-17,'0','But Ms. Figes was far too independent-minded and acerbic to stay with any movement for long. She could even be dismissive of her sisters-in-arms. “I have never read ‘The Female Eunuch,’ ” she told the British newspaper The Guardian in 1993.   “It came out after my book and everyone said, ‘Don’t bother,’ so I didn’t. I think Germaine is mad and a lot of what she says is romantic hot air.”Instead, she went back to writing novels. She wrote more than a dozen and became loosely associated with a British experimental movement led by B. S. Johnson. “Virginia Woolf and Kafka were the huge influences she looked back to,” Orlando Figes, a historian and author, said.Much of Ms. Figes’s fiction was concerned with the passage of time. “Waking” (1981) tells one woman’s story through her awakening from sleep over seven days throughout her life. “Light” (1983) is about a day in the life of Monet.She also often incorporated didactic passages on the oppression of women that critics disliked, even while they praised the books.   “It is Ms. Figes’s insistence on hammering home a message that weakens an otherwise ambitious, innovative and stunningly poetic work,” Angeline Goreau wrote in a review in The New York Times of “The Seven Ages” (1987), a novel in which seven voices intrude on the solitary life of a midwife.In her last decade Ms. Figes focused on memoir writing, seeming intent on coming to terms with her traumatic youth.Eva Unger was born in Berlin on April 13, 1932, to Peter and Irma Unger. She recalled her childhood as golden years, shielded at first from the growing Nazi menace by an affluent Jewish household. She remembered learning to cook and sew after school at her grandmother’s.  This Eden was shattered when her father, a zipper wholesaler, was arrested along with thousands of others during the violence of Kristallnacht in 1938 and sent to the Dachau concentration camp.Peter Unger managed to escape Dachau, and the family fled to England in 1939, but to 7-year-old Eva, it did not feel like safety. She was teased at school. Her grandparents and family servant were left behind and she realized their fate only when her mother sent her to the movies alone at the end of the war to watch newsreels about the concentration camps. She never recovered from the shock of those lonely moments in the dark, she said.Ms. Figes’s sense of herself as an outsider waned as she mastered English and began to excel as a writer. She received a bachelor’s degree in English from Queen Mary College in London in 1953. Two years later — to get away from her parents, she said — she married John Figes, who ran a job-recruitment agency. The marriage ended seven years later.She returned to the war — or, she said, it returned to her — when she became a grandmother and found herself thinking back on those years in Germany and the pain of being wrenched away, a theme she revisited in the memoir “Tales of Innocence and Experience: An Exploration.” In a Times review in 2003, Barbara Ehrenreich described that book as “a story of the Holocaust, related with such a fine, poetic delicacy that no summary can do it justice.”Although Ms. Figes had many relationships after her divorce, including one with the writer Günter Grass, whose work she championed in England and who came to live with her family after one of his own marriages dissolved, she mostly lived alone.Besides her son she is survived by a daughter, Kate, a brother, Ernest, and four grandchildren.“My mother was an isolated and intellectual person,” Orlando Figes said. “She was so driven by writing, it was quite limiting. She lived on her own, so everything she wrote came from within herself. In the last year, as she was contemplating death, she even saw that as writing material.”'"
"'12-09-17,'0','The material, called extracellular matrix, is the natural scaffolding that underlies all tissues and organs, in people as well as animals. It is produced by cells, and for years scientists thought that its main role was to hold them in their proper position.But researchers now know that this scaffolding also signals the body to grow and repair those tissues and organs. Armed with that knowledge, the new body builders are using this material from pigs and other animals to engineer the growth of replacement tissue in humans.The technique used on Sergeant Strang, though still in development, holds particular promise for some of the thousands of veterans of the and Afghanistan wars who have been maimed by explosives and have lost so much muscle from an arm or a leg that amputation is sometimes the best alternative.Sergeant Strang’s is one of the first cases in what will eventually be an 80-patient trial to grow limb muscle. It is financed by the Defense Department’s Office of Technology Transition, but it will include civilians as well.Dr. Peter Rubin, a plastic surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who is a leader of the study, said that early results with Sergeant Strang and a handful of other patients showed that the animal scaffolding was spurring muscle growth. “We are seeing evidence of remodeling of tissues,” he said.Last fall, Dr. Rubin cut out the tissue from Sergeant Strang’s leg and stitched a sheet resembling a thick piece of parchment paper — extracellular matrix from a pig urinary bladder, which had shown excellent results in lab studies — into the remaining healthy thigh muscle.His body immediately started breaking down the matrix, which consists largely of collagen and other proteins. But the doctors expected, and wanted, that to happen — by degrading into smaller compounds, the matrix started the signaling process, recruiting to come to the site where they could become muscle cells.“We’re trying to work with nature rather than fight nature,” said another leader of the study, Dr. Stephen Badylak, deputy director of the McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine at the university.Dr. Badylak is a pioneer in the use of extracellular matrix, having discovered many of its properties more than two decades ago while performing biomedical engineering research at . As part of his work on a mechanical heart device, he was looking for a way to move blood from one part of the body to another but wanted to avoid synthetic materials, which can cause blood clots.“I thought, what looks like a tube?” he recalled. “A piece of intestine.” So using a research dog named Rocky, he replaced its main artery near its heart with a section of its small intestine. (“I’d have a tough time getting that experiment approved today,” Dr. Badylak said.)When he arrived at work the next morning, he was expecting all sorts of problems. “But Rocky is standing up in his cage, wanting breakfast and wagging his tail,” Dr. Badylak said. “I thought, well, this is pretty cool.”Later experiments showed that over time the tube had lost the internal cells that are specific to intestines and gained cells specific to blood vessels. “It had morphed into a blood-vessel-like structure, which we thought was incredible,” he said. “Eventually we figured out that it was not the whole intestine but just the extracellular matrix that was responsible.”Extracellular matrix from pigs, sheep and other animals has been used in the past decade as a reinforcing layer to help repair rotator cuff damage, and other injuries. “Surgeons think of them as meshes that hold things together,” Dr. Badylak said. Most of them do not understand the matrix’s role in signaling and repair. “They don’t get it,” he said. “We didn’t either at first.”The scaffolding is isolated by stripping out all of the living cells from a tissue or organ, leaving an intricate three-dimensional web of proteins and other compounds. Removing the cells eliminates the possibility that the material, of animal origin, will be rejected outright by the body when it is implanted. But the matrix does provoke a less intense , Dr. Badylak said, which is necessary for it to work. “You actually need the immune system to recognize the material.”“The body can say, ‘This is not me,’ but the signals that are there are actually telling me that I need to rebuild that tissue,” he added.The matrix has to be in contact with healthy tissue, which is why scar tissue must be removed first. “If it’s put in the middle of a scar, it doesn’t remodel because it’s not exposed to the bloodstream and sources of cells,” Dr. Badylak said.Stitching it directly to the muscle also ensures that it will be stretched when the muscle is activated, beginning the day after surgery, when patients start an intensive program of . Putting a mechanical load on the matrix tells the body, in effect, that this should become muscle and not some other kind of tissue.Sergeant Strang was skeptical when he first signed up for the trial and cleared all the physical hurdles to qualify for it — among other things, patients must have some muscle remaining and enough undamaged nerves so the muscle can work. But at that point he was willing to try anything to be able to walk normally again.Ten soldiers, American and Afghan, were wounded on the road in Helmand Province that Easter Sunday, Sergeant Strang the most severely. He was given 42 units of blood, airlifted to and then treated for a month at in Bethesda, Md.Sergeant Strang returned to his home outside Pittsburgh, where he underwent outpatient physical therapy for months. When he walked he favored his right leg, which caused pain in his knees, back, hip and neck. “Everything was torqued to the side,” he said.When the doctors told him what they planned to do, “I kind of didn’t believe it at first,” Sergeant Strang said. “It strikes you as science fiction stuff when they explain it to you.”Dr. Badylak said it was important not to set unrealistic expectations.“We tell them, this isn’t magic. It’s not a miracle,” he said. “We’re not going to restore your 100 percent normal anatomy. But we think we’re going to be able to make a difference for you. You’ll be able to do things you can’t do now.”There is still a big divot in Sergeant Strang’s leg, graphically illustrating how just a little new muscle tissue can make a difference.“It was amazing,” he said. “Right off the bat I could do a full stride, I could bend my knee, kick it out a little bit, just enough to get that initial spring where gravity would take it the rest of the way.” Two weeks later he was out in the woods hunting with friends.Some of the initial improvement may be from the mechanical connection between the matrix and the existing muscle, the doctors said. But as the matrix has degraded, Sergeant Strang has continued to improve, although there are signs that his progress is slowing down.The improvement had a psychological effect, too, Sergeant Strang said. Before, if he went to a busy restaurant or other crowded place, he would spend time planning where to sit, because he knew he would not be able to move quickly in the event of danger. “It was always in the back of my mind,” he said.But now, he said, “I don’t have to sit by the door.”'"

Mr. Mohamud acknowledged the difficulties, saying in his inauguration remarks that security was the nation’s paramount issue. He promised to be an advocate for democracy and to create “an effective justice system” that serves all Somalis.He also said that his government would “deliver a new democratic beginning.” His predecessor, Mr. Ahmed, said in his remarks that he was happy that a degree of security had returned to Mogadishu. He wished Mr. Mohamud success.The political process that resulted in Mr. Mohamud’s election, backed by the United Nations, was condemned by Islamist militants, who said it was manipulated by the West. But Mr. Mohamud has broad international support to try to bring stability to his troubled nation.The inauguration was attended by regional leaders, including the prime minister of Ethiopia and the president of Djibouti.'"

"'12-09-17,'0','As she did last week, Creamer missed a few clutch putts, but she was not complaining. “It’s a great way to finish, she said, adding: “I have to continue moving forward with everything that I’m doing, because I feel really good about where I’m at. It’s just a couple things here and there.”Lydia Ko, 15, one of nine players under par at the start of the day, posted scores of 76 and 78 to finish as the low amateur at nine over. “I’m happy to be the leading amateur,” said Ko, a South Korean-born New Zealander, who was tied for 17th in a group that included the 17-year-old American Lexi Thompson, who equaled Creamer’s 72 after a third-round 76.Ko and Thompson finished one stroke ahead of Juli Inkster, the oldest player in the field at 52, who posted scores of 72-78. Inkster called the conditions brutal — among the worst she had faced in 30 years as a pro.“We started off and it was hot,” she said. “Then it was windy. Then it was cold. And then it was rainy. And then it was pouring. And then it came back to raining, and then it was just windy.”Shin, the 2008 champion at Sunningdale, began her second 18 on Sunday with a triple-bogey 7 at the 392-yard first hole, which yielded one birdie in the final round and averaged 4.8 strokes. She hit a driver into the right rough, a 3-wood into the left rough and a 7-iron to the front of the green. After chipping to 20 feet, Shin three-putted. “I hit a lot of shots,” she said, laughing. “Makes it more of a challenge.”Webb, playing in the group directly ahead of Shin, started even worse, playing the first three holes in four over on her way to an 82 and a fifth-place tie with So Yeon Ryu. Webb, a seven-time major winner, was among a dozen golfers in the field of 57 who failed to break 80 in the fourth round.“Today was worst conditions I think I’ve ever played, yeah,” Shin said. “But it was really fun, because every hole, how can I say, was a challenge.”By the time Shin made the turn in two-over 37, the only remaining obstacle in her path was Mother Nature. The wind picked up, and then came heavy rain. After tapping in for par on the ninth hole, Shin took the umbrella from her caddie and spent the next several seconds struggling in vain to keep it from turning inside out.It was a day better suited for Mary Poppins than the world’s best women golfers, who averaged 77.7 strokes in the final round. By midafternoon, it had become difficult to discern where the Wirral mud flats ended and Royal Liverpool began.“It was like we were standing under a shower,” Creamer said.Carts got stuck in muck just yards off the fairways, and Shin was stuck on the 12th tee for eight minutes when play was briefly suspended because balls were moving on the No. 5 green.On the 72nd hole, Shin made a 3-footer for par, and got soaked. Not by rain, this time, but by a bottled-water spray from her friend Ryu. “I can’t believe I get this again,” Shin said. “Finally, and also I’m happy to finish today because in my head I think about Monday play again.”She added: “It was really, really tough and long day. It was work.”'"

"'12-09-18,'1','The report will state that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority faces “serious risks,” including an inability to make essential payments, like salaries, with all the implications that has for stability. The authority employs about 180,000 Palestinians, among them the security forces. Those employees, in turn, support relatives estimated to include about a quarter of the population of the Palestinian territories, including the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas. In June, July and August, the authority was unable to pay its employees their full salaries on time.Over the last two years the West Bank has experienced an economic slowdown, with real G.D.P. growth declining to about 5 percent from an annual average rate of 9 percent in 2008-2010, the study found. Unemployment has reached 19 percent in the West Bank and as much as 30 percent in Gaza. The authority’s severe financing difficulties over the past 20 months have led to a substantial rise in domestic payment arrears and debt to commercial banks.Although the authority has reduced its reliance on international aid after economic reforms — to $1.1 billion in 2010 from $1.8 billion in 2008 — the amount received since then has not been sufficient to fulfill requirements. Much of the shortfall is due to a drop in aid from Arab countries, according to officials. In both 2008 and 2009, Arab donors disbursed $500 million, but in 2011 and so far in 2012, the amount dropped to more like $200 million.The Palestinian Authority is already reeling under the pressure. Shaken by days of popular protests over fuel price increases and the rising cost of living, the government hastily backtracked this week on some of the austerity measures it had taken, like a raise in taxes.Much of the anger has been directed against Salam Fayyad, the prime minister of the authority.“We are doing the best we can, and we have been all along,” Mr. Fayyad said after announcing the steps aimed at calming the protests.Some Palestinians in the West Bank have called for a review of the Oslo Accords and changes to its economc annex. Critics argue that the accords allow Israel to continue its occupation of areas captured in the 1967 Middle East war while divesting itself of responsibility for the welfare of the population.There is always concern in Israel that discontent with the Palestinian Authority can easily be channeled against Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu instructed the Israeli treasury last week to advance to the Palestinians 250 million shekels, or more than $60 million, in the monthly tax clearance that Israel collects on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.An Israeli official said that some of the road blocks and other restrictions cited by the I.M.F. as undermining the economy were essential to address Israel’s security concerns. The official said Israel had removed many of the roadblocks and other obstacles in the West Bank that were introduced after the violent Palestinian uprising broke out in 2000, and under international pressure, it significantly eased import restrictions on consumer goods from Israel to Gaza. The Israeli official also hinted at bad Palestinian management.But Mr. Kanaan argued that more could be done, and that what was needed was to restart peace negotiations between the parties that would lead to a fundamental change in the Israeli-Palestinian economic relationship. For example, he said, allowing the operation of an airport in the West Bank or a seaport in Gaza would give Palestinians easier access to outside markets.Crucially, he added, Palestinian economic activity and investment should be allowed in Area C, the portion of the West Bank where Israel retains full civil and military control under the Oslo Accords and which covers 60 percent of the West Bank territory.Any Palestinian economic initiatives there have to be coordinated with Israel; the Palestinians say that permission is rarely given.One area of particular contention is the Jordan Valley, the fertile strip of West Bank land along the border with Jordan, where Israel says it must retain a presence for strategic reasons under any future statehood agreement with the Palestinians.The Palestinians say the valley holds great potential for agriculture and agro-industry projects, but large swathes of land there have been declared Israeli military zones off-limits to the Palestinians and other parts are designated for use by the Jewish settlements in the area. Palestinian access to the area’s water resources is also severely limited.The Palestinian government complained in late August that the Israeli authorities had issued orders to a number of Palestinian farmers in the Jordan Valley to uproot some 900 acres of date palms that they had planted east of Jericho. The Palestinians said the date palms were planted on lands they had rented from the Waqf, or Islamic trust.The office of the Israeli authority that liaises with the Palestinians on such issues said that there had been a “phenomenon of illegal palm plantings” in the area on lands where ownership discussions had not yet been finalized, and that this date palm plantation had relied mostly on water from pirate drilling or unauthorized connections to Israeli-controlled water sources.'"
"'12-09-18,'1','By comparison, according to the fly-or-drive calculator, driving would have taken about eight hours, not including pit stops. The total cost for the 489-mile trip by automobile, which was calculated based on the make and model of my car at 32 miles a gallon, would have been $170.27. And the carbon dioxide impact was estimated to be 821 pounds for flying and 741 for driving.Incidentally, at no point in that trip by air did I feel actually relaxed and in control of my destiny until I was in the red Mustang, merging with traffic on the 405 down to Long Beach.Which brings me to Ginger Strand, who happened to be traveling up Highway 101 near San Francisco when I spoke to her the other day about the lure and lore of the open road. Ms. Strand — on her cellphone while her sister drove — is the author of a well-received new book about America’s long affair with the highway, “Killer on the Road: Violence and the American Interstate.”In the book, Ms. Strand cleverly weaves the history, politics, psychology and geography of the Interstate System, and threads her fabric with stark reporting on how the mobility, alienation and anonymity of the open road have bred a new kind of violent crime.I’m not sure I fully subscribe to her thesis about the implicit relationship between the Interstates and the long history of serial killers who have haunted them since the system began in the 1950s. But it made for a very good read. And a lot of driving of those roads for Ms. Strand when she researched it.“I drive a lot, rather than flying. I have this compulsion to go, so I actually drove to all the places where the serial killings I wrote about happened,” she said. “I just drove across the country again, the whole way, and I was like, ‘Oh yeah, there’s a serial-killer truck stop; there’s the exit ramp where so-and-so was killed.’ It definitely changes your view of the landscape.”O.K., I thought. There’s a perspective on flying versus driving that I didn’t have until now. Maybe that long slog through the airport security lines isn’t so onerous after all.Ms. Strand went on: “There’s an understanding of the Interstate that you only get from being on it for very long periods of time. You’re so trapped in your own head. It’s like the car becomes your brain.”I was thinking about that speeding down the 405 late the other night, to the point where I almost missed the exit for Long Beach as a big truck barreled up menacingly on my bumper. In her book, Ms. Strand has a lot to say about some truckers, some truck stops and violent crime. “At least 25 former truckers are currently serving time in American prisons for serial murder,” she writes darkly.On the 405, I resisted the impulse to give the trucker a rude hand signal as he thundered past me. Instead, I thought of Ms. Strand’s happier assessments of the enticement of the open road.“I grew up the daughter of an airline pilot,” she said. “We never took road trips. We’d fly if we had to go from like Michigan to Chicago. So I think that might be part of the appeal of a road trip to me. It always seems exotic and interesting, especially when you slow down and look at what’s in between.”'"
"'12-09-18,'1','I’VE loved flying since I was a kid. The whole feel of it is just magical.Because of my love of flying, I actually wound up working as a market analyst in the airline industry. That insider knowledge helped me develop my pet transport company, PetsJets. Basically, I fly commercial with someone’s pet when they can’t or don’t want to do it.But I have to say a lot of the credit for my company goes to my dog, Jackson. Several years ago, I was coming out of a bakery and I noticed a skinny, starving black Lab. He was begging for food. I wound up bringing him home and then taking him to the vet. He was in pretty bad shape, but the nicest, sweetest animal.Anyway, about a month later I was at an A.T.M. around midnight, and I had Jackson in the car with me. A young guy came up to me with a gun. The A.T.M. wasn’t working, so I told the guy I had some money in the car. I opened my car door and Jackson got out and started acting like a police dog, barking and rushing the guy.I was freaked out that the guy was going to shoot my dog, but instead he ran off and jumped into a waiting car. I think the dog saved my life. After Jackson died four years ago, I decided I really wanted to combine my love of animals with my love of flying.I usually have the security screenings narrowed down to perfection. I insist on a private screening room. That way, when the pets are checked, we’re in a closed environment and they can’t escape.I’ve found the agents are much nicer to me when I’m flying with a pet. I’ve traveled to Paris several times with pets and have spent hours in advance making sure I have the correct paperwork. Yet, I’ve never been asked for a thing. The French agents just smile, and I swear the pets just smile back.'"
"'12-09-18,'1','As a science writer, I knew hantavirus could be swiftly lethal. The virus and the disease it causes, called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first discovered in 1993, when a terrifying outbreak began to unfold in the Four Corners area of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona. One of the first cases was a healthy 19-year-old man who was a marathon runner. A day after coming down with flulike symptoms, he went to an emergency room. Three days later he was dead. Medical detectives soon discovered that the man’s fiancée had died days earlier, also from a runaway respiratory infection.Researchers have since learned that deer mice transmit the virus in their droppings, urine and saliva. People become infected when they inhale particles contaminated with the virus. The first symptoms are varied — fatigue, fever, chills and muscle ache — but the infection can progress within 10 days to coughing, nausea, respiratory difficulty and death.During the Four Corners outbreak, hantavirus killed about half of the people it sickened — an exceptionally high fatality rate. In the years since, infections have continued to occur sporadically, one here, one there. As physicians learned more about the disease, they got better at saving lives. But not that much better. On average, the case fatality rate remains about 35 percent — meaning one in three people who get sick die.Now hantavirus is back, in an unusual geographic cluster of cases at Yosemite. The person in the eighth case had stayed in the same tent cabins we stayed in at Tuolumne Meadows. At our home and many others, a fretful waiting game has begun.If you have been exposed, there’s nothing you can do to prevent getting sick. All you can do is be alert to symptoms, and at the first hint of trouble, seek medical help. But even researchers acknowledge that the symptoms are disconcertingly vague.When the e-mail arrived, Steven and I thought back over the past couple of weeks. Had either of us felt fluish? No. Aches and pains? No more than the usual. Neither of us has a tendency toward hypochondria. Still, the symptoms can appear up to five weeks after exposure, and it is impossible not to be hyper-alert to any headache or feeling of fatigue. One morning, after dinner with friends, I woke up feeling more than a little queasy and thought, “Uh oh” — until I remembered that I had drunk a little more wine than usual.So what were the odds we were exposed?“Very small,” Craig Manning, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told me when I reached him by phone. In the two decades since hantavirus was discovered, there have been only about 600 cases in the United States, most of them in the Southwest.Hantavirus infection in humans is rare, in part because the virus is comparatively fragile, Mr. Manning said. Sunlight or exposure to air inactivates it within one to two days. Eight of the nine confirmed cases so far involved people who stayed in insulated tent cabins in Curry Village, leading epidemiologists to suspect that the design of the cabins unwittingly created spaces for deer mice to hide. Only 10 percent to 12 percent of deer mice carry the virus, but reports suggest that the deer mice population at Yosemite is bigger than usual this year.An outbreak at a park like Yosemite poses special challenges to public health officials, Mr. Manning told me. Because visitors typically stay only a short time, most will have returned home before symptoms show up. Often it takes an astute physician, asking about a patient’s travel history, to make the connection.So far, three people have died in the Yosemite outbreak. All nine known cases have been residents of the United States, all but two from California. But about 20 percent of visitors to the affected areas of Yosemite are foreign tourists. On Sept. 4, the World Health Organization issued its own hantavirus advisory.When I spoke to Mr. Manning, more than a week had passed since a new case had been identified, raising hopes that the outbreak might be over. “There is a kind of hold-your-breath phenomenon here at the moment,” he told me.On Wednesday, the ranks of the worried swelled when state officials decided to reach out to an additional 230,000 visitors who had stayed one or more nights at Yosemite since early June. Then, the next day, the ninth case of infection was announced.So there’s a hold-your-breath phenomenon at our house, too. We’re closing in on the four-week mark. All’s well. Health experts insist that there’s no reason to be tested for the virus until symptoms occur. “We want to keep track of how you’re feeling,” Mr. Manning told me. Somehow, the thought that the C.D.C. was taking a personal interest was more discomforting than reassuring.“Let me put it this way,” he said. “I don’t want to not hear back from you.”'"
"'12-09-18,'1','But there were hints everywhere. One study found that heavier dialysis patients had a lower chance of dying than those whose were of normal weight or underweight. Overweight patients with coronary disease fared better than those who were thinner in another study; mild to severe obesity posed no additional mortality risks.In 2007, a study of 11,000 Canadians over more than a decade found that those who were overweight had the lowest chance of dying from any cause.To date, scientists have documented these findings in patients with heart failure, heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, high blood pressure — and now diabetes.Experts are searching for explanations. One idea is that once a chronic disease develops, the body becomes catabolic, meaning it needs higher energy and caloric reserves than usual. If patients do not have those reserves, they may become malnourished even though their weight is normal, said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, one of the directors of the preventive cardiology program at the University of California, Los Angeles.Some researchers suspect genetics: Maybe thin people who develop diabetes, cardiovascular disease and other chronic ailments have gene variants that make them more susceptible to these illnesses and put them at greater risk once they become ill. Heart disease in thin people may represent a different illness from heart disease in heavier people, Dr. Lavie said.It may be that doctors do not treat thin patients as aggressively as they do heavier patients — or that the yardstick itself is to blame. Most researchers assess obesity by measuring body mass index, a simple ratio of height and weight. But B.M.I. does not take into account body fat, lean muscle mass, metabolic abnormalities and other nuances of physical composition.Perhaps, some experts say, we are not asking the right question in the first place. Maybe we are so used to framing health issues in terms of obesity that we are overlooking other potential causes of disease.Dr. Neil Ruderman, an endocrinologist at Boston University School of Medicine, was the first to identify a condition he called “metabolically obese normal weight,” in 1981. Such people have weights in the normal range on the B.M.I. chart but also have metabolic abnormalities, including high levels of insulin resistance and triglycerides; they tend to carry fat around the middle, which is more apt to affect the heart, liver and other organs than fat in the hips and thighs.“If we’re open-minded when we look at the data, we often find confounding factors that can explain the disease associations we blame on weight,” said Linda Bacon, a nutrition professor at City College of San Francisco and author of “Health at Every Size: The Surprising Truth About Your Weight.”Fitness is an important, and often unmeasured, confounder, and the growing pile of paradoxical evidence is forcing experts to re-evaluate its importance.The link between obesity and health derives in part from research like the Framingham Heart Study, which has followed thousands of men and women since the 1940s. But Paul McAuley, a professor of health education at Winston-Salem State University, has noted that Framingham and other longitudinal studies often fail to take into account physical activity and fitness.Research that does tease apart weight and fitness — like a series of studies conducted by Steven Blair at the Cooper Institute in Dallas — shows that being fat and fit is better, healthwise, than being thin and unfit. Regular aerobic exercise may not lead to weight loss, but it does reduce fat in the liver, where it may do the most metabolic damage, according to a recent study at the University of Sydney.“More often than not, cardiovascular fitness is a far more important predictor of mortality risk than just knowing what you weigh,” said Glenn Gaesser, author of “Big Fat Lies” and director of the Healthy Lifestyles Research Center at Arizona State University.In 2005, an epidemiologist, Katherine Flegal, analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and found that the biggest risks of death were associated with being at either end of the spectrum — underweight or severely obese. The lowest mortality risks were among those in the overweight category (B.M.I.s of 25 to 30), while moderate obesity (30 to 35) offered no more risk than being in the normal-weight category.Whatever the explanation for the obesity paradox turns out to be, most experts agree that the data cast an uncertain light on the role of body fat. “Maintaining fitness is good and maintaining low weight is good,” Dr. Lavie said. “But if you had to go off one, it looks like it’s more important to maintain your fitness than your leanness. Fitness looks a little bit more protective.”That is a message that may take a long time to reach your family physician, however. “Paradigm shifts take time,” Ms. Bacon said. “They also take courage. Not many people are willing to challenge the weight conventions. They’re just too culturally embedded, and the risk of going against convention is too high.”'"
"'12-09-18,'1','The big giver was Robert Wilson, who contributed $200,000 to Restore Our Future, a pro-Mitt Romney “super PAC.” That is not so far from what Mr. Wilson paid 30 years ago for his 16th-floor apartment overlooking the park, which he said cost him $300,000.“I think Obama has done a poor job,” Mr. Wilson said. “Obama wants to increase the size of government; Romney wants to keep it flat.”Mr. Wilson is a retired hedge fund titan and someone who seems to enjoy a good contradiction. He gave more than $5 million to support New York’s Roman Catholic schools two years ago, despite being a self-proclaimed atheist.Now, he can add Romney-backing Upper West Sider to his list of oxymoronic-sounding titles. But his latest distinction can be a lonely one, indeed, so he says he is unlikely to mention it among friends, much less in a San Remo elevator.“I think anyone who lives in New York knows mostly Democrats,” Mr. Wilson said. “I really try to avoid arguments.”The analysis by The Times counted donations made in the 2011-12 election cycle to the candidates, to super PACs aligned with them and to the national parties, from the two addresses that make up the San Remo — 145 and 146 Central Park West.A San Remo couple, Kevin and Karen Kennedy, gave $105,000 to the Romney side. Mr. Kennedy, who made his money at Goldman Sachs, declined to comment.According to Bill Allison, the editorial director at the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group, the money trail at the San Remo echoes a broader national trend, in which Mr. Romney has found greater success than Mr. Obama has in getting people to support him with six- and seven-figure checks.And while the amount of money an individual can donate directly to a political campaign remains capped, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission gave rise to unlimited donations to super PACs, which allows donors’ checkbooks to breathe free.“He goes after big-ticket contributors, but they very quickly max out on his campaign,” Mr. Allison said of Mr. Romney. “Thanks to Citizens United, now they can just give to the super PACs to support him.”The San Remo, which was designed by Emery Roth and completed in 1930, is one of four buildings along Central Park West with a distinctive two-tower design. Andrew S. Dolkart, director of the historic preservation program at Columbia University, said the four — the others are the Eldorado, the Majestic and the Century — were built in the span of just a few years. They went up after a change in laws in the late 1920s that allowed for greater building heights, but before the Depression collapsed that market.Over the years, the San Remo has developed a celebrity pedigree, with a list of co-op owners that has included Bono, Dustin Hoffman, Steven Spielberg and Bruce Willis. A few years ago, there was a dispute in the building when Bono and other residents complained that smoke from some fireplaces, including one belonging to the 1980s rock star Billy Squier, was getting into their apartments. (Mr. William Squier gave $500 to Representative Ron Paul’s fund in this election cycle.)The building’s political pedigree is similarly robust. At one point in 2004, 146 Central Park West was the single most generous address to Democratic presidential causes in the country — a ranking earned even without donations from the southern half of the San Remo, 145 Central Park West, which is part of the same physical building, though it has a separate lobby. And in the 2008 cycle, the combined San Remo addresses gave nearly $200,000 to Democratic candidates and $32,000 to Republicans.But Democrats need not panic at the apparent shift in tides. If the totals for the building were to include money donated by apartment owners using other addresses, say, of a second home, the scales begin to tip back.Mr. Tobias, a financial writer, gave only $30,400 using his San Remo address but $36,200 from a Miami address, the analysis of donations found. Mr. Spielberg and his wife, Kate Capshaw, have given $204,800 to the Obama re-election effort in this cycle, including $100,000 to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, but have done so from California. A resident named Diana Rose gave $64,100 from Katonah, N.Y.Money donated since July to the Obama and Romney efforts has not yet been reported.Nonetheless, the revelation that, at least on paper, the San Remo was a Romney stronghold caused a few Democrats to promise to believe in Mr. Obama a little harder.“I’m going to give a lot of money,” Joy Fishman said from her San Remo living room, which overlooks Central Park. (Ms. Fishman’s husband, Jack Fishman, along with his colleagues, invented and patented in the 1960s the drug Naloxone, which is given to people who have overdosed on opioids like morphine and heroin.)“I find the Romney team very scary,” Ms. Fishman continued. “I just don’t want to live under that.”Mr. Tobias, who said he paid $41,000 for his two-bedroom spread in the 1970s, said it was not always easy for him to solicit fellow co-op shareholders for money because he gets off the elevator at the fourth floor. But he said he knew what he had to do: “I’ll get back to work!”'"
"'12-09-18,'1','The Japanese government’s response so far has been muted, with officials calling on the Chinese government to protect Japanese citizens and property.Economically, the impact was hard to assess, but many Japanese businesses in Beijing were closed on Tuesday. The popular clothing chain Uniqlo covered its name entirely with red paper; over the weekend it had tried to protect itself by putting a sign in its windows saying it supported China’s territorial claims.On Tuesday morning, the crowds at protests in front of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing swelled into the hundreds after ebbing Monday. But they were carefully controlled by the police, who blocked off streets around the embassy.Many Chinese people said they did not support the attacks on Japanese businesses. China’s most influential blogger, Han Han, posted an essay on Monday urging Chinese not to boycott Japanese cars. He said the protests served those in power, who could use the violence to reinforce their claims that stability is paramount.Some Chinese pleaded online with foreigners to be more nuanced in their views of China. “Don’t say ‘residents of Beijing,’ ” one wrote, referring to the size of the protests in a city with nearly 20 million inhabitants. “Write ‘some numbskulls in Beijing’ did this or that.”But Mr. Panetta’s visit raised tensions on another front. During a stopover in Tokyo before flying to China, he praised the antimissile radar system as essential to enhancing the American-Japanese alliance and improving its ability to defend Japan from surprise attack by North Korea, while stressing that it was not aimed at China.“The purpose of this is to enhance our ability to defend Japan,” Mr. Panetta said at a news conference in Tokyo. “It’s also designed to help forward-deployed U.S. forces, and it also will be effective in protecting the U.S. homeland from the North Korean ballistic missile threat.”But several leading Chinese reacted strongly, saying the system was also aimed at China, where officials fear that their relatively small nuclear deterrent could be greatly diminished by even a modest missile defense program. Two senior figures in Chinese international relations said the American missile shield was also emboldening Japan to resist China’s territorial claims on the Diaoyu Islands, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan.“The joint missile defense system objectively encourages Japan to keep an aggressive position in the Diaoyu Islands dispute, which sends China a very negative message,” said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing. “Japan would not have been so aggressive without the support and actions of the U.S.”Although he has been in Asia for only two days, Mr. Panetta has been asked repeatedly about the sovereignty dispute — and each time he responded that the United States was not taking sides in any of the region’s territorial disagreements. Washington, he said, was advocating a diplomatic process to resolve the tensions peacefully, echoing points made by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on a visit to Asia this month.Mr. Panetta’s weeklong mission to Asia is intended to prove to allies and partners that the United States is refocusing its national security attention and resources on the region. At the same time, though, he has to try to convince the leadership in Beijing that the “rebalancing” does not have as a shadow agenda the containment of China.Japan is already the site of one American X-band radar, officially known as the AN/TPY-2, which is a central element in a complex technical architecture for identifying ballistic missiles and coordinating a defense by interceptors. That first radar is at Shariki; the location for the second has not been decided.The Japanese government has so far offered only a muted reaction to the Chinese protests, which were the top news over the weekend in Japan. Officials have issued appeals for restraint and called on the Chinese government to ensure the safety of Japanese individuals and businesses.“We need to take a coolheaded approach to avoid negative impacts on overall relations,” Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan told the broadcaster NHK. “Japan will do so, too, but we need to strongly call on China to show restraint.”Officials in the Noda government have said that they are considering increasing the number of coast guard ships patrolling the disputed islands, after unconfirmed reports on Chinese Web sites that as many as 1,000 Chinese fishing vessels may stage a mass protest by sailing into waters around the islands. On Monday, the coast guard said it had so far not seen any increase in the normal fishing activity around the islands.The array of issues — the radar, the island dispute and the American shift to Asia — should come into clearer focus on Wednesday, when Mr. Panetta is scheduled to meet with Mr. Xi, who serves on China’s Central Military Commission.The meeting with Mr. Panetta, however, could prove tricky for Mr. Xi, 59, who is due to take over from Hu Jintao as Communist Party leader at a congress in the coming weeks. Mr. Xi, who is widely seen as more pro-American than the current leaders, has visited the United States several times, including a stay with a farming family in Iowa and an official visit to the Pentagon.The recent protests here against Japan over the island dispute have been interpreted by some observers in Beijing as a challenge to Mr. Xi and an effort to allow Mr. Hu to stay in control of the military longer than he might have.Mr. Hu’s predecessor, Jiang Zemin, stayed on as chairman of the Central Military Commission for an extra two years when he stepped down as leader of the party and the government a decade ago. One reason given was China’s unsettled external circumstances, which some hard-liners may be using now in a bid to prevent Mr. Xi from taking fuller control of the military.“This could force Xi to take a strong line with Panetta,” said a Chinese academic who asked not to be identified because of the issue’s sensitivity. “He will have to say very forcefully that what the U.S. is doing is wrong.”Although the United States has said it is neutral in the dispute over the islands, its actions show it is taking sides, said Tao Wenzhao, deputy director of United States studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.“This move shows that the U.S. has picked a side between China and Japan in the Diaoyu dispute,” Mr. Tao said. “It is highly inappropriate and counter-constructive for the U.S. to make such a move at this highly sensitive time.”As if to underscore its displeasure, China held a large naval exercise over the weekend, with 40 missiles launched.In addition, China unveiled another stealth fighter, just as it disclosed another model two years ago, when Mr. Panetta’s predecessor, Robert M. Gates, visited Beijing. The new model is made by a different company, and it indicates that China is pushing ahead with the project, although it is not certain if the planes will ever be produced and deployed in large numbers.'"

"'12-09-19,'1','She could be Miss Havisham. This ageless ghost of a woman with long, scraggly gray hair, dressed in a tattered, once-elegant gown, shuffling — noisily, rhythmically — back and forth across a bare floor in the growing dark. But Miss Havisham is a Dickens character and a villain, while May (Holly Twyford), the woman we see onstage, is a Samuel Beckett character and a leading lady. And while Miss Havisham is the eternal spurned bride, May is the eternal daughter. She has an elderly, bedridden mother who speaks in the tones of a cruel god (the voice of Kathleen Chalfant).“Sounding Beckett,” which completes its short run at the Classic Stage Company on Sunday, is a far cry from “Waiting for Godot” or “Happy Days,” that playwright’s cheerfully absurdist midcentury tributes to the battle against despair. The three short plays that make up this program — they’re not usually presented together — were written in the last decades of Beckett’s life, the 1970s and ’80s, his minimalist period. Maybe it’s most accurate to think of this as extreme Beckett.In “Footfalls” we learn that May has not left the house (literally) since her girlhood. Her mother chides her more than once, “Will you never have done — revolving it all in your mind?” And Beckett leaves it to us to fill in the blanks about what is torturing her.The two men (Ted van Griethuysen and Philip Goodwin) in “Ohio Impromptu” have long gray hair and wear what looks like black religious garb; they are seated at a table while one reads to the other. The second man reacts only by slamming his fist on the table periodically. Beckett wrote them as doppelgängers; I mistook them for a gay Amish couple with power issues.The final play, “Catastrophe,” was written as a comment on totalitarianism and political martyrdom. The protagonist (Mr. van Griethuysen), a frightened, trembling elderly man, is manipulated and humiliated by a vicious director (Mr. Goodwin). What kind of director? We are never told. Sometimes the setting seems more like a museum than a theater or soundstage. This is a heartbreaking piece with a happy but upsetting ending.“Sounding Beckett” is directed by Joy Zinoman, the founding artistic director of the Studio Theater in Washington (she stepped down in 2010), who chose the plays and has staged them with a glamorous starkness and a clear respect for the works’ purity. They alternate with original musical compositions that they inspired, performed live and with a haunting intensity by the Cygnus Ensemble.'"

Mr. Hicks said federal law requires that the company notify anyone whose position could change, including those who could get “bumped” by more-senior employees whose jobs are eliminated or outsourced.American said in February that it planned to cut 14,000 jobs, including 13,000 held by union workers. But according to Mr. Hicks, the job losses will be about a third of that.This summer American accepted slightly smaller cost-cutting measures as it negotiated new contracts, and it agreed to give bonuses to flight attendants and ground workers who quit. So far 1,800 flight attendants and 800 ground workers have applied to accept the bonuses.'"

The fighting grew worse and rolled through the neighborhood and surrounding areas, sending more and more families to shelter in the schools.Last week, Unicef, citing government estimates, said that of the country’s 22,000 schools, at least 10 percent were damaged, destroyed or occupied by displaced families. In Homs, parents said that classes had started in only a few schools; in one private school, the families living there simply moved to an upper floor. In the Damascus suburb of Barza, one or two schools took students in shifts, to make up for all the schools that were closed.Different challenges faced Syrians who had fled the country, including to Lebanon, where officials are struggling with a vexing issue: how to teach Syrian students, accustomed to classes in Arabic, in Lebanese schools where science and math classes are taught in English or French.“When you ask young people about school, they say they’re afraid of the language,” said Soha Boustani, a spokeswoman for Unicef. Last year, she said, the dropout rate for seventh-, eighth- and ninth-grade Syrian students in Lebanese schools was 70 percent, with the language barriers being a major cause.Syrian students also face discrimination, from Lebanese teachers and students, and resentment from local residents in impoverished parts of the country where the school system is already overburdened.The United Nations envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, visited Syrian refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan on Tuesday, and was quickly given a taste of the anger brewing among the exiles. In the Zaatari camp, near Jordan’s border with Syria, refugees angered that Mr. Brahimi had met with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria chanted, “By seeing Bashar, you’ve extended his life,” according to The Associated Press. As Mr. Brahimi’s entourage left the camp, teenagers pelted its cars with rocks.The problems for many of the children start even before they register for school. “Some of them have seen dead bodies,” said Miled Abou Jaoude, the emergency coordinator for Save the Children in Beirut. “There is a fear of warplanes. Some families are living in one room, with the father unemployed, which can create domestic violence.”At a registration center for the refugees in the Lebanese city of Baalbek on Tuesday, Thaer al-Ghawi, a teacher who fled the Damascus suburbs 10 days ago, fretted about the transition for his four children, who had been top students back home. “Everything is good in Syria, except language instruction,” he said.Aid officials said that the Lebanese government recently directed the schools to accept the Syrian students. The United Nations Refugee Agency and nongovernmental groups are trying to rehabilitate schools to prepare them for more students, especially in low-income areas where repairs were badly needed.Schools in Syria face a much steeper challenge. In Qaboun, an opposition stronghold outside Damascus that has had fierce fighting, a teacher said his school opened under orders from the Education Ministry: teachers were told to show up, whether the students came or not.“They wanted to show the situation is as normal as any year,” said the teacher, who, like others, requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.About 100 students returned Sunday, when classes began, to a school where there were once 50 students in each classroom. “Most of the families left Qaboun,” the teacher said, adding that many of his colleagues had not shown up for work because they lived in other areas besieged by violence.At a school in the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, a 13-year-old boy scolded administrators for planning to remove displaced families to comply with the order to open schools, a teacher there said on Tuesday. “To be honest, I cried when I heard those words,” the teacher said.The crisis has not spared the country’s elites, including government officials who used to send their children to private and international schools outside of Damascus.“I decided to send my son to the state-run school instead,” one father said. “I think that this year, Syrian students will not get a good education.”'"
"'12-09-19,'1','The genius reference could be interpreted as a swipe at the Apple customer support employees, who work at the company’s “Genius Bars.” This summer, Apple started a television ad campaign featuring a Genius Bar employee. The campaign was short-lived.Todd Pendleton, Samsung’s chief marketing officer, said the “It doesn’t take a genius” ad was not meant to insult iPhone owners. “Apple users or fanboys, or whatever you call them, they’re not the target of this work at all,” he said. “If you look at the core essence of the work, it really is showing an innovation story. A more innovative product in this case is the GS III.”Innovation has been at the heart of the dispute between the companies. In August, a California jury ruled that Samsung had infringed upon a series of mobile technology patents and awarded Apple $1 billion in damages.In a statement after the verdict, Samsung showed it was still in fighting spirit. “It is unfortunate that patent law can be manipulated to give one company a monopoly over rectangles with rounded corners, or technology that is being improved every day by Samsung and other companies,” the company said. It vowed that the defeat was “not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world, some of which have already rejected many of Apple’s claims.”In an interview, Mr. Pendleton said Samsung’s new ads were part of a larger campaign for the Galaxy S III that began in June and included ads on television, online, in print and in outdoor areas, like posters at bus stations. Major markets for the company include Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, he said.A headline on a Samsung ad that ran in newspapers on Sept. 9, days before Apple introduced its iPhone, says, “The Next Big Thing Is Already Here.” Samsung used a similar tag line in 2011, “The Next Big Thing Is Here,” to promote its 4G service and the Galaxy S II. Television ads for that campaign showed people waiting in line for the latest Apple device while Samsung owners showed off the features of phones they already had.Adding the word “already” to this latest iteration of the campaign signaled the brand’s focus on the iPhone 5 coming to market. The technology blog Gizmodo published a collection of homemade ads that Apple fans created in response to the latest Samsung ads. Headlines included “Don’t settle for cheap plastic” and “In high school, it doesn’t take a genius to understand who is just a bully.”Apple, which declined to comment about the Samsung campaign, has undertaken its share of ad campaigns mocking the competition.Ken Segall, the ad guru who worked on Apple’s “Think Different” marketing campaign and the author of “Insanely Simple,” a book about Apple, said that over the years, Apple learned to apply a light touch of humor when it mocked competitors in ads. For example, in its previous “Get a Mac” TV commercials, a PC, personified by a pudgy John Hodgman, exchanged comedic jabs with a Mac, played by a handsome Justin Long.In 1985, Apple ran an unpopular TV commercial during the Super Bowl that depicted PC users as mindless lemmings leaping to their death from a cliff. “It was widely panned because they were insulting the ones they were trying to talk to,” said Mr. Segall, who worked at TBWA\Chiat\Day, the agency that produced the ad.Samsung’s new ads are repeating the same mistake, he said, by making iPhone customers seem foolish. “It seems like an odd way to seduce them because you’re basically telling them they’re idiots,” he said.While Apple has outspent Samsung on advertising wireless devices, both companies have increased their ad spending in that category over the last year, according to data from Kantar Media, part of WPP. From January to June, Apple spent $193.1 million on advertising mobile products, while Samsung spent $99.9 million. In 2011, Apple spent $104.1 million during the same period, while Samsung spent $6.95 million.Tom Denari, the president and a principal at the advertising agency Young & Laramore, said the Samsung campaign was reminiscent of the Pepsi and Coke wars of the 1970s and ’80s.“It’s a classic challenger strategy, where No. 2 throws stones at the leader, in order to attract attention to itself,” Mr. Denari said.Any brand would like to have the kind of loyalty that Apple gets from its fans, Mr. Denari said, “because these fans identify themselves so closely to the brand that they feel that Samsung is not only attacking Apple, but they feel like they are being personally attacked as well.”Bill Winchester, chief creative officer of Lindsay, Stone & Briggs, said Samsung should decide what its brand stands for instead of responding to whatever Apple does and competing with Apple based on the features of the phone. “At the end of the day, don’t you think these phones more or less do the same thing?” said Mr. Winchester, who uses an iPhone. “We carry these as a prop to tell people in the world what we are. As soon as you get down to features and starting to compare features, you’re not really going to convince me at that level.”'"

The benchmark index reached levels not seen in nearly five years last Friday, a day after the Federal Reserve disclosed a plan for a third round of economic stimulus.

The Dow Jones transportation average lost 1.1 percent. FedEx cut its profit forecast for its fiscal year 2013, saying that a weakening world economy had prompted customers to shift toward cheaper shipping.Estimates for the third-quarter profits of S.& P. 500 companies have fallen sharply in recent months, and earnings are expected to decline 2.2 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. It would be the first such decline in three years.'"
"'12-09-19,'1','Separate from the help to lower Spanish government borrowing costs is aid for the country’s banking sector. The Bank of Spain reported Tuesday that in July the country’s banks had 170 billion euros in loans that were at risk of not being paid, representing 9.86 percent of their total loans, The Associated Press reported. The central bank said that the proportion of nonperforming loans in July was up from 9.42 percent in June.In June, euro zone finance ministers agreed to make available as much as 100 billion euros in emergency loans for the Spanish banking sector.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy wants the loans to be made directly to the banks, rather than be funneled through the Spanish government and in that way increase its sovereign debt. But direct transfers to the banks cannot be made until the euro zone’s new banking supervisory system is in place.European Union member states are divided on the details of the new regulatory structure, and it is not clear when those issues will be resolved.Speaking in London on Monday, the French finance and economy minister, Pierre Moscovici, said that it was up to the Spanish government to decide whether it wanted assistance but that the euro zone and central bank stood ready to help the government in Madrid if it requested assistance.“If, and when, the Spanish ask for any solution or any kind of intervention from either the central bank or the member states — after the decisions taken by the E.C.B., after also our exchanges in the Eurogroup — all the tools are available and we will answer to whatever the Spanish government asks, if it does,” Mr. Moscovici said.The Eurogroup refers to the finance ministers of the euro zone countries, who meet regularly.“This is a matter of sovereignty, and Spain has to make its decision on its own,” Mr. Moscovici added. “I’m not pressuring, I’m not pressing. They have to make their choice, they know exactly what they have to do and they know what the tools are. But of course we have those discussions, they exist.”Nicholas Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy in London, said that sentiment toward Spain was starting to deteriorate in the bond market because of the uncertainty about whether Madrid would request a bond-buying program.“The Treasury managed to get all its debt out the door this morning, demand was solid, if unspectacular, and yields continued to fall,” Mr. Spiro said. “However, the window of opportunity for Spain to issue debt at what are still relatively favorable yields appears to be closing.”He added: “The markets have priced in an E.C.B.-backed bond-buying program for Spain. The longer Madrid dithers, the more likely it is that the markets will turn decisively against Spain.”'"
"'12-09-19,'1','FIRST the chicken is baptized in sweet tea, a Southern elixir giddy with sugar, in which tea is an afterthought. It is left to brine overnight, then dredged in milk, flour, salt, pepper and mystery spices that the chef refuses to divulge. Into the pressure fryer it goes, then onto your plate.Dismemberment is swift. The skin is dark bronze and nubbly, studded with tiny crispy kernels and whorls, and already you are breaking off pieces and crumbling them in your mouth. Slow down. Consider, too, the pleasures of the flesh, tender and salty sweet, a marriage of brash and beatific. On hand are Texas Pete’s original hot sauce, flaring with cayenne, and squeeze bottles of honey, but the chicken is just fine without either.Southern fried chicken is the mission at Bobwhite Lunch & Supper Counter, a small no-fuss storefront that opened in Alphabet City in January. The owner, Keedick Coulter, hails from Roanoke, Va. He doubles as chef — “de facto chef,” as he puts it, acknowledging his lack of classical culinary training.No need for the self-deprecation. Mr. Coulter’s fried chicken is the kind you dream about when trapped at other, more buttoned-up restaurants. It comes as a complete supper (available all day), with an overgrown buttermilk biscuit, mottled gold on top and devastatingly moist inside, and a dutiful salad ($11.50).Less successful is fried catfish, which tends to the limp, whether in a supper ($12) or a sandwich ($9). And a number of the side dishes could benefit from more attention, and salt: undersimmered collard greens ($4) that taste not at all of the ham hock and pork jowl they were cooked with; voluptuous but vapid grits ($3.50); oddly dry macaroni and cheese ($4.50); and texturally perfect and perfectly bland black-eyed peas ($3.50).'"

"'12-09-20,'1','Part of the romance of sports lies in the thrill of controlled, heroic brutality. Modern athletes are often likened to warriors: they sacrifice, put their bodies on the line and take punishment in pursuit of a noble cause. The rest of us — couch potatoes, season-ticket holders, parents on the sidelines — cheer for the toughest players and the hardest hits.Steve James’s troubling new documentary, “Head Games,” reckons some of the terrible costs of modern American sports culture. Focusing on football, hockey and women’s soccer, the film looks at the widespread incidence of head injuries that threaten the well-being of competitors at every level, from youth leagues to the pros. Recent neurological research suggests that even mild and infrequent concussions can have terrible long-term consequences. Repeated impact, of the kind that is routine in football, especially, can lead to dementia and severe psychological disorders.Guiding us through this grim medical information is Christopher Nowinski, a former Harvard defensive lineman who went from the Ivy League to professional wrestling. He is now the public face of an institute at Boston University specializing in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a brain disease that is believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head, and that seems to occur with alarming frequency among athletes.Mr. Nowinski and his colleagues explain the science clearly. Other interview subjects include former athletes; league officials; and journalists, among them Alan Schwarz, a reporter for The New York Times who has written extensively on head injuries.“Head Games” is alternately sobering and terrifying. It is painful to watch a grown man struggle to recite the months of the year, and to hear about the shockingly high number of suicides among N.F.L. veterans with C.T.E. It is also chilling to watch youngsters heading out onto the field or the ice accompanied by the usual exhortations from parents and coaches to play hard.Mr. James, whose “Hoop Dreams” may be the best sports documentary ever made, is motivated by a fan’s devotion as well as a journalist’s skepticism. “Head Games” gains credibility and power from compassion for athletes and respect for their accomplishments. But it also tries to open the eyes of sports lovers to dangers that have too often been minimized and too seldom fully understood.'"

Mr. Stevens is alone in the main building, according to guards interviewed later. The militants enter the compound, backed by truck-mounted artillery.The American security detail finds the body of Sean Smith, who died of smoke inhalation, but is unable to locate Mr. Stevens because of the thick smoke.American security forces try to retake control of the main building, but do not succeed. At some point before 1 a.m., they retreat to another American compound a half-mile away.Libyans, possibly looters, find Mr. Stevens inside the main building and take him to a hospital. The doctor who treats him says he may have died from smoke inhalation. Americans are unaware of his whereabouts at this point.Eight American security officers arrive at Benghazi’s airport and drive to the second compound accompanied by Libyan militiamen.As the staff is preparing to leave the second compound, they come under fire. More than 20 staff members retreat to a building at the back. The building is hit twice by mortar rounds but all survive. The attack lasts about five minutes. Two security officers, Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty, die in the shootout.American and Libyan forces now control both compounds.The surviving staff members fly from Benghazi to Tripoli. Two hours later, a second flight leaves, taking the bodies of the Americans killed, including Mr. Stevens’s body, which was returned to American officials at the airport.'"

At the time, the company said it would open a new translational clinical research center somewhere on the East Coast.The company is expected to formally announce Thursday that it will locate that new operation in the Alexandria Center for Life Science, at 29th Street and First Avenue in Manhattan.The decision is a coup in New York City’s efforts to develop a life sciences and biotechnology hub.Translational research provides a bridge between basic research and clinical practice.

"'12-09-20,'1','The killing of Mr. Marzouki has not been solved, the police said. But they blamed the drug trade for the recent killings, specifically dealers from the “Quartiers Nord,” the predominantly immigrant districts of northern Marseille. Top dealers can easily make 100,000 euros a month (about $131,000), the police said, relying on violence and murder to intimidate others or defend their territory. Unlike the United States, guns are tightly regulated in Europe, but the gangs have armed themselves with weapons obtained on the black market.“We are confronted by inhuman situations,” said Jean-Louis Martini, the local spokesman of Synergie Officiers, one of the major police unions in France. “It becomes terrifying, because it has no limits.”Marseille, one of France’s poorest cities, has long been a haven for gangs, which first surfaced to control prostitution. It was home to a major heroin ring known as “The French Connection,” the basis for the 1971 film. And like many port cities, it has been identified with smuggling and political corruption.Today, experts and police officers say that the number of crimes, mostly related to marijuana trafficking, has not increased significantly. But the crimes have become much more violent in the past year. Police officers and residents are particularly worried about the increasing use of automatic and semiautomatic rifles, especially the Kalashnikov. Knockoff versions are made in many eastern European countries and China, and cost about $1,300.They were introduced in France after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia and became more available recently after the chaos that followed the uprising in Libya. The police said about 300 Kalashnikovs have been intercepted in Marseille this year.The drug networks are also larger and less structured. “It is hard for us to dismantle those networks,” said David-Olivier Reverdy, a former policeman. “Until now, we come after the crime and count the dead.”Last week, Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault paid a two-day visit to Marseille to discuss the security situation and urge an end to what he called the city’s “inertia” in the economic crisis. He announced a plan that would increase the number of police officers in the districts affected by crime and trafficking, and also include longer-term initiatives to alleviate poverty.The program was welcomed by experts. “We must stop thinking that this delinquency happens by magic and that people were born with this illness in them,” said Laurent Mucchielli, a sociologist, in the magazine Le Point. “We must confront school failure, unemployment and the desertification of certain districts.”According to Insee, the country’s national statistics agency, up to 45 percent of male residents aged 15 to 29 were jobless in 2009 in several poor arrondissements of Marseille.For Ms. Ghali, the northern districts she serves have been abandoned by the state and left to the authority of gangs and to dealers who “are able to shoot the friend they ate and slept with the previous night.” The economic distress in Europe has reinforced the phenomenon. “Before we had temporary work,” she said in an interview. “Now there is more unemployment and no temporary jobs.”Marseille was not hit hard by the 2005 riots that inflamed the Paris suburbs. But some people believe that its embrace of multiculturalism and strong local identity no longer protect it from social unrest.“We got overwhelmed by the expansion of this new delinquency,” said Mr. Martini, the police official.The police say that the drug gang progression follows a common pattern. A young man drops out of school to become a “chouf,” the Arabic word for “watchman,” often paid about $65 a day to alert dealers when police officers enter his neighborhood. A good chouf is given the opportunity to drive a “go fast,” which consists of bringing marijuana in from Spain as fast as he can without being caught.Mr. Marzouki, the drug dealer who died in his car last month, was wanted by the police. “He had risen in the past five years,” said a police officer. “He went from being a driver of go fasts to one of the main importers of drugs in Marseille.” (Mr. Marzouki’s girlfriend, Anaïs, was wounded but survived the attack.)Mr. Marzouki dropped out of school at 13. His mother cleaned houses, his father worked at temporary jobs and his brother was jailed for petty crime.“Walid was a good guy, a nice guy” said Inés, 20, a nurse who went to school with Mr. Marzouki. “We are used to murders here — it is ‘mektoub,’ ” the Arabic word for fate.But her fatalism is not shared by others in the northern districts who have been terrorized by the violence. “It’s a city of crazy people,” said a man who works near the spot where Mr. Marzouki was killed, who spoke on condition he not be identified. “If a 16-year-old kid can use a Kalashnikov, it means that he never experienced a childhood, and his parents never cuddled him.”Mr. Marzouki’s parents may not have cuddled him. But placed on that light pole on the Boulevard Casanova are flowers and a note, written in what appears to be red lipstick, saying: “Walid, we’ll love you forever.”'"

"'12-09-20,'1','Unfortunately for Nicks, the pain in his foot kept him from practicing in the days leading up to the game. He was initially listed as questionable on the Giants’ Wednesday injury report, but he was later ruled out and did not travel, the team said.Bradshaw, who has a history of injury problems in recent years, sustained what Coach Tom Coughlin has described only as a neck problem in Sunday’s win. Bradshaw left the game in the first half and did not return, opening the way for the No. 3 running back, Andre Brown, to lead the Giants’ rushing attack. Brown is likely to start Thursday night; David Wilson, the nominal backup, has struggled to gain trust from the coaching staff and figures to remain a reserve.Brown will be working with a patchwork offensive line, as Diehl’s knee injury, believed to be to his medial collateral ligament, has forced another reshuffling of a unit already in flux. The Giants moved left tackle Sean Locklear to right tackle after Diehl was hurt Sunday, inserting the former starter Will Beatty at left tackle. (Beatty had been replaced because of a lingering back problem.) It is likely the Giants will at least begin Thursday’s game with the same lineup.The other two players who did not travel are receiver Domenik Hixon, who sustained a concussion Sunday, and the rookie defensive end Adewale Ojomo, who has a strained hamstring. Without Nicks and Hixon, the Giants will dress just four receivers: Cruz, Ramses Barden, Jerrel Jernigan and the rookie Rueben Randle.The Giants are expected to get back cornerback Prince Amukamara, who sustained a high ankle sprain during the preseason and has yet to play this season. Linebacker Keith Rivers, who was dealing with a hamstring issue, was listed as probable and is expected to play.PATRIOTS ADD PASS CATCHERS New England signed tight end Kellen Winslow and receiver Deion Branch to add depth to an offense that lost tight end Aaron Hernandez on Sunday to an ankle injury. Winslow was released by Seattle on Sept. 1. The Patriots released Branch, who caught 51 passes last season, in the final roster cutdown but kept his nameplate above his locker and his possessions inside it.

"'12-09-20,'1','Owners and employees of the stores have been retrained and have new uniforms. Stores have a bright aqua and teal color scheme, and some locations have new equipment. But U.P.S. is keeping its distinctive brown and gold corporate shield.“Our research shows that the majority of small businesses feel they don’t get support to cope with their challenges,” said Michelle Van Slyke, vice president of marketing and small business solutions at the UPS Store headquarters in San Diego.Using focus groups, surveys and techniques like journals kept by small-business owners, the company found last year that most small-business owners wanted to work with other local business people because they felt they could trust them more and because their economic health was linked, Ms. Van Slyke said.But many did not know that their community UPS Store was a franchise operated by a local owner, she said. Nor did they always know the full range of services the store provided, she added.Even so, she said, a third of the customers of the 4,300 UPS Stores are small businesses — with 10 or fewer people or individuals — that accounted for 75 percent of overall revenue.To attract more small enterprises, the UPS Store’s “Small Business Solutions” campaign emphasizes that its new services can be customized, like the specially designed pie box, to meet a specific business need. In a two-minute video, Ms. Poehnelt traces how she arrived from Wisconsin three years ago, then opened a pie shop to make use of her baking skills and, with the help of her local UPS Store, a mail-order business that ships pies around the United States.The local UPS Store also does her printing, including business cards, menus and gift certificates, the video notes. The stores, which compete with FedEx Office, Office Depot and even the local post office, say their services can be bundled into accounts for monthly billing.Doner, an advertising agency based in Detroit, designed the multifaceted campaign to underscore the message that the neighborhood UPS Store is the “repository of solutions to help small businesses,” said Clint White, the agency’s brand leader for the stores.Three television commercials, by Ogilvy & Mather Chicago, humorously highlight the UPS Store’s connection to small and individual business owners. One, called “Mailboxes,” shows various box renters peering into “their office” and explaining why it is valuable to them. Another shows a building contractor, who relies on his UPS Store’s services to meet demands from clients, including a woman who commissions a doghouse that is a replica of her elaborate house. The 30- and 60-second commercials will appear on prime-time shows like “The X Factor,” and on cable, late-night shows and N.F.L. games and ESPN Monday Night Football. The CBS anchor Charles Osgood will voice the campaign’s ads on his radio broadcasts.The campaign also will advertise on digital media, mobile video and video on YouTube, Hulu and other online sites. Customers will be able to submit their stories of how a UPS Store has helped their enterprise, and those stories could be featured in a future ad campaign.The company spent $30 million on advertising in 2009. The UPS Store did not disclose what it would spend this year, but Ms. Van Slyke said it would be the company’s largest annual outlay.Last year, U.P.S. spent nearly $40.4 million to promote the stores, and almost $23.4 million in the first six months of 2012, according to figures from Kantar, the unit of WPP.As part of its campaign, the UPS Store also has a small-business solutions portal to connect small-business owners with relevant news, blogs, videos and vendors offering legal, financial, technological and other services.Ms. Poehnelt’s print ad can be scanned by a mobile device to link to a video of her baking and doing more routine chores like paperwork — set in the idyllic Kauai scenery.“At the end of the day, it’s on me,” she says of her business. “But shipping pies is one thing I don’t have to worry about.”'"
"'12-09-20,'1','On the bright side, the new Apple-powered Maps app includes some features that were not in the old version, like spoken turn-by-turn directions and Flyover, a feature that shows 3-D models of buildings in major cities.The colors in the Apple maps sparkle a bit more; zooming and panning is faster. Yelp, a popular review site for businesses and restaurants, supplies data for location searches. And iPhone users can ask Siri, the voice-powered assistant, to tell them how to get somewhere.But because Apple is relatively new to mapping, it has a lot more work to do before its service is as robust as Google’s.Anil Dash, a New York-based entrepreneur, was critical of Apple and its maps on his blog, writing that Apple had “used their platform dominance to privilege their own app over a competitor’s offering, even though it’s a worse experience for users.” He complained that a search for “Bloomberg” failed to turn up the company’s headquarters, and one for an address on Lexington Avenue pulled up a street in Brooklyn, even when “NY, NY” was specified.Trenton Fuller, an iPhone and iPad owner and a computer systems administrator in Louisville, Ky., said he liked the look of the Apple maps but found similar problems.Mr. Fuller said he did a search for Heine Brothers, a popular coffee shop in Louisville, but substituted “Bros.” The map service could not find the shop until he typed its name in precisely. Google Maps, in contrast, was able to find it, even with spelling variations. And the Apple service came up with an inaccurate street address for Mr. Fuller’s office.“Not being able to find businesses or points of interest without spelling a name 100 percent perfectly could cause some grief,” Mr. Fuller said. “That problem combined with inaccurate street addresses could be superfrustrating.”Despite the problems, Mr. Fuller said he did not regret his decision to order the new iPhone 5, which will come with the new software installed when it is released on Friday.For public transit schedules, Apple gives the option for customers to tap on a tab inside the Maps app and download a third-party transit app for their city, though the quality of these may vary.Google could build its own maps app for Apple devices and submit it to Apple for approval. It declined to say whether it would do so. Brian McClendon, vice president for engineering for maps at Google, would say only that the company wanted to make its maps available to everyone.All iPhone users will continue to be able to reach Google’s mapping service through a mobile Web browser, a method that is somewhat clunky compared with an app. (The Google site prompts users to create a Google Maps icon that resides alongside app icons on the iPhone.) Users who choose not to upgrade to the new Apple operating system or buy a new iPhone will be able to keep using Google’s maps, and there is no indication that either Google or Apple will stop providing that service.As more people use Apple’s maps, the company will learn how to improve them. There are 400 million devices running iOS, so it may only be a small matter of time before millions of people have the new maps. Over the next year or two, Apple’s maps should become as good as Google’s for most people, said Scott Rafer, chief executive of Lumatic, a company that has developed a transit app for iPhones.“What no one’s talking about is map usage is a lot more important than any of this crazy software” that Google’s maps may have, Mr. Rafer said.Google executives, though they will not talk directly about Apple’s maps, are reminding people that Google is coming to the fight with years of expertise, and a lot of data of its own.Google, which has offered maps since 2005, has taken photos of streets in 3,000 cities for its Street View service, photos that help it ensure the accuracy of its maps. And it has information about one million transit stops around the world, including things like photos of the inside of Tokyo subway stations and directions on which exit to use.“It takes a long time and effort to figure out how to do this right,” Mr. McClendon said. “Experience is important.”On the same day that Apple released iOS 6, Google introduced some small updates to its Android maps, like the ability to see a list of places that a user had previously searched for on his computer.Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, said Apple was clearly not the market leader in maps, lagging both Google and Nokia. But Mr. Gartenberg said he did not think most consumers would be bothered by what was missing in Apple’s maps and that, on the whole, they would be more pleased by the addition of turn-by-turn navigation.“The granularity of how good mapping is on one platform versus another doesn’t seem like it’s going to matter a lot to consumers,” he said.'"
"'12-09-20,'1','USA Swimming barred a coach, Rick Curl, for life for an improper relationship with a teenage swimmer in the 1980s. Curl, who ran one of the nation’s largest swim clubs, near Washington, and coached the 1996 and 2000 Olympic gold medalist Tom Dolan, waived his right to challenge the case. He was accused of starting a relationship with a 13-year-old female swimmer, Kelley Davies Currin, who received a $150,000 settlement from Curl not to go to law enforcement.'"
"'12-09-20,'1','“Those little boys are crying out for help,” said a neighbor, who called the Bureau of Indian Affairs Police but said that officers declined to take a report or notify child welfare officials.Another member of the tribe said that police officers and social workers failed to act after a 9-year-old girl described giving oral sex to a man.Neither the tribe nor the federal government provided current figures on abuse, but in 2007 there were 26 confirmed cases of child sexual abuse and nearly 10 times as many allegations of abuse or neglect. Ms. McDonald said she presided over 20 to 30 cases of child sexual abuse each year. In 2011, fewer than a dozen cases of sex crimes against children were prosecuted by either the tribe or the federal government, which has jurisdiction, according to federal and tribal records.Betty Jo Krenz, a former tribal social worker, said she oversaw 131 children — 100 more than the state’s average caseload. In some instances, members of the tribe say, there are generations of victims from the same family who have been preyed upon by generations of child rapists from other families. Others abuse their own children, including one tribal government employee who publicly complained that his young daughter had bitten his penis, according to a relative of the man and a federal official.Federal agencies, however, have sought to minimize the extent of the problem, including disciplining employees who have spoken publicly about sexual abuse and questioning the competence of others, according to federal and tribal officials.Thomas F. Sullivan, a director of the federal Administration for Children and Families, who has emerged as a crucial whistle-blower, is among those who have been prevented from speaking to reporters, he said. Still, his periodic reports to his superiors in Washington have been blistering.“If we fail in our role as leaders, we will deserve the same condemnation society so correctly applied to those leaders at Penn State and in the Catholic Church who, knowing of the abuse being inflicted on children by their colleagues, did nothing, failing in their basic obligation to protect children,” Mr. Sullivan wrote last month to his supervisors.And weeks before the scheduled federal takeover on Oct. 1 of the reservation’s social service system, which is responsible for the care of the tribe’s sexually abused children, senior staff members at the Bureau of Indian Affairs continued to play down the issue.Hankie Ortiz, deputy bureau director of the Office of Indian Services, said the news media and whistle-blowers had exaggerated the problem. “Their social service program has made steady progress,” Ms. Ortiz said, adding that she was unable to discuss specific cases under privacy laws or because she was unaware of them.Roger Yankton, the tribe’s chairman, did not respond to requests for interviews.But in a letter published last month in The Devils Lake Journal, a local newspaper, tribal officials cast blame on whistle-blowers and a lack of federal money.“The tribe’s elected leaders and its people are well aware of the gravity and difficult nature of these problems,” the letter said, “particularly because we live with their consequences every day.”But members of the tribe say their leadership has often sought to hide abuse.Ms. McDonald said that the police investigated sex crimes against children only if a victim requested hospitalization, and that tribal leaders frequently sought to sway judges’ opinions improperly. She said she was forced to dismiss many cases because social workers forgot to submit required paperwork.“The perpetrators know they can get away with it because the authorities don’t do anything,” said Joanne Streifel, a tribal elder.Among the sex offenders is Quentin Yankton, 61, who stands 6 feet 5 inches and is a brother of the tribe’s chairman. He was first convicted of raping a child in 1976, state records show. In 1992, he was convicted of a similar crime after he forced his 15-year-old niece into sex. The girl became pregnant with twins, and DNA analysis showed that he was the father.Mr. Yankton told the police, according to court documents, that he thought he was entitled to have sex with his niece because she told him that she had previously been sexually abused by her father.Mr. Yankton was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The girl’s father was never prosecuted, but Alfred Longie, 67, a half-brother of the men, was convicted in 2008 for undressing and rubbing the genitals of a 12-year-old who had passed out after he had given her alcohol.Joseph Alberts, 59, who plays Santa Claus for the tribe, was convicted of rape in 1983, and in 1986 was found guilty of committing lewd acts with a child under 14 on four different occasions. He served one year in jail for that crime and 18 months for the rape.In another case, after a woman tried to burn down her house with her 5-year-old daughter inside, the girl was put in a foster home where a sex offender was living, according to Mr. Sullivan and a member of the tribe. Once the foster parent’s criminal record was discovered, the tribe removed the child and put her back in her mother’s home.But when the child proved too much for the mother to care for, Mr. Sullivan said, she sold her daughter back to the family of the registered sex offender for $50 and a ride to Grand Forks.'"
"'12-09-20,'1','What game is being upped, exactly, was not clear on Wednesday.Perhaps it’s one of punctuation. As befitting New York City, where most crosswalk conversing is conducted at the level of a bark, the white thermoplastic lettering includes an exclamation point. London’s signs use no such brusque emphasis.Perhaps it’s one of brevity. In London, the signs command you to “Look Left” or “Look Right.” In New York, the directional guide can be found in the form of Cookie Monster-like irises inside the vowels that indicate the direction of oncoming traffic.Those askance eyeballs were the first thing that Brent Wilson, 40, a geologist from Oklahoma City, noticed on Wednesday as he stood at Second Avenue and East 42nd Street, on his first visit to New York. “That’s good, because being from out of town, you get a little preoccupied.”He’s not alone. Ms. Sadik-Khan said around 9,200 were hurt and 41 killed in distracted driving accidents in the city in 2010, the last year for which information was available.Tourists, dazzled by the sights and sounds of New York, may be at risk, especially if they are from countries like Japan, where driving is done on the other side of the road. Safer streets, though, may put heartthrobs like Ryan Gosling out of sideline work. Last spring, the actor made headlines when he stopped a visiting British journalist from falling victim to a Churchillian fate on Sixth Avenue.Robin Baum, a publicist for Mr. Gosling, said the actor was not available to comment on the city’s new signage.Ms. Sadik-Khan said a corresponding safety campaign for drivers would include advertisements emblazoned on 300 city buses and bus shelters. One ad features horizontal pictures of three pairs of eyes, each looking to a different side as if watching a tennis match. The picture reads, “Mom was right. Look before you cross the street.”It is New Yorkers, with their noses in their smartphones, not directionally confused tourists, who are the most at risk, said Romeo Marishaw, 25, a ticket agent for New York Tours who is stationed in Times Square. “I’ve seen them fall into potholes. I’ve seen them knocked down as they cross the street,” he said of the multitasking pedestrians“What we really need is an app that stops you as you get to a major intersection,” he added. “That would save a lot of lives.”As for Churchill, his story might have been different had there been a curbside cautionary note, but only slightly, his granddaughter said. “He would have found one way or another of having his medicinal brandy,” she said.Correction: September 21, 2012  An article on Thursday about a new traffic safety awareness campaign by the city’s Transportation Department misspelled the surname of the department’s commissioner at two points and misstated, in some editions, the group at which the campaign is directed. As the article correctly noted elsewhere, the commissioner is Janette Sadik-Khan, not Sadik-Kahn. And the campaign is intended for distracted pedestrians and drivers, not “tourists from scores of countries where driving is done on the other side of the road, like Japan and Bhutan, as well as at distracted New Yorkers.” Correction: September 22, 2012  An article on Thursday about a campaign by New York City’s Department of Transportation to remind pedestrians to look both ways misstated the length of Winston Churchill’s stay at Lenox Hill Hospital in 1931 after he was struck by a car on Fifth Avenue after becoming confused about the direction of traffic. As The Times noted in 1931, he was admitted on Dec. 13 and released eight days later, not two weeks later. He recuperated at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel before sailing to the Bahamas on Dec 31. (A similar reference appeared in a May 7, 2006, article about the accident.)'"

"'12-09-20,'1','BERLIN — The European Commission said Wednesday that it was prepared to drop its investigation into the fixing of e-book prices by Apple and four European publishers after the companies agreed to let online retailers like Amazon sell e-books at a discount for two years.The proposed settlement, which will be open to comment from affected businesses for a month, would end the commission’s nine-month antitrust inquiry into Apple and the publishers — Simon & Schuster, a division of the CBS Corporation; HarperCollins, a unit of the News Corporation; Hachette Livre, owned by the French publisher Lagardère; and Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck of Germany. The commission’s antitrust arm opened the investigation in December, and the companies had faced penalties of up to 10 percent of their global sales if they had been found to be fixing prices. One publisher still under investigation, the Penguin Group, owned by Pearson, did not participate in the proposed settlement.The commission contended that the publishers had intentionally set up distribution deals with Apple, which sells e-books through iTunes for iPhones and iPads, to thwart the ability of large online sellers like Amazon to dictate reduced prices for their titles.The proposed settlement echoes a deal reached in the United States in April between the Justice Department and HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster and Hachette. A judge in New York approved the agreement on Sept. 6.One British author, Damien Seaman, said the proposal could open the nascent market for electronic books to lesser-known writers by allowing them to price their novels competitively to attract readers.'"
"'12-09-20,'1','Larry Cohen, president of the communications workers, criticized what he said was Verizon’s hard-line approach, coming when the company had $2.4 billion in net income in 2011 on revenue of $110 billion.Mr. Cohen said that while some unions have lost ground in concessionary contracts, “we’ve maintained our living standards in this contract.”“Because of what’s going on in America, every employer, regardless of its financial wherewithal, believes it’s obligated to cut the costs of front-line employees,” Mr. Cohen said. “But we held our own. This is an incredibly profitable company, and the reality of today in America is if you hold your own, that’s a victory.”Verizon issued a statement praising the deal. “We believe this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as for the future of the wireline business,” said Marc C. Reed, Verizon’s chief administrative officer. “It provides competitive wages, valuable benefits and affordable quality health care while giving the company new flexibility to better serve customers and become more efficient.”The contracts cover workers in Verizon’s traditional landlines operation and its new FiOS Internet and cable operations, but only a handful of workers at Verizon Wireless, the highly profitable cellphone joint venture that is largely nonunion and in which Verizon Communications is the majority shareholder.Verizon originally pushed for a pension freeze for current workers, significantly higher employee contributions for health coverage, an end to all job security provisions and freedom to do as much outsourcing as it wanted.As part of the deal, union officials said, the company will maintain the same level of health coverage and the workers will pay 20 percent of their overall health coverage costs, roughly double the old percentage. That provision is expected to increase out-of-pocket health care costs for family coverage by more than $1,000 a year.Verizon has repeatedly argued that it needed many concessions as a way to reduce costs in its landline business because that division’s consumer base and profit margins have shrunk over the last 10 years. Many customers have dropped fixed-line phones and turned to competing options like mobile phones, cable and Internet calling.In defending the demand for givebacks, Verizon’s chief executive, Lowell C. McAdam, wrote in a letter to employees last year, “The existing contract provisions, negotiated initially when Verizon was under far less competitive pressure, are not in line with the economic realities of business today.”Union leaders said the tentative settlement enabled them to preserve most job security protections and still limit some outsourcing, although some union members could be transferred into different Verizon jobs.Union officials said the raises would total $5,500 over the life of the four-year contracts. They said the typical Verizon union member earns $70,000 a year before overtime.For future hires under the tentative agreements, Verizon would provide a dollar-for-dollar match in 401(k) contributions up to the first 6 percent of pay, and then, depending on the company’s performance, it might add as much as 3 percent more in profit-sharing. Union officials said Verizon also agreed to reinstate 37 workers it had fired after accusing them of misconduct during the 2011 strike.The two unions called their members back after two weeks of striking even though there was no agreement partly because union leaders saw how dug in Verizon had become and partly because they said Verizon had finally agreed to focus on the major issues in the negotiations.Under the settlement, there is no raise for the first year of the contract, which has already passed, a 2.25 percent raise in the second year, 2.75 percent in the third year and 3 percent in the fourth year.The two unions cited Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and George Cohen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, for their work over the last two months in helping to reach the deal.'"

"'12-09-21,'0','Where EMI’s castoffs end up may not be known for months. According to a memo to EMI employees sent on Friday by Roger Faxon, its chief executive, once Universal completes its takeover of most of EMI, artists on labels to be sold will fall under the authority of a “hold separate manager” that will report to a trustee for the commission. (In that memo, Mr. Faxon also announced that he would resign next week.)The sale process can take six to nine months, and potential buyers must have “a proven track record in the music industry,” which would exclude private equity and other bidders.Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, also stressed at a news conference in Brussels that Universal must sell at least two-thirds of the EMI assets it must dispose of to a company that can serve as a credible competitor.Likely buyers include Warner, Sony and BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between Bertelsmann and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Various independents and entrepreneurs in music are also likely to bid.The decision by the European Commission and the F.T.C. was criticized by many of the consumer and independent music groups that have been speaking out against the deal for months. Among their concerns are that Universal, already the largest music company, would gain so much control over the music market that it could dictate terms to new digital services.“It’s good to see that the commission has seen this deal as such a threat to the market that it has demanded and received truly swinging commitments on divestments,” said Martin Mills, chairman of the independent Beggars Group. “However, that should not conceal that fact that Universal’s arrogance has paid off for them, that they have destroyed a significant competitor, and that even with these divestments their ability to dominate and control the market has reached even more unacceptable levels.”Jodie Griffin, staff attorney at Public Knowledge, a digital rights advocacy group, said that by failing to block the merger, “the F.T.C. is allowing UMG to acquire unprecedented market power and amass a dominant collection of copyright holdings. UMG can now use those holdings not just to raise prices for consumers, but also to create a new tax on innovation among digital music services.”For Universal, which agreed to pay Citigroup the full price of EMI regardless of regulatory approval, the value of the deal will be decided by how much the disposed assets will fetch at auction.The value of the assets to be disposed is not clear. The labels in Europe are said to generate about $450 million in annual revenue there, but global rights could add considerably more.“We’ve had enormous interest from the usual suspects,” Mr. Grainge said. “Bertelsmann has been a very aggressive entrant, and there are other trade buyers — experienced, well-known music professionals. We’re in discussions with all of them.”To avoid losing money, Universal and its parent company, the French conglomerate Vivendi, would need to sell assets for as much or more than they paid. According to Vivendi, it paid seven times earnings, a high but not extraordinary price by the standards of other recent music sales.Some analysts believed that the deal may turn out well for Universal, and that the company will still be likely to find significant savings through the merger, even with disposals.“In many ways, Universal and EMI must be reasonably happy,” said Claudio Aspesi, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in London. “They would probably prefer to buy the whole thing, but still they are much better of than they were yesterday.”'"

"'12-09-21,'0','Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, warned Thursday that the first decline in international aid to developing countries in years is jeopardizing the United Nations’ goal of reducing poverty by 2015 in many countries. Official development assistance in 2011 fell to $133 billion, less than half the $300 billion needed annually to meet the goals set by world leaders in 2000, according to a new report on the Millennium Development Goals. Mr. Ban urged donor nations to step up their international aid and fill the $167 billion gap. The report said 16 major donors reduced their aid in 2011, mainly in response to the global economic crisis. The economic downturn also led governments to adopt protectionist trade policies that hurt developing nations, the report said. The Millennium Development Goals include cutting extreme poverty by half, ensuring that every child has a primary school education, halting and reversing the H.I.V./AIDS pandemic, reducing by half the number of people without access to clean water and basic sanitation, and cutting child mortality by two-thirds and maternal mortality by three-quarters. Despite weakening international support, Mr. Ban said, some goals have already been achieved. But the report warned that the $167 billion gap could worsen as a result of the delayed impact from the economic crisis on donors between 2013 and 2015.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','Now Yum Brands, which also owns Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, is introducing its sixth annual World Hunger Relief fund-raiser, to benefit the United Nations World Food Program and other groups.Christina Aguilera will be a spokeswoman, and the effort, which encompasses all three brands, will be promoted in their nearly 38,000 restaurants in more than 120 countries. Rather than donations being tied to buying certain menu items, consumers will be asked when they are at the register whether they would like to contribute, as has been the case since the program began in 2007.“Prior to launching this we did a lot of research with consumers, and the research suggested that we should not try and solve world hunger on the back of a purchase of one of our products at one of our restaurants,” said Jonathan Blum, a Yum spokesman.David C. Novak, the chief executive of Yum, said: “There’s not a profit motive behind this whatsoever. We’re not here to make money, we’re here to attack the issue of hunger, and consumers like the purity of our program.”Asked if the program with Komen might have faced less ridicule if it had been separate from purchases, Mr. Novak responded, “I think that saying it was ridiculed might be a bit of an overstatement,” adding, “We received a lot of positive feedback as well.”He expressed no regret about the earlier KFC program.“It made more than $4 million for a good cause,” Mr. Novak said. “People will criticize you when you do good, people will look for ulterior motives — our philosophy is to do good anyway.”Ms. Aguilera, who has served as a spokeswoman for the effort since 2009, will appear in a public service commercial, online ads, print ads and on in-store posters.The commercial opens with a song by Ms. Aguilera, “The Voice Within,” as an impoverished woman puts a child (both actors) to bed. Tears are streaming down the mother’s face.“Every night, millions of children go to bed hungry, and every night millions of parents can’t find the words to make it all O.K.,” says Ms. Aguilera. “But you can give them a voice at FromHungerToHope.com — and use your voice for good.”The spot, by DraftFCB Chicago, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, will be introduced on Hulu and Hulu Plus on Oct. 1, then will be shown widely on cable networks including MTV, TBS and USA Networks, and online.A 15-second video solicitation produced internally by Yum will appear on a Jumbotron in Times Square throughout October.Yum chains also will have distinct efforts. Musicians in Taco Bell’s Feed the Beat program will highlight the antihunger campaign on their Facebook and Twitter accounts. Feed the Beat gives 100 rising musicians $500 Taco Bell gift cards for meals on the road.On its Facebook and Twitter accounts, KFC will ask followers to pass a virtual KFC bucket to friends for donations, and will contribute $1 for every time they share the bucket.And at Pizza Hut, for $3 to $10 contributions, consumers will receive a free two-week trial subscription for Hulu Plus.Yum’s chains spent a combined $676.2 million on advertising domestically in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.A 2010 study by Cone Communications, an agency that focuses on cause-related marketing, found that 41 percent of consumers had purchased a product within the last year because it was associated with a good cause, up from 20 percent in 1993. Cone also found that 80 percent of Americans were likely to switch to brands that supported a good cause.Craig Bida, an executive vice president at Cone, said clients contemplating a cause-related marketing campaign often mention the Buckets for the Cure campaign with trepidation.The Komen campaign “has become a teaching moment for cause marketers and for the corporate social responsibility space in general,” Mr. Bida said.“The critique that was leveled was that eating fried chicken can make people obese, and that obesity has been linked to cancer,” he continued. “And it is an absolute delight for your critics if they can say you’re helping to create the problem you’re helping to solve.”But Mr. Bida said the antihunger campaign reflected far more positively on the company. “This is a lasting commitment, and the United Nations World Food Program is a blue-chip partner in the space,” he said.It also may better align the business and philanthropic interests of the company. “This is a company whose business mission it is to feed people, and here they’ve taken on a social mission to feed people, too,” Mr. Bida said.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','There were allegations of a White House cover-up, a vote by the House citing Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. for contempt, and contentious Congressional hearings. On Wednesday, the Justice Department’s inspector general issued a scathing report singling out 17 department officials for blame but essentially exonerating Mr. Holder. One of the officials who was singled out, Jason Weinstein, the deputy assistant attorney general in charge of the department’s criminal division, resigned, and a second one, Kenneth E. Melson, who was the acting director of the A.T.F. at the time of the gun operation, retired.Throughout the fight, as politicians repeatedly invoked Agent Terry’s killing, the Terrys sought to grieve in seclusion, but eventually they, too, were sucked into the public debate over who was to blame for the death. His father, Kent Terry Sr., called Mr. Holder a liar on national television after the attorney general’s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee in November. In June, after members of the Congressional Black Caucus walked out during the contempt vote, Kent Terry Jr. released an e-mail that said: “Very sad that our childish government walks out. What kind of respect?”In an interview, Brian Terry’s mother, Josephine, said his death became “a political football,” hurting “like a knife to my chest.”“I don’t look at it as Democrats or Republicans,” she said. “It’s about right or wrong. I just want justice for Brian.”With a picture of her son pinned to her chest, Mrs. Terry, 72, toured the Border Patrol station — only the second in the agency’s history named after a fallen agent — on Tuesday. She smiled as Octavio Arvizu, the supervisory Border Patrol agent, guided her into the gym and said, “Those of you who knew Brian know he’d have loved this place here.”Brian Terry cared meticulously for his chiseled physique, lifting barbells weighing as much as himself and seldom skipping his daily 10-mile runs across the Arizona desert, even when his mother came to visit. His colleagues at the Border Patrol called him “pretty boy.” Geoffrey Howard, 37, a friend he made at a police academy in Michigan, called him Johnny Bravo, after the cartoon character with the pompadour.He also had a more endearing nickname: Superman. He once carried a fellow agent on his back for two miles during a training exercise, trudging and panting over sandy ground to meet a challenge from an instructor.To his siblings — Michelle Balogh, 44; Kent Terry, 43; and Kelly Willis, 39 — he would often say, “Nothing is going to amount to anything if you don’t put in the work,” his mother recalled.His father, who worked for 30 years on a Chrysler assembly line, left them when they were teenagers. Mrs. Terry worked three jobs — as a cook at a hospital and at a retirement home during the week, and in the kitchen of fast-food restaurants on weekends — to make ends meet. She lives in Flat Rock, Mich., south of Detroit, where Brian grew up wanting to be a police officer like his uncle Bob Heyer, who retired as chief of police in nearby Lincoln Park.He joined the Marine Corps out of high school, telling his mother that he was going to amount to something, “no matter how long it takes,” she said. After a stint as a police officer in the suburbs of Detroit, he joined the Border Patrol in 2007, graduating first in a class of 699 recruits. He eventually gained entry into its elite special operations team known as Bortac, which is how he got to come face to face with the Mexican bandits who took his life.Mrs. Terry first heard about Operation Fast and Furious from reporters who started calling for her reaction. Members of Congress had begun asking questions about the operation after hearing from A.T.F. agents about its connection to Agent Terry’s killing. No one from the Justice Department explained to the family the link between the operation and the weapons found at the shooting scene, relatives said.On Monday, Mrs. Terry stood surrounded by politicians and other dignitaries who had gathered at a hotel ballroom in Tucson to raise money for a foundation honoring Agent Terry’s memory.There was Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, who, as chairman of the House oversight committee, helped lead the push for an investigation and who has called Mrs. Terry almost every week to check in on her. There was Representative Ron Barber, Democrat of Arizona, who said, “Standing up for the men and women of the Border Patrol should never be a partisan issue.”John Dodson, one of the whistle-blowing A.T.F. agents, was also there, and he rode in the back of the family’s chartered bus the next morning to join the ceremony at the Border Patrol station. As the bus rolled west on Interstate 10, he mused about whether Mrs. Terry and the rest of the family would ever get the answers they were looking for.“There’s a part of me that believes the system, with all its bureaucracy, politics and political pitfalls, is still just,” he said.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','The European Commission and Universal both declined to comment. Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, said at a conference at Fordham Law School in New York on Thursday that his team was “in the last hours of our assessment” of the deal and would announce its decision on Friday in Brussels. The people briefed on the deal said it was possible that changes could be made at the last minute.The takeover will advance the corporate consolidation of the music industry that has been under way for more than a decade. But for Universal and its parent company, the French media and telecommunications conglomerate Vivendi, the EMI ruling is a painful victory.The negotiations with European regulators went on for months, and by all accounts were tense. Regulators demanded significant concessions to preserve competition and cultural diversity in Europe, and Universal initially was reluctant to give up large pieces of EMI.The difficulty for Universal was rooted in the unusual structure of the deal, which was struck with Citigroup in November: in it, Universal agreed to pay Citi the full price of EMI, regardless of regulatory approval. (Its first payment — about $1.75 billion, or 90 percent — was made earlier this month, and the balance is due when the deal closes.)Citi seized EMI in early 2011 after the label’s previous owner, the private equity firm Terra Firma, defaulted on a $5.4 billion loan. In a parallel deal reached last November, an investor group led by Sony paid $2.2 billion for EMI’s music publishing assets. That deal closed in June.Universal’s agreement with Citi put pressure on its executives to preserve as much of EMI as possible, since the company would face losses if it were forced to sell assets for less than it paid. In addition, Universal had estimated $160 million a year in savings by merging the two companies, but not all of those savings would be realized from a diminished EMI.In late July, Universal offered to sell about two-thirds of EMI’s holdings in Europe, including much of Parlophone and top acts like the D.J. David Guetta. Also included were the former independent labels Chrysalis, Mute and Ensign; EMI Classics and Virgin Classics; EMI’s share of the profitable pop compilation series “Now That’s What I Call Music!”; and EMI’s subsidiary companies in Belgium, France, Sweden and other countries.The divestment package that the European Commission agreed to will include those pieces with some additions, as well as global rights.The damage to Universal and Vivendi could be minimized if Universal can get good prices for the divested assets. Several parties are said to be interested, including BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between Bertelsmann and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Daniel Miller, who founded the Mute label in 1978 and sold it to EMI in 2002, has also expressed interest in buying it back.Universal’s acquisition of EMI has drawn criticism from independent music companies, consumer advocates and Warner Music, one of its major rivals, who contend that Universal would gain too much market power. Already the largest label, with about 30 percent of the worldwide recorded music market, Universal would have about 40 percent if it absorbed EMI whole.Randy Stutz, director of special projects at the American Antitrust Institute, which has asked the F.T.C. to block the deal, said that even with the divestments, Universal’s enhanced size would pose problems for the music industry and for consumers.“Maybe you can fix it so the market share figures aren’t quite as scary, but you’re still down to three major record companies on planet Earth,” Mr. Stutz said. “That means the next great innovator has to negotiate with an even tighter oligopoly if it wants to license the major music catalogs, and that kind of bargaining dynamic doesn’t tend to favor the innovator or, ultimately, the consumer.”'"
"'12-09-21,'0','Two years ago, as public awareness grew along with the number of concussion-related lawsuits involving former players, the N.F.L. and the players union commissioned an independent study that identified three helmet models — the Revolution and the Revolution Speed, both manufactured by Riddell, and the DNA Pro, made by Schutt — as the top performers in protecting against collisions believed to be linked to concussions. But the league did not require nor officially recommend those helmets, opting only to send a memo to teams explaining the results. The reason, a league spokesman said, was that the study was not definitive with regard to actual on-field performance.Additionally, while the N.F.L. holds twice-yearly seminars for team equipment managers, there is no formal oversight of team operations with regard to helmets, leaving the process in the hands of each player and his team.For some players, the choice is easy: the helmet that looks best on TV is the one they want. Giants linebacker Keith Rivers, a five-year professional, said there was no doubt that “a lot of guys go looks first,” preferring more classic models. Modern helmets like the Schutt DNA Pro look “a little Darth Vaderish,” Rivers said, and are turnoffs to some even if they rate higher in safety tests.Other players, particularly veterans, simply wear the helmet models they have always worn, some of which can be outdated. Tony Boselli, an offensive lineman who played in the N.F.L. from 1995 to 2002, said players “just wore what the teams gave us.”“I didn’t even think about asking for something else,” he said.Giants center David Baas, who is in his eighth N.F.L. season, said veterans can be hesitant to change anything related to their equipment. “Some guys don’t want to switch because they’re comfortable in the same one they’ve had since college or whatever,” he said. “I change almost every year to get what’s new, but lots of guys don’t. It’s just not on their radar.”The Giants’ equipment director, Joe Skiba, fills out a profile sheet for each new player, complete with physical attributes, personality traits and equipment preferences, including what type of helmet the player wore previously. Any player who is interested can follow Skiba down a short hallway from the team’s main equipment workshop into a cinderblock-walled room with fluorescent lighting. Inside is a row of tall gray metal racks that slide open electronically, as if in a warehouse.All types of gear fill the shelves, and two of the racks are dedicated solely to helmets. Skiba, a member of the league’s subcommittee on safety equipment and playing rules, said he spent so much time around helmets that he could tell a player’s model simply by looking at the marks the pads left on the player’s forehead. He talks passionately about the intricacies of helmet technology.“If you’re excited about your job and show it, and make it clear that it’s important to you, the players will take that cue,” Skiba said.With 32 N.F.L. teams, however, each with different budgets and equipment staffs, there appear to be variations in how helmet distributions are handled. While some teams, like the Giants, the Atlanta Falcons and the Miami Dolphins, are known as fastidious and well-stocked, the players union has received complaints in recent seasons, according to an official with knowledge of the criticisms, about teams’ having few models available for players to test. This is an important factor, players say, because they are reluctant to ask for a helmet they have not tried in practice.There have also been accusations that teams have failed to obtain requested models in a timely manner, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.The Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs were two of the teams cited, the official said. Rivers, who spent four seasons with the Bengals before joining the Giants, said that in Cincinnati “our team had used a lot of Riddells, and I wanted a Schutt, so I had to complain for a while.”“I finally got one like weeks and weeks later,” he said. “Here, you say what you want and you get it.”The Bengals disputed Rivers’s account and said the team was not aware of any complaints about his helmet procedure. “The Bengals will provide players with any Nocsae-approved helmet they request, and the club handles all expenses,” the team said in a statement. A spokesman for the Chiefs declined to comment.Smith, the head of the players union, declined to identify or address specific complaints but said: “We are aware of disparities, and we have raised it with the N.F.L., not only this year but for the past several years. The fact that there continues to be disparities is unacceptable.”Some observers question whether the league’s 23-year partnership with Riddell sends the wrong message. Because Riddell is the official helmet manufacturer of the N.F.L., it is the only brand name allowed to appear on helmets in use. For the roughly 30 percent of players who use a different brand, the rubberized plate where the brand name would appear contains a team logo.The agreement with Riddell does not include specific provisions for preferred pricing or free items for N.F.L. teams, but as a general league policy, all equipment companies are allowed to provide favorable pricing. This can create perception issues: for example, Riddell offers a program in which a team that outfits a high percentage of its players in Riddell helmets — believed to be roughly 90 percent to 95 percent — is eligible to receive free helmets from the company, perhaps an incentive for budget-minded franchises.Then there is the issue of consistency. When it comes to potentially mandating certain types of helmets beyond the Nocsae standard — based on a yearly study similar to the one the league and the union already commissioned, for example — the league says it believes such a measure would stifle innovation among the manufacturers. Some helmet manufacturers say the opposite would be true.Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina and a member of the N.F.L.’s head, neck and spine committee, said that permitting Riddell to be the only brand identified on the field could also be misleading to fans or to parents considering buying helmets for their children.“I think we need to get away from ‘the’ helmet of the N.F.L.,” Guskiewicz said. “The fact that only one helmet can be advertised, the perception is there that they don’t have a choice. I think we need to educate them about that choice.”A league spokesman said that when the N.F.L.’s agreement with Riddell ends in 2014, the situation will be re-evaluated. Until then, the circumstances surrounding helmet selection seem unlikely to change.Ultimately, it is up to each player to make what is almost certainly the most important health-related equipment choice of his career — even if there is no guarantee that each player will be presented with similar information or options.“This is our livelihood,” Giants quarterback Eli Manning said. “It’s one of the biggest decisions we make.”'"
"'12-09-21,'0','At 5-foot-7, with sea-blue eyes, flowing red hair, chiseled cheeks and a shapely figure, Tedi Thurman was a stunner. But it was her breathy, alluring voice that brought her fame.The “weather girl” on the long-running NBC radio show “Monitor” in the late 1950s and early ’60s, Ms. Thurman would take over the mike and in soft, sultry tones — with lush music in the background — virtually drawl, “Cleveland, 34, snow; Boston, 41, cloudy; Phoenix, 62, fair; New York City, 43, sunny; Paris, 38, cloudy.”But she would always lead with Atlanta, “because Georgia was her home state,” said Dennis Hart, the author of “Monitor: The Last Great Radio Show” (2002), a history of the program, which Pat Weaver, the president of NBC, created in 1955. Starting at 8 a.m. on Saturdays, it originally stayed on the air till midnight on Sundays.Ms. Thurman, who died on Monday at 89, made the forecasts “sound like an irresistible invitation to an unforgettable evening,” Jack Gould wrote in The New York Times shortly after the show’s premiere.In Mr. Hart’s estimation, Ms. Thurman “probably became the most recognizable female voice in the country within a few short months.”With hosts like Dave Garroway, Hugh Downs, Frank Blair, Gene Rayburn, Henry Morgan and Bill Cullen, “Monitor” was a hit, offering an array of news, sports, comedy, variety, music and live remote pickups from around the nation and the world. It lasted 20 years, the first six of which featured Ms. Thurman as the so-called Miss Monitor, updating the weather hour after hour.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A Taiwanese company, AU Optronics, was fined $500 million on Thursday and its former president and executive vice president were each sentenced to three years in prison for their roles in a global LCD screen price-fixing conspiracy.The sentences handed down by a federal judge in San Francisco are among the harshest penalties ever given in an antitrust criminal case. Still, the Justice Department said the punishments were not enough. Federal prosecutors demanded a $1 billion fine for the company and 10-year prison sentences for the executives.Judge Susan Illston said she rejected the prosecutors’ demands because AU Optronics had already paid out millions to settle a class-action lawsuit and still faced other lawsuits in the United States and around the world.She also said the two executives — Hsuan Bin Chen and Hui Hsiung — did not deserve the lengthy prison sentences demanded by prosecutors because they acted not for personal gain but out of their belief that they were aiding a troubled industry plagued by overproduction and plummeting prices. Both men declined to address the court.“There were a lot of business pressures they responded to,” the judge said. “There was relatively little personal motivation.”Nonetheless, Judge Illston said the evidence of their guilt was “overwhelming” and that “they did know it was illegal.”'"
"'12-09-21,'0','The I.A.E.A., Mr. Abbasi was further quoted as saying, deals with Iran as if it is guilty and must “establish its innocence. And this is rejected.“Others accuse us, and the agency seeks to establish these accusations, like what happened with the regime of Saddam Hussein, wanting a legal framework by which to isolate Iran and toughen sanctions on it.”Gill Tudor, a spokeswoman for the agency, declined to comment on Mr. Abbasi’s quoted remarks, which were part of a news report on the Iranian nuclear issue, including a meeting on Tuesday in Istanbul between the top nuclear negotiators for Iran and the big powers. Both sides have said the meeting was constructive, but it was unclear when more talks would be held.Iran has consistently asserted that its uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes and that, as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, it has been transparent about all of its nuclear activities. But critics have long contended that Iran is untrustworthy on the nuclear issue.Iran hid the construction of its Natanz nuclear enrichment plant — until it was revealed by a dissident group — as well as its construction of centrifuges to enrich uranium, until inspectors acting on a tip found them behind a false wall in a Tehran clock factory.Iran revealed a deep underground site in 2009 only when it became clear that the West had discovered it and was about to announce its existence.Iranian officials have refused to answer questions about documents and computer files that suggest Iran has explored how to build a weapon and has researched explosive yields of different nuclear fuels.While Mr. Abbasi’s comments seemed to confirm that some of the answers Iran had provided were false, it remained unclear what kind of abilities it was hiding or overstating.Mr. Abbasi, who was the target of an assassination attempt two years ago in Tehran by what Iranian officials said were Israeli agents, said in a blunt speech at the I.A.E.A. meeting on Monday that the agency had been infiltrated by “terrorists and saboteurs.” He also disclosed two previously unreported bombings at Iran’s top uranium enrichment sites, suggesting that at least one may have been carried out based on information gained through compromised security within the I.A.E.A.The news media in Israel, where the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said it considered Iran its top threat and only months away from achieving atomic bombmaking capability, seized on Mr. Abbasi’s quoted remarks in Al Hayat and his speech, interpreting them as part of an Iranian strategy to further justify its rejection of I.A.E.A. inspection requests.But one Israeli analyst, Uzi Eilam, former director of the Israel Atomic Energy Commission, said it was unclear why Iran would admit to having issued false information. It is particularly perplexing at this stage in what has been a long-running dispute that has escalated in recent months, as new Western sanctions have been imposed on Iran and as Israel has threatened a pre-emptive military strike on Iranian nuclear sites.“It could be that the lies and deceptions have become so transparent that they no longer have any choice and they are now forced to admit to that,” Mr. Eilam said on Israel Radio.Mr. Netanyahu’s publicly expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear work has caused new frictions with the Obama administration, which has refused his request to specify “red lines” of Iranian behavior that would justify a military attack on Iran. President Obama and his aides have said there is still time for the sanctions and negotiations to help resolve the dispute.The Israeli leader has frequently cited public threats by Iran’s government to eradicate Israel as an underlying justification for his militant position toward Iran on the nuclear issue.For Iran’s part, its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has banned nuclear weapons as un-Islamic.Iranian officials also note that Israel is not a signatory to the nonproliferation treaty and possesses an unacknowledged stockpile of nuclear weapons.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','The $250,000 exhibition advances its thesis in formidable detail. There are 222 props, prints, costumes, paintings, sculptures, photographs, posters and other artifacts in a 3,000-square-foot gallery space arrayed over three floors. The three-year effort to mount the show has also produced two colorful books: a massive, 472-page history, “The American Circus” (Yale University Press, $65), and a 208-page exhibition catalog.Circus buffs and fan magazines have kept big-top lore alive, but until recently many museums and historical societies did not deem the itinerant, ephemeral circus worthy of documenting or preserving. “We know much about the development of the arts in New York City, but we know very little about the development of the circus,” said LaVahn G. Hoh, a circus historian who is professor of drama at the University of Virginia (and is not connected to the exhibition).Step right up, then, to the exhibition’s dizzying highlight reel of fanfares. New York’s love affair with circus began when a horse wrangler from London, John Bill Ricketts, established the first true circus in the city on Aug. 7, 1793. The crowd gave it “a general huzzah,” according to reports at the time.Ricketts was so notable that Gilbert Stuart painted him. The portrait, unfinished, of course, with a sadly incomplete depiction of Ricketts’s wonder horse Cornplanter, is on loan for the exhibition from the National Gallery of Art.Historians have long debated whether Dan Rice, the first great American clown (born Daniel McLaren in the Five Points neighborhood of Manhattan in 1823), was an inspiration for the classic personification of Uncle Sam. They can now seek clues at the show from Rice’s red-and-white-striped silk satin pants with velvet trim from 1860.At the heart of the exhibition, it is no surprise, is Phineas Taylor Barnum, the master entrepreneur and colossal hoaxster. Barnum began operating the venerable Scudder’s American Museum of oddities and relics in 1842, transforming it into an eccentric exhibition hall, theater, lecture center and freak show named, naturally, for himself. It was the same year he met Charles Sherwood Stratton, the perfectly formed and perfectly talented dwarf who became the entertainment mainstay Gen. Tom Thumb. The exhibition presents a black silk velvet suit from 1840 worn by the General, as well as his teensy boots and Lilliputian 1845 violin.As for the circus’s influence on marketing, “certainly the circus gave advertising a great subject,” Dr. Weber said, and New York’s printing industry contributed greatly to the popularity of this entertainment early on.But there was also Barnum himself. Given his genius for bunkum, hokum, hooey, hoopla and ballyhoo, “I think we can call Barnum the Shakespeare of advertising,” Professor Hoh said. A telling artifact in the show is a round red, white and black poster from 1875, almost three feet in diameter, featuring a portrait of Barnum, but not his name. The lettering proclaims, simply, “I am coming.”In 1871 Barnum opened his hugely influential Great Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan and Hippodrome in the city; the next year it was billed as “the Greatest Show on Earth.” That circus, Dr. Wittmann said, became a model for the vast railroad shows that the American circus became known for. Barnum merged his show with James Bailey’s in 1881; Barnum died 10 years later, but the Ringling Brothers bought the Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1907, toured the shows separately, then merged them in 1919 into what is today known as the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus.It was Jumbo’s arrival from London in 1882, Dr. Wittmann said, that turned the circus into family entertainment; before that its rowdy bawdiness attracted mostly men. On a poster from the year of Jumbo’s debut, he was called “the children’s giant pet.”“Barnum knew that if you had the whole family there, you could sell them toys and food,” Dr. Weber said.Barnum had also billed the elephant as the “Towering Monarch of His Mighty Race,” setting off Jumbomania. The surviving cross section of Jumbo’s tusk was cut shortly after the animal was killed in a railroad accident in 1885.New York’s status as an immigrant city also shaped the circus. A third of the population was foreign-born, and the rise of immigrant performers to circus stardom “was a Horatio Alger story to immigrant audiences,” Dr. Weber said. Circuses also provided rare progressive role models for New York women in the 19th and early 20th centuries; May Wirth — “the world’s greatest female bareback rider,” in her circus billing — “represented the public face of the New Woman,” Dr. Wittmann said.Dr. Weber pointed out that some of these women “accomplished feats that many men couldn’t do, and they earned salaries equal to, or more than, men.”Photographs and other artifacts in the show offer evidence of the circus’s cannibalizing the city’s popular culture, and popular culture’s reciprocating. In 1926, for example, elephants danced the Charleston. In 1935 the Broadway musical “Jumbo” (by Rodgers and Hart) starred Jimmy Durante and a live elephant. There was also the collaboration of George Balanchine and Igor Stravinsky in a 1942 “Ballet of the Elephants” for Ringling: 50 dancing showgirls and, in pink tutus, 50 dancing elephants. Marilyn Monroe opened the Ringling circus at Madison Square Garden in 1955 by riding a pink elephant. In the photograph — by Weegee and in the exhibition — is she thrilled or terrified?Despite decades of circus continuity in New York, Ringling has been unable to perform in Madison Square Garden since 2010 because of renovations to the arena — and won’t return until 2014. Circus tradition cannot be denied, however. For a fix, the Brick Theater in Brooklyn is hosting its annual New York Clown Theater Festival through the end of the month. And the Big Apple Circus, which made its debut in 1977 and “was important to the resurgence of the one-ring circus,” Dr. Wittmann said, opens its three-month season at Lincoln Center on Oct. 20.As for Ringling, one of its shows will be in Bridgeport, Conn., Oct. 18 through 21. Its 2013 show is booked for 10 days in March at the soon-to-be-unveiled Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The show promises to be faithful to its record of modesty and understatement. Nicole Feld, who with her sister Alana is Ringling’s producer, revealed that the show would trumpet nothing less than the construction of a circus.“The elephants,” she said, “will wear hard hats,” and the show, perhaps in a nod to its new arena, will be titled “Built to Amaze.”'"
"'12-09-21,'0','The fact that the Pakistani government had invited the team to visit constituted a tacit admission that there is a problem, Mr. de Frouville said. “There is acknowledgment that enforced disappearances have occurred and still occur in the country,” he said.The 10-day visit was marked by controversy from the start. Even though the United Nations team enjoys little more than moral authority — Mr. de Frouville was reluctant to even describe it as a “fact finding” mission — it came in for withering criticism in Pakistan’s Parliament and some news media outlets, where right-wing politicians slammed it as a threat to national sovereignty.Some of the witnesses who met with the delegation, including in the Baluch capital, Quetta, told its members that they had been “threatened or intimidated,” Mr. de Frouville said.Speaking to local and international reporters, he appealed to the government “to guarantee the safety of those who have met us and protect them from any form of reprisals, threat or intimidation.”Despite its modest powers, the United Nations mission did bring new attention to a phenomenon that has eluded the efforts of the Pakistani government to solve.Mr. de Frouville noted that a judicial inquiry into the disappearances, started by the Supreme Court in March 2011, had been hampered by the presence of intelligence operatives at hearings, which prevented some witnesses from speaking out.“Some said they had no fear to confront them, whereas others felt intimidated,” he said. He called on the government to hear future testimony in private.The United Nations officials also touched on the delicate issue of prosecutions of perpetrators, urging the government to amend the law so that illegal abductions by agents of the state will become a criminal offense.They called on the government to provide financial aid to the relatives of people who have disappeared, in particular women and children.More contentiously, they recommended that military personnel facing charges connected with the disappearances be suspended from official duty so they can be tried by ordinary courts. Currently, officers are subject only to secretive military courts; the military has staunchly resisted efforts to prosecute them elsewhere.A spokesman for the government could not be reached for comment on Thursday evening.Impunity in Pakistan is a concern “for the whole society,” Mr. de Frouville said, before quoting the mother of a disappeared person who had asked the United Nations officials to convey a message to “all persons in public life” in Pakistan.“If your child disappeared, what would you do?” he said, citing her words.'"

Researchers reported last year in The that the participants who moved to new neighborhoods had lower rates of and than those not offered the chance to move. Beyond the increase in happiness, the new study found lower levels of depression among those who moved.“Mental health and subjective well-being are very important,” said , a sociology professor at Harvard whose 1987 book “The Truly Disadvantaged” pioneered theory about concentrated poverty. “If you are not feeling well, it’s going to affect everything — your employment, relations with your family.”The researchers measured quality of life using participants’ reports of their own well-being. Researchers asked: “Taken all together, how would you say things are these days? Would you say you are very happy, pretty happy or not too happy?”A year after they entered the program, the families who had made the move were living in neighborhoods where about a third of the residents lived in poverty. In contrast, those who were not offered the chance to move lived in neighborhoods where half of the residents lived in poverty.Professor Wilson said it was not surprising that education levels did not change significantly because many of the children who moved remained in the same school districts. And Lawrence Katz, an economics professor at Harvard and one of the study authors, said that the preference for educated workers was so strong that changing neighborhoods did not do much to improve job options for the participants, who were mostly African-American women without college educations.Researchers said that though they did not know why people felt happier after moving, it probably had to do with feeling safer and less stressed. Nearly three-quarters of the families who signed up for the program said they had done so to get away from violence in dangerous neighborhoods.Moving to a neighborhood that was less poor caused families that were making $20,000 a year to feel as happy as families making $33,000 a year, Professor Ludwig said.Even more startling, researchers said, was the finding that families who moved into new neighborhoods that were just as racially segregated as the ones they came from, but were much less poor, reported much larger gains in feelings of well-being than those who moved to much more racially integrated neighborhoods that were nearly as impoverished.That finding, Professor Katz said, is troubling for the future because economic segregation has grown steadily in the , since the 1970s, while racial segregation has been declining.“The increased geographic isolation of the poor appears to have a pure adverse effect on health and well-being,” he said.Improvements in health and well-being caused by moving to areas with less concentrated poverty “is not a magic bullet to eliminate poverty itself,” Professor Katz said. That would require major changes in the American economy. But he said it would improve lives for the families that experience it, and reduce the costs to taxpayers of medical care for them.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','The Dow industrials ended slightly higher on Thursday while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq cut most of the day’s losses in a sign that investor sentiment remained generally positive despite several weak manufacturing surveys from around the world.Pockets of strength included housing, with an index of housing stocks up 0.8 percent, following Wednesday’s gains on better-than-expected housing-market data. The S.& P. energy index rose 0.4 percent, in line with a rally in Brent crude oil prices after a three-day decline. The S.& P. utilities index gained 0.4 percent.“What’s happening in the market is ‘What’s next?’ ” said John De Clue, a global investment strategist at U.S. Bank in Minneapolis. “It’s a classic tug of war between indicators that things are improving and, on the other hand, some things appear to be a little more troubling.”Several economic indicators painted a sobering picture of the global economy. Manufacturing closed out its weakest quarter in three years this month, and the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits held near two-month highs last week. The data followed disappointing manufacturing reports from Europe and China.The S.& P. 500 has gained 5.9 percent since the beginning of August, driven higher mostly by expectations of more stimulus from central banks. A week ago, the Federal Reserve announced its third round of stimulus, or quantitative easing, helping push stocks up last Friday within reach of five-year highs.'"
"'12-09-21,'0','Mr. Litvinenko’s critics had long asserted that he maintained ties with British intelligence services, but those contacts — if they took place — remain murky.At the hearing on Thursday, Sir Robert Owen, a senior judge appointed to oversee the oft-delayed inquest, said: “It has been almost six years since his death in November 2006. Such a delay is regrettable.”“There will be no further delay,” he said, according to Britain’s Press Association news agency. “It is manifestly in the interests of the interested persons, in particular his widow, Marina Litvinenko, and his son Anatoly Litvinenko, of the other interested persons and in the wider public interest that the inquest is brought to a conclusion with due expedition.” He said hearings would begin next year.One part of the evidence to be shown to relatives and other people involved in the case will be a report by Scotland Yard on the events leading up to the poisoning of Mr. Litvinenko, who had become a British citizen only weeks before he died.But Hugh Davies, a lawyer representing the inquiry, said the British government had requested that references in the report as to whether Mr. Litvinenko had contacts with MI6 be kept secret. While those aspects of the police report are known to the coroner and members of the legal team conducting the inquiry, he said, they will not be disclosed to the other parties in the case.He said details of any contacts had “been redacted from the report at the request of Her Majesty’s Government.”“This redaction, of course, should not be taken as indicating one way or the other whether Mr. Litvinenko did indeed have any such contact,” Mr. Davies said.Ben Emmerson, a lawyer representing Mr. Litvinenko’s widow, Marina, said she was “keen that the significance of all the evidence, including that which is redacted, is in one way or another fairly and independently evaluated and that as much as is possible should be made public.”Mrs. Litvinenko wanted to know whether her husband’s death was “a targeted assassination of a British citizen committed by agents of a foreign state in the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom,” the lawyer said.Mrs. Litvinenko, whose husband accused Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian leader, of being responsible for his poisoning, told reporters that she believed that “we will get justice in Britain.”“It was a British citizen killed here, a British soul,” she said. “I’m not a politician, I’m a woman who lost her husband and I want to know what happened.”In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Alexander Lukashevich, told reporters that Russia expected the inquest in London “to give an exhaustive picture of what happened and that it will shed light on all the facts that are needed to reveal the truth,” Agence France-Presse reported.He said Britain’s chief suspect had proved himself innocent by taking a lie-detector test, apparently a reference to a test Mr. Lugovoi reportedly took for a television documentary in April.'"

"'12-09-22,'0','On Friday, Mr. Singh urged people to “not be misled,” framed the moves as essential, if tough, and said they would begin to restore economic growth and help prevent India from falling into the same economic malaise that Europe is in. Economic growth, which topped 8 percent in 2011, is now projected to be as low as 5.4 percent in the current fiscal year. “We are at a point where we can reverse the slowdown in our growth,” he said. “We need a revival in investor confidence domestically and globally.”Hours earlier, Mamata Banerjee, the populist chief minister of the state of West Bengal and once the most crucial regional ally in the governing coalition, formally withdrew her party’s support. On Friday afternoon, with television crews beaming live reports across the nation, Ms. Banerjee’s cabinet ministers submitted their resignations to protest the new economic measures.The departure of Ms. Banerjee’s 19-member parliamentary delegation means that the governing coalition, led by the Indian National Congress Party, has lost its parliamentary majority. However, the coalition will survive, for now, courtesy of support by a two nonaligned regional parties, which extended lukewarm endorsements on Friday.“Our support is clear,” said Mulayam Singh Yadav, a regional leader who told the Indian news media that he would support the government, though not join it.Friday’s machinations dispelled, for the moment, the possibility of the government collapsing or of elections, now scheduled for 2014, being called early. But the Congress Party now faces a complicated governing situation, in which it will need to massage and maneuver around regional leaders like Mr. Yadav, as well as his rival, Mayawati, another powerful figure who is supporting the government and uses only one name.“We have another 18 months to go for the next elections,” said Digvijaya Singh, a general secretary in the Congress Party. “We’ve got sufficient numbers to carry us through.”The prime minister’s appeal to the nation amounted to an effort to reboot his much-maligned government. For roughly two years, the Congress Party has been mired in corruption scandals and widely criticized for arrogance and ineffectiveness, while also overseeing a rapidly declining economy.Mr. Singh, considered the father of India’s first era of economic overhaul in the 1990s, has been accused of failing to lead or to articulate a clear vision for the government. On Friday, Mr. Singh argued that rising global oil prices meant that the government had to reduce popular subsidies on diesel and cooking gas or risk a rapidly higher fiscal deficit.“Where would the money for this have come from?” Mr. Singh asked. “Money does not grow on trees.”Mr. Singh did not mention the weeklong political controversies or the loss of support from Ms. Banerjee. Some analysts predicted that her departure could free the government to push ahead with other economic measures. Palaniappan Chidambaram, the country’s recently appointed finance minister, has signaled that recently announced economic moves will come as soon as next week.To some degree, Ms. Banerjee had held veto power over such initiatives because of her periodic threats to withdraw her party’s support and bring down the government. Last year, she blocked a water treaty with Bangladesh — embarrassing the prime minister and Indian diplomats — and also forced Mr. Singh to reverse himself after his cabinet first approved the plan to open the door to retailers like Walmart.“The government faces a stark choice — stand firmly behind the measures to promote India’s long-term economic interests or back off the reforms in the interests of short-term political survival,” said Eswar Prasad, an economist and an adviser to the Indian government. “The outcome of this battle, and even the way it is fought and ultimately resolved, will reverberate in India’s economic and political arenas for many years to come.”When it became clear on Friday that the government was not bending this time, India’s stock market recorded the biggest gain of the year.'"

"'12-09-22,'0','The Moscow police are searching for a band of vigilante “dog hunters” who have set traps with poisoned meat to kill stray dogs. But the poison has killed pets instead, and on Friday the police opened a criminal investigation. Last week, residents of a Moscow neighborhood complained that several pets had mysteriously died just as warnings to pet owners began to appear in a local park. “If you don’t follow the rules of walking your dog — it will die,” said one of the fliers, a Russian news agency reported. Packs of stray dogs are a common sight in Russia; the government estimates that tens of thousands roam Moscow’s streets. The police say that several dogs have been killed recently, but Moscow residents say that the number is actually in the dozens.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','The Office of Congressional Ethics, a proven force for good on Capitol Hill, is in need of a fresh lease from House leaders if it is to continue conducting discreet preliminary investigations of corruption allegations against lawmakers. The quasi-independent office has tallied an impressive 101 ethics inquiries in its four years of existence.Its unpopularity among lawmakers grows with its caseload, but its record suggests professional evenhandedness, with 32 cases forwarded so far to the House Ethics Committee for further review, and dismissal recommended in 26 other cases. The immediate problem for the office is that four of its six board members must be replaced as soon as the new Congress convenes in January if the investigative watch is to continue. But, of course, this need has not been addressed by current House leaders, who are racing back home for elections.The dismal record of the House Ethics Committee trying to investigate and judge its own colleagues prompted the creation of the O.C.E. after the Abramoff corruption scandal. When Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, was speaker in 2008, she proposed the bipartisan agency to show allegations would not be swept under the rug. While there has been pressure to stop financing the office, John Boehner, a Republican, has also supported the office as speaker.With big-money politics presenting ever greater ethical threats, Congressional leaders must promptly name independent professionals to the oversight agency. The shortcomings of the House’s own Ethics Committee were on display again this week when its poorly handled investigation of Representative Maxine Waters in a banking influence case ended with her exoneration. Lawmakers had to hire an outside counsel to wade through allegations by the committee’s own chief counsel that House staff members had leaked information about the case to Ms. Waters’s political adversaries. The outside lawyer’s services cost taxpayers at least $1 million. That money would have been more effectively spent on the Office of Congressional Ethics, which has already proved it can do a far better job.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','Franklin D. Raines, who resigned as chief executive of Fannie Mae in late 2004 amid revelations of extensive accounting improprieties at the mortgage finance company, has been dismissed from a long-running civil suit brought by Fannie Mae investors hoping to recover damages.The federal judge overseeing the class action, Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, ruled on Thursday that the investors’ lawyers had not proved that Mr. Raines knowingly misled shareholders about the company’s accounting and internal controls, a necessary hurdle for the case against him to continue.“There is not only no direct evidence that Raines intended to deceive Fannie Mae’s investors,” Mr. Leon ruled, “there is no evidence that he even knew his statements were false.” At best, the judge continued, evidence submitted by the shareholders showed that Mr. Raines “acted negligently in his role as the company’s chief executive and negligently in his representations about the company’s accounting and earnings management practices.”The judge said that he would rule on the other defendants in the case soon. They are J. Timothy Howard, Fannie’s former chief financial officer, and Leanne G. Spencer, its former controller.Kevin M. Downey, a lawyer at Williams & Connolly who represents Mr. Raines, declined to comment. So did Steven J. Toll, of Cohen Milstein, the lawyer for the plaintiffs.The investor lawsuit was filed in 2005 on behalf of approximately one million Fannie Mae shareholders who incurred losses after regulators identified pervasive accounting irregularities at the company. Between 1998 and 2004, government investigators found, senior executives at Fannie had manipulated its results to hit earnings targets and generate $115 million in bonus compensation. The company had to restate its earnings, reducing them by $6.3 billion.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','But there is also a less obvious — yet possibly more important — reason that Apple’s best days may soon be behind it. When Jobs returned to the company in 1997, after 12 years in exile, Apple was in deep trouble. It could afford to take big risks and, indeed, to search for a new business model, because it had nothing to lose.Fifteen years later, Apple has a hugely profitable business model to defend — and a lot to lose. Companies change when that happens. “The business model becomes a gilded cage, and management won’t do anything to challenge it, while doing everything they can to protect it,” says Larry Keeley, an innovation strategist at Doblin, a consulting firm.It happens in every industry, but it is especially easy to see in technology because things move so quickly. It was less than 15 years ago that appeared to be invincible. But once its Windows operating system and Office applications became giant moneymakers, Microsoft’s entire strategy became geared toward protecting its two cash cows. It ruthlessly used its Windows platform to promote its own products at the expense of rivals. (The Microsoft antitrust trial took dead aim at that behavior.) Although Microsoft still makes billions, its new products are mainly “me-too” versions of innovations made by other companies.Now it is Apple’s turn to be king of the hill — and, not surprisingly, it has begun to behave in a very similar fashion. You can see it in the patent litigation against Samsung, a costly and counterproductive exercise that has nothing to do with innovation and everything to do with protecting its turf.And you can see it in the decision to replace Google’s map application. Once an ally, Google is now a rival, and the thought of allowing Google to promote its maps on Apple’s platform had become anathema. More to the point, Apple wants to force its customers to use its own products, even when they are not as good as those from rivals. Once companies start acting that way, they become vulnerable to newer, nimbler competitors that are trying to create something new, instead of milking the old. Just ask BlackBerry, which once reigned supreme in the smartphone market but is now roadkill for Apple and Samsung.Even before Jobs died, Apple was becoming a company whose main goal was to defend its business model. Yes, he would never have allowed his minions to ship such an embarrassing application. But despite his genius, it is unlikely he could have kept Apple from eventually lapsing into the ordinary. It is the nature of capitalism that big companies become defensive, while newer rivals emerge with better, smarter ideas.“Oh my god,” read one message I saw. “Apple maps is the worst ever. It is like using MapQuest on a BlackBerry.”'"
"'12-09-22,'0','“Congressman Murphy has spent two weeks in cover-up mode, but you can only cover up so much dishonesty,” Corry Bliss, Ms. McMahon’s campaign manager, said.Webster Bank has said there was nothing unusual in the transaction and demanded a retraction.The McMahons themselves were more than a month and a half late in paying the first half of their annual $54,110 property tax payment on their 3,900-square-foot penthouse duplex at Trump Parc Tower in Stamford. The year’s bill was paid in full on Friday, according to the Stamford tax office. Ms. McMahon’s campaign said no bill had arrived until Sept. 13.One difference between the campaigns remains Ms. McMahon’s ability to flood the airwaves with seemingly limitless advertising that was first intended to soften her image, and that now batters Mr. Murphy daily.Between her 2010 campaign against Richard Blumenthal and the current race, she has spent more personal wealth — about $70 million — to win a Senate seat than anyone in history. The question now is whether this race will be a rerun or end differently from 2010, when she spent $50 million against Mr. Blumenthal and still lost by 12 percentage points. Both sides this time expect a much closer vote.Ms. McMahon’s aggressive campaign, and polls showing a tight race, led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which had hoped to avoid spending money in Connecticut, to make two purchases of advertising, $320,000 each, this month. Democrats also brought in a new press person for Mr. Murphy’s campaign, and the campaign changed advertising companies.“Murphy has had the political equivalent of the 82nd Airborne parachuted into Connecticut,” said Chris Healy, former chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party and now a political consultant.Ms. McMahon has outspent Mr. Murphy and Democratic groups on television advertising by about five to one. But Senator Blumenthal said the Murphy campaign did not have to match her spending.“He won’t need the tens of millions his opponent will spend,” Mr. Blumenthal said. “All he needs is enough to set the record straight.”In recent weeks, the Murphy campaign and the Democratic Party have tried to remind voters of World Wrestling Entertainment’s sometimes seamy history, something the company has tried to scrub from the Internet: in one video, necrophilia was simulated, and in another, Mr. McMahon ordered a female performer to get down on her knees and bark like a dog. The company says the material does not reflect its current G and PG content.And the Murphy campaign has tried to use the bankruptcy revelations to blunt Ms. McMahon’s plain-folks story of overcoming hard times.“Shouldn’t she have paid back the people she owed money to before going out and purchasing a power boat she named the ‘Sexy Bitch,’ a Vegas condo, a Boca condo, two Bentleys and an Aston Martin, three motorcycles, a $7 million Greenwich mansion and much, much more with her hundreds of millions of dollars?” the Murphy campaign said in a statement Friday.Still to come are debates. Mr. Murphy has agreed to nine, Ms. McMahon to four.Also uncertain is how much the presidential race could affect the election. A Quinnipiac University poll in August showed President Obama leading by only 7 percentage points in a state he won by 22 points in 2008. A poll by the University of Connecticut and The Hartford Courant released this week showed his lead at 21 points. Analysts say a huge Obama victory in the state could make it much harder for Ms. McMahon to buck that tide.Her campaign says the race is about jobs in Connecticut, not about presidential politics. This week she tried to distance herself from Mitt Romney’s controversial remarks about the nearly half of Americans who do not pay income taxes.“I know that the vast majority of those who rely on government are not in that situation because they want to be,” Ms. McMahon said in a statement.But Democrats said that with control of the Senate at stake, there was nothing in her background that indicated she disagreed with her party on this or other issues.“She’s desperately trying to distance herself from it, but Linda McMahon has embraced the Romney agenda and the Romney worldview,” said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','In announcing the changes, the corporation formed by Mr. Rechnitz to back his project, New York City Fieldhouse Inc., sought to play up portions of the project dedicated to athletic endeavors familiar to residents of Brooklyn, like basketball and yoga, and to play down the centrality of track cycling to the plan. Absent from its statement on Thursday was any mention of the word “velodrome.”“Velodrome is the name of the track,” Ms. Connelly said by way of explanation. “We’ve always said the cycling track is a distinctive feature of this facility, but not the only one.”Among the other uses suggested in the latest plans, she said, are summer camps for children, athletics space for nearby public and private schools, and recreational space for a wide variety of sports and activities including basketball, volleyball, double Dutch, graduations and community fairs.Lifting the velodrome would add 3,000 more square feet of space for those activities, for a total of 25,000 square feet. Conceptual designs are not set to be released until the late fall.For Anton Marchand, who runs a girls’ basketball league in Fort Greene, the new building would be welcome. “It’s a place that would be great for us,” he said of the field house. “There just aren’t many facilities in Brooklyn to use.”But local critics of the plan did not appear greatly placated by the design changes.“None of the questions that were most important to the community were answered,” said Ms. Zimmerman, who worried about the footprint of the building, its long-term financial viability and the impact on local traffic. “Once the building is up, it’s up for decades to come.”Mr. Rechnitz, a cyclist and the grandson of philanthropists, declined to be interviewed and has not made public appearances to discuss the field house plan.He does, however, appear in the October issue of Forbes magazine, where his large gift landed him a spot among a list of “philanthropy’s next generation.”'"

"'12-09-22,'0','The pale outlines of Japan were all there, but Miuccia Prada insisted that she hadn’t started there. Designers don’t like to be too explicit. Backstage, she was talking to reporters about dreams, nostalgia, toughness. The words blew away.Down a narrow flight of stairs to the principal dressing area, a mess of girls, still in crimson lip makeup and Guido Palau baby beehives, talked loudly and laughed with the crew before they moved on; outside Prada’s headquarters, dozens of young people were waiting to ambush them, to demand photos and autographs, all those intense, giddy faces melting into one big crush.What would they think of those red lips?“The key to the lips was they were about twice the actual size,” said the show’s makeup artist, Pat McGrath. She used CoverGirl’s Lip Perfection, a shade called Hot, and filled in the cupid’s bow with white to bring out the lips, and to relate to the illustration effect of the show’s white-etched flowers on black or bottle-green silk. Eye shadow and mascara was scaled back. “It was all about the sexy, passionate mouth,” Ms. McGrath said.In one way or another, the best of the spring collections are drawing a bull’s eye around sex: Marc Jacobs. Narciso Rodriguez. Tom Ford. Christopher Kane. Now Prada. Pull my daisy, indeed.Ever the bookworm, Ms. Prada took two historical modes — 1960s minimalism and traditional Japanese dress —and collapsed them into shapes that looked completely new. This collection seemed more thought-out than some of her recent ones, with a greater feeling of true design and less archival heaviness.While Ms. Prada may not have started with Japanese culture, as she claimed, the kimono and obi were nonetheless persistent shadows in the sash-tied skirts and boxy coats, and later in the off-the-shoulder satin evening coats and flat-folded hems.Her ’60s references were the austere, dowdier ones: Jackie Kennedy in black couture silk for a visit to the Vatican rather than Twiggy stick figures. But, again, it was how Ms. Prada broke down these shapes and recombined them that made this collection relevant.One is tempted to say it will sell like hot cakes. In part, that’s because Ms. Prada offered a wide variety of shapes and hemlines, despite a concise framework, and because the flowers never got boring. She did them as spindly stems, as if drawn; as large satin appliqués (a bit like cockades); and as girlish wallpaper blooms on old-girl, straight-line fur coats. And for that trendy, bankable Prada touch, there were flower-etched bags and kid-leather socks in pink, white or gold with beefed-up Japanese sandals.'"

"'12-09-22,'0','Nonetheless, officials of the group, including its leader in , Maryam Rajavi, had been slow to cooperate with a plan to empty Camp Ashraf, as demanded by Iraq, and await resettlement to other countries. In recent months, M.E.K. officials had repeatedly delayed planned convoys, complaining about what they described as poor living conditions at the camp.The group’s lawyers had challenged the terrorist listing in court, and Mrs. Clinton faced an Oct. 1 deadline to make a decision.Presumably it did not hurt the group’s case that among the dozens of prominent American supporters were and , former C.I.A. directors; , the former F.B.I. director; President ’s homeland security secretary, , and attorney general, ; and ’s first national security adviser, Gen. .It even enlisted journalists as speakers, including , of Watergate fame, and Clarence Page, a columnist for The Chicago Tribune.Many of the American supporters, though not all, accepted fees of $15,000 to $30,000 to give speeches to the group, as well as travel expenses to attend M.E.K. rallies in Paris. , the former Democratic governor of , said in March that he had been paid a total of $150,000 to $160,000.Mr. Rendell said then that his speaking agency had received a subpoena for records of his payments from the , which appeared to be examining whether the payments were legal. He said he believed they were legal because they came from Iranian-American supporters and not from the M.E.K. itself. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to say whether any investigation is continuing.But Mr. Rendell and others said that while the offer of lucrative speaking fees may have first drawn them to the group’s cause, they became convinced that it was unfair and dangerous to leave the group on the terrorist list.“Yes, I was paid to speak at certain events,” said Philip J. Crowley, who served as an assistant secretary of state from 2009 to 2011. “But what drove me was the humanitarian issue of getting them safely out of Iraq and the strategic importance of Iran for the United States.”The terrorist label imposed in 1997, the supporters said, was outdated and might be interpreted as a green light by Iraqis or Iranian agents to attack the group. The group did commit terrorist attacks in the 1970s and 1980s, first against the government of the shah of Iran and later against the clerics who overthrew him, and several Americans were among those killed.It allied itself with Mr. Hussein, the Iraqi dictator, who permitted it to operate from Camp Ashraf. But while some news reports have suggested its involvement in the recent assassination of Iranian scientists, American officials have not confirmed the claim, and by most accounts the group has not committed acts of violence for many years.Shahin Gobadi, an M.E.K. spokesman in Paris, said the group had received no official word of the delisting. He said the terrorist designation was “a gift to the mullahs’ regime and greatly assisted prolonging the rule of the religious dictatorship ruling Iran.”Some members of Congress have become outspoken advocates for the M.E.K., which originally embraced a hybrid of Marxism and Islamism, but now speaks of democracy. They accept its claim to be “the main organized opposition” to Iran’s clerical rulers.Representative , Republican of , welcomed Mrs. Clinton’s decision, which was formally delivered Friday. “The lives of hundreds of the M.E.K. misplaced persons could well be saved as result,” he said. “It took a while, but in the end Secretary Clinton made the right decision, and for that we are grateful.”Mr. Rohrabacher said the group seeks “a secular, peaceful, and democratic government.”By contrast, the National Iranian American Council, which has long feuded with the group, denounced the delisting decision, saying that it “opens the door to Congressional funding of the M.E.K. to conduct terrorist attacks in Iran” and “makes war with Iran far more likely.” The statement compared the M.E.K. to , the Iraqi exile who helped persuade the Bush administration to invade Iraq.Karim Sadjadpour, an expert on Iran at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he thought the M.E.K. was less important than either its backers or critics claimed.“They’re widely viewed as a backward and intolerant cult by their opposition peers in Iran,” he said. After the terrorist label is dropped, Mr. Sadjadpour said, “I don’t think the world really looks that much different. U.S.-Iran relations will remain hostile, and the M.E.K. will remain a fringe cult with very limited appeal among Iranians.”About 100 of the group’s members are expected to stay at Camp Ashraf for now, with permission of the Iraqi authorities to oversee the group’s property there, American official said.Meanwhile, United Nations officials are interviewing those members at the Camp Liberty site and have granted refugee status to several hundred of them. United Nations officials are now looking for countries that will accept them.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','That is a not a lot of money considering the risks. (Mr. Birkenfeld will probably pocket around $40 million, if the usual third of his award goes to his lawyers and 40 percent of what is left goes to taxes.)Still, the interest in inducing whistle-blowers to come forward is on the rise. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission created the Office of the Whistleblower. It began operating in August 2011, and received 2,700 tips in the first year, said Sean McKessy, chief of the office.“Not every tip was a home run, but I’ve been surprised by the quality,” he said. “We require that people sign a declaration under penalty of perjury that the information they are submitting is true. It’s a control. We didn’t want to be inundated with nonsense.”Last month, the office made its first award of $50,000, which was a third of the fine collected. Mr. McKessy defended what was a meager sum by whistle-blower standards, saying he would be happy if his office consistently paid out small sums over many years. “That will show that we’re getting to things before they get to a catastrophic level,” he said.So if you still want to be a whistle-blower, what should you do?The short answer is to think long and hard about it. All the lawyers I talked to — and they’ve all made millions of dollars from cases like these — said they discouraged anyone who walked into their offices from becoming a whistle-blower. Doing the right thing, they said they tell their visitors, will be emotionally costly, even if there’s eventually a monetary award.“There is a 100 percent chance that you will be unemployed — the question is, Will you be forever unemployable?” said Patrick Burns, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against Fraud. “The other 100 percent factor is the person who fired you, the person who designed and implemented the fraud, won’t be fired. He’ll probably be promoted again.”Stephen M. Kohn, one of Mr. Birkenfeld’s lawyers and the author of “The Whistleblower’s Handbook,” said that despite laws to protect whistle-blowers against retaliation, companies still marginalized and harassed employees who came forward.Then, there is the length of these trials to consider. Mr. Phillips said he spent 10 years representing two of the whistle-blowers in a case against GlaxoSmithKline that centered on accusations that it promoted its antipsychotic drugs for unapproved uses. The case was settled in July for $3 billion.There was a divide on how much the award mattered to whistle-blowers. Mr. Kohn said the rewards were often the deciding factor in whether to go ahead with a case.Other people said whistle-blowers were motivated more by the desire to right a wrong, particularly in instances where people’s lives were at risk. “When people talk about the big whistle-blower payouts, I say, you don’t get it,” Mr. Burns said. “You don’t see the train of pain I see every day. They can’t tell you their story without quivering and crying, even though they’re millionaires.”But since the failure rate of these cases is so high — 80 percent are not pursued by the Justice Department program — whistle-blowers want confidentiality. That is not always possible.When people come forward under the False Claims Act, their identity may be protected at first, but since they are essentially filing a case on behalf of the United States, it will eventually come out.When people send claims to the I.R.S. and S.E.C. programs, these are considered administrative actions, not cases, which gives whistle-blowers a better chance of anonymity.“We can’t guarantee their name won’t come out since they may be called as a witness,” said Stephen A. Whitlock, director of the I.R.S. Whistleblower Office. “Generally when it does get out, it’s because of something the whistle-blower did, not something we did.”So who makes a good whistle-blower? Someone who has a lot of detailed information that the government could not learn about otherwise. But since the people who have that kind of information are usually high-ranking and have a lot to lose, they are not easy to find.This is where Mr. Kohn said the headline-making awards were so important. “It’s pie in the sky,” he said. “But it is what it takes to have an employee risk everything.”Mr. Birkenfeld’s award, though, is complicated. Depending on your point of view, he is either a felon who was complicit in the crime he reported and does not deserve his reward or he is a new type of whistle-blower — one with knowledge of a complicated crime that came from being part of it.His lawyer said paying a reward to someone like Mr. Birkenfeld sent a positive message. “These laws are designed to induce those who may have been participants and done lots of bad things for years to come forward,” he said. “They’re designed to instill distrust among the conspirators, especially in a complex white-collar fraud.”Mr. Birkenfeld is being credited with unlocking billions of dollars of tax revenue that had been hidden in offshore banking accounts.By law, the I.R.S. cannot comment on individual cases. But in general, it said that to get good information, it may need to rely on people who do bad things. “The people who will know what is going on often times don’t have clean hands,” Mr. Whitlock said. “The law recognizes that, and that’s O.K.”Mr. Kohn, who started defending whistle-blowers in the 1980s, said there were still a few whistle-blowers who would risk everything without any chance of a reward. He cited another client, Richard Convertino, a former assistant United States attorney in Detroit, as an example of just how messy these suits can become.Mr. Convertino prosecuted the first post-Sept. 11 terrorism case against a sleeper cell in Detroit. He won a conviction of three of the four men involved, but in 2003 he was removed from the case. The convictions were later overturned after he was charged with withholding evidence. Mr. Convertino said that he did not withhold information and that the Justice Department tried to discredit him because he was talking to Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa who is a champion of whistle-blowers, about failings in the Justice Department’s war on terror.Even though the criminal case brought by the government against him was thrown out, Mr. Convertino said he had spent his life’s savings on nearly a decade of litigation to clear his name. And while he is working as a lawyer, he is not earning close to the $130,000 he made as an assistant United States attorney.Still, he won a small victory in June when the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reinstated his case to determine the identity of the person who leaked information about an internal government investigation about him.“I think we’re going to prevail,” he said. “I’m not going to get $104 million. But I’ll get a different pot of gold that is more important to me. I’ve lost everything, but I haven’t lost me.”'"
"'12-09-22,'0','TOKYO — Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda fended off a challenge to his leadership of Japan’s governing party on Friday, but his victory may be short-lived amid a parliamentary impasse, a damaging feud with China and dismal poll ratings that bode ill for his party’s fortunes in the next elections.Mr. Noda’s re-election as president of the Democratic Party of Japan underscored the party’s lack of choices as it seeks to hang on to power after two weak prime ministers. Indeed, Mr. Noda may have been elected simply to spare the Democrats the humiliation of burning through three prime ministers in three years.Mr. Noda has won a second term as party leader at an unenviable time. An escalating territorial dispute with Beijing over a set of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea has prompted protests across China, threatening to damage relations with Japan’s biggest trade partner.He also faces a standoff in Parliament, where the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party has moved to block almost every policy move. He pushed through a contentious increase of the sales tax to 10 percent, but only after promising to dissolve Parliament and call nationwide elections “soon.”That is a vote that the governing Democratic Party appears unlikely to survive. Mr. Noda’s popularity ratings are in the low 20s, hurt by his failure to break through the parliamentary gridlock, to stimulate the economy and, more recently, to take a decisive stand on Japan’s nuclear energy policy.His party has lost more than 75 lawmakers during his term and is in danger of losing its majority in Parliament’s powerful lower chamber.'"
"'12-09-22,'0','Where EMI’s castoffs end up may not be known for months. According to a memo to EMI employees sent on Friday by Roger Faxon, its chief executive, once Universal completes its takeover of most of EMI, artists on labels to be sold will fall under the authority of a “hold separate manager” that will report to a trustee for the commission. (In that memo, Mr. Faxon also announced that he would resign next week.)The sale process can take six to nine months, and potential buyers must have “a proven track record in the music industry,” which would exclude private equity and other bidders.Joaquín Almunia, the European competition commissioner, also stressed at a news conference in Brussels that Universal must sell at least two-thirds of the EMI assets it must dispose of to a company that can serve as a credible competitor.Likely buyers include Warner, Sony and BMG Rights Management, a joint venture between Bertelsmann and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Various independents and entrepreneurs in music are also likely to bid.The decision by the European Commission and the F.T.C. was criticized by many of the consumer and independent music groups that have been speaking out against the deal for months. Among their concerns are that Universal, already the largest music company, would gain so much control over the music market that it could dictate terms to new digital services.“It’s good to see that the commission has seen this deal as such a threat to the market that it has demanded and received truly swinging commitments on divestments,” said Martin Mills, chairman of the independent Beggars Group. “However, that should not conceal that fact that Universal’s arrogance has paid off for them, that they have destroyed a significant competitor, and that even with these divestments their ability to dominate and control the market has reached even more unacceptable levels.”Jodie Griffin, staff attorney at Public Knowledge, a digital rights advocacy group, said that by failing to block the merger, “the F.T.C. is allowing UMG to acquire unprecedented market power and amass a dominant collection of copyright holdings. UMG can now use those holdings not just to raise prices for consumers, but also to create a new tax on innovation among digital music services.”For Universal, which agreed to pay Citigroup the full price of EMI regardless of regulatory approval, the value of the deal will be decided by how much the disposed assets will fetch at auction.The value of the assets to be disposed is not clear. The labels in Europe are said to generate about $450 million in annual revenue there, but global rights could add considerably more.“We’ve had enormous interest from the usual suspects,” Mr. Grainge said. “Bertelsmann has been a very aggressive entrant, and there are other trade buyers — experienced, well-known music professionals. We’re in discussions with all of them.”To avoid losing money, Universal and its parent company, the French conglomerate Vivendi, would need to sell assets for as much or more than they paid. According to Vivendi, it paid seven times earnings, a high but not extraordinary price by the standards of other recent music sales.Some analysts believed that the deal may turn out well for Universal, and that the company will still be likely to find significant savings through the merger, even with disposals.“In many ways, Universal and EMI must be reasonably happy,” said Claudio Aspesi, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in London. “They would probably prefer to buy the whole thing, but still they are much better of than they were yesterday.”'"

"'12-09-23,'0','At first, the Clemson offense appeared circuslike in how each player’s movement was purposeful and elaborate. Boyd faked handoffs and throws. Running backs and receivers motioned and swept around him. Although, when the whirlwind ended, most times a ball carrier emerged free, or a receiver broke open, with room to run.It was the mark of genius play design wedded to matched talent. This was best exemplified when Clemson (3-1, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) opened the third quarter: on a double pass, Boyd threw to Watkins, who found Ellington open on the other side of the field for a 52-yard score.These Tigers were not Murray State, Savannah State or Wake Forest — Florida State’s first three opponents — who, combined, had managed one field goal, and whose ineptness had required Manuel to play six and a half quarters.Clemson scored on a 60-yard touchdown pass a minute 26 seconds into the game. Not just quick, it looked easy. It went that way for both teams for most of the night.At the half, the Tigers led, 21-14, but Seminoles kicker Dustin Hopkins had hooked a 37-yard field goal left and had missed a 44-yarder wide right. They had also muffed a punt and allowed a fake field goal to result in Clemson touchdowns.A breakneck pace had been set. After the double-pass touchdown, though, Boyd and Clemson skidded, punting four times, and Manuel sped on.“It’s his fifth year here; he’s seen it all,” Bryan Stork, the Seminoles’ center, said of Manuel this week. “He’s the man now.”Completing 27 of 35 passes, Manuel stayed accurate, finishing with a career-high 380 yards and 2 touchdowns. Riding Manuel in the third quarter, Florida State (4-0, 2-0) scored three touchdowns and took the lead for good.Having heard some critics question Manuel’s resolve, Wilder said, “I think he just shut everybody up.”Thompson sidestepped defenders as if a joystick controlled him and Wilder scored two touchdowns himself.In all, Manuel completed passes to eight receivers. Compared with Clemson’s flash, Manuel’s play was traditional but effective. His most frequent target was Thompson, who touched the ball 23 times for 182 yards and 2 touchdowns.Thompson had missed eight games last season with two broken vertebrae but ran for 197 yards last week against Wake Forest. Like his team, he maybe needed to prove the early dominance had been no fluke.Much was at stake as the last three winners of this game had eventually won the Atlantic division and played for the A.C.C. championship. But neither team has thrived under expectations lately. A comfortable, good but not elite, level of football had plagued the end of Bobby Bowden’s storied coaching career, and it had seeped into the start of Fisher’s. Not since 2000 has Florida State lost fewer than three games.Across the field, Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney had led the Tigers to 10 wins last season — their most since 1990. The resulting 70-33 Orange Bowl loss to West Virginia lingered Saturday, still framing its offense as potent in getting to the bowl and its defense as porous in being thumped.Now Florida State and Clemson were considered the A.C.C.’s best, expected, perhaps if the A.C.C. had its way, to put on a show on prime-time television.Fisher, as he sat down for his postgame news conference, said, “Well, I’ll say this: everybody got their money’s worth.”'"

"'12-09-23,'0','After scoring a season-high 91 points, the Liberty enter Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Thursday with the kind of momentum Whisenant referred to when he spoke about the reigning Super Bowl and World Series champions. Trailing by 50-40 at the half, the Liberty did not rest their starters and began the third quarter with a 22-2 run. A majority of the points were scored as a result of turnovers caused by the defense, with the Liberty shutting down fast-break opportunities.Leading the defensive charge was Essence Carson, who kept the Liberty offense afloat in the first half with 14 points.“Their point guards are like trying to catch a mosquito in your hand,” Whisenant said after the game. “They’re so quick. I just about played Essence’s wheels off. I hope I didn’t hurt one of her wheels in the end.”Carson, who strained her right hip in the fourth quarter in a collision with Tulsa’s Temeka Johnson, said she felt good after the game and had no doubts that she would be able to play Thursday.The Connecticut Sun, the top seed in the East, play their final game on Sunday when they host the Atlanta Dream. Connecticut holds a 4-1 advantage over the Liberty this season.Whisenant said his team had a tendency to fall asleep and allow the Sun to go on big runs this season, but he was confident that if the Liberty executed on both sides of the ball, as they did in the second half Saturday, they could pull another upset.“If we play right, we can play with them,” he said.Pondexter added: “I’m not thinking about getting down, period. The only thing I’m thinking about is stealing Game 1.”Another positive sign for the Liberty, who went 6-3 during September, was their work on the boards Saturday, as they outrebounded Tulsa, 44-26. The Liberty also shot 50 percent from 3-point range. The Sun are led by Tina Charles, who is averaging 10.5 rebounds a game and could clinch her third consecutive rebounding title Sunday.“Connecticut has whipped us on the boards badly,” Whisenant said. “That’s a critical component for us to have success against them.”Carson, who finished with eight rebounds, agreed, saying the Liberty had to “handle our own on the boards.”“We didn’t get here just because two other teams were worse than us,” Carson said. “We got here because we worked hard and fought hard together and we’re one of the best in the league.”'"

"'12-09-23,'0','In a separate local television interview, Mr. Ryan also explained how he had come to change his mind and since 2007 has supported the embargo.“You learn from friendships,” Mr. Ryan told the crowd at Versailles, explaining that his Florida friends in Congress had shown him “just how brutal the Castro regime is, just how this president’s policy of appeasement is not working.”Mr. Ryan argues that the Obama administration has been too willing to engage with Cuba and has made it too easy to travel back and forth and send money to Havana from the United States. He vowed that a Romney-Ryan administration would be “tough on Castro” as well as on Hugo Chávez, the Venezuelan leader.An aide said Mr. Ryan’s evolution was not hard to understand: when he began in Congress he considered the issue primarily through the prism of constituents in southern Wisconsin who worried about export markets for agricultural products. But gradually, the aide said, Mr. Ryan’s views evolved to consider more heavily the embargo’s national security implications, and that he has explicitly supported the embargo for the past five years.An Obama campaign official took strong issue with Mr. Ryan’s characterization of the administration’s Cuba policy, saying that Mr. Obama “has repeatedly renewed the trade embargo with Cuba, pressured the Castro regime to give its people more of a say in their own future, and supported democracy movements on the island.”The official also said that the administration had “put in place common-sense, family-based reforms that allow Cuban-Americans to visit their family members still living in Cuba.”Later in the day, Mr. Ryan spoke to 2,000 supporters at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, drawing ovations and what seemed universal approval from the cheering crowd. It was a stark contrast to his appearance the day before at the AARP convention in New Orleans, where he was booed for making many of the same arguments about Medicare and the Obama administration.As he had in Miami, Mr. Ryan also began with a particularly local appeal to voters, arguing that the Romney-Ryan ticket would be better than the Obama administration for space exploration, long an economic driver in central and eastern Florida. (The Obama campaign quickly issued a statement asserting that Mr. Ryan repeatedly voted against NASA funding and that Romney-Ryan budget cuts could trim space-exploration financing by 19 percent.)Using PowerPoint slides projected onto the wall of the arena, and with a national debt clock ticking behind him, Mr. Ryan put on a tutorial embraced by the crowd about the dangers of the national debt and government spending. “We can’t afford four more years of the last four years,” he said.And he ended with what has become an effective talking point for his campaign, seizing on recent comments by Mr. Obama about how hard it is to change Washington from the inside.“Don’t we send presidents to Washington to change Washington, to fix the mess in Washington?” Mr. Ryan asked. “When President Obama admits that he cannot change Washington, then we need to change presidents.”While Mr. Ryan was on the stump in Florida on Saturday, the top of the Republican ticket was in California raising money in the hopes of recovering his fund-raising advantage.In August, Mr. Obama and the Democratic Party raised more than Mr. Romney and the Republican Party. And much of the more than $300 million the campaign reported raising this summer is earmarked for the Republican National Committee, state Republican organizations and Congressional races, limiting the money Mr. Romney’s own campaign has to spend.Mr. Obama on Saturday headed to Mr. Ryan’s home state, Wisconsin, to try to shore up support there. The addition of Mr. Ryan to the Republican ticket made Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes quite competitive in the closing phase of the presidential race, but a recent Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll of likely Wisconsin voters found Mr. Obama with a slight edge in the state.Meanwhile, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was campaigning Saturday in the swing state of New Hampshire, where he repeatedly brought sarcasm to bear on Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, describing their record and agenda with a “can you believe that” tone.Mr. Biden seized on Mr. Romney’s disparagement at a private fund-raiser of “47 percent” of Americans who see themselves as dependent on government benefits. Mr. Biden facetiously recommended a book by Mr. Ryan and two fellow Republican leaders in the House, “Young Guns.”“Get it, read it, it’s in paperback,” Mr. Biden said. “They constantly talk about this culture of dependence.”He said he did not recognize the country described in the book. “People who get knocked down, my experience has been we get back up,” he told several hundred enthusiastic supporters at a middle school in the town of Merrimack. “There is no quit in America.”'"
"'12-09-23,'0','The influenzas are zoonoses. They emerge from wild aquatic birds, sometimes with a pig as an intermediary host on the way to humanity. AIDS is a zoonosis; the pandemic strain of H.I.V. emerged about a century ago from a single Cameroonian chimpanzee. Ebola is a zoonosis. The Ebola viruses (there are five known species) abide inconspicuously in some as yet unidentified creature or creatures native to Central African forests, spilling over occasionally to kill gorillas and chimps and people. SARS is a zoonosis that emerged from a Chinese bat, fanned out of Hong Kong to the wider world, threatened to be the Next Big One, and then was stopped — barely — by fast and excellent medical science.And the hantaviruses, of which there are many known species (Andes virus, Black Creek Canal virus, Muleshoe virus, Seoul virus, Puumala virus and dozens more), come out of rodents. The species of hantavirus at large in Yosemite is called Sin Nombre — “nameless” — virus, and is the same one that erupted famously, and lethally, at the Four Corners in 1993. Its primary host is the deer mouse, one of the most widely distributed and abundant vertebrates in North America. The virus makes its way from dried mouse urine or feces into airborne dust, and from airborne dust into human lungs. If that happens to you, you’re in trouble. There’s no treatment, and the fatality rate for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the infection in severe form, runs at about 40 percent.You don’t have to go to Yosemite and sleep in a dusty cabin to put yourself close to a hantavirus. Although one expert, recently quoted by Scientific American, called it a “very rare” kind of virus, that view doesn’t square with the studies I’ve read or the testimony of hantavirus researchers I’ve interviewed. The virus seems to be relatively common, at least among deer mice. A 2008 study done at Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite found that 24 percent of local deer mice had the antibody for the virus, signaling a past or current infection. One mouse in four is worryingly high. Among these mouse populations nationwide, the prevalence of the antibody seems to vary from as low as zero to as high as 49 percent, or one in two mice.The question this raises is: Why aren’t more people dying from Sin Nombre virus? The answer seems to be that, although very dangerous when caught, it’s not easy to catch, despite its presence in mouse-infested sheds and trailers and garages and barns across much of America. This is because it doesn’t pass from person to person — only from mouse to mouse, and from mouse excretions to one unlucky person or another, each of whom represents a dead-end host. (The “dead” of that “dead-end” may be figurative or literal.) It’s not a “very rare” virus; it’s a common virus known only rarely to infect humans, and with no ramifying chains of human contagion. So the Next Big One is not likely to be Sin Nombre.Nor is it likely to be Ebola, which is transmissible from human to human through direct contact with bodily fluids, but can be stopped by preventing such contact. Furthermore, Ebola burns so hotly in its victims, incapacitating and killing so quickly, that it is poorly adapted to achieve global dispersal. Only one human has ever been known to leave Africa with a rampant Ebola virus infection — and that was a Swiss woman, evacuated in 1994 to a hospital in Basel. If you want to be grateful for something today, be grateful for that: Ebola doesn’t fly.WE should recognize such blessings, and try to focus our deepest concerns on real global dangers. Too often, we’re distracted from good scientific information by yellow journalism and the frisson of melodrama. Ebola is charismatic, the demon that people love to fear. Other lurid candidates, like hantavirus and SARS, also get their share of headlines. When you mention emerging diseases, people’s responses tend to fall at the two ends of a spectrum. Some folks are mesmerized by the dark possibilities and the garish but unrepresentative cases. Others are dismissive, rolling their eyes at the prospect of having to contemplate still another category of dire monition. They want you to cut to the chase. “Are we all gonna die?” they ask. Or they say: “Fine, so what can we do about these bugs?”Yes, we are all going to die, though most of us not from a strange disease newly emerged from a mouse or a chimp. And there are things we can do: get a flu vaccination; support calls for research; avoid coughing people on airplanes; apply mosquito repellent; wear a mask when you sweep out your old shed; don’t eat any chimpanzee meat from an animal found dead in the forest. But the concrete measures are limited by time, place and circumstance. The broader response is more basic: learn, absorb, understand. Don’t start trying to apply your knowledge until you have some.Among the other unsettling disease news this summer, you’ve probably seen mention of influenza, that old familiar zoonosis, quite capable of devastation and melodrama all its own. Yes, there’s a new flu bug, a nasty variant of the H1N2 strain, suspected now to be traveling through pigs at state fairs. The influenzas are protean and explosive. Keep your eyes on that one.Hantavirus in Yosemite is a little cloud that seems likely to stay little. This doesn’t mean that the great dark thunderhead isn’t coming. It just speaks to the need for a bit of informed judgment about which sector of the horizon we should watch.'"
"'12-09-23,'0','For the right to personal privacy to survive in America in this digital age, courts must be meticulous in applying longstanding privacy protections to new technology. This did not happen in an unfortunate ruling last month by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.The case concerned a drug conviction based on information about the defendant’s location that the government acquired from a cellphone he carried on a three-day road trip in a motor home. The data, apparently obtained with a phone company’s help, led to a warrantless search of the motor home and the seizure of incriminating evidence.The majority opinion held that there was no constitutional violation of the defendant’s rights because he “did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the data given off by his voluntarily procured pay-as-you-go cellphone.”The panel drew a distinction between its ruling and a ruling by the Supreme Court last January in United States v. Jones, which held that the placement of a hidden device on a suspect’s car without a valid warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. The three-judge panel said that its case, in contrast, did not involve physical trespass on the suspect’s private property. The judges also asserted that the tracking in the case before them was not sufficiently “comprehensive” to be “unreasonable for Fourth Amendment purposes” and trigger the need for a warrant — even though the police tracked the defendant’s every move for three days, hardly a negligible time period.The Jones case suggests that the Supreme Court’s future direction may be more protective of privacy in cases involving new and potentially invasive technologies. In two concurring opinions in that case, a majority of justices agreed that “longer-term” GPS monitoring impinged on expectations of privacy.As Justice Sonia Sotomayor stressed in her concurrence, “GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person’s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.” If anything, tracking someone using cellphone GPS capabilities is even more invasive than following someone with a GPS device attached to a car since it allows for 24/7 coverage. Most people carry their phones wherever they go, including into their homes.The circuit court panel majority concluded that because the defendant’s phone emitted information that could be picked up by law enforcement agents, he had no reasonable expectation of privacy and thus no warrant was needed to conduct the surveillance. This was at odds with yet another Supreme Court ruling, in 2001, involving a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street.'"
"'12-09-23,'0','But in what may still be the closest Senate contest in the country, Mr. Allen believes he has found an issue he can ride back to Washington. A recent round of polls suggests that Mr. Kaine has opened his first real lead of the contest. That has pushed Mr. Allen to press his case against the defense cuts even harder.“These folks really regret doing it,” Mr. Allen said of fellow Republicans and their votes. “Tim Kaine thinks it was the right thing to do. That’s beyond me.”Mr. Allen faces two risks. For one, the more he presses his case against the automatic defense cuts, the more opportunities Mr. Kaine has to demand a specific Allen program of deficit reduction to replace those cuts. For another, conservatives are questioning the fiscal bona fides of Republicans trying to undo the automatic cuts, which are known as sequestration.Chris Chocola, the president of the conservative political action committee Club for Growth, has been urging Republican candidates to stand by $1 trillion in additional spending cuts. “I need to see some sign that Congress is willing to do something really hard,” he said. “Sequestration is really hard, but they said they were going to do it.”The automatic cuts are the ugly result of the showdown last year over raising the nation’s statutory borrowing limit. A potentially crippling default was averted only after House Republicans and President Obama agreed to 10 years of caps on federal programs at the annual discretion of Congress. Moreover, a special committee was established to find an additional $1 trillion to cut over 10 years. If it failed, the cuts — half in defense, half in domestic programs — would kick in.It failed, and as the deadline for the cuts approaches, a blame game has begun. House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio on Friday again labeled it “the president’s defense sequester.” Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, called that “monstrously cynical,” since the cuts were “100 percent their creation.”“It’s like a man who kills his mother and father and throws himself on the mercy of the court because he’s an orphan,” he said.At a debate in Northern Virginia on Thursday, both Senate candidates jumped into the issue almost immediately, but they took very different approaches.In an interview, Mr. Allen said, “The responsible thing to do is to propose a way to avert these cuts.” But at the debate, he spoke generally about how to head off the defense cuts while maintaining deficit reduction targets.His suggestions: repeal the Obama health care law, although the Congressional Budget Office said a repeal would raise the deficit; expand domestic energy production on federal lands and use royalties to reduce the deficit; and put into effect a voluntary flat tax, which households could choose instead of the existing tax code. That, too, would most likely expand the deficit as taxpayers opted for the tax that saved them money.Mr. Allen also suggested that Congress start with a bill, already passed by the House, that would cancel the first year of automatic defense cuts by shifting the cuts to domestic programs. But last Monday, when asked if he was endorsing that House measure, he would not commit.“I haven’t had a chance to look at every detail of it,” he said, “but if I were in the Senate I’d be saying let’s look at this.”What Mr. Allen said he would not do was raise taxes. “The men and women in our armed forces should never be used as bargaining chips to raise taxes on job-creating small businesses,” he said.Mr. Kaine proposed letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire on incomes over $500,000, which he said would raise $500 billion; repealing tax breaks for oil and gas companies, to raise $24 billion; and allowing the federal government to bargain for lower prescription drug prices for Medicare, for a $240 billion savings. That would leave Congress to find $250 billion in spending cuts over 10 years to avert all the automatic cuts, defense and domestic.“We have to have shared sacrifice,” Mr. Kaine said. “Everybody has to be in the game if we are going to solve our budget issues.”As Republicans grow more nervous about the defense cuts, some conservatives fear that the party is preparing to cave — either by agreeing to raise taxes or by simply canceling the cuts. On National Review’s Web site last week, Veronique de Rugy, a conservative economist, wrote that even if the automatic cuts were carried out, overall military spending would continue to increase. Republicans who want to stop the cuts, she asserted, are falling into Democratic thinking that the government must prop up employment.“The Department of Defense is not a jobs program,” she wrote. “Its role isn’t to sustain defense contractors’ profits independently of the security they are actually meant to provide.”Here in Virginia, where defense contractors make up a substantial chunk of the economy, such ideals may not fly. Mr. Allen’s campaign has received nearly $89,000 from the defense industry, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics; Mr. Kaine’s campaign has received nearly $70,000.For now, many defense contractors are sticking with Mr. Allen. Mr. Radziszewski, the executive vice president of the software unit of QinetiQ North America, here in Stafford, said he trusted the Republican to bargain in good faith on behalf of the state’s contractors once he returned to the Senate.But Mr. Radziszewski also delivered a message to the man he says he will vote for. Everything has to be on the table, taxes, domestic spending, even defense.“The thing that keeps me awake is the bipartisan bickering,” he told Mr. Allen. “There’s the right wing. There’s the left wing. But the answer is always in the middle.”'"
"'12-09-23,'0','The Sharks’ current ownership, by the way, told The San Jose Mercury News recently that the team lost $15 million last season, despite selling out every home game. Nothing bothers fans more than to hear that their team, whose filled-to-capacity arena creates a raucous, hostile environment for opponents, is losing money despite their intense emotional involvement.“We’re a completely liquid organization and so far have continued to fund operations by choice,” Kevin Compton, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who is a Sharks owner, assured the fans. “This isn’t Phoenix.”Except that the viability of the league, metaphorically at least, is based on hockey working out in Phoenix. Yes, the Coyotes again. The day before the collective bargaining agreement expired, the Coyotes re-signed the free agent Shane Doan — the heart and soul of the team, who started with the franchise when it was the old Winnipeg Jets — to a four-year, $21.2 million contract.Can they afford to pay that? Or can they afford not to?In 2004-5, the owners wanted a salary cap to control escalating player salaries and create more parity on the ice. They got it, along with a larger share of hockey revenue. This time around, they want to reduce the players’ percentage of revenue even more. It is said that apart from the elites (the Rangers, the Philadelphia Flyers and the Toronto Maple Leafs among them), more teams are awash in red ink than are turning a profit.This seems serious, but there is no need to panic — yet. After all, on the 10-month hockey calendar, only preseason games through Sept. 30 have been canceled.But the ides of October loom, and one can become wistful thinking of the postgame clichés (“It’s early, but we have to play more desperate”) that will not be uttered.It is also worrisome that a number of the league’s biggest stars, as they did during the 2004-5 lockout, have left to stay sharp playing with professional teams in places like Switzerland, Sweden and Russia, home of the high-paying Kontinental Hockey League.The buttoned-down N.H.L. doesn’t much care for the K.H.L.’s style of getting into the heads of young Russian stars and meddling with player development by dangling fat contract offers. So it was hard to miss the schadenfreude in the news release the K.H.L. issued this month, outlining the requirements for locked-out foreign players wanting to compete in Russia.Job applicants, the K.H.L. said, would be considered if, for instance, they had “experience as a Stanley Cup winner or finalist,” or had won “one of the individual prizes awarded by the N.H.L. at the close of their season.” In other words, welcome home, Ilya Kovalchuk, Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk and Alex Ovechkin.For all the N.H.L.’s discussion of economic viability and cost certainty, it’s worth noting that neither the players nor the owners are saying much of anything about the biggest threat to the league’s stability: concussions. This time a year ago, the N.H.L. was wondering if its biggest star, Sidney Crosby, would ever play again.Then the season started with a raft of concussion-related injuries and player suspensions, as the league hoped to legislate head hits out of the game. Crosby, concussed during the 2010-11 season, returned last Nov. 21, scoring two goals against the Islanders, then reported more symptoms in December. He came back again for the playoffs in April.Crosby’s agent, Pat Brisson, conceded on a Toronto sports radio show last week that a factor in whether Crosby plays in Europe during a prolonged lockout is the issue of insuring his head. The notion neatly encapsulates where the situation stands: at money and headaches.'"
"'12-09-23,'0','David Garza, 48, runs the Henry Street Settlement, a social service agency on the Lower East Side, but his Sundays belong to Park Slope, Brooklyn, where he grew up. He still lives on the same block, with his wife, Gina Meggo-Garza, 46, a L’Oreal executive; daughter, Alexandra Garza, 20, a student at Smith College; and two dogs, Beck, a Tibetan mastiff, and Phoebee, a golden retriever. After working in retail and in television production, Mr. Garza joined Henry Street in 2001 and became its executive director in 2010. Though he spends the occasional weekend in the Catskills, he devotes most Sundays to revisiting old neighborhood haunts and exploring new ones.UP WITH THE DOGS We get up, really, whenever the dogs get up, so 5:30. We’re pretty dog-centric. We have two big dogs. A golden retriever, Phoebee — my daughter named her when she was much younger — and we have a Tibetan mastiff that we rescued who has certainly turned our world slightly in a different direction. Lots of energy, very large. Sundays, unlike other days, we can spend a lot of time. Hopefully, the dog walks are uneventful, but with a rescue dog as big as this is, every once in a while he’ll find some trouble.COFFEE AND SWEAT We skimp on breakfast a little bit on Sundays. It’s generally a pot of coffee and anything else that’s around. Then we all go to get on our separate sweats. Gina likes to go to Bikram yoga; Alexandra goes to SoulCycle. I’ve been boxing for a year now. I love it. I played a lot of contact sports as a teenager, and I think contact sports are best left for teenagers, but I had this epiphany that I missed hitting something and getting hit. I have yet to actually fight someone, but I aspire to connect my worlds by staging some kind of charity boxing event.BREAKFAST OPTIONS I’ll generally hit the bagel store, and we’ll all meet back at the house for breakfast, although many Sundays I will hit the diner with my buddies, who I’ve really known since the first grade. There’s more than a handful of us that are still around. We take Sunday mornings as a way to take over some of the yuppified dining spots we’ve been going to for a long time. Dizzy’s, we used to refer to it as Benny’s — Benny was the owner and was a fixture there for 30 years at the front counter. It’s a very different place now, but it’s our little time capsule. We used to meet at Dizzy’s for lunch back in the third grade, and we’re still eating there. Sometimes we’ll use our status to get a table and beat the stroller brigade.UPKEEP, AN EVENT On Sundays, personal maintenance is on the agenda — a haircut or something like that. Sometimes there are work-related events, more on the fun side of work. So, for example, we have an art center that’s always putting on a range of performances, or I’ll go see our kids in a softball or basketball game.DINNER OUT We’ll meet for dinner, and generally my daughter gets to pick the restaurant because her knowledge of the city is a little more accurate these days than ours. Both Gina and Alexandra are vegetarians, but I’m strictly carnivore, although every once in a while, they’ll get me to eat a fake steak sandwich.COUCH TIME The dog walks, they tether us back to Brooklyn. They go at 5:30 and 11:30, 5:30 and 11:30. So 11:30’s the last walk of the day. We don’t get to watch a lot of television, so we’re a big fan of going through a whole box set. So we’ve done “Nurse Jackie” that way, we’ve done “Weeds” that way, we’ve done “Mad Men” that way, you name it. And we kind of devour a box set as quickly as we can and have a good time with it, and by that time, it’s lights out.'"

"'12-09-23,'0','Our hotel was on Place d’Armes, an ordinarily bustling square in the city center with music and outdoor cafes, but a power outage shortly before we arrived had curtailed the nightly activity as well as shut down the restaurant — and the computer system — in our hotel (whose name I won’t mention because it seems unfair to complain about mediocre service after that). We found a night spot, Brasserie Guillaume, a garishly lighted bistro with well-dressed patrons and a menu — on the expensive side (main dishes were mostly between 20 and 30 euros, about $25 to $37 at $1.25 to the euro) — prominently featuring beef carpaccio and lobster. The waiter recommended veal rognons, a specialty of the chef, which turned out to be kidneys, something I didn’t realize until after I’d eaten them, returned to the hotel and looked up the word. I liked them better before I knew.Early the next morning we made our way to the Grund, a quarter of quaint lanes and shops along the Alzette River sunk so dramatically below the central city that the entire area feels as though it has fallen into a crevasse. (We had walked down a long, uncomfortably steep cobblestoned road to get there, not knowing that there is, in fact, an elevator available to ferry pedestrians down and up.)In any case, in the Grund we found the Velo en Ville bike rental shop, a very casual place staffed by competent and earnest young men, where we picked up our sturdy, easy-to-ride touring bikes. Made by Trek, the popular American manufacturer, they were built for comfort rather than speed, featuring upright handlebars, simple shifters, reliable brakes and soft, padded seats.LIKE much of Europe, Luxembourg has an enthusiastic cycling culture. The Schleck brothers, Frank and Andy, perpetual Tour de France contenders, are Luxembourgers, and the government has officially supported cycling as a boon to both tourism and recreation. The country is laced with a national network of cycling paths — known as PCs, for the French term pistes cyclables — which perambulate through a pretty, undulating landscape with only the occasional, briefly daunting incline. The project was set in motion in 1999 and is about two-thirds finished. Right now 23 separate paths — about 600 miles in total — crisscross the nation.Conveniently, PC 1, the part of the cycle path network that circles Luxembourg city and intersects with a number of other pistes, goes right by Velo en Ville, so we started our ride from there.The route we planned was a vaguely egg-shaped path through the center of the country that touched both the Belgian and German borders and was a kind of Luxembourg sampler: a little urban sophistication, a little small town quaintness, some architecture from the Middle Ages, and landscapes of forests, riversides and rolling farmland.We hadn’t thought about suburbs — who plans to cycle through suburbs? — but within an hour of leaving the capital city, that is exactly where we found ourselves. Namely, we were in a park in a town called Hesperange, where a children’s summer camp was in session.The children, for some reason all wearing yellow baseball caps, were playing jump-rope and dodge ball (or something like it) on a lovely green lawn that also served as a contemporary sculpture garden; the exhibit included a dozen or so life-size female mannequins in imaginatively intergalactic garb along with half a dozen orange pigs, which the children took pleasure in mounting, cowboylike, and kicking with their heels as if they were saddled horses. One of the camp counselors, meanwhile, borrowed our pump to inflate her unicycle tire.The scene was charming and, in the driest, most deadpan way, hilarious. But it did slow us down. The park, you see, wasn’t really on our preferred route, but the signs marking the bike path we’d been following were, at that point, in conflict with one another. We found our way forward with the help of some park workers (who held quite a substantial debate about our predicament before venturing their counsel). But as we negotiated the rest of a suburbanscape that resembled nothing so much as Englewood, N.J., we grew hungry and grumpy — the only explanation for our lunch stop at McDonald’s, where we scarfed down what should be (but aren’t) called Luxemburgers. Still, I have to admit — they perked us up.Soon we were beyond the reach of the capital’s infrastructure, traffic and population, and the remainder of the day was far more encouraging. As it would for the rest of the journey, the bike path proceeded in seemingly designated segments, each with a distinct character: the forest segment, with dense undergrowth and dappled sunlight; the field segment, with Andrew Wyeth-like waves of rolling wheat; the riverside segment, with leafy trees along a sleepy watercourse. One segment would stop abruptly and the next would begin.Occasionally, there would be a town — we passed through Steinfort and Eischen along the Belgian border, then pivoted toward the northeast toward Noerdange, Useldange and Colmar-Berg — generally small and tidy communities with azure-, peach- and lox-colored houses, well-tended gardens and flower boxes replete with red begonias, pink impatiens and deep-purple petunias. Judging from the number of bustling, crowded riverside campgrounds we passed, outdoor living is a national pastime. Public sculpture, some of it eyebrow-raisingly kitschy, is all over the place.That was also the day of the rainstorm, the tunnel and the alphorn trio, but I’ll get to that later. We rode 40 miles before we stopped for the night in Erpeldange, an unassuming small town just north of the larger town of Ettelbruck. You wouldn’t think there would be a hotel at all in Erpeldange, but there was, in fact, a surprising one, the Hôtel Dahm, where the room (small but comfy) was more than adequate, especially for 90 euros, and the restaurant was terrific, even if chateaubriand for two came to a lot more than that.On Saturday, once we passed through the town of Diekirch (home of a pretty good beer), we had our most rural day of riding, going north out of our way a bit to Vianden, near the German border, where a formidable medieval castle, built between the 11th and 14th centuries, stands sentry high above a charming, if touristy, village, affording dramatic photo ops. (The steeply pitched, cobblestoned road up to the castle was the toughest challenge of our ride — and worth it.)The path to Vianden went through cornfields, intensely green hills and rolling farmland stocked with the meatiest, healthiest-looking cows I’ve ever seen. At the top of one hill whose slopes were dotted with apple trees, we were treated to the sight of two enormous hawks with brown mottled wings, circling above us in a swooping, graceful dance that went on for minutes.The castle houses a museum (6 euros admission) with some interesting displays of weaponry and a striking view of the river valley below, but it is more impressive from the outside, where the magnificent view is made especially poignant by a plaque dedicated to the American soldiers who completed the liberation of Luxembourg when they took Vianden from the Nazis in February 1945.We retraced our path for a few miles, back past the apple trees (the hawks were gone), and followed the Sure River along the border, crossing over a short bridge to touch our wheels in Wallendorf, Germany, before continuing south on the Luxembourg side. We spent the night at Hôtel Brimer, a roadside resort in the town of Grundhof, which had just added a “wellness” wing to a traditional, century-old inn, and whose motley decorative plan featured some striking taxidermy in the lobby hallway and a Vegas touch (that rug!) in our large, light, well-appointed bedroom (141 euros.) I’m not scoffing: The foie gras was superb (the broiled lobster, too) and the bathroom unexpectedly commodious. I’d recommend it, especially to travelers who can appreciate a good identity crisis.On Sunday we had weather. We followed the Sure to Echternach, an attractive town on a sleepy stretch of the river, and then turned west for the final 25 miles back to Luxembourg city. It was a beautiful and adventuresome ride, part of it through a glorious forest in a torrential downpour and part through treeless, rolling fields as the rain died down and the wind rose. We were hurrying.Finally, we entered the city from the north, where a slew of gargantuan public buildings of strikingly modern design were in varying stages of completion. The sky was gray, the urbanscape spooky, and as we pedaled through what felt like the abandoned set of a science fiction movie, suddenly the wind gusted — once, twice, three times — so hard it halted our pedaling and nearly threw us off our bikes. We had to wait for it to pause, and we raced to the city center, just as another downpour descended. It was a nice way to finish, actually, with a little drama that made us glad to be back.Now, I hope you get my point that crossing Luxembourg is worthwhile without an alphorn trio serenade. It still counts as a crossing. But the truth is it’s better with one, which is exactly what I was thinking when Paul Krummes, Anne Houlard and Remy Zahlen introduced themselves.Known collectively as the Aischdall Alphorntrio, they were setting up for a rehearsal in the mouth of a quarter-mile-long tunnel near Eischen, a few dozen pedal strokes from Belgium, unpacking their instruments, the giraffes of the music world.It had just begun raining, suddenly and rather hard. The arched stone tunnel, paved and lighted in dim, handsome amber, was formerly for the railroad but now it’s part of a trail reserved for hikers and bikers. It was a surprise and a relief; the manifestation of the trio, as if from thin air, seemed straight from a fairy tale.Their music was delightful, imperfectly performed but richly harmonic, deep-voiced and thrumming like a pride of bullfrogs along the empty stone corridor.“The acoustics,” said Mr. Krummes, the leader of the group, when I asked what they were doing there. This was the longest tunnel in Luxembourg, he added.WE listened for 10 minutes or so, a rapt audience, then bade them regretful farewell and remounted our steeds. (Sorry, something about all of this seems to call for archaic language.) They continued to play as we rode away, and the soundtrack trailed us and faded away, as if a movie were ending. When we emerged at the other end, the rain had stopped and the sun was out.No rainbow, alas. But maybe that would have been too much.IF YOU GOBoth the size and civility of Luxembourg make it especially well-suited to a do-it-yourself cycling vacation. We arranged all of it easily — locating a bike rental, planning the route, reserving hotels, buying train tickets — in a few hours online and on the phone just a couple of days before we left. (Luxembourg by Cycle is a helpful online guide: biking-tours.lu/cycle-luxembourg.)We rented our bikes from Velo en Ville, which from what I could tell is the only full-service bike rental place in the city of Luxembourg. In a cavelike space on a cobbled road in the Grund quarter, it is staffed by helpful people and provides sturdy, well-maintained bikes. Children’s bikes are available as well. Reservations are not necessary. Bikes can be rented by the hour or the day or the weekend. We paid 75 euros total, not quite $100, for two bicycles, from Friday morning through Sunday afternoon. One bit of advice: Though Ville en Velo provides locks, water bottles and helmets, it does not supply saddlebags, so bring your own — or at least a few bungee cords to secure your duffel bag or backpack to the rear rack. Velo en Ville: (352) 4796-2383; vdl.lu/Location+de+vélos.htmlOnce you are in the country, Luxembourg pedestrians are so eager to help lost English-speaking cyclists that you might end up swearing they’ve been hanging out on street corners waiting for you. Though the French influence seems to dominate the west and German the east, most residents toggle easily among several languages. The beginning of any conversation with a stranger is devoted to which one it will be conducted in. “You speak English? No problem” was the nearly universal reaction to us — but the official national tongue is Luxembourgish.As for the biking itself, the terrain is ideal for easygoing travel.  The paths themselves are mostly paved, easily negotiable for any reasonably competent cyclist and generally distinct from auto routes, though there are segments where you’re obliged to ride with traffic. The network rises to a peak altitude of just 1,800 feet — the lowest point is about 430 — and there are no quad-straining, lung-burning climbs. We covered roughly 100 miles by bike in three days.A couple of caveats: Though the routes are often well marked, riders need to be eagle-eyed for the markers, especially passing through towns; we got thrown off the track a handful of times and ended up on roads without adequate shoulders. Luxembourg drivers, however, seem especially sensitive to cyclists and gave us a wide berth.Brasserie Guillaume (352-26-20-20-20; brasserieguillaume.lu), where we had a late dinner our first night, has all the trappings of a place to be — atmospheric buzz, well-dressed diners, indifferent waiters and elevated prices.We preferred Restaurant l’Academie (Place d’Armes 11; 352-22-71-31), a homier place with an open terrace on Place d’Armes, hearty local fare (try the lamb) and large portions.Outside Luxembourg city, the restaurants at both our hotels were satisfying — thoughtful menus, well-prepared food.'"
"'12-09-23,'0','We are losing the real lesson in Ohio — no one man and no one policy is going to make the difference. Columbus has always been a bit recession-proof, but the real leadership comes from the bipartisan work of the Republican business leaders and the Democratic city and county government officials. Let’s stop the divide and conquer. We are all in peril if we continue this path.Gov. John R. Kasich is being very unwise when he states: “I don’t care what the reason is. I don’t care if it’s because of some little green man on Mars. When people are working, families are stronger, children are healthier and families are better.” All governors should show interest in the welfare of their citizens, but without understanding the reasons for economic growth, you cannot stimulate growth when the economy is down. His JobsOhio initiative could be very productive, but if it is just a matter of persuading companies to move to Ohio, he is taking jobs from another state. He needs to think about how jobs are created, not how jobs are stolen.In 2008, there was a real fear that what happened to Pittsburgh and Youngstown in the late 1970s with the collapse of the steel industry would happen to Toledo and many small cities in the region if G.M. failed. For Northwest Ohio, the bailout kept the economy afloat. Manufacturing remains central to Ohio’s economy, but that sector cannot continue to reliably employ Ohioans in large numbers. As a result, few people move to Ohio, which has one of the most “native” populations in the country. Without fresh blood, the state will languish.Do citizens understand their tax dollars are paying corporations, which are sitting on massive profits due to high worker productivity and low wages, to remain in their cities? Isn’t this corporate welfare? How do people square it with their “government is bad, private industry is good” beliefs? These are the same corporations that are lobbying Congress to lower the corporate tax rate, which they don’t pay anyway.Is This the Most Dangerous Thing in Your House?'"
"'12-09-23,'0','Keeping Casco cool, at least for another five years, will require restraint — something that appears to be in short supply in Panama these days. All over the country, mangrove swamps, essential not only to the local ecosystem but to countless migratory and animals, are being buried under landfill to support new condo developments. And in Panama City, scores of new buildings, among them the Trump Ocean Club International Hotel & Tower, are so close together that each one blocks the views the others struggled to achieve.Last year, the Panamanian government announced plans to extend a highway called the Cinta Costera out into the sea around Casco, which is on a small peninsula, to help commuters bypass the neighborhood. If the extension to the highway is built, could withdraw the neighborhood’s status, bestowed in 1997. Locals say landfill is already being laid on both sides of Casco, where the roadway will connect to existing mainland arteries.A pro-construction ethos seems to be in Panama’s DNA — fitting, perhaps, for a country founded on a civil-engineering project. (It is currently widening the canal, a multi-billion-dollar project that provides the material for, and temptation to create, even more landfill.) But Panama has always had a complicated relationship with Casco Viejo.Though foreigners tend to be entranced — the wide variety of architectural styles, reflecting periods of prosperity over four centuries, make it more interesting than purely colonial outposts like Cartagena, , or Granada, , and almost as enticing as — Panamanians are often surprised that travelers are drawn to the area. Matt Landau, who co-owns a hotel in Casco called Los Cuatro Tulipanes, says that Panamanians tend to think of Casco as a place you visit for a few hours to look around, not where you spend your evenings.For travelers Casco has been on the radar since the late 1990s, around the time the gave control of the Canal Zone back to Panama. After the spectacular restaurant and the hotel Cuatro Tulipanes both opened in Casco in 2002, travel magazines were suddenly pronouncing it the next hot place. In reality Casco Viejo has been “on the verge” for decades, says Jean Pigozzi, a millionaire socialite who spends much of his time in Panama.Though the neighborhood is now getting the lift so many have been waiting for, its seedier elements have not fully disappeared. Just a few feet from Blesso’s new hotel are buildings that appear to be on the verge of collapse, with trees growing out of cracks in their exposed concrete. Their residents, some of whom are squatters, “have great sound systems, pounding out really loud all the time,” Blesso says. “It’s not at the point where there are wealthy people making noise complaints every time something goes on.”While giving a tour of Canal House, Hardin points out a bullet hole, a vestige of a gang shooting in front of the hotel in 2009. Since then, the crime rate in the neighborhood has dropped. One former gang member even runs a bar, La Vecindad, in a space provided by Hardin’s company. (Hardin is an acolyte of Craig Robins, the Miami Beach developer who jump-started the redevelopment of South Beach by letting artists live and work rent-free.)Hardin and Pinzón are active in a group that opposes the Cinta Costera project. Last year, Panama’s president hinted in a television interview that a few of their properties might be in danger of expropriation. This past spring, Hardin and Pinzón festooned their Casco home with a banner that declared, in Spanish, “We want social housing, not a coastal highway.” It earned them a court summons. Nevertheless, Hardin is optimistic that Casco Viejo will survive. “I don’t think in the end the Panamanian public will let it be wrapped in concrete,” he says.Hotels Las Clementinas Perfectly appointed suites the size of small apartments.

"'12-09-24,'0','WASHINGTON — At the dawn of the civilian nuclear age in the 1950s, one of the pressing questions was how to find enough fuel for reactors and bombs. The government and the private sector seized on a man-made substitute for natural uranium, producing about 3,400 pounds of an exotic and expensive material called uranium 233.Today, the problem is how to safely get rid of it.“We do consider this to be waste,” said David G. Huizenga, the senior administrator for environmental management at the Energy Department. “There’s no further need for it.”Uranium 233 looked attractive because it could be made in a reactor from thorium, a cheap and abundant radioactive metal, and, almost magically, the reactor would produce more fuel than it consumed. Utilities manufactured some of it at the Indian Point I reactor in Westchester County, N.Y., which is now retired, and at reactors in Colorado, Illinois and Pennsylvania.But in the end, ordinary uranium was cheaper, and 233 was not needed.“Nuclear physicists weren’t geologists and didn’t understand the supply of uranium,” said Frank N. Von Hippel, a physicist and public policy specialist at Princeton. “It turned out there was more uranium than people thought and less nuclear power than people thought there would be.”Ordinary uranium also proved to be much easier to work with than 233. But the government assembled a few bombs with the 233 version, and a research reactor in Tennessee briefly switched to it as fuel in 1968. But very little was used, so the material sat for decades in government laboratories and weapons plants.'"
"'12-09-24,'0','He hoped to turn The Atlantic into a weekly, a glossy artifact that he could proudly display in his office at the Watergate complex, overlooking the Potomac River. But even as a monthly, the economics were baffling.I called him back after our lunch and he repeated something he had said.“In a sense, I was born 50 years too late,” he said. “I love the romance of print, but after I took over The Atlantic, I quickly began losing $8 to $10 million a year. It was not a sustainable business, no matter how much I loved being part of it.”After spending 10 years and $100 million on the Atlantic brand, he realized that making baubles for the coffee table would soon leave him bereft. He hired Justin Smith, the publisher of The Week who had also worked at The Economist, in 2007. Mr. Smith has Mr. Bradley’s polish, but is more ruthless in business matters and less sentimental about print. The pair set about building a ladder out of the hole that the company — and most of print publishing, for that matter — found itself in.What is the way forward for a 155-year old-magazine that once published Emerson and Longfellow? Digital first and last, with ancillary revenue from conferences. The magazine, edited by James Bennet, is still very much in the middle of the conversation, but these days it is prized mostly for bringing luster to digital assets like TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic Wire, Atlantic Cities, and beginning Monday, Quartz.Mr. Bradley shared the financials that suggested that revenue at the various Atlantic properties had doubled in the last four years, from $20 million to $40 million, and that the company was profitable for the third year in a row. Digital revenue, he said, now makes up 65 percent of all advertising revenue. (Even though Atlantic Media is a private company, I believe Mr. Bradley; he was always honest when he was losing gobs of money, so I have no reason to doubt him now that he says they are in the black).“It’s become very, very clear to me that digital trumps print, and that pure digital, without any legacy costs, massively trumps print,” Mr. Bradley said.At a time when other media properties are leaning hard on subscriptions and paywalls, Mr. Smith believes that a free product, with revenue from sponsorships and events, can avoid the dependency on commodity ads and play in more rarefied, lucrative terrain.“We don’t want to be the Royal Navy,” he said. “We want to be the pirate ship attacking the Royal Navy. I’m bearish on print, including our own. It is an inexorable trend that has to be met with some very radical changes.”Quartz is the company’s effort to take advantage of a changed environment, not just in publishing, but in the world at large. The editorial product is aimed at the front half of airplanes that crisscross from Zurich to São Paulo to Singapore, serving executives who are increasingly having similar conversations no matter where they land. It was built for tablets, conceived as a mobile product for mobile people.“This is a global audience, one that is growing very rapidly,” Mr. Smith said. “When you walk through a busy Asian airport, nobody is talking about or thinking about the American economy. The world has gotten much bigger than that.”Quartz is staffed by 20 journalists, including Kevin Delaney, its editor in chief, who was managing editor of The Wall Street Journal Online, and Gideon Lichfield, global news editor, who was deputy digital editor and media editor at The Economist. Of course, Quartz won’t have the financial data resources of Dow Jones, Reuters or Bloomberg, but Mr. Delaney suggested that data is ubiquitous while real insight on the news is a rare commodity.“Any good blog or magazine has defining obsessions, and we’ll structure around the ones that we think smart, globally minded people will be interested in,” he said.He said that the sudden abundance of energy, chronically flat interest rates, and the behavior of Chinese consumers would be themes, among others, that the site would return to again and again. Quartz has four sponsors — Boeing, Cadillac, Chevron and Credit Suisse — that have bought out the site until the end of the year.The site is built for mobile, which means banner ads are not part of the picture; sponsored content will be built into the editorial stream. (Whether that represents significant innovation or a worrisome trend depends on your take on church-and-state advertising issues.)Because the site is free, the people behind Quartz expect it to have maximum traffic in social media streams, freed of the paywalls that provide revenue to The Economist, FT.com and WSJ.com, but which limit the sharing of information. So, does the world need more business news, really?“Nobody is ever going to say that they need you,” said Mr. Bradley. “The market never needs what you have until they decide they do.”Yes, it may be hard to picture Mr. Bradley as a digital pirate in an eye patch. But as Mr. Smith points out: “David is a kind and thoughtful person, which is very much a part of our culture. But he is also very competitive. He wants to win.”'"
"'12-09-24,'0','“If you own a mobile ecology, as Google does, the other mobile ecology owners are not going to allow you to own tons of data in their world,” said Scott Rafer, chief executive of Lumatic, which makes city map apps. “And so neither Apple nor Amazon were going to let Google know where every one of their users was at every time.”Being kicked off the iPhone has potentially significant consequences for Google, whose Maps service earns more than half its traffic from mobile devices, and almost half of that mobile traffic has been from iPhone users. Apple’s move strikes at the heart of Google’s core business, search, because about 40 percent of mobile searches are for local places or things.“Local is a huge thing for Google in terms of advertising dollars, and search is very tied to that,” said Barry Schwartz, an editor at Search Engine Land, an industry blog. “Knowing where you are, when you search for coffee, it can bring up local coffee shops and ads that are much more relevant for the user.”Consumers are innocent bystanders of the brawl. IPhone users now have an extra step to download the YouTube app from the App Store and, so far, Google has given no indication that it will offer a maps app. Apple’s maps, meanwhile, are littered with flaws, some laughable, like a bridge that appears to collapse crossing the Tacoma Narrows Strait of Puget Sound.Some analysts say, however, that Apple’s maps will quickly improve, and that the long-term result of heightened competition will be better maps all around.“Apple Maps are apparently not ready for prime time, and that’s a loss,” said Peter Krasilovsky, the program director for marketplaces at BIA/Kelsey, a local media research firm. “But a long-term loss? No. With all the incredible technology being developed by everybody, consumers are the winner.”The war between Google and Apple escalated abruptly before breaking out on the iPhone screen. At the height of their friendship, their chief executives together unveiled the first iPhone, packed with Google services like maps, search and YouTube. But since Google introduced its own mobile operating system, Android, the companies have battled over everything mobile, from patents to ads and apps.The brawl has played out most publicly in the courtroom, where Apple and phone manufacturers that use Google’s Android software have sued one another. Most recently, on Friday and Saturday, Apple and Samsung each filed papers to amend or overturn a jury verdict that awarded Apple $1 billion in a patent trial with Samsung. Apple wants more money and Samsung wants a new trial. The companies will return to court Dec. 6 to discuss their demands.Though Apple’s rejection of YouTube is part of its effort to cut ties with its former friend, it is different from the battle over maps because Apple has no competing video service. Google has introduced a new YouTube app in the App Store, which has become the No. 1 free app.But with maps, Google, which has long been the dominant digital mapmaker, now must adjust to a new rival, along with the loss of valuable iPhone users.Even though Android phones far outnumber iPhones — 60 percent of smartphones run Android, versus 34 percent for iPhones, according to Canalys, a research firm — iPhone users account for almost half of mobile traffic to Google Maps.In July, according to comScore Mobile Metrix, 12.6 million iPhone users visited Maps each day, versus 7.6 million on Android phones. And iPhone users spent an hour and a half using Maps during the month, while Android users spent just an hour.Those users are a valuable source for Google, because it relies on their data to determine things like which businesses or landmarks are most important and whether maps have errors.Google also risks losing the allegiance of app developers who build apps that tie in to maps.“Overnight, Apple has really taken out a significant chunk of Google’s market, and it’s much harder for Google to say to developers, ‘We’re the only game in town, come play with us,’ ” said Tony Costa, a senior analyst who studies mobile phones at Forrester. “It will affect the Google ecosystem, putting it back in the same game of their apps lagging behind Apple, and that’s not a good position for them to be in.”Still, Google is no doubt feeling a bit of satisfaction as Apple is loudly criticized for the errors in its maps.Apple Maps users have been tallying its blunders. A Tumblr devoted to the topic included a missing lake in Hyderabad, India, misplaced restaurants in Cambridge, Mass., and the placement of Berlin in Antarctica.Apple responded Thursday with a statement that its map service was a work in progress and would improve as more people used it.Google, meanwhile, has been reminding people of its seven years of experience in mapping.But the company would not say whether it was building an iPhone app for users to download. Its only public statement on the matter has been vague: “Our goal is to make Google Maps available to everyone who wants to use it, regardless of device, browser, or operating system.”Google could decide not to build an app, as a gamble that iPhone users depend on its maps so much that they might switch to Android.If it does build an app, Apple would have to approve it. Its guidelines for developers are ambiguous, but exclude apps that “appear confusingly similar to an existing Apple product.”Rejecting Google’s app would most likely set off a brouhaha similar to that over the Google Voice app, which Apple rejected in 2009, prompting an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission, and a year later was approved.More likely, analysts say, Google is waiting for the right time to swoop in and save the day by offering its own iPhone app. One benefit of making its own app: It could add features and sell ads, which it could not do on the old app because Apple controlled it. The situation with the YouTube app was the same.In the meantime, Google is encouraging people to use maps on the iPhone’s browser, where it shows instructions to install it on their home screen.'"
"'12-09-24,'0','Transforming the current chaotic mélange of health care payment and delivery arrangements into a genuine system will take many years, because current arrangements are entrenched and structured to resist effective cost control.The task for this generation should be to implement the many promising cost-control measures in the health reform legislation. There are better ways to respond to today’s budget challenges than to renege on the commitment made nearly half a century ago to assure the elderly, people with disabilities and the poor health care comparable to that enjoyed by the rest of us.The writer is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.Steven Rattner rightly focuses on the need to allocate health care resources more prudently. But it isn’t just the last year of life that consumes irrational costs. I’m 85, and this morning I had a six-month checkup that happily reported wonderful test results and no significant problems. Yet my nice doctor wants me back six months from now, even if I am still feeling fine. She says this is “preventive medicine.”Steven Rattner says that “unless we start allocating health care resources more prudently — rationing, by its proper name — the exploding cost of Medicare will swamp the federal budget.”The Times’s pages have been filled with news articles, editorials, Op-Ed articles and letters showing how we can control health care costs and improve outcomes through care coordination, more primary and preventive care, accountable care organizations and single-payer health coverage.We already ration care through payment denials, bare-bones policies, high deductibles and co-payments, and unaffordable coverage that deprive working people of access to care. We don’t need more rationing.The well-to-do can easily afford to pay for care to fill the gaps that Mr. Rattner’s proposal would leave. For the rest of us, it’s a gruesome and unnecessary approach.The writer is chairman of the New York State Assembly Committee on Health.Steven Rattner wants to reduce medical costs by not offering “every treatment, regardless of expenses or efficacy” in the last year of life. That’s reasonable — if and when we give the elderly (I am one of them) the right to choose their own gentle death, something that many religions would obstruct.But even before we get to that, let’s consider the 76 million baby boomers who are or will be retiring and will drain Medicare. Would they be willing to join me in choosing death with dignity? Or would they prefer heart transplants at 85?The large cost for treatment in the last year of life is not a problem unique to the elderly population. Except for those who die suddenly, almost everyone, at every age, consumes the most medical dollars in the year before death, from preemies to centenarians. That’s because they are usually sickest just before death.Keeping impossibly young preemies alive in intensive care units for months before a largely predictable death — which dramatically affects total health care dollars if not Medicare dollars — should be just as much a topic for debate.As the cost of Medicare consumes a larger and larger share of the American economy, Steven Rattner states that “overtly acknowledging that elderly Americans are not entitled to every conceivable medical procedure or pharmaceutical” is politically toxic.The toxicity extends beyond politics into the personal. If care were rationed as it is in England and elsewhere, my wife, whose pancreatic cancer was diagnosed exactly one year ago and who has been kept alive with expensive drugs, would have missed our 53rd wedding anniversary in March, her 73rd birthday in August and her grandchildren’s amazing accomplishments.Do we ration care for the elderly? We must.The writer is a retired associate professor at the Wayne State University School of Medicine.'"
"'12-09-24,'0','CAIRO — Libya’s interim government on Sunday ordered the breakup of all militias that do not fall under its authority, and demanded that those militias pull out of military compounds and public property within 48 hours.The order came in response to an upwelling of public anger at the militias after an armed group assaulted a United States diplomatic mission in Benghazi earlier this month, killing Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Exasperated by the interim government’s failure to curb the militia brigades, thousands of civilians swarmed into the headquarters of several of them in Benghazi on Friday and forced their fighters to scatter — in effect, an angry mob demanding law and order.Mohamed al-Magarief, the president of Libya’s national Congress and the interim head of state, apparently sought to both appease public anger and capitalize on it with the order to withdraw and disband. Previous interim leaders have issued similar calls before without success, in part because the Libyan government still depends on many of the self-organized militias to act as its military, police and national guard.Hundreds of such armed groups were formed during and after the uprising against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, typically armed with Kalashnikov rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and truck-mounted artillery captured or looted from the colonel’s armories. Since his overthrow the groups have been both the main guardians of the social order in Libya and the chief menace to it.As recently as Friday the Libyan Army’s chief of staff, Yousef al-Mangoush, urged protesters not to molest the many militias that were now officially authorized and ostensibly operating under the army’s direction, because the government still needed them to control the country.'"
"'12-09-24,'0','It was most evident Saturday in Manuel, a senior, who has repeatedly said that Florida State should expect to win big games. He regularly speaks to Ward and Chris Weinke, another former Seminoles quarterback, who texts Manuel before every game. Ward and Weinke each won a Heisman Trophy and a national championship. The recent play of Manuel, a former No. 2-rated quarterback prospect out of high school, has made him worthy of their company.Against Clemson, Manuel set single-game career highs in passing and rushing yards. Pundits heaped more expectations on him, mentioning him as a Heisman candidate.“If you do everything else, that’s what comes,” Manuel’s father said.Relieving the pressure on Manuel was Thompson, who almost one year ago broke two vertebrae in his back when he lowered his head on a run. Forget running, cutting and sprinting — just sitting upright in class bothered him. He wore a brace and preferred lying down whenever he could. In March, he began working out but still felt pain. In his senior year, an inescapable sense of finality is driving Thompson.“Just laying it all out,” he said after he had athletic runs of 41 and 27 yards and provided a shifty release option in the passing game. His speed and core strength seemed reminiscent of the style of Dunn, Florida State’s pre-eminent running back.If not for Coach Jimbo Fisher’s remade offensive line, though, Thompson and Manuel may not have had room to show their brilliance. Last season, Manuel was sacked 40 times. Center Bryan Stork blamed injuries and a general lack of communication and knowledge of the plays.As Florida State generated 667 yards Saturday, starting next to Stork were Cameron Erving, who played defensive tackle last season; Josue Matias and Tre’ Jackson, who started one game each last season when they were freshmen; and Menelik Watson, a junior college transfer.“The holes are there,” Wilder said. “There aren’t a lot of sacks. There aren’t a lot of carries that we’re stopped at the line. We’re usually 5 yards past the line of scrimmage before we get touched.”The starting linemen’s average weight is 319 pounds, reflecting Fisher’s fresh emphasis on size: 18 Seminoles are listed at 300 pounds or heavier. On defense, size inside has allowed defensive ends Bjoern Werner and Cornellius Carradine to wreak havoc. Carradine had two sacks Saturday, but his five and a half sacks still trail Werner’s six and a half, which lead the country.The Seminoles’ lines — ferocious on defense, effective on offense — resemble those that played with Dunn, Ward and Weinke.“Size and girth makes a difference with athleticism; I mean, mass matters,” Fisher said last week, adding, “It lets you be forceful, and that physical pounding wears on people.”By the time Manuel sprinted down the sideline toward the end zone, Florida State’s will had been imposed. At halftime, with his team down by 21-14, Manuel made a speech to inspire urgency, reminding his teammates what was expected. The Seminoles then outscored the Tigers, 35-16.With Manuel’s — and Florida State’s — message made, he slid well short of the goal line, purposely killing the clock, as if he too had been there before.'"

BBDO had been the creative agency for Visa USA from 1985 to 2005, when those duties went to the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA. In 2009, Visa consolidated the worldwide creative assignment at TBWA.

"'12-09-25,'0','Brooks seemed awe-struck after receiving his first tour of the arena, marveling at its cavernous interior (“It’s very spacious — it goes up”) and predicting that the Nets would enjoy a very loud and very healthy home-court advantage.Lopez got his tour Friday at the arena’s ribbon-cutting ceremony. He was the only player in attendance that day, an indication of just how eager he was to see his new home. Lopez spent several minutes walking around the court, gazing up at the rows of black seats.The arena’s long-awaited opening surely meant more to Lopez than any other Net. Drafted in 2008, he is the Nets’ longest-tenured player and the one who has endured the most to reach this point. The Nets won 92 games and lost 220 in Lopez’s first four seasons while burning through three head coaches, two general managers and two nondescript New Jersey arenas.Lopez is one of two Nets (along with Kris Humphries) remaining from the humiliating 2009-10 season, when they lost a franchise-record 70 games. He chuckled when it was suggested he had earned this moment.“I’m pumped,” he said. “Throughout that whole process, everyone kept talking about Brooklyn and stuff like that, how exciting it was going to be. So I just focused on making myself a better player, helping my team in any way possible. And with all the talk I heard about Brooklyn, I knew it was just something I wanted to be part of. It was something that was going to be big.”Lopez endured a broken foot that wiped out nearly his entire final season in New Jersey. But he is healthy again and has been scrimmaging five-on-five with his teammates during informal workouts this month.“I haven’t been thinking about it when I’m playing,” Lopez said of his foot, adding, “I’m very confident out there.”Before the injury, Lopez had become one of the league’s best scoring big men, averaging 20.4 points a game in 2010-11. The Nets need a healthy and effective Lopez if they hope to crack the top tier of the Eastern Conference.Then again, they might not need nearly as much from him after acquiring Johnson, Mirza Teletovic and others this summer. This will be, by far, the most talented Nets team that Lopez has been part of.The Nets’ new team store — a staple for most franchises these days — is remarkably the first in the franchise history. But then there was not much of a fan base to serve in East Rutherford, or any ability to walk up to the arena in the Meadowlands to make a purchase.More than 100 fans lined up along Flatbush for the store’s opening Monday morning. Some 300 filed through the shop in the first hour. Lopez lingered long after the autograph session was over.“I want to spend as much time as possible here,” he said of the arena. “This is really our home now.”'"
"'12-09-25,'0','But a similar urgency to address runway safety has lagged, safety experts said. Only in the last year have all 35 major airports installed new ground radars that provide air-traffic controllers a better view of the runways, and a handful of airports are now testing a new system of warning lights on runways.“These incidents remind us how vulnerable we are when procedures or people fail,” said Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the , which has put runway safety on its top 10 list of priorities since 1990.The said the number of runway incidents that it classifies as most severe — in which a collision is narrowly avoided — has dropped in the last decade. In 2000, there were 67 serious incidents, only half involving a commercial aircraft, compared with just 12 in 2011.Still, the , an auditing arm of Congress, said there were 18 incidents per million flights in 2010, up from 11 per million in 2004. The safety board said about a dozen incidents are serious enough to warrant an investigation each year.Airports, particularly major hubs, are busy places that can handle more than a hundred flights an hour, while thousands of fuel trucks, bag tugs, catering trucks and many other vehicles crisscross the airfield.Most incidents involve jets, but there have also been cases where fire trucks, helicopters, animal control vehicles, police cars and even pedestrians, cross runways by mistake in recent years. In one instance, a 767 landing at Honolulu International Airport in 2009 was forced to slam on the brakes to avoid striking an F-15 fighter jet that had stopped on the runway. The pilot realized there was an obstacle only when he saw the F-15’s tailpipes and stopped 200 feet from the fighter.In 65 percent of cases, pilots are blamed, according to the F.A.A. In a few extreme cases, pilots have landed on a taxiway. In 2009, for instance, a Boeing 767 coming from mistook a taxiway for a runway at .Hazards on runways are likely to increase with the expansion of air traffic in coming decades, said James M. Burin, the director of technical programs at the Flight Safety Foundation, an aviation consulting firm. “ is really starting to become an issue, and with that, the risks of planes’ colliding with each other,” Mr. Burin said.A runway incursion in 1977 caused the deadliest accident in aviation history, when two Boeing 747s — a and a Royal Dutch KLM flight — collided on a runway at Tenerife Airport in the , killing 583 people. In 1991, a Boeing 737 landing at Los Angeles International Airport collided with a commuter jet that was about to take off. Thirty-four people died.The last fatal accident involving a commercial aircraft and a runway incursion in the occurred in 1996, in Quincy, Ill., when a commuter plane and a private plane collided at crisscrossing runways, killing 14 people.After a series of close calls, the biggest pilot union, the , warned in 2007 that “the risk of a runway incursion event that could kill hundreds of people in a single accident is real and growing larger.”That year, the F.A.A. bolstered its runway safety program. It required airports to install more explicit signs to better mark runways and taxiways, and expanded the use of ground radar systems, called ASDE-X. These give air traffic controllers a real-time picture of where airplanes are on the airfield and an alarm in the event of a potential problem.Two years ago, the F.A.A. changed its runway procedures, requiring pilots cleared to proceed on taxiways to also get explicit approval from the tower before crossing a runway.The F.A.A. is also testing a new system at Los Angeles International Airport and a handful of other airports called Runway Status Lights, which uses red warning lights embedded in runways and taxiways that automatically turn on when a runway is being used. The F.A.A. aims to have the system at 23 airports by 2016.The Transportation Department’s inspector general also questioned the F.A.A.’s reporting of incidents, describing the rating process in a July 2010 review as “inconsistent, subjective, and potentially susceptible to bias, making the accuracy of year-to-year comparisons of serious accidents questionable.”In the case of the Southwest flight at Midway last December, because the F.A.A. determined that the Southwest plane had “ample time” to stop, the incident was classified as a category C, less serious than a category A, defined as “an incident where a collision was narrowly avoided,” or B, “an incident in which separation decreases and there is significant potential for collision.”Critics also point out that the ground radar does not always provide perfect coverage, and according to the G.A.O., the technology has suffered from “operational difficulties with its alerting function.” In some cases, the alarm sounded when there was no risk. In others, it failed to sound at all. At International Airport in 2010, a vehicle entered an active runway undetected while an Air Canada jet was about to take off.Some airports have taken a different tack, building new taxiways that go around the runways. ’s airport, one of the world’s busiest, recently completed one of those, reducing runway crossings by 600 a day. But many airports, including the three serving , do not have enough room to expand.“It boils down to layers of safety,” said Jacqueline Yaft, the deputy executive director of operations and emergency management at the Airport. “One system alone doesn’t eliminate all risk or fix it all.”'"
"'12-09-25,'0','Apple’s decision to switch to its own, less-polished maps does not appear to have hurt sales of its latest iPhone, which went on sale Friday in Japan to long lines and much fanfare. But it has demonstrated, on a global scale, how Apple, a seemingly infallible company, is still prone to embarrassing missteps.Apple’s map errors have been particularly embarrassing in hard-to-navigate Japan, where maps have become an essential smartphone feature. In Japan, most streets do not have names, and house numbers are often assigned by order of registration, not location. Before GPS and smartphones, the Japanese often went around city blocks two or three times, puzzling over well-worn maps looking for an address.Moreover, cities like Tokyo are changing fast: its 80,000 restaurants, for example, open and close at a rapid rate amid cutthroat competition. Navitime, another map app that has benefited from Apple’s map problems, updates its data every eight hours, and replaces a third of its seven million data points every year.Against this challenging backdrop, Apple’s maps have been a disappointment from the start. In central Tokyo, they show a busy Shinjuku subway station in the middle of serene Shinjuku Gyoen park, one of many errors diligently cataloged by Japanese bloggers. The Hinode monorail stop hovers above the waters of Tokyo Bay, which is erroneously labeled “the North Pacific.”Hikarie, the new shopping tower, is nowhere to be found, while a museum, now closed and once run by Tokyo Electric, the operator of the ravaged nuclear power plant at Fukushima, is marked as a major landmark nearby.Apple has said that its map service was a work in progress and would improve as more people used it.The biggest problem with Apple’s map, Mapion’s Mr. Yamagishi said, is that much of its data appears to be drawn from OpenStreetMap Japan, a Wikipedia-like service that contains a lot of incorrect and outdated information.Moreover, Japan uses a system of longitude and latitude that differs slightly from the global standard, and Apple may have mixed up data sources that use the two systems, Mr. Yamagishi said.At certain points, the difference between the Japanese and international coordinate systems can come to as much as 450 meters (1,476 feet), according to Japan’s Land Ministry.“It looks like they haven’t merged their various data sources very well. That’s a painstaking process that will take a lot of time and effort,” Mr. Yamagishi said.Mapion has been merging data constantly since 1997, he said, and has a team of engineers who scour sources for information that might require map updates. The team got the word in November 2011 that Hikarie would open the following year, and quickly updated its data with the planned shopping tower.Those efforts have paid off: Mapion gets a combined 86 million page views of its online map service a month from PCs and smartphones.'"

"'12-09-25,'0','The task force did not recommend the same screening and counseling for adolescents because, it said, it was less clear whether the benefits would outweigh the potential harm, like anxiety or the stigma of being singled out.Susan Curry, a panel member, emphasized that the recommendation was preventive, designed to keep people who drank more alcohol than they should from becoming alcoholics. People who are already addicted need more extensive help, she said, like therapy in rehabilitation clinics.“This says, ‘Let’s pay attention,’ ” said Dr. Curry, who is the dean of the College of Public Health at the University of Iowa. “ ‘You may want to take a look at how you are drinking. If it escalates, you’re at risk, but you can change that now.’ ”The panel based its recommendations on a review of research that showed counseling helped reduce binge drinking. According to those studies, the number of adults with risky drinking behaviors who reported no heavy drinking within a year was 12 percent higher among those who received counseling than those who did not. The research also indicated that several sessions of counseling were more effective than only one.It also found that counseling helped patients who drank more than the recommended limit reduce their weekly consumption. Patients who had received counseling consumed an average of 19 drinks a week, down from 23, the panel said, while those who received no counseling did not change their level.The task force is a group of 16 experts, who are appointed by the government but independent, that makes recommendations about screening tests and other efforts to prevent disease. Its advice is based on medical evidence, not cost.The strongest of the panel’s recommendations are now hard-wired into the country’s health care system through the Affordable Care Act, which requires health insurance companies to cover many of the services or treatments free of charge to the patient. The recommendation about alcohol screening falls into that category.The recommendations, issued in draft form on Monday, will be published in a final version after a public comment period. They are not new; the panel is reaffirming its advice from 2004.While few dispute the value of offering alcohol counseling to those who need it, primary care doctors are not always able to take the time to follow through. A 2004 study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine that used national data estimated that 45 percent of adults reported being asked about their alcohol use during a routine primary care visit. Among those with risky drinking patterns, about 60 percent reported being asked.Alcohol misuse contributes to many illnesses, the panel said, including hypertension, liver disease and breast and esophageal cancers. The studies were not designed to measure the effect that counseling had on mortality rates, the panel said.'"
"'12-09-25,'0','TiVo, the digital video recorder maker, said Monday that it would receive at least $250.4 million from Verizon Communications in a patent lawsuit settlement.TiVo has turned to litigation to generate revenue from licensing fees as it struggles with competition from low-cost rivals.Analysts said the settlement could bode well for a TiVo victory in cases against other companies, including Time Warner Cable and Motorola Mobility, which is now owned by Google. TiVo reached a similar deal in January with AT&T, which agreed to pay $215 million.TiVo also prevailed in a similar case against Dish Network and EchoStar in May 2011. Verizon declined to comment and referred questions to TiVo.Regarding the continuing legal cases, “Verizon has set a strong precedent for Motorola to settle,” said Todd Mitchell, an analyst at Brean Murray, Carret, a boutique investment bank.'"
"'12-09-25,'0','And the parasitic strategy is so irresistible that according to recent research in the journal Ecology, the spotted antbirds on Barro Colorado Island just may be taking it professional. Whereas the species has traditionally opted for a mixed approach — filching from ant swarms but also finding food on its own — the island-bound antbirds appear to increasingly depend on army ants to scare up their every meal.Janeene M. Touchton a researcher associated with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Princeton, and the principal author of the report, is now trying to identify the personality traits that may facilitate a spotted antbird’s leap from amateur to polished parasite. Is it boldness, aggressiveness, a love of novelty? Or maybe a lack of aggressiveness, a nonchalance about territory and a refusal to pick a fight? She is collaborating on the project with Martin Wikelski of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology.Dr. Touchton, who is 37, looks as if she could be Keira Knightley’s sister and has the field-hardiness of a Dr. Livingstone. In her view, studying spotted antbirds offers an extraordinary opportunity to catch evolution on the wing, to identify the precise steps behind the great mystery of how new species arise from old ones.“If spotted antbirds on the island are losing some of their plasticity, if they’re trading in the life of a generalist for that of a specialist, I want to know what that process is,” Dr. Touchton said. “I want to see it happen.”Michaela Hau of the Max Planck Institute and the University of Konstanz, who has studied breeding patterns among antbirds, said Dr. Touchton was “getting fantastic data out of the system — and she’s gathered the data through heroic fieldwork, through crazy, really hard work.”The antbird story also demonstrates the vividly baklavaian nature of parasitism in a tropical rain forest. Researchers have identified three species of butterfly that specialize in following antbirds. The reason? The butterflies feed on bird droppings, and though guano is a notoriously unpredictable resource in a rain forest, these butterflies know where their suppliers are likely to be found.“I always end my talks by showing a slide of this complex, quadruple-tiered relationship,” said Joseph Tobias of the University of Oxford, who studies antbird song and has worked with Dr. Touchton. “You have the ants themselves, followed by a gaggle of antbirds, and behind the antbirds are the butterflies, and behind them are a couple of bird watchers.”Antbirds belong to a large, old and almost purely tropical avian family of some 200 species, only a fraction of which have anything to do with ants. The new research looked at three swarm-stalking species that live in the same region of Panama: the spotted antbird, the slightly larger bicolored antbird and the even larger ocellated antbird. All three adhere to the basic script of tropical birds, living much longer than the two or three years of the average chickadee or sparrow up north but brooding significantly smaller clutches per year, and with males and females singing jointly to prove to the world that they’re a formidable team.“We call them mutually vocally ornamented,” Dr. Tobias said. “It’s a very egalitarian setup.”All three types of antbirds are adapted to the clotted, shadowy conditions of the understory, which means they flit more than they fly and they avoid open, sunny places. Fields, rivers and hills are essentially impassable barriers.The birds also have features designed for the ant-following trade — big, strong legs and long claws for gripping onto vertical stems and branches as they lean sideways to scan the forest floor for ants, and pie-plate eyes to spot minor movements in very low lighting. They look for the earliest possible signs of approaching Eciton burchelli, the most formidable species of army ant in the neotropics.“Eciton are like lions,” said Michael Kaspari, an ant expert at the University of Oklahoma. “They’re the top predators of the tropical forest.”Their armies are shape-shifting nation-states built of hundreds of thousands of ants — bridges of ants, spiraling staircases of ants. Army ants don’t dig nests, as most ants do; they become nests. When it’s time for the queen to fatten up and lay a new round of eggs, the worker ants find a nice hollow log, link themselves together like Lego pieces, and form a bivouac, a vast, quivering, climate-controlled haven for the colony’s crown jewel. Most bivouacs are the size of a basketball, Dr. Kaspari said, “but I’ve seen ones as big as a couch.”When the eggs hatch and there are multitudes of young mouths to feed, the workers light out in search of prey. The ants are savage, relentless, capturing as many as 30,000 prey items in a single day. They scale trees to pull down giant scorpions, raid wasps’ nests and overwhelm the defenses of even the most violent Africanized bees. Any life form lying in the ants’ path knows its only chance is to try to leap away — and the antbirds know it, too.The birds swoop down and pick off as many of the harrowed menu items as they can get away with, a kleptoparasitism that ends up reducing the ants’ hunting success by one-sixth. Each of the three types of antbird makes its grab from a particular position around the swarm.As the biggest, most dominant member of the antbird guild and an “obligate” parasite — one that cannot find food on its own — the ocellated antbird monopolizes the leading edge and snaps up the meatiest prey. The bicolored antbird, also an obligate parasite, occupies the side position and takes in the second-order invertebrates. Spotted antbirds content themselves with the dregs at the rear. After all, they’re only discretionary parasites and can compensate later with independent foraging.In the new work, the researchers compared the standard three-part scrimmaging of antbirds seen on the Panamanian mainland with the situation on Barro Colorado Island, where the ocellated antbird recently went extinct. They expected that the bicolored antbirds on the island, as the beta birds of the pecking order and obligate parasites besides, would be the biggest beneficiaries of the loss of competition.Instead, it seems that the spotted antbirds are the ones making the most of the newly opened niche. For one thing, while the island’s population of bicoloreds has stagnated and may even be shrinking, the number of spotted antbirds is on the rise. Moreover, some spotted antbirds on the island are clearly losing interest in maintaining and defending specific territories, as spotted antbirds on the mainland vigorously do.In tricky field experiments just now under way, Dr. Touchton is using checkered flags and other novelty objects to determine whether antbirds that score low in neophobia — fear of the new — are the ones most likely to roam. As she explained, obligate parasites can’t be tethered to static real estate. If ants are always on the move, their true moochers must follow. Home, for them, must be where the swarm is.'"
"'12-09-25,'0','Still, the prospect of a speedy return to politics is clouded by the fact that Mr. Olmert is fighting another corruption case, in which he is charged with taking bribes in connection with the construction of a huge residential complex while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.Eli Abarbanel, a lawyer for the prosecution, said after Monday’s decision, “We thought the principle of equality before the law required a sentence no less than community service.”“This episode is not over,” Mr. Abarbanel added, saying that prosecutors would study the sentence before deciding how to proceed, and that they were also studying the original verdict, with a view to a possible appeal.Mr. Olmert has acknowledged making mistakes in the years before he became prime minister, but he has always denied criminal wrongdoing. He insisted that the matter on which he was convicted, known as the Investment Center affair, amounted to procedural irregularity rather than corruption. In their ruling on Monday, the judges described the conflict of interest as “acute.”Mr. Olmert was acquitted in July of two more serious matters, the most sensational one involving accusations of the transfer of large sums of money from Morris Talansky, an American businessman whose early testimony was instrumental in Mr. Olmert’s downfall. The prosecution failed to prove that the money was used for private purposes.The second involved accusations that, while he was mayor of Jerusalem and later in the cabinet, he billed multiple state and charitable agencies for the same travel expenses and used the extra money for private family trips.The acquittals caused an uproar in Israel and led to questions about zealous state prosecutors who appeared to have staked their prestige on convicting the former prime minister.The judges on Monday noted that Mr. Olmert’s resignation from office was connected with these matters and not the Investment Center affair.Mr. Olmert came of age politically in the Likud Party but by the time he became prime minister, he was the leader of Kadima, a centrist party established in 2005.Israeli elections have to be held within the next 14 months. Mr. Olmert’s sentencing comes amid speculation about a reordering of the centrist forces in Israeli politics. Newcomers like Yair Lapid, a former journalist, have entered politics, and there is talk of a comeback by Tzipi Livni, a former foreign minister who succeeded Mr. Olmert as the leader of Kadima but was unable to form a government of her own. Soon after losing the party leadership in March, she resigned from Parliament.'"

Who could have guessed 40 years ago, when a band of gay Jewish men came together in Greenwich Village to worship because they were welcome nowhere else, that today gay marriage would be legal in this state and others? Who could have guessed 20 years later, after AIDS had killed a generation of gay men, faster than they could be properly mourned, that Congregation Beit Simchat Torah would be a “real’’ synagogue, with a lesbian rabbi? Who could have guessed that before long Beit Simchat Torah would be a magnet for both gays and straights, Jews and Christians, especially on the High Holy Days — Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur — when most synagogues are open only to members with tickets? And that their open-door policy would draw crowds so large it meant using New York City’s historic Town Hall for the first holiday and the cavernous Jacob Javits Convention Center for the second? Attending on the first night of Rosh Hashanah, and welcomed as a “practicing heterosexual,’’ I noted that the audience had at least two things in common: A belief that religion could and should be an open tent. And enough years on this earth to know that there is a time to sow and a time to reap, and that the second required both grace and courage.

A complete version of the poem, in yet another translation, can be found here if you scroll to the bottom.Inside me the season is autumn,the chill is in me, you can see through me, and I am sad, but not altogether cheerless,and filled with humility and goodness.But if I rage sometimesthen I am the one whose rage is shedding my leaves, and the simple thought comes sadly to methat raging isn’t really what is needed.The main need is that I should be ableto see myself and the struggling, shocked worldin autumnal nakedness,when even you, and the world, can be seen right through.From “Bratsk Station, and Other New Poems’’  by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, translated by Tupikina-Glaessner, Dutton & Mazbakoff-Koriakin, copyright © 1966 by Sun Books Pty.

"'12-09-26,'0','Gov. Jerry Brown signed several bills on Tuesday that will keep California parks open for the next two years and will provide greater oversight of the embattled state park system. Officials discovered this year that parks employees had hidden $54 million, even as 70 parks faced closings because of budget cuts. The bills signed on Tuesday would institute a two-year moratorium on park closings and provide $30 million to finance maintenance and parks at risk of closure, in addition to $10 million to match private donations made this year to keep parks open.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','Steven Banks, the chief lawyer of the in New York, said that the new requirement put “a procedure in place to verify that the stop and subsequent arrest were proper.”“This is exactly what prosecutors should be doing before proceeding with criminal prosecutions — namely making sure that formulaic statements by police officers actually have some basis to support the arrest and prosecution,” Mr. Banks said.The city’s reliance on stop-and-frisk has come under intense scrutiny and legal challenges, as critics charge that the police disproportionately target minorities and harass innocent people. That sentiment is especially prevalent at housing projects, which account for about 10 percent to 15 percent of all police stops; the trespassing arrests occur when officers are unconvinced that a person lives at the housing project or is a guest.Police officers typically fill out a sworn statement and some check-the-box-type paperwork on such low-level arrests.Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney, , said that the new policy of requiring interviews of officers “was discussed with the offices of the other district attorneys and the ,” but he would not comment further because of continuing litigation.The new policy in the Bronx led to an Internal Affairs Bureau inquiry into the allegation of improper arrests, according to a letter sent by Police Commissioner to Mr. Johnson on Sept. 6. Mr. Kelly said that no misconduct had been uncovered, and that it appeared that Ms. Rucker’s “estimation of the issue was in error and that she overstated her perception of discrepancies regarding criminal trespass arrests in the Bronx.”Mr. Kelly also suggested that Ms. Rucker was unable to provide specifics of the cases referred to in her letter, and that she could cite only one example in which she alleged an arrest was dismissed because of a police error. Nonetheless, he added that the legal issues surrounding trespassing arrests would be addressed at training sessions at the precinct and borough levels.Mr. Johnson has adopted some independent positions before. In 2006, he became the first prosecutor to use the state’s 2001 antiterrorism statute, doing so against a street gang member. He also issued a statement in 1995 saying he did not intend to pursue execution in first-degree murder cases.The letter from Ms. Rucker, who is the chief of arraignments for the Bronx district attorney, was filed in federal court this week in a lawsuit challenging trespass arrests in New York. The lawsuit was filed by Legal Aid and the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund.Prosecutors in the Bronx have been “experiencing a great deal of problems with trespassing” arrests, Ms. Rucker wrote in the July 18 letter. She wrote that she had received numerous complaints from defense lawyers who claimed that many of the people arrested were not trespassers. Deciding to investigate further, she found that “in many (but not all) of the cases the defendants arrested were either legitimate tenants or invited guests,” she wrote.In some cases, Ms. Rucker claimed, the police arrested people even when there was persuasive evidence that they were not trespassing, citing “several instances where defendants who were guests, had the person whom they were visiting verify this fact to the arresting officer, yet the defendant was arrested anyway.” In those cases, the deposition from the arresting officer “indicated the defendant did not know the name of any tenant or the apartment number.”From 2009 to 2011, the police arrested more than 16,000 people on trespass charges in public housing, according to a report filed as part of the federal litigation over the arrests.At the Mott Haven Houses in the Bronx on Tuesday, several tenants and neighbors said they had been wrongly arrested for trespassing.Darren Jones, 28, said he was arrested in the elevator of his building in the development about two months ago because he did not have identification.Quanell Carwell, 27, a hairstylist who lives at the Mott Haven complex, said she was in the courtyard common area three weeks ago when she was arrested on a trespassing charge. She was given a desk appearance ticket, but said she was going to plead not guilty because she did not do anything wrong.In addition to stops in public housing, Ms. Rucker’s letter addresses stops in private buildings registered with the Clean Halls program, in which landlords of some 16,000 buildings have given the police permission to enter and patrol the hallways and stairwells. The Legal Aid Society and civil rights groups, including the , have sued the city over trespass arrests in both public housing and buildings registered with the Clean Halls program.According to another memorandum filed in the lawsuit, the Police Department had voiced its own concern about the legality of police stops at housing projects. In 2010, Katherine Lemire, the counsel to Mr. Kelly, told the that she had “found many instances in which officers were incorrectly stating the required standard for a question or stop” at public housing, according to a memo prepared by Meera Joshi, then a deputy executive director at the board.Paul J. Browne, the chief police spokesman, said that Ms. Lemire only learned of “several” instances — not “many” — in which officers were mistaken about the legal standard for stopping people.Ms. Joshi wrote that Ms. Lemire pointed out that some officers were under the mistaken impression that they “were entitled to stop and question anyone inside” public housing.In fact, legal experts say, the police require reasonable suspicion that a person is about to or has just committed a penal code violation before stopping that person.After Ms. Lemire’s findings, Commissioner Kelly issued a directive reinforcing the legal standards and ordered intensive training for all housing officers and certain patrol officers. In all, some 3,000 officers went through a three-week training program, conducted by the department’s academy chief and overseen by the commanding officer of the Legal Bureau, according to Ms. Joshi’s Sept. 28, 2010, memo.Even so, problems with trespassing cases seemed to persist.“Unfortunately, as this most recent letter shows, these stops and arrests continue, and more drastic measures are needed,” Christopher Dunn, the associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said.Mr. Browne said that the department was committed to lawfully conducting “stops of trespassers in New York City public housing as a means of fighting crime and offering some semblance of safety that residents of doormen buildings often take for granted.”He said that even though the department’s inquiry into the allegations by the Bronx district attorney’s office had not found any police misconduct, “the N.Y.P.D. engaged in retraining on the issues,” adding that Ms. Rucker has asked that her own staff receive the same training.In Brooklyn, prosecutors shared their own concerns about potentially problematic trespass cases with prosecutors around the city and the Police Department’s legal bureau, according to Jerry Schmetterer, a spokesman for the borough’s district attorney. The topic surfaced about two years ago, he said.“We found that there were times when the basis for the arrests might not have been the criteria we were looking for, and we addressed that through training,” Mr. Schmetterer said.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','The government considers all three brigades as “authorized” and, in fact, essential. But they remain independent, and last Friday one of the three came under attack by anti-militia demonstrators.If successful, the appointment of army officers to lead the militias could be the first tangible step toward government control of the brigades. Until now the transitional government has in effect handed army or internal security uniforms to brigade fighters and left their commanders in place.But brigade leaders gave conflicting reports of the new officers’ authority. The commander of the Rafallah al-Sehati Brigade, Mohamed al-Gharabi, said in an interview on Tuesday that he had stepped aside to make room for the appointment by the army chief of Col. Salah bin Omran to lead his militia. Asked what his position was, Mr. Gharabi said, “Nothing.”A spokesman for a coalition of brigades that includes Rafallah al-Sehati and others reported to be under a newly appointed commander said that their former leaders remained in place but that a new administrative officer had been added. “The commander of the brigade is still the same,” said the spokesman, Ramiz Daghman, disputing Mr. Gharabi’s account.A senior officer in Rafallah al-Sehati, Ismail al-Sallabi, also indicated that he expected his militia to resume its role without any such changes. “We feel hurt, we feel underappreciated,” he said, describing his brigade’s role in guarding ballot boxes and otherwise keeping the peace during the election in July.Security officials at the Tripoli hotel attacked by militiamen said that two people had been injured in an exchange of gunfire but that the hotel guards had repelled the attack.Two security officials at the hotel, the Rixos, said the attack grew out of a protest by three different groups of Libyan fighters, each with its own complaints. One group, based in the Souk al-Juma district, was angry over what it called a lack of government support when it fought suspected Qaddafi loyalists in the western town of Birak.Another group, based in Misurata, was angry over the death in Paris of a rebel fighter from that coastal city, Omran Shaaban, who was famous for a leading role in the capture and killing of Colonel Qaddafi. They believe Mr. Shaaban had died of injuries sustained at the hands of Qaddafi loyalists in the town of Bani Walid, a last bastion of Qaddafi support that remains outside the new government’s control. Misurata and Bani Walid have a history of animosity dating to the Italian occupation decades ago.The third group may have been pushing back at the government’s drive to rein in the militia, or perhaps just defending the Islamist militias that have come under increased pressure recently after a hard-line brigade was seen at the forefront of the attack on the United States Mission in Benghazi. This group chanted, “There is no god but God, and Abu Shagour is the enemy of God,” against the new prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, according to two hotel security officials.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','This would require deep cuts in government spending. And the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has predicted that for Mr. Romney to fulfill his promises, he would have to raise taxes on the middle class and the poor.“Redistribution” has recently taken center stage in the presidential campaign, presented as a choice between Mr. Obama’s demand that millionaires pay a higher tax rate than their secretaries do and Mr. Romney’s impatience with moochers waiting for a government handout. Yet the discourse overstates the difference between what an Obama administration and a Romney administration would do to reduce the income gap.A Republican administration would most likely choose fewer taxes and less spending than a Democratic one. Still, demographics alone suggest that regardless of who is the next president, and the one after that, the government is going to wind up distributing more of the nation’s wealth than it does today.The debate about income inequality has grown louder as the nation’s income gap has widened over the last three decades. But it is hardly new.When Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for wanting to redistribute income, he was channeling Ronald Reagan, who quipped back in 1964: we “can’t see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion that the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one.”Yet, in fact, governments throughout our history — Republican and Democratic — have used taxes and transfers to subsidize the poor with money from the better off. At the end of the administration of George W. Bush in 2008, taxes and government spending trimmed the Gini index — a common measure of inequality that ranges from 0 when everybody has the same to 1 when a single person hogs everything — to 0.444, from 0.579, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Redistribution by government doesn’t always fit our expectations. President Reagan was indeed set against a broad redistribution of wealth. By the time he left office, the federal government was doing far less to close the gap on income inequality than when he arrived.Since then, however, there have been some surprising turns. President Bill Clinton, for instance, redistributed less than his predecessor, George H. W. Bush. When Mr. Clinton took the reins of government in 1993, taxes and transfers reduced the Gini index measure of inequality by 23 percent, according to the budget office. When he left office in 2000, income inequality was much greater than when he started. Yet government closed the gap by only 21 percent.Even George W. Bush did more. He slashed taxes on the rich and tried to privatize Social Security. But by the end of his administration, taxes and government spending closed the income gap by 23 percent.Administrations face constraints, of course. An attempt to compromise with Congressional Republicans led President Obama to extend his predecessor’s tax cuts, rather than repeal them as he had proposed, sending less money from the rich to the poor than he had promised.Despite his distaste for redistribution, Mr. Romney has staunchly defended at least a part of it: opposing some $700 billion worth of cuts to the Medicare program.Beyond political limitations, the amount of redistribution by government is shaped largely by outside factors: in the short term, the economic cycle, and in the long term, demographic change.The amount of money that the government moves from the rich to the poor will jump almost automatically in a recession because of rising unemployment payments.Unemployment insurance accounts for much of the growth in government transfers that made such a big dent in income inequality in the first year of the Obama administration.But there are long-term forces that will help determine how much wealth the government redistributes in the future. One is globalization. It increases demands for a bigger social safety net to protect workers from the uncertainty of a hypercompetitive open world economy, but also reduces the government’s ability to raise the money to finance it.Some economists worry that globalization makes it too difficult to raise money to redistribute. Corporate taxes, for instance, have dropped sharply as a source of revenue since the 1950s as corporate tax rates have been trimmed and companies have adopted more sophisticated financial tools to reduce their liability. As capital becomes easier to move across borders, corporate income may become even more difficult to tax.The other powerful driver is demographic change. Specifically, we are getting older.As the population ages, government spending on health care is expected to mushroom.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is on track to consume 16.5 percent of our national economic output by 2037, nine percentage points more than the average since the 1970s. This means the government will need to raise much more money. And though government spending on health also benefits the middle class and the rich, the money will flow mostly to the poor.Take it from Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who worked in the administration of George W. Bush. Mr. Viard is no spendthrift. He advocates trimming benefits — requiring that high-income Americans pick up more of the tab for their own health care. But he acknowledges that meeting our demographic challenge will require more spending, too.The American public will not really accept the kind of drastic cuts in benefits that would be needed to solve the entitlement crisis.The additional money won’t all come from the rich, of course. The “middle class,” defined by the president as families earning less than $250,000, will need to chip in, too, to pay for the larger government in our future. Yet the result is almost certainly much more redistribution of wealth than we have today. Mr. Viard puts it well: “It seems that a larger share of our economic resources will be redistributed.” That’s regardless of who occupies the White House.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','Two weeks after the Metropolitan Museum of Art said it was considering staying open seven days a week, the Museum of Modern Art announced that starting in May it would be open every day, including Tuesday, the one day it has traditionally been closed.The main reason is growing attendance, said Glenn D. Lowry, MoMA’s director, in a telephone interview. The number of visitors has nearly doubled, to nearly 3 million annually from around 1.5 million, in the eight years since MoMA reopened after its expansion and renovation in 2004. “Our galleries are pretty close to being maxed out,” Mr. Lowry said.The museum was open every day since its founding in 1929, until 1975, when it closed one day a week (originally Wednesdays) to reduce operating expenses.National museums in the United States, including the National Gallery of Art in Washington, are open every day, as are major London institutions, including the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the Tate Britain and the Wallace Collection.“The question has been, ‘How do they do it?’ ” Mr. Lowry said, adding, “The larger question for us has been how to best serve the needs of the public.” After analyzing the costs and extra labor required to be open an additional day, the museum determined that it was doable.Mr. Lowry said that three years ago he started discussing with his staff the idea of staying open longer. One idea considered was extending the hours on the days the museum was already open, rather than opening on Tuesdays.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','With a once-a-decade leadership transition expected to take place this fall, Chinese officials are watchful for any potential trouble here. Written requests for comments made to both the headquarters of the Beijing police and the Foreign Ministry went unanswered on Tuesday.It was unclear whether American officials are negotiating with the Chinese government to allow Mr. Ai to travel to the United States. An embassy spokesperson did not return a request for comment. The Smithsonian Institution has written the Chinese culture minister reaffirming the invitation for Mr. Ai from the Hirshhorn.While in detention, Mr. Ai was interrogated on, among other things, the value of his artwork, and tax officials later said he owed $2.4 million in back taxes and penalties. Mr. Ai sued the tax authorities in a Beijing court, but the court ruled against him. Mr. Ai appealed the ruling at a higher court; he said court officials were expected to announce a decision on Thursday.Mr. Ai, the son of one of the most respected modern Chinese poets, has for years been an outspoken critic of China’s authoritarian system. When he was released from detention in June 2011, he was ordered not to talk to foreign journalists or use Twitter. He habitually violated those directives and has continued to make his presence felt both in the streets of Beijing and on the Internet.Mr. Ai said his inability to travel abroad had prevented him from starting a job as a visiting professor at the Berlin University of the Arts. Mr. Ai said the school asked for a three-year commitment, and he expects to spend several months each year in Berlin if he can travel.For his scheduled appearances in the United States, Mr. Ai said he had planned to leave at the end of September and spend four to six weeks in the country.A team from Mr. Ai’s studio is already at the Hirshhorn, where it is preparing the opening of his exhibition, “Ai Weiwei: According to What?”“The exhibition will be ready by the opening and it already looks very powerful,” the exhibition curator, Mami Kataoka, of the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, said in an e-mail. “The only thing I can say is that we would miss him very much.”Organizers of The New Yorker Festival, to be held in New York in early October, had also planned for Mr. Ai to be there. And on Oct. 11, Mr. Ai was scheduled to take part in a talk at the Public Theater in New York as part of the PEN World Voices Festival, an annual literary gathering whose aim is to help defend freedom of expression around the world.The festival director, Laszlo Jakab Orsos, said if Mr. Ai managed to get his passport, the Oct. 11 event would still take place. “The question is: What can we do when artistic freedom is so blatantly denied at this point?” Mr. Orsos said. “It’s very sobering and sad, the whole situation.”'"
"'12-09-26,'0','He said one of the most pressing immediate issues confronting the United Nations is the Syria conflict, which began in March 2011 and is now causing regional instability. “This is a serious and growing threat to international peace and security which requires Security Council action,” Mr. Ban said.The Council remains sharply divided on Syria, with Russia and China arguing that the opposition needs to be curbed while the West wants President Bashar al-Assad to step aside.“We must stop the violence and flows of arms to both sides, and set in motion a Syrian-led transition as soon as possible,” said Mr. Ban. He noted that “brutal” human rights abuses continue, “mainly by the government, but also by opposition groups.” Criminal prosecution should be pursued, he said.On the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, being given scant high-level attention this week, Mr. Ban said that when it comes to the two-state solution, “the door may be closing, for good.” The growth of settlements in occupied Palestinian territory as “seriously undermines,” efforts toward peace, he said.Mr. Ban also made an oblique critical reference to the threats traded between Israel and Iran about a possible war over Iran’s disputed nuclear program, describing the shrill war talk as “alarming.”“I also reject both the language of delegitimization and threats of potential military action by one state against another,” he said. “Any such attacks would be devastating.”Speaking about the outbreak of global rioting in the past few weeks over an anti-Muslim video, Mr. Ban said, “a disgraceful act of great insensitivity has led to justifiable offense and unjustifiable violence.”While endorsing freedom of speech as a fundamental right, he said it should not be used as a license to incite nor commit violence. Divisions around the world are too often “exploited for short-term political gain,” Mr. Ban told 120 assembled world leaders.“Too many people are read to take small flames of difference and turn them into a bonfire,” he said. “Too many people are tolerant of intolerance.”'"
"'12-09-26,'0','The price cutoffs for each tier vary widely depending on the city. The cutoff for the lowest tier ranges from $86,000 in to $349,000 in .Other data supports the trend. According to a report from Zillow, a real estate Web site that divides homes into three price groups, the gap in price changes between the top and the bottom of the market is narrowing. “It’s less that the top tier is cooling than that the bottom tier is strengthening,” said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. “The bulk of the recovery is due to the changes in the bottom and middle tiers.”Even in , where housing prices are still slightly down over the last year, lower-end homes have ticked up in value, which may be good news for sellers but can be a hurdle for buyers. Mark Graham, a youth pastor who has been looking for a house for his family there for months, said buying a home for less than $150,000 could be a challenge.“Houses are going on the market and within a day have multiple offers already on them,” Mr. Graham said, adding that most of the offers were from investors who did not need financing. “It’s more or less a heartbreaking market, because you get your heart set on a house, and then someone walks in with cash.”Not every market is showing improvement on the low end, according to Case-Shiller. Atlanta and are still lagging, but in places like and , the bottom third of houses are doing better.“The majority of the cities have been more like Boston and San Diego,” said Maureen Maitland, a vice president at S.& P. Indexes, which produces the Case-Shiller index.In , which has shown the strongest recovery in housing prices of the 20 cities surveyed, the lowest third — homes under $127,000 — gained 33.5 percent from July 2011 to July 2012, while the top tier — homes above $211,000 — posted an 11.5 percent increase in that period.Prices have been bolstered by a decline in the number of foreclosure sales and strong interest from investors, who are buying low-price properties and converting them to rentals.In the , Fla., area, investor demand has driven up prices for lower-end homes, said Roxanne Moore, a real estate agent with Green Lion Realty there.“Investors are finding properties that they used to be able to buy for $80,000 or $90,000 are now going for $100,000,” she said. In addition, after a long absence, first-time home buyers are beginning to trickle back in.Over all, home values in the first seven months of the year rose 5.9 percent, the best year-to-date performance in seven years. Nevertheless, the broad housing market is still nearly 30 percent below its high in 2006.In four cities — Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and New York — prices are lower than they were a year ago. In New York, including the surrounding suburbs, prices increased 1.2 percent from June to July, but remain 2.6 percent lower than they were in July 2011. Prices at the low end of the market — houses below $271,000 — have dropped 3.9 percent in the last year, while high-end homes — $437,000 or more — have dropped 2.5 percent.But in an optimistic sign, consumer confidence rose in September to its highest level since February, according to a report released Tuesday by , a private group.The consumer confidence index reached 70.3 points, well above economists’ expectations of 63 and a significant improvement from the upwardly revised level of 61.3 in August. Some analysts attributed the bump to gains in the stock market, while others credited the improved outlook for housing.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','Nemorino, a young man who feels deeply, thinks himself a nobody. To him Adina is a wonder, a woman running a farm, someone who reads books and knows things. When the dashing, cocky Sergeant Belcore shows up, and Adina appears to fall for him, Nemorino is tormented but not that surprised. What can Nemorino offer in comparison?This makes him an easy target for the sales pitch of Dr. Dulcamara, a quack who peddles an elixir that he says can grow hair, cure rickets and do almost anything (even combat bedbugs, which would make the stuff popular in New York). When Dulcamara claims that his brew is also an elixir of love, Nemorino must have it.In its look and feel, the production is true to the opera’s original setting. Michael Yeargan’s modest, painterly sets evoke wheat fields, vineyards and village piazzas in soft browns and russets; Catherine Zuber’s lovely costumes are similarly rustic and simple. In the opening scene, when the choristers, playing peasants, take a break from work and find shady spots to rest, you can practically feel the hazy Italian sun.The production’s contemporary element comes from showing the main characters engaged in a triangle of desire, distrust and gamesmanship. As Ms. Netrebko’s voice has gained body, power and darker colorings in recent years, she has been moving away from lighter ingénue roles toward vocally weightier repertory. So this may be the last chance for Met audiences to hear her impetuous Adina. If a soubrette soprano is your preference in this role, Ms. Netrebko’s full-throated performance is not for you. She may have almost too much voice for the music. Capping an agitated phrase with a penetrating top note, she sometimes sounded as if she were Tosca swearing vengeance.But in her village Adina is a like a prima donna, something Ms. Netrebko easily conveys. Her singing is feisty and earthy one moment, poignant and shimmering the next. If coloratura passages are not always smoothly executed, each run and roulade has shape and character. Her Adina is a breezy woman caught in a bind, touched by Nemorino’s passion but rattled by his helplessness.Wearing a wavy wig that makes him look like a cross between a Byronic hero and a disheveled bumpkin, Mr. Polenzani is an endearing Nemorino. But he captures the dangerous hothead side of the character as well, bounding about the stage, writhing with frustration and leaping atop crates to declare his love.Mr. Polenzani is coming into his prime. Though he still has youthful sweetness in his voice, in recent years he has been singing with increasing ardor, richness and power. He holds back nothing here. Yet in the great aria “Una furtiva lagrima,” where Nemorino dares to believe that Adina loves him, it was Mr. Polenzani’s honeyed phrases that won your heart.The baritone Mariusz Kwiecien, who performed Belcore in the final run of the previous “Elisir” production last season, is a stage natural who sings with hearty sound and seductive lyricism. Yet though Belcore is a self-absorbed lady’s man, Mr. Kwiecien sometimes makes him a crude, groping, bullying jerk. The production would be helped if the roughhousing and emotional intensity were dialed down a bit. This is “L’Elisir d’Amore” as a proto-verismo opera. Some restraint would have been welcome, too, in the conducting of Mr. Benini, who showed a tendency toward hard-driving tempos in the bustling ensemble scenes.For a demonstration of dramatic naturalness and stylish bel canto singing, there was the Italian baritone Ambrogio Maestri as Dr. Dulcamara. When he arrived in his colorful wagon to peddle his elixir (actually cheap Bordeaux), Mr. Maestri’s Dulcamara, a portly, rumpled giant of a man, looked eccentric enough to be believable. His voice is big, beefy and never forced; he sings with sly phrasing and droll comic timing.Over all, this psychologically charged take on “Elisir” is fascinating. On Monday, when Adina finally admitted to Nemorino that she loved him, a wide-eyed and out-of-control Mr. Polenzani grabbed Ms. Netrebko and gave her a smothering kiss. The audience applauded and cheered.Ms. Netrebko and Mr. Kwiecien will be back on opening night next season. No, not another Donizetti, but a new production of Tchaikovsky’s “Eugene Onegin.” Thank goodness.'"
"'12-09-26,'0','To a room full of millionaires, Mitt Romney said he will never get the votes of the 47 percent of Americans he sees as “dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.” Programs that provide food, medical care or shelter are, to him, drugs that turn users into Democratic-addicted voters, their individual initiative hollowed out.Mr. Romney has the politics backward. Evidence suggests that regions most dependent on government payments — places like eastern Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and northern Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho and Montana — reliably vote Republican. It is one of the great puzzles of modern politics, best expressed by the cry “Keep your government hands off my Medicare!”Democrats too quickly dismiss this paradox as hypocrisy or denial. It stems instead, I suspect, from the contradictions between old American ideologies and modern economic forces. From 19th-century Horatio Alger tales to modern conservatism’s up-by-your-bootstraps-ism, Americans have long cherished self-reliance.This idea now finds itself at odds — as it did in the Progressive Era and the Great Depression — with the vicissitudes of modern capitalism. As more people rely on government programs, from tax credits to school lunches to mortgage relief, some respond not with gratitude but resentment, focusing their ire not on the economic forces that brought them low but on the government programs that lift them up. Do they take Mr. Romney’s words seriously, and really believe themselves unable to “take personal responsibility”?Responding to this paradox requires an alternative to modern conservatism’s individualist ideologies. For too long, liberals have sought to persuade Americans, in the face of growing evidence to the contrary, that self-sufficiency and a middle-class life are compatible.'"

I’m told that’s generational, but I can’t envision myself laughing at something Mr. O’Brien said even at 35.1964 — The Warren Commission found that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of Kennedy, setting off a series of conspiracy theories that will likely exist as long as there are humans. Above is a remarkable newscast of Jack Ruby shooting Oswald. As I’ve noted before, the access news reporters had in that day was remarkable. You can clearly see Oswald being loaded into an ambulance. At one point, a cameraman pushes a police officer aside to get a better shot. And the officer complies, ducking down and sliding to the left so the newsman had a clear camera shot.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','By August, Mr. Malloy was expressing skepticism about his state’s reported unemployment rate of 8.5 percent for July. He remained skeptical when it jumped to 9 percent in August.In Trenton, skepticism turned to disdain when New Jersey’s unemployment rate for August came in at 9.9 percent, its highest level in three decades. State officials could find no way to fit that number into the economic comeback story Mr. Christie had been telling.“These numbers simply do not make sense,” the governor said in a statement last week.The chief economist for New Jersey’s treasury department, Charles Steindel, went further, telling reporters, “That’s nuts.” He said the rising rate conflicted with other economic data, including the payroll survey that showed that the state had added about 50,000 jobs in 2012.In Albany, the consternation about the high unemployment rate has caused delays in reporting the data. Last Thursday, the report that revealed that New York’s unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent in August included a dismissive description of the household survey that the Census Bureau conducts monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That survey, state officials declared, is “not comprehensive,” because it samples the working status of too few residents.The focus of the criticism is the divergent results of two federal surveys conducted each month. The unemployment rates are derived from a survey of households, while the tally of jobs added and eliminated comes from a separate survey of employers.The rash of criticism has left the staff of the federal Labor Department bewildered.On Monday, Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said that she did not understand the complaints because the system for determining the rates “has been used for a long time.” Ms. Solis was in Manhattan to announce a $3 million federal grant to the Borough of Manhattan Community College to train students for jobs in health information technology.Brian Hannon, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, said almost all of the complaints about the methodology came from the Northeast, particularly New York. Mr. Hannon said the bureau’s Office of Survey Methods Research was analyzing the data to determine if changes were needed. But so far, he said, “we think that what we have now is working.”Mark Zandi, the chief executive of Moody’s Analytics, said he agreed that the surveys used to produce the state and national unemployment rates were too small to be reliable. But he said he had not heard state or city officials calling for the federal government to spend enough to improve them.“As an economist, I think it’s kind of silly that we don’t spend more resources trying to get better data,” Mr. Zandi said. “The economic benefits would be enormous if we had good information.”Still, he said, “no matter how you slice the data, it’s hard to change the reality that things are better, but they’re still not good.”'"
"'12-09-27,'1','It isn’t hard to find Republicans in Congress willing to support immigration generally, but rarer to hear them talk about actually allowing more foreigners to come here. When they do, you have to listen for the catch. Take Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, leader of the Republican immigration restrictionists, who recently offered a bill to provide 55,000 permanent-residency visas, or green cards, each year to immigrants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.These so-called STEM graduates are the immigrants everybody likes. Even Mitt Romney, a defender of Arizona-style deportation crackdowns, says he’d happily staple a green card to every advanced STEM diploma.But the Smith bill was a cynical exercise. It supported one visa program by killing off another. It eliminated the diversity visa, which distributes 55,000 green cards by lottery to countries with low immigration rates. And it ruled that any unused STEM green cards could not be redistributed to ease backlogs in other visa categories — a common practice under current law.In effect, Mr. Smith was willing to consider approving a few thousand STEM visas only as long as the net effect on immigration was zero, or less than zero. The bill was brought to a vote last week by a fast-track method and needed a two-thirds majority to pass; thankfully it didn’t.The noxious thinking behind the bill, however, survives. It considers immigration a zero-sum game, and that America should allow in only a subset of educated elites.Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Zoe Lofgren each have bills to increase STEM immigration while preserving the green-card lottery. That’s a fair approach, but better still would be a far broader deal that gives immigrants multiple legal paths into the country, is generous in reuniting families and legalizes millions of valuable workers who are already here. Building the kind of immigration system the American economy needs takes a lot more than cherry-picking workers for technology industries.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','The district attorney’s office showed sound judgment when it told the that it would no longer prosecute people stopped for trespassing, unless the officers could demonstrate that the arrests were warranted.The trespassing arrests are a variant of the broad program that has been challenged by civil rights lawsuits filed over the last several years. Last year, New Yorkers, nearly all of whom were innocent of any crime, were stopped by the police nearly 700,000 times.Documents filed this week in Ligon v. City of New York — a lawsuit brought on behalf of people who say they were illegally stopped, ticketed or arrested for trespassing, some in their own buildings — shows that the Bronx district attorney’s office had serious concerns about such arrests as far back as three years ago. These arrests were made in public housing developments or under the Clean Halls program, which allows police to patrol the hallways of private buildings to prevent crime.As The Times’s Joseph Goldstein reported Wednesday, the Bronx district attorney’s office quietly notified the Police Department in July that it knew of people who had been arrested on charges of trespassing, though they were identified as guests by residents in the buildings. As a result, the office said, it would no longer automatically prosecute people charged with trespassing in public housing or Clean Halls buildings.This was apparently not the first time that the Bronx district attorney had complained about this problem. Lawyers for the Ligon plaintiffs asserted that the prosecutors had told the Police Department in 2009 that some trespassing arrests were not legally justified. By 2011, the prosecutor had become so concerned about the lawfulness of stops made outside of Clean Halls buildings that it “started routinely to decline to prosecute” outdoor arrests, according to court documents.The Police Department says that it found no wrongdoing by police officers after conducting a thorough investigation. The department asserts that the district attorney did not provide specific examples of bad arrests and notes that it retrained officers after receiving complaints.Even so, descriptions of police conduct in this case are disturbingly consistent with those cited by civil rights attorneys in Floyd v. City of New York, a federal class-action suit that challenges the legality of the Police Department’s stop-and-frisk program. In the Ligon and Floyd suits, analyses of police records show that the cops routinely stopped people for vague “furtive movements” and that stops often fail to meet legal standards, which require “reasonable suspicion” that a crime has been committed or is about to take place.'"

"'12-09-27,'1','The University of California has agreed to pay $1 million in a lawsuit filed by demonstrators who were pepper-sprayed during an Occupy protest last fall at the campus in Davis, according to a preliminary settlement filed Wednesday. The episode led to national outrage, campus protests and calls for the resignation of Chancellor Linda Katehi after witnesses’ videos of a police officer spraying the faces of nonviolent protesters spread on the Web. Under the settlement, each of 21 plaintiffs would get $30,000 and their lawyers would split $250,000. Chancellor Katehi would also be required to apologize to each plaintiff.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','A chemist at the center of a scandal at a Massachusetts drug laboratory admitted to investigators that she faked test results for two to three years, forged signatures and bypassed proper procedures, a State Police report says. “I messed up bad; it’s my fault,” said the chemist, Annie Dookhan, according to the report by the attorney general’s office. “I don’t want the lab to get in trouble.” Ms. Dookhan’s actions have thrown thousands of criminal cases into question, and some defendants have been freed or have had their sentences suspended. She resigned in March but has not been charged, and investigators have not said what her motive was. She admitted “dry labbing,” where she tested some samples properly but just looked at others and guessed that they were the same drug as the properly tested ones, the report said.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','These days text messaging, Facebook and Foursquare make it possible to see if a bar is worth the trip (translation: who is there) without leaving the dorm. Meanwhile, location-based mobile apps like Grindr, which point to the nearest available candidates looking for sex or not-quite-sex, are helping dethrone college bars from their place as meat markets.Students have spent so many hours pregaming (as in, getting as cost-efficiently drunk as possible, usually on hard liquor at a private party) that there is little need to waste money even on cut-price drinks, and they often don’t arrive at the bars until midnight or so, before the bars in Ithaca close at 1 a.m.“Students don’t need bars to create a community the way they used to,” said Stephani Robson, a senior lecturer in the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell who specializes in restaurant psychology.And it’s not just at Ivy League Cornell, where the libraries are open later than the bars, but in college towns across America like Iowa City, where at least four bars have closed since 2011.Bars near Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania are so peripheral to Lanie Parr’s social life that she doesn’t know what time they close. That is not because she doesn’t drink. “We sometimes pregame even the pregame,” she said.Pregames often are single sex, with men playing beer pong or video games, and women drinking vodka sodas or a peach-flavored Champagne called André and refusing to head out until they have captured the perfect photo, which they promptly post to Instagram and Facebook.“You could have this really amazing night, but if you didn’t get a picture, it’s like it didn’t happen,” said Ms. Parr, 22, a senior at Gettysburg, whose friends often order designer outfits from the Rent the Runway Web site because incessant documenting makes wearing anything more than twice taboo. “It’s crazy how much pictures consume our lives. Everyone knows how to pose and how to hold your arm and which way is most flattering, and everyone wants the picture taken with their phone.”That preamble tends to delay arrival time at bars, another factor in their decline. At Cornell, three Collegetown bars have closed in the last year, including the 71-year-old Royal Palm Tavern, a storied dive where students convened at “Palms o’clock,” meaning in time for one last drink.“These kids today won’t pay even $2 for a drink,” said the former owner, Lenny Leonardo, as he cruised down a highway in Florida, where he retired in August. “They buy a bottle of Southern Comfort and show up in time to try to get laid. But they just end up throwing up in my men’s room, and I get reprimanded because it looks like I’m the one who let them get this drunk.”In an effort to appeal to increasingly demanding students, bars are cleaning up their sticky-as-caramel floors, installing midcentury modern furniture, and offering more hard liquor. This while struggling to keep prices low. “Students want to get drunker faster and cheaper,” said Jason Sidle, general manager of Rulloff’s Restaurant and Bar in Collegetown. In its last decade, the Royal Palm Tavern sold about twice as much hard liquor as it had in the previous one, Mr. Leonardo said.Mike McLaughlin, 21, a senior at Cornell, said, “I drink liquor because it takes too long to drink beer.” On the drinks menu at Rulloff’s, “Bitch Fuel” (vodka, gin, rum, peach schnapps and lemon-lime soda) is a popular recent addition, but Mr. Sidle has also required all his bartenders to download mixologist apps to their phones. “We get all these requests for weird drinks we’ve never heard of because they’ve seen someone drinking it on Facebook,” he said.After sales slumped in recent years at He’s Not Here, the oldest bar in Chapel Hill, home of the University of North Carolina, Dave Kitzmiller, the bar’s longtime owner, added murals and spruced up the restrooms. “Ours had such a bad rap, the ladies didn’t want to come because of them, and if the ladies don’t want to come you’ve got a problem,” he said, adding that they began serving $12 bottles of Champagne, which women empty into the bar’s famous 32-ounce beer cups.Mr. Kitzmiller, who retired in March after more than 40 years as owner, said he used to order 100 cases apiece of Schlitz and Budweiser and sell them all in a weekend. (At capacity, the bar accommodates 1,000 patrons.)  Now, he said:“No one orders bottles anymore unless it’s the ladies drinking those flavored things like Smirnoff’s. It’s all draught and craft.”Meanwhile, crackdowns on serving under-age patrons coupled with students increasingly fearful of fake identification troubles trailing them to the job market have further cut bars’ clientele. By midafternoon most days, the pleading Facebook messages start popping up on upperclassmen’s phones: “Need a handle!” (Translation: a half-gallon of liquor.)“These freshmen, if they’ve met you once, they’ll ask,” said Ally Momo, 21, a Cornell senior. “They’d never ask you in person, but they’ll find you on Facebook.”Cornell’s freshmen may be especially desperate, she said. The university banned them from fraternity parties after an alcohol-poisoning death in 2011. Now entry to a fraternity party requires an iPod-touch-like scanner for student IDs that flashes up the class year and prevents any card from being used more than once an evening.But no matter where the drinking is done, the morning after is often the same. Tracy O’Hara, 21, a Cornell senior, said: “I can’t imagine what it was like before Facebook when you could just spend the morning after a big night out recovering. Now you have to spend, like, an hour untagging photos. And then you read your texts and you’re like, ‘Oh, so that’s what I did last night.’ ” (It’s job-recruiting season, which means even most students who can drink legally untag every photo, she said.)Her friend Mr. McLaughlin (who estimated he sent 25 texts as well as an e-mail to his fraternity listserv just plotting the start of his evening) could have a lot of reading to do.After drinking two Manhattans, a half-bottle of wine, a glass of Champagne in celebration of a friend’s job offer and almost a half- bottle of vodka, Mr. McLaughlin decided, about 11:15 p.m., to rally his friends to go to Dunbar’s for its “Group Therapy”: $6 for a pitcher of beer and a carafe of kamikaze shots of vodka, Triple Sec and lime.But after he ordered ( though before he paid), a friend received a text about a more appealing deal: Women they wanted to hang out with had staked out a table at Rulloff’s. The group made the five-minute trek uphill, passing Pixel Lounge, an arcade-turned-bar where students often end up to dance and hook up.“If it’s before midnight, it’s too early to go there,” said Peter Brogan, 21, who was in the male pre-fall evening uniform of shorts, a button-down shirt and flip-flops. Downstairs at Rulloff’s, the group became so involved in a drinking game called Fingers that suddenly it was 12:45 a.m., too late to go to Pixel. They texted to find out how long the line was at the hot dog truck a block away (too long), then split roughly along gender lines, the women wanting frozen yogurt and the men, Collegetown Bagels.Mr. McLaughlin downed two bagel sandwiches and flipped back and forth between Facebook updates and texts, looking for hookup contenders. Mr. Brogan (who would like the record to reflect, especially for his parents, that he has a job after graduation) sipped a pint glass of sangria left by a previous patron and shot down prospects. “Don’t do that,” he said to Mr. McLaughlin, referring to one woman. “She likes you.”“Come on, let’s go smoke cigars and play drunken Madden,” Mr. Brogan said, moving his thumbs to mime an Xbox controller. Mr. McLaughlin’s phone lit up and he jumped, but alas, it was only a Facebook status update.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','Russian regulators, Russian doctors and even many patients are increasingly embracing any chance they can get to take part in medical experiments.Patients, as was the case with Ms. Malinina, are eager to join trials because often it is the only way to receive modern medical care.That creates a pool of willing test subjects. The government of President Vladimir V. Putin, eager to diversify Russia’s economy away from oil dependence, welcomes the jobs and high-tech investment associated with clinical trials, and has eased access for drug companies to the Russian patients as an incentive to lure in these benefits.In fact, under a law passed in 2010, ostensibly on health grounds, foreign drug companies must test medicine on Russians for it to be marketed in Russia.The law has the effect of compelling investment in clinical testing on Russians, trade groups say. And it is working. The number of drugs tested on Russians has shot up over the last year. Russian regulators approved 448 clinical trials in the first six months of 2012, compared to 201 in the same period a year earlier — an increase of 123 percent.Russia is not alone in opening the doors of hospitals in the national health system to drug companies looking for test subjects, in a quid pro quo with the international industry that conducts tests globally for a better demographic representation.Testing in Russia is a net benefit to public health, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into diagnostic work and doctor care that would not have been here otherwise. Much of the business swirls around lower-risk testing of generic replacements for brand-name drugs.Singapore, South Korea and China are among countries offering incentives or compelling companies to conduct clinical trials locally, John Lewis, the vice president for the Association of Clinical Research Organizations, a trade group, said in a telephone interview from Washington.Ethically, if a clinical trial will most likely improve a patient’s health — for whatever reason, including because the patient lacks access to standard, already accepted care — a doctor should admit the patient to the trial.“We see a lot of governments encouraging testing for economic benefits, for health care benefits and for innovation benefits,” he said.Drug companies benefit, too, though the association does not endorse that motive. “Clinical trials should be viewed as experiments, as investigations, not as treatment,” Mr. Lewis said.A host of pharmaceutical companies operate in Russia, including Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The companies use the results of trials in Russia, as elsewhere, to help win approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration.Companies have turned to Russia in particular to test experimental psychiatric medicines, sometimes in the same mental health wards once used to confine Soviet dissidents. There is no indication political detainees are used today in drug testing.But there have been strange results. In 2007, an F.D.A. official wrote that the agency approved Eli Lilly’s top-selling antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for use by adolescents based on the results of a Russian test, even though trials in the United States showed the drug had no effect. Why tests differed in Russia and the United States was never explained. Doctors now routinely prescribe the drug for American adolescents.Companies are exploring creative ways to take advantage of Russia’s embrace of clinical testing as a means to attract biotech investment.In March, Domain Associates, an American venture capital firm, agreed to jointly invest with the Russian government about $760 million in 20 biotechnology start-up companies in the United States. The investment was intended to help Russia transfer drug development expertise to its own, nascent biotech industry.As an incentive for the American drug companies it will invest in, the joint venture offered to help these start-ups conduct “advanced stage clinical trials in Russia of new pharmaceuticals,” according to a statement.In another example, VitaPortal, a Russian Web site analogous to WebMD, plans to profit by helping pharmaceutical companies find test subjects among visitors to the Web site who have searched for information about particular ailments.For Russian doctors, the benefits of the globalization of clinical trials are clear from cases like that of Albert V. Chupikov, a 75-year-old cardiac patient enrolled in a trial in Moscow who was referred for an interview by one of his doctors. He said he joined because he could not find treatment elsewhere.“It was really, really hard to find a doctor,” he said. “We couldn’t find one.” So he joined a trial to take an experimental medicine, a choice that worked well for him.He credits the trial for keeping him alive. “I understand I won’t get any healthier. So it’s important not to get worse. And it hasn’t gotten worse. So I’m thankful.”Supporters of the expanding business in Russia note it has room to grow. For every one million people in the United States, drug companies are conducting 46.8 clinical trials, according to the National Institutes of Health, which keeps a running tally. In the European Union the average is 11.5, and in Russia a mere 3.3. About 5 percent of global clinical trials are conducted in Russia, compared with about 50 percent in the United States.“America is saturated with clinical trials,” Svetlana Zavidova, the director of a trade group promoting the business in Russia, said in an interview.The National Center for Preventive Medicine, a research hospital on a leafy back street in Moscow, is testing dozens of new drugs for American and European companies this fall, with a range of promising uses and side effects.The weight loss medicine gets the pounds off, but patients often vomit or lose control of their bowels. A prostate medicine being tested here on young male volunteers can cause dizziness and spontaneous erections. Elderly patients are raving about the energy-elevating effects of one experimental drug, Dr. Svetlana N. Toppygina, a lead doctor on the studies, said.That energy-enhancing substance, from a class of drugs banned as doping in sports, was once tested on soldiers to raise stamina and mood. So far the trial is going well with geriatric cardiac patients, who all seem spry after taking their pills.Folya M. Gonopolsky, an 83-year-old retired engineer who is taking these pills with his wife, Margarita, said, “They told me I would feel better and I do.”At a recent appointment, the two received free electrocardiograms and consultations, then shuffled into a room to take the experimental medicine, laid out on a table in tiny plastic bags beside glasses of water. “Take the pills,” a doctor said. They did.Inevitably, tests sometimes do go awry.Vera G. Belolipetskaya is the supervisor of the ward where patients are observed in early-stage trials. Here, a substance is tested on humans for the first time after animal trials. These studies are also done more cheaply and swiftly in Russia than the West, as volunteers, perhaps tapping Russians’ deep sense of fatalism, are surprisingly forthcoming.Once, an experimental antibiotic set off allergic reactions. Doctors stared in amazement at the students and migrant workers who volunteered to take it.“It was like something from the cartoon ‘Tom and Jerry,’ when a character gets sick,” Dr. Belolipetskaya said. “Red dots started appearing all over, right in front of my eyes. They appeared in just a few minutes. It was really shocking.”On a recent morning, Yevgeny Maksimov, a 32-year-old computer salesman, slouched in a chair and waited for his turn in these trials. On offer: $180 to take the experimental prostate drug.He would be enclosed in a ward under observation for 24 hours, then let go and asked to return two weeks later for a follow-up.“Why not? I take risks every day,” Mr. Maksimov said, noting that he recently flew on a Russian-made airplane.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','Carrots are among the staple foods exempt from the tax increase, so the Bescanó theater is selling them for 13 to 15 euros each, or $17 to $19. Each carrot entitles the bearer to see a play in November.Quim Marcé, director of the Bescanó theater, said: “The theater world was already in very bad shape, but this tax increase will basically kill off small theaters like ours. We’re perhaps pioneers, but I really think that other theaters will have to follow our example and find ways around this unsustainable tax.”Investors have already shown renewed doubts, demanding sharply higher interest rates to hold Spanish government debt. On Wednesday, the interest rate on Spain’s 10-year bonds approached 6 percent for the first time in months, while European shares and the euro fell sharply as investors reacted to social turmoil in Spain and Greece.On Thursday, the Rajoy government plans to present a draft budget for 2013 that is aimed at reducing Spain’s deficit to 4.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, from a target of 6.3 percent this year. But hitting either target depends on higher tax revenue even as unemployment and recession are sending protesters into the streets and prompting a political revolt in some of the country’s largest regions.“Spain is the only country in the world that must contend with a banking, economic, sovereign debt, political and constitutional crisis all occurring simultaneously,” said Nicholas Spiro, founder of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, a London consultancy that helps assess sovereign debt risk.Javier Díaz-Giménez, an economics professor at the IESE business school campus in Madrid, said Mr. Rajoy’s tax drive risked prompting “plenty of imaginative ways to interpret the law.” He warned it could also swell the size of an underground economy already estimated as representing 20 percent of Spain’s overall economy. “Raising taxes is only truly effective,” Professor Díaz-Giménez said, “when it comes together with a proper plan to combat fiscal fraud.”Mr. Rajoy’s center-right Popular Party won a parliamentary majority last November, when voters punished the previous Socialist administration for economic mismanagement. But since Mr. Rajoy took office, Spain has sunk back into recession, unemployment has continued to rise, to 24.6 percent, and four rounds of austerity measures have been announced.The latest package, announced in July, added up to 65 billion euros and included the increase in the value-added tax to 21 percent from 18 percent despite previous pledges by the government not to raise it.The tax increase has especially angered people working in segments of the economy like the performing arts, which previously received preferential tax treatment. Some street protests against the tax have been led by celebrities like the film actor Javier Bardem.The higher tax has also played a part in the heightened tensions between Madrid and regional governments, which have been ordered by Mr. Rajoy to cut their own budget deficits to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. this year. The central government put down a tax revolt in Extremadura this month; despite being controlled by Mr. Rajoy’s party, the regional government tried to exempt culture from the tax increase decreed by Madrid.If anything, the domestic dissent is gaining momentum. On Wednesday, workers in the Basque Country and Navarra regions held a general strike to protest Mr. Rajoy’s austerity cuts. A day earlier, thousands of demonstrators clashed with the police outside Parliament in Madrid.The protests and the standoff with the regions — particularly the separatist push in Catalonia — have left Mr. Rajoy little maneuvering room with the rest of Europe.Euro zone finance ministers are still waiting to learn if and when Mr. Rajoy will request release of any of the 100 billion euros in banking bailout loans they agreed in June to make available. A banking audit that Mr. Rajoy commissioned is due out on Friday, which should help determine how much assistance Spanish banks may require, but Madrid has continued to wrangle with its euro zone partners over the exact conditions for the disbursement of the rescue money.Mr. Rajoy has also been reluctant to take on further European scrutiny of his government’s finances, which could result in more demands for spending cuts if he invokes the new bond-buying program that the European Central Bank announced on Sept. 6. But if Spain’s borrowing costs in the commercial markets continue to rise, he might soon have little choice.As the government readies its 2013 budget draft, Spain’s 17 regions are not only struggling to cut their budget deficits but are also crippled by mountains of debt accumulated during a decade-long boom led by construction.On Tuesday, Andalusia announced that it would tap into an emergency fund set up by the central government to help regions meet their debt repayment obligations. Andalusia’s 4.9 billion euro request means that four of Spain’s 17 regions have already requested three-quarters of the 18 billion euro emergency fund the Rajoy government has set aside.On Wednesday, Fitch, the credit ratings agency, warned that regions now faced an uphill struggle to meet Mr. Rajoy’s deficit target.“The substantial deterioration in tax revenues after the first quarter puts the chances of meeting the full-year target in doubt,” Fitch said. It noted that three regions — Extremadura, Murcia and Navarra — had already exceeded this year’s 1.5 percent target.While the regions are struggling to balance their books, so too is the government in Madrid. The central government’s running deficit reached 4.77 percent of G.D.P. through the end of August, according to figures released Tuesday. That makes it increasingly doubtful Mr. Rajoy can come in under the 6.3 percent full-year target.In Bescanó, the carrot-for-tickets program proceeds apace. Town Hall has allowed the theater to set up a food stall outside the entrance to sell carrots: 13 euros for advance sales, 15 euros for a carrot at the door.Carrots carry only a 4 percent value-added tax, so the theater pockets the 17-point differential, or roughly 2.40 euros per spectator. Mr. Marcé said the tax savings would enable his theater to maintain a full season, rather than cut back to two or three plays.Mayor Xavier Soy of Bescanó is fully behind the ploy. “I see it as a clever way to protest against a tax hike that could really hurt culture,” he said.Meri Yanes, an actress, compared the dark atmosphere of “Suicides,” the play she was rehearsing on Wednesday, to an Edgar Allan Poe short story.“Everybody is pretty depressed at the moment,” Ms. Yanes said, “so we’re trying to take to extremes what is already the general mood.”'"
"'12-09-27,'1','The United States had already lifted its ban on American investment in Myanmar, and just last week it removed Mr. Thein Sein from a blacklist of individuals who faced sanctions. The pressure for further easing of sanctions also came from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar opposition leader and former political prisoner, who said during a visit to Washington last week that she favored moves toward normalization of commercial relations.Political experts said the easing of the restriction on imports from Myanmar was significant for that country, which is mineral-rich but desperately impoverished. Formerly known as Burma, it was once prosperous and self-sufficient.“The timing of this announcement is a big win for Thein Sein,” said Suzanne DiMaggio, the Asia Society’s vice president for global policy programs. “He will return from his first visit to the U.S. as Myanmar’s president with a major boost to his reform agenda. It’s a ‘concrete deliverable’ that will go a long way toward muffling critics and hard-liners at home.”A senior Obama administration official said the lifting of the import ban — which has been in place for more than a decade — would require a waiver that the administration would now shape, working in consultation with Congress. That could take some months, and some prohibitions could remain in place on specific areas of concern, including businesses tied to military industries. Even so it will remove the bulk of sanctions, though the provisions will remain on the books.“What this is intended to do is help a Burmese economy that is more than resource-based in terms of exports,” the official said, expressing hope that lifting American and European sanctions would create jobs and promote industries beyond natural gas, oil and timber.A second administration official, asked about Myanmar’s military ties to North Korea — one of the main concerns for American officials — said that the administration was satisfied with efforts by Myanmar’s leaders to reconsider that relationship. “They understand this is a legacy of a different Burma,” this official said.The easing of the import ban was announced against a backdrop of gradually warming American relations with Myanmar, punctuated not only by Mr. Thein Sein’s first visit but by a 17-day tour of the United States by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate who became a worldwide political heroine during nearly two decades of house arrest. She has met with President Obama, received the Congressional Gold Medal and enjoyed rapturous welcomes from expatriate communities.In a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times earlier Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 67, said she bore no malice toward the generals who oppressed her, and as a recently elected legislator from her party, the National League for Democracy, said she hoped to qualify as a presidential candidate one day.“The leader of every political party must aspire to be head of state; otherwise he or she would be letting the party down,” Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said.The daughter of the country’s independence hero, Gen. Aung San, who was assassinated when she was just 2 years old, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to become Myanmar’s most popular political figure and a beacon of resistance to the military dictators who have run the country for much of her adult life. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.The ruling generals first placed her under house arrest in 1989 and kept her there for most of the next 21 years, isolated from her English-born husband and two sons, finally releasing her in 2010. Her children grew up without her, and her husband died of cancer in 1999. Nonetheless, she said, she did not feel a sense of bitterness or need for retribution.“They didn’t treat me badly,” she said. “If I had been put in prison and tortured, perhaps I would have feelings of vengeance and hatred.”House arrest was not unpleasant, she said, adding, “I was just simply kept in the house.”Asked why she had not been imprisoned, like many of her colleagues, she said, “I think because I’m my father’s daughter.”'"
"'12-09-27,'1','WYNTON MARSALIS I was 22, 23 at that time, and I was serious, but my seriousness was being tested. And he gave me a big boost. Not only him but everything he had created around him. It was moving.Q. What about it?MARSALIS Tonight, I was telling the cats in the band, these are people who have been with Garth for a long time. It’s a community. When I was growing up in Louisiana it was segregated, and a janitor made it possible for us to play basketball and football. With Garth tonight, it had that feeling. A community. He made it possible.FAGAN Yes. We catch his band wherever they’re playing. And they come see us. I’ve done other pieces to Wynton’s music since “Griot,” but he hasn’t done a commission for me since then.Q. How did this one come about?FAGAN I was bored. I wanted to see what would happen now that we’re both older. For “Griot” I gave him a poem. This time all I gave him was the title. I told him I needed something frisky to start, an adagio middle and a killer end. He gave me exactly that, nine pieces of music, and he said, “Do what you want with them.” I rearranged some, used one section twice. I knew from “Griot” that if something didn’t work, he’d change it on the spot.Q. Wynton, did you compose with Garth in mind?MARSALIS He teaches his dancers to listen to the underlying form. So with this piece I tried to make the form more intricate. One piece I made real complicated. I was kind of glad when he told me he didn’t like it, because it’s hard for us to play. But when we got here he said, “I put it in.”FAGAN I was chicken. But then I thought, “Roll up your sleeves and do it.”MARSALIS What’s most striking about Garth is how he provides a counterpoint to what we’re doing. And I know he’s going to embrace the 4/4 swing, whereas most dancers are afraid of it. It’s kind of ironic, because it’s the principal of American dance rhythms, but everybody got away from it. It allows you to lay ideas out longwise. I think Garth understands that rhythm better than anybody.FAGAN I insist that the dancers dance with the music, not to the music. I do that with Brahms, too. That’s my thing.Q. You said that you’re doing “real jazz dance.” What did you mean?FAGAN Not the corny, kick-kick sense. It means giving a sense of improvisation. I’ve choreographed for ballet, but in this I don’t want grand ballet preparations. Take risk, with the rhythm especially. Go to that scary place. The jazz people and the real dance people, about 15 to 20 percent of the audience, they’ll get it.Q. And it’s O.K. for the musicians to improvise?FAGAN Within a certain form. We know the music, so we don’t get lost if we don’t hear a certain note. And jazz musicians get bored doing the same thing every time.Q. What do you do when you receive the music?FAGAN I’ve got to listen to it two million times, till I know it. I choreograph in silence. I give the dancers the movement and see if it holds up. And then I turn on the music and the dancers are so excited to see how it fits.Q. Wynton, what’s it like to see your music choreographed?MARSALIS We look at it one time, to see how Garth has laid it out. But he doesn’t want us looking at it too much, which is intelligent. Because we naturally will play something based on what they’re doing, and it’ll be like the counterpoint of a counterpoint. We’ll mess up the syncopation. If we’re looking at the dancers, we’ll start to play with them.MARSALIS But I have so much confidence in him. For those who have that absolute dedication, you always know the other people who have it. Look at how he is. He’s been working all day and he’s so excited.FAGAN We know each other. Four members of the band did “Griot.” Both of our groups are like families. The age range of our company is 60 to 19. It’s a community onstage, not six little maids in a row. We have the pluses and the minuses of families.'"
"'12-09-27,'1','Mr. Rajoy has been trying for months to convince investors that Spain can handle its own problems and that it will not need a bailout that would force Madrid to cede some authority over its fiscal affairs to its lenders, and is set to introduce new cutbacks to meet budgetary goals. Those will include restrictions on early retirement and various measures to streamline regulations and fight unemployment, he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.The proposed cuts in Greece have ignited new anger, with many talking openly of increased impoverishment as the nation grapples with a third round of austerity measures in three years. The protests in Athens were peaceful in the morning, as civil servants, teachers, medical personnel, bank employees and lawyers made their way to the city center. A police spokeswoman put the turnout at 35,000 to 40,000 people — modest by Greek standards.But violence broke out shortly after 1 p.m., as a group of protesters wearing black masks hurled gasoline bombs at police officers on Vasilissis Sofias, a wide avenue abutting Parliament, sending bursts of flame and black smoke into the air. Firebombs were also thrown at the Finance Ministry and into the lush National Gardens next to Parliament.Officers wielding batons responded with bursts of tear gas, scattering demonstrators and tourists as police helicopters circled overhead and flares exploded. Many cursed the police with cries of “traitors” and “Merkel’s pigs” — a reference to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the country widely blamed for insisting on strong austerity measures in exchange for aid.Mr. Samaras is scheduled to meet on Thursday with his coalition partners — Evangelos Venizelos, the Socialist leader, and Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Left — to seek a common line regarding the $15 billion austerity plan.Representatives of the troika left Athens last week after tussling with the government over the depth of cuts planned for salaries and pensions. The two sides need to reach an agreement before the lenders can issue a report in October grading Greece’s ability to mend its tattered finances. Additional aid depends on a positive assessment, and is critical to lifting confidence that Greece will remain in the euro zone.But for many Greeks who took to the streets, that pact amounts to a bargain with the devil.Anna Afanti, 50, a secondary school teacher, removed a surgical mask she had been wearing to ward off the tear gas to denounce Greece’s foreign creditors. “They just want to impoverish us, to bring our salaries down to the level in India and swoop in and buy everything on the cheap,” she said, referring to planned privatizations of state assets.Ms. Afanti, who traveled about 40 miles to Athens from the town of Halkida with several colleagues to attend Wednesday’s protest, said her salary had been cut by a third since the crisis hit. “I should have left this country a long time ago,” Ms. Afanti said. “Now I’m stuck here.”Smaragda Aivalioti, 21, an economics student at Athens University, had planned to stay in Greece despite the crisis. “But now I just don’t see any hope,” she said. “All the odds are stacked against Greece. Even if we stay in the euro, life will be wretched. What’s the point?”Speaking to state television, Alexis Tsipras, the head of the leftist opposition party Syriza, which opposed Greece’s bailout terms, said the country’s only hope was in Greeks’ rejecting austerity.Numerous government services across the country were shuttered for the day, and main transportation arteries in central Athens were disrupted. Flights to and from the main Athens airport were delayed as air traffic controllers briefly took part in the strike.'"

"'12-09-28,'0','The Libor fiction began in the 1980s, when finance felt a need for a private sector, virtually risk-free interest rate to serve as a benchmark. Banks had learned that there was a big risk to making a long-term fixed-rate loan — the risk that market interest rates would rise and leave them with loans that were paying less than it was costing the bank to pay for the loan. Short-term loans could solve that problem, but at the risk that the borrower might be forced to repay at any time a loan that was taken out for a long-term project.Enter Libor. A loan could be long term, but with a rate that periodically reset based on the cost of funds to banks. If a loan were priced at, say, three percentage points above the three-month Libor, the bank would be getting a reasonable risk premium, and would face no risk from changing market rates, since the interest rate would be reset every three months. The borrower would get long-term money.There were two implicit assumptions in Libor. One was that banks were virtually risk-free, or at least that their risk was small and would not vary much over time. The other was that there was a way to actually calculate what the rate was. Both assumptions turned out to be wrong.Libor rates are calculated each day by the British Bankers’ Association, a trade group that makes good money from licensing the use of Libor rates. Each day panels of banks tell the association the rate they will have to pay for unsecured loans at maturities ranging from overnight to 12 months. They do that for each of 10 currencies, including the United States dollar, the euro, the Swedish krona and the New Zealand dollar.The scandal made clear that those reports were faked before and during the financial crisis by at least some of the banks. But what is not as widely appreciated is that there is substantial evidence that the deception goes on. Banks continue to report figures that strain credulity, both in their level and in their lack of volatility from day to day or week to week. The scandal might never have surfaced, or might have done so in a sanitized fashion, had bank regulators had their way. But the banks had the bad fortune that the investigation of it was spearheaded by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a market regulator that under Gary S. Gensler, the chairman appointed by President Obama, has changed from lap dog to bulldog. It had no institutional need to protect the banks, and it did not.This week Mr. Gensler, testifying before a European Parliament committee, laid out the evidence that the deception continues, although he was nice enough not to put it in such stark terms. He noted the wide swings in the cost of credit-default swaps on debts issued by major banks, while those same banks were reporting that their costs of unsecured borrowing were varying hardly at all.“It is critical that markets be able to rely on something that is credible and honest. The data in the market now strains that credibility,” Mr. Gensler said in an interview before Mr. Wheatley’s conclusions were announced. “History shows that something that is prone to abuse will be abused, and that even people of good faith can have a difficult time estimating when there are no observable transactions.”In his testimony, Mr. Gensler noted that a competing indicator, known as Euribor, consistently came up with higher rates than Libor. In the middle of this week, the three-month United States dollar Libor rate was 0.36 percent. The similar Euribor rate was 0.61 percent.Perhaps that can be explained by the Lake Wobegon effect, after the mythical town invented by Garrison Keillor in which all the children are above average. Libor asks each bank to give the rate at which it could borrow. Euribor, administered by the European Banking Federation, asks banks to give the rate at which they think the average bank could borrow.These days neither number is based on real transactions, since there is virtually no interbank unsecured lending. Perhaps every bank believes it is above average.Mr. Gensler says that a replacement for Libor should be based on observable market transactions, not subject to manipulation.Mr. Wheatley evidently entered into his research having decided that Libor must be saved. Proving that Libor is “beyond repair” would not be enough, he said. There would also have to be “a better alternative” that already existed, and a way to make “an immediate and smooth transition.” It was obvious that the last two criteria could not be met.His solution is to put a new group in charge of Libor and to slim it down by purging small currencies and most maturities. “This will reduce the current number of Libor reference rates — 150 — down to 20 where we are confident there is a real market to underpin the rates,” he said.It will be interesting to see his evidence that such a market exists. He evidently knows there is not much of one. He would still allow banks to submit rates not based on transactions, but would make them disclose that fact. There would be new regulations aimed at forcing banks to be honest.His conclusions seem to be based on the same kind of logic that got us into the mess in the first place. Without a benchmark, floating rate loans are impossible. We need floating rate loans. Therefore, there must be a good benchmark.There is one sort-of real rate that has been discussed as a replacement for Libor: the overnight index swap rate. Don’t worry if that sounds like Greek to you. It is observable, but it is also based on the Fed funds rate set by the Federal Reserve. It is manipulated, in other words, but by the central bank. Using the swap rate would reflect the real world, more or less, but would not reflect the banks’ actual cost of funds. The creditworthiness of banks as a group, and of individual banks, will vary, sometimes drastically. Mr. Wheatley seems to have dismissed that idea out of hand.The underlying problem is that the great desire for risk-free assets, and genuine risk-free interest rates, simply cannot be met in the real world. A major contributor to the financial crisis was that the financial engineers decided that you could take a basket of inherently risky assets — say, home mortgages — and treat it as if it were 70 or 80 percent risk-free. So senior securities backed by that basket would be rated AAA by the rating agencies, and would float based on Libor. Investors craved no-risk assets, and Wall Street obliged.The bank regulators believed the fiction. Banks that owned AAA-rated floating rate assets needed to keep virtually no reserves on hand to back them.We all know what happened. It turned out that risks were far greater than had been realized. Banks failed or were bailed out. Investors in AAA securities suffered major losses.Libor was manipulated by bankers long before the financial crisis, and it is still based on calculations that have little basis in reality. Mr. Wheatley assures us that more regulation can deal with conflicts of interest. There will, he promises, be a “clear code of conduct” and “clear rules,” enforced by a regulator with “extensive powers.”'"

"'12-09-28,'0','Virginia has 13 electoral votes, but pathways to victory for either man, particularly Mr. Romney, get steeper if the state is taken out of their column.With each day that moves him closer to Nov. 6, and perhaps because of recent polling that shows him ahead in Ohio and Florida, the president has appeared more relaxed, almost as if he is starting to enjoy himself. Surrounded by 7,000 screaming supporters — a crowd as diverse as the Tidewater region, with its naval base and countless veterans, has become — Mr. Obama seemed determined to hang on to his small but steady lead in Virginia polls.“How’s it going, Virginia Beach?” Mr. Obama shouted into the microphone. He quickly attached himself to Senator Jim Webb, the retired Marine who had introduced him in a lengthy windup that trumpeted the president’s support for military families. “I could not be prouder of a man who has served his country his entire life, as a Marine, as a secretary of the Navy,” the president said of Mr. Webb, who is not seeking re-election.The crowd ate it up, especially as they were primed beforehand by the cast of colorful characters that make up Virginia Democratic politics. Representative Robert C. Scott, sporting an accent straight out of “Dukes of Hazzard,” seemed a particular favorite. He drew roars when he recounted how in 2008, CNN called Virginia for Obama for the first Democratic presidential win here in 40 years, and then, “two minutes later,” called the election for Mr. Obama. It was a story meant to demonstrate how central winning the state has become to American presidential aspirations.As is now becoming the norm before the president comes on stage, when Al Green’s “Let’s Stay Together” — part of the campaign playlist — came on, the crowd took over, belting it out the way the president did at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. By the time Mr. Webb came out to introduce the president, the din sounded like a Bruce Springsteen concert.The Obama campaign also unleashed a new two-minute television ad in which Mr. Obama pitches an economic plan he says will create one million manufacturing jobs, cut oil imports and increase education jobs. He characterized it as a “new economic patriotism.”Mr. Romney was tying himself to the military as well. He talked about his experience on Wednesday night in Toledo, when his private charter plane was getting ready to take off as an honor flight —  full of veterans who had spent the day in Washington visiting the war memorials —  was returning home. Mr. Romney delayed his own flight in order to greet all of the veterans as they walked down the gangway of their plane, and one elderly, wheelchair-bound World War II veteran, he said, stood out in his mind.“I said hello to him and shook his hand, and then he turned to go through this long alleyway that had been set up with flags and people who were there to recognize each of the veterans,” Mr. Romney recalled. “But he stopped the person who was pushing him, pushing him in the wheelchair, and then he reached inside his coat and took out a flag. And waved it.”Mr. Romney also talked about how, as governor of Massachusetts, he was attending a ceremony to send his state’s servicemen and -women off to Iraq and Afghanistan, when one of the soldiers raised his hand with an interesting proposal.“He said, ‘I have a young lady that I’m in love with, and we haven’t been married and I’m going to go off to conflict — could you marry us?’ ” Mr. Romney said. “And I said, ‘I don’t see why not.’ ”He said he called the two up to the front of the audience and married them right there.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','Later, after taking the job, the complaint says, Mr. Lerner disclosed to a bank employee the name of another of employee who had acted as a confidential whistle-blower and had given the I.R.S. information that had led to the audit.In a conversation with the other individual at the bank, Mr. Lerner is quoted as lamenting that it was sad “that someone you trust would turn their back on you.”Mr. Lerner, 59, was arrested on Thursday at his home in Edgewater, N.J. He was released on bond by a magistrate judge; his lawyer did not respond to a message seeking comment.Even after Mr. Lerner joined the bank, he continued to ask I.R.S. employees for information about the pending settlement that he had helped negotiate, despite being told that such requests were improper, the complaint said.“Lerner’s violations of basic conflict of interest laws were brazen and continued in the face of warnings about his conduct,” Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement.The complaint does not identify the bank, but a “Dennis Lerner” is listed on a Web site as having worked as an international examiner at the I.R.S. in 2010 and 2011, before he joined Commerzbank in September 2011. A Commerzbank spokeswoman declined to comment.The complaint says that Mr. Lerner worked at the I.R.S. from June 2010 until Aug. 31, 2011.In his final months at the I.R.S., prosecutors said, Mr. Lerner was responsible for an audit of the bank, which related to more than $1 billion in unreported income, and for negotiating a settlement.But in early 2011, the complaint says, while involved in the matter, Mr. Lerner was also sending e-mails to a woman with whom he was apparently romantically involved, sounding desperate to find work elsewhere.“This is pure waste of my time,” he wrote in February, asking that she check a jobs-related Web site to see whether any “tax director” positions had been posted. He complained again a month later. “Another wasted day,” he wrote.“My day is empty and without any purpose,” he wrote in May, the complaint says. “No prospects, no job, no pay, nothing.”At one point, he learned of an opening in the tax department of the bank being audited, and in July, he wrote about meeting with the bank’s chief executive, the complaint says.In late summer, a tentative settlement was reached in which the bank would pay about $210 million. That fall, the office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration began an investigation after learning that Mr. Lerner had gone to work at the bank, the complaint says.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','The test-only rule has existed for decades, as have complaints about its effect on minority enrollment. In May 1971, after officials began thinking about adding other criteria for admission, protests from many parents, mostly white, persuaded the State Legislature to enshrine the rule in state law.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Thursday that the schools were “designed for the best and the brightest” and that he saw no need to change the admissions policy or state law.“I think that Stuyvesant and these other schools are as fair as fair can be,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “There’s nothing subjective about this. You pass the test, you get the highest score, you get into the school — no matter what your ethnicity, no matter what your economic background is. That’s been the tradition in these schools since they were founded, and it’s going to continue to be.”A bill introduced in the Assembly last session sought to give the city power over admissions to the schools. But it was not brought to a vote, said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. “We’ll look at the issue and study it,” Mr. Whyland said. “Of course we want to make sure everyone has equal access to all our schools.”A city Education Department spokeswoman, Deidrea Miller, said the department “has launched several initiatives to improve diversity.” Those include a free test-preparation course aimed at poor students.Daren Briscoe, a spokesman for the federal Education Department, said the complaint “has been received and is under review.”The complaint does not claim the test is culturally biased. But it says that its use has led to racial disparities and that there is no conclusive data showing the test predicts a student’s success.Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy group, said that in researching 165 selective high schools around the country, he found that New York City’s specialized schools were the only ones that used a single test as the sole admission criterion. Others use multiple factors including grades, teacher recommendations, essays and interviews.“They are more like college admissions procedures, or private colleges, that try to look at a kid holistically,” said Mr. Finn, who, with Jessica Hockett, was a co-author of the recent book “Exam Schools: Inside America’s Most Selective Public High Schools.”But he said New York’s law was less worrisome to him considering the “dozens and dozens” of other academically high-powered schools in the city that do not use the test. “The larger challenge for the city is to prepare its minority children so that they will do well on the various screening requirements for the city’s large number of good high schools, including the ones that require this test.”Most students interviewed Thursday at the Bronx High School of Science, one of the oldest specialized schools, said Thursday that they did not believe the test was discriminatory. When asked the uncomfortable question of why the racial imbalance existed, some students mentioned the intensive tutoring services that are out of reach of poorer families. But others did not hesitate to say that they believed the family culture of Asian and white students put a higher value on educational achievement than others.“African-American and Hispanic parents don’t always seek out extra help for their kids and their kids don’t score as high,” said Manjit Singh, a senior. “But it’s the same test for everyone, so how can it be discriminatory? If you can’t handle the test, you can’t handle the school, and you’re taking up someone else’s spot.”Noah Morrison, a senior who is black, was not ready to change the policy, either, but he agreed that “there needs to be more racial diversity at this school.”“There are no black people and it’s horrible,” he said. “The test is fine, but there need to be more opportunities for people to do well on it. There need to be more test-prep programs in underachieving middle schools with high black and Latino populations. It’s a socioeconomic problem.”'"
"'12-09-28,'0','BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) — Nike reported on Thursday that its fiscal first-quarter net income fell 12 percent as stronger sales of its clothing and footwear brands were offset by increased costs and advertising spending.The company’s results, reported after the markets closed, exceeded Wall Street’s expectations, but its shares fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading as investors appeared worried about a slowing of future orders.Nike, like other consumer product makers, is facing high costs for materials and labor, as well as an uncertain economy in Europe and a slowdown in China.

"'12-09-28,'0','The Libor fiction began in the 1980s, when finance felt a need for a private sector, virtually risk-free interest rate to serve as a benchmark. Banks had learned that there was a big risk to making a long-term fixed-rate loan — the risk that market interest rates would rise and leave them with loans that were paying less than it was costing the bank to pay for the loan. Short-term loans could solve that problem, but at the risk that the borrower might be forced to repay at any time a loan that was taken out for a long-term project.Enter Libor. A loan could be long term, but with a rate that periodically reset based on the cost of funds to banks. If a loan were priced at, say, three percentage points above the three-month Libor, the bank would be getting a reasonable risk premium, and would face no risk from changing market rates, since the interest rate would be reset every three months. The borrower would get long-term money.There were two implicit assumptions in Libor. One was that banks were virtually risk-free, or at least that their risk was small and would not vary much over time. The other was that there was a way to actually calculate what the rate was. Both assumptions turned out to be wrong.Libor rates are calculated each day by the British Bankers’ Association, a trade group that makes good money from licensing the use of Libor rates. Each day panels of banks tell the association the rate they will have to pay for unsecured loans at maturities ranging from overnight to 12 months. They do that for each of 10 currencies, including the United States dollar, the euro, the Swedish krona and the New Zealand dollar.The scandal made clear that those reports were faked before and during the financial crisis by at least some of the banks. But what is not as widely appreciated is that there is substantial evidence that the deception goes on. Banks continue to report figures that strain credulity, both in their level and in their lack of volatility from day to day or week to week. The scandal might never have surfaced, or might have done so in a sanitized fashion, had bank regulators had their way. But the banks had the bad fortune that the investigation of it was spearheaded by the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a market regulator that under Gary S. Gensler, the chairman appointed by President Obama, has changed from lap dog to bulldog. It had no institutional need to protect the banks, and it did not.This week Mr. Gensler, testifying before a European Parliament committee, laid out the evidence that the deception continues, although he was nice enough not to put it in such stark terms. He noted the wide swings in the cost of credit-default swaps on debts issued by major banks, while those same banks were reporting that their costs of unsecured borrowing were varying hardly at all.“It is critical that markets be able to rely on something that is credible and honest. The data in the market now strains that credibility,” Mr. Gensler said in an interview before Mr. Wheatley’s conclusions were announced. “History shows that something that is prone to abuse will be abused, and that even people of good faith can have a difficult time estimating when there are no observable transactions.”In his testimony, Mr. Gensler noted that a competing indicator, known as Euribor, consistently came up with higher rates than Libor. In the middle of this week, the three-month United States dollar Libor rate was 0.36 percent. The similar Euribor rate was 0.61 percent.Perhaps that can be explained by the Lake Wobegon effect, after the mythical town invented by Garrison Keillor in which all the children are above average. Libor asks each bank to give the rate at which it could borrow. Euribor, administered by the European Banking Federation, asks banks to give the rate at which they think the average bank could borrow.These days neither number is based on real transactions, since there is virtually no interbank unsecured lending. Perhaps every bank believes it is above average.Mr. Gensler says that a replacement for Libor should be based on observable market transactions, not subject to manipulation.Mr. Wheatley evidently entered into his research having decided that Libor must be saved. Proving that Libor is “beyond repair” would not be enough, he said. There would also have to be “a better alternative” that already existed, and a way to make “an immediate and smooth transition.” It was obvious that the last two criteria could not be met.His solution is to put a new group in charge of Libor and to slim it down by purging small currencies and most maturities. “This will reduce the current number of Libor reference rates — 150 — down to 20 where we are confident there is a real market to underpin the rates,” he said.It will be interesting to see his evidence that such a market exists. He evidently knows there is not much of one. He would still allow banks to submit rates not based on transactions, but would make them disclose that fact. There would be new regulations aimed at forcing banks to be honest.His conclusions seem to be based on the same kind of logic that got us into the mess in the first place. Without a benchmark, floating rate loans are impossible. We need floating rate loans. Therefore, there must be a good benchmark.There is one sort-of real rate that has been discussed as a replacement for Libor: the overnight index swap rate. Don’t worry if that sounds like Greek to you. It is observable, but it is also based on the Fed funds rate set by the Federal Reserve. It is manipulated, in other words, but by the central bank. Using the swap rate would reflect the real world, more or less, but would not reflect the banks’ actual cost of funds. The creditworthiness of banks as a group, and of individual banks, will vary, sometimes drastically. Mr. Wheatley seems to have dismissed that idea out of hand.The underlying problem is that the great desire for risk-free assets, and genuine risk-free interest rates, simply cannot be met in the real world. A major contributor to the financial crisis was that the financial engineers decided that you could take a basket of inherently risky assets — say, home mortgages — and treat it as if it were 70 or 80 percent risk-free. So senior securities backed by that basket would be rated AAA by the rating agencies, and would float based on Libor. Investors craved no-risk assets, and Wall Street obliged.The bank regulators believed the fiction. Banks that owned AAA-rated floating rate assets needed to keep virtually no reserves on hand to back them.We all know what happened. It turned out that risks were far greater than had been realized. Banks failed or were bailed out. Investors in AAA securities suffered major losses.Libor was manipulated by bankers long before the financial crisis, and it is still based on calculations that have little basis in reality. Mr. Wheatley assures us that more regulation can deal with conflicts of interest. There will, he promises, be a “clear code of conduct” and “clear rules,” enforced by a regulator with “extensive powers.”'"
"'12-09-28,'0','The program’s broader goal of bringing nature and sustainable practices to prisons is echoed across the nation as states seek ways to run prisons more cost-effectively.Utilitarian practicality led Wisconsin in 2008 to begin having inmates grow much of their own food. And federal energy rules are pushing the goal of zero-net energy use in federal prisons by 2030.Indiana and Massachusetts have become aggressive in reducing energy and water consumption and waste in their prisons, and tough renewable energy mandates in California are pushing alternative generation and conservation at prisons there, said Paul Sheldon, a senior adviser at Natural Capitalism Solutions, a Colorado-based nonprofit that works with government agencies and companies on sustainability issues.Mr. Pacholke can rattle off statistics. The amount of waste generated per offender in Washington State has fallen from 2.9 pounds a day in 2004 to 1.5 last year through inmate-operated recycling and composting.Because of practices like collecting rainwater, use of potable water has dropped by 100 million gallons a year even as inmate populations have increased.But Washington State’s overlay of science — offenders in four state prisons work on projects involving the spotted frogs (Rana pretiosa), wild prairie grasses and butterflies — is also addressing a budget gap in habitat restoration and ecology.The prisoners, who trained with a state biologist but also learned from one another, must compete to enter the program and maintain a record of perfect behavior to stay in it. They are paid 42 cents an hour, standard prison wages, for 10-hour workdays that involve sometimes tedious tasks like monitoring the frogs’ water temperature or harvesting the hundreds of crickets grown for frog food — something that even an oppressed graduate student might avoid at real wages.But there may be some intangible benefits for inmates who are being exposed to the scientific process, many of them for the first time, said Carri LeRoy, a professor of ecology at Evergreen State College in Olympia, and co-director of the Sustainability in Prisons project.Science, she said, is about procedural order, point A to point B, with every step measured and marked for others to check and follow. And when the focus of that work is a creature that undergoes a profound metamorphosis from egg to tadpole to adult, the lesson is also one about the possibilities of change. In a prison, Professor LeRoy said, that is a big deal.“This image of transformation, I think, allows them maybe to understand their own transformation,” Professor LeRoy said.This week at Cedar Creek the day finally arrived, anticipated by inmates and scientists alike, for the frogs to leave their tanks and go off into the wild, six months after hatching.Their new home is Muck Creek, about 90 minutes away in an area of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord military compound near Olympia. Scientists and volunteers in waders and rolled-up jeans carried the boxes to the water’s edge. Tree frogs, one of five or so frog species on the base, chirruped from the sidelines.“Get out of here, you’re free!” said Andrea Martin, a graduate student at Evergreen State College who has been working with the inmates at Cedar Creek. She held up one of the frogs in a swampside goodbye, then carefully opened her hand.The frog leapt and was gone.Yet it was a moment that Mr. Henson and Mr. Taylor could not witness. Military rules barred the inmates from participating in an event on Department of Defense property.Both men said they understood. Rules define prison life, they said.The frog shed is only a few yards from the chain-link and razor-wire prison enclosure. As the frogs were netted, counted, placed in plastic bins and carried out to an S.U.V. for transport, Mr. Henson said he would picture his slimy charges finally swimming free.“It’s a good feeling to know they’re going to be released,” he said as one furtive frog, hiding motionless in a dark corner of the tub, was fished out. “When you go to a zoo, you see the animals; they’re not really happy.”With the frogs gone, it was time to start preparing for next year. Over the winter, Mr. Davis and Mr. Henson will rebuild the frog shed’s roof so that by March, when the next eggs arrive, a sun-and-shade system will be in place that better mimics the world the frogs are bound for.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','Only as Mr. Silver began working on the show did it emerge that all the paintings were created in the artist’s native city. “In many of the Piero exhibitions in Italy, art historians have focused on his work in Florence and Urbino,” said Mr. Silver, an Andrew W. Mellon Fellow. “And while he made his reputation traveling all over Italy, it has often been overlooked how important the work was that he produced in his hometown.”SELLING WHILE THE ARTIST IS HOTWhen the big November auction catalogs begin arriving in the mail next month, they will include the usual array of art being sold by museums. What’s curious about several consignments this season is that, intentionally or serendipitously, these institutions have chosen to sell works that dovetail with current tastes and fashions.Top examples of work by Yves Klein have brought consistently high prices at auction. Christie’s has had a particularly successful track record with that artist. At its May auctions in New York, “FC1 (Fire Color 1),” a 1962 painting created with a blowtorch, water and two models, sold for $36.4 million, a record broken the next month in London, where Christie’s auctioned Klein’s “Rose du Bleu (RE 22),” an organic landscape of pink sponges and pebbles, for $36.7 million.In New York on Nov. 14 the Brooklyn Museum plans to sell “Accord Bleu (Sponge Relief),” one of Klein’s classic painted sponges on board, at Christie’s. Created in 1958, it has not been on the market since 1960. It is estimated to sell for $7 million to $10 million.The relief was a 1992 bequest to the museum from William K. Jacobs Jr., a trustee. “It has almost never been exhibited,” said Kevin Stayton, the museum’s chief curator. “We are not known for our postwar European art and have no work to contextualize it with.”Brett Gorvy, who runs Christie’s postwar and contemporary-art department worldwide, said Klein’s early sponges — in which the porous surface is absorbed in the artist’s signature ultramarine blue — are “becoming rarer and rarer.”Rare as the work may be, Mr. Stayton said he believed it made sense to sell it and use the proceeds to create a fund to buy 21st-century works. The museum has no specific wish list, he said.The Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington is another institution selling art in November. It is parting with “Mousquetaire au Chapeau. Buste.,” one in a series of paintings Picasso made of musketeers late in his career. This canvas, from 1967, is expected to sell for $3 million to $5 million when it is offered at Sotheby’s on Nov. 5. The musketeer paintings have been especially popular ever since an exhibition organized by John Richardson, the Picasso biographer, ran at the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea three years ago.The Hirshhorn one was left to the museum by the estate of its founder, Joseph H. Hirshhorn, in 1981. Richard Koshalek, the museum’s director, said Hirshhorn was a believer in de-accessioning.“The sale was not at all market-driven,” Mr. Koshalek said in a telephone interview. The Hirshhorn has 211 works by Picasso, including several good paintings, 25 sculptures and 176 prints. This painting has rarely been on view and does not fit in well with the institution’s holdings, he explained.“It is important that we have funds available to make strategic purchases,” Mr. Koshalek added. He said he hoped to build the museum’s Minimalist, Conceptual and film and video holdings.Two years ago Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, corralled colleagues at other institutions to collaborate on a series of events that addressed the importance of culture and its future in urban centers. The initiative was called the Festival of Ideas for the New City and was a weekend-long event in May 2011. There were panels, round tables, symposiums and workshops. The New Museum and Cooper Union were the festival’s anchors, and organizations like the Drawing Center, the Architectural League of New York and the Bowery Poetry Club were also involved.“The response was overwhelming,” Ms. Phillips said, “So we’ve decided to make it a biennial event.”The next iteration, to run May 1 through 4, has been rebranded as Ideas City. It will consider the future of cities, with the theme “Untapped Capital.” Ms. Phillips explained its focus as “pinpointing resources, people, ideas and networks that may be underrecognized or underutilized.” For Ideas City, the New Museum will team up with Storefront for Art and Architecture, the Architectural League of New York, the Bowery Poetry Club, New York University Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and the Drawing Center.A full schedule of exhibitions and performances, talks and tours will be posted in January on the New Museum’s Web site. Ms. Phillips is also taking the idea global. During the years the festival is not taking place in New York, she plans to hold three-day conferences in other cities. The first will be in Istanbul next month. Future stops, Ms. Phillips said, would be São Paulo and New Delhi.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','There was no concealing how far RIM’s fortunes had declined. Its net loss for the second fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 1, was $235 million — better than the $518 million loss in the previous quarter, but a steep fall from the net income of $329 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Shipments of BlackBerrys last quarter were 7.4 million, compared with 10.6 million a year earlier.The company said revenue in the most recent quarter was $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion in the first quarter though down 31 percent from $4.2 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected a far steeper year-on-year drop in revenue of 41 percent and some feared that the company had dipped into its cash holdings. But RIM actually increased its cash thanks to sharp cost-cutting.As a result, RIM’s stock jumped more than 20 percent in after-hours trading. In the regular session, before its announcement, it closed at $7.14 a share. RIM’s shares have been as high as $24.74 over the last year.Several analysts said they were now focused on next year. The new smartphones will be based on a new and more sophisticated operating system and are promised for the first calendar quarter of next year.“I don’t think anything good can come out until they release BB 10, aside from selling the company or something else in the strategic review,” said Peter Misek, an analyst with Jefferies & Company.But Shaw Wu, an analyst at Sterne Agee, said the dominance of Apple and Android had closed the window of opportunity for RIM’s BlackBerry 10 strategy and turned the company’s last great hope into its biggest problem.“It’s about survival now, it’s not about BlackBerry 10,” said Mr. Wu, who is based in San Francisco. “That’s almost secondary. The battle now is staying alive and looking after your current customers. It’s not really clear that their core customers are looking for BlackBerry 10.”Unless BlackBerry 10 is an exceptional hit, which is far from certain, Mr. Wu said that RIM might be able to continue for only one or two more years. Some analysts had expected that the company would report that subscriber growth had stalled. At a developers’ conference earlier this week, Mr. Heins  said that the number of BlackBerry users had instead grown to 80 million, up from 78 million.Unlike other smartphone makers, RIM continues to directly profit from every active BlackBerry handset long after its sale. RIM receives monthly subscription fees from carriers for every BlackBerry in exchange for routing the phone’s data through its own, closed network. Under normal conditions, the network allows RIM to provide high security for corporate and government users and it reduces the amount of wireless data consumed by all BlackBerrys.But it became apparent in the conference call that growth was driven by sales in markets like South Africa and Indonesia where prices and service revenue are low.“They’re pushing the subscriber base up by offsetting the loss of very high-value customers in markets where it’s critical to build momentum now,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research. “It’s a matter of the market getting away from them.”'"
"'12-09-28,'0','Since then, negotiations have gone around and around, with increasing pressure by the United States, the African Union and the United Nations to come to an agreement. Since Sunday, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, and Salva Kiir, South Sudan’s leader, had been holed up together in negotiating rooms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, trying to hammer out a compromise. For years, the two men fought each other on the battlefield, and it seems that the history of bitterness has been extremely difficult to overcome.On Thursday, Mr. Bashir and Mr. Kiir emerged to announce that they would demilitarize the border — a step that had been agreed to in principle last year but was almost instantly violated when Sudan began a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in the Nuba Mountains, near the border. The two sides also committed to resuming cross-border trade and allowing citizens from each side to move freely.And they agreed to resume oil production — again, an issue that had been previously covered, with a deal reached in August, but had not yet taken effect because of mutual mistrust. “This basically kicks the can down the road,” said EJ Hogendoorn, the Horn of Africa director for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization.“Oil production will give both governments some breathing room, since their economies were collapsing, but unless there is a resolution to Abyei” and other conflict-ridden parts of Sudan, he said in an e-mail, “enormous frictions remain.”One person close to the talks tried to put a positive gloss on them, saying the negotiating session was a “crunch summit” and the border deal was “serious progress.”“Of course, there will be a tremendous amount of overselling whatever agreement is signed,” Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and a prolific blogger on the Sudans, wrote in an e-mail. “This is a survivalist regime in Khartoum,” the capital of Sudan, “and the agreement signed is precisely what one would expect from survivalists. This fundamental feature won’t change.”'"
"'12-09-28,'0','Some of the poor performance in the second quarter has been attributed to a public holiday in June to celebrate the diamond jubilee of Queen Elizabeth. Such an event would normally shift economic activity into the third quarter, producing a bounce.In its report, the statistics office did not give a reason for the revisions, and some economists worried that if the latest figures suggested that the holiday did not have as significant an economic effect, the rebound would not be as big as predicted, either.“The U.K. is continuing to deal with real challenges at home and abroad, and the government’s relentless focus is on addressing them and supporting growth in the economy,” said an official for the Treasury who spoke on the condition of anonymity, in line with official policy.“There are signs the economy is healing: the deficit is down by a quarter, inflation has halved and employment is rising, with more than a million private sector jobs created in the last two years,” the official added.Many economists agree that Britain, which faces steep cuts in public spending to reduce its budget deficit, is emerging from its double-dip recession, albeit extremely slowly. The Olympic Games, held in July and August, were likely to have helped stimulate growth.George Buckley, chief economist for Britain at Deutsche Bank in London, said he would be surprised if the economy did not return to growth in the third quarter.“However, what these figures are saying is that the recovery is not as strong as normal recoveries after recessions,” he added.Mr. Buckley said that some of the other data in the report was encouraging and indicated that an economic rebalancing was under way. For example, he said, the statistics office said that real incomes showed some slight improvement, the ratio of household debt to income was the lowest since 2004, and the ratio of savings to disposable income was the highest since the end of 2010.This month, the Bank of England kept interest rates at 0.5 percent and did not increase its asset-buying program after policy makers concluded that there were sufficient indicators of recovery to wait before undertaking any new efforts to stimulate economic growth.But some analysts expect an expansion in November of the asset-buying program, known as quantitative easing, which was intended to increase the money supply to encourage spending and borrowing.David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, which represents local businesses, said in a news release that while the revision Thursday was welcome, the new figures were still “too gloomy.”“It is clear that the U.K. economy has been stagnant for too long and bold measures are needed if we are to return to growth,” he saidThe Bank of England’s modeling suggests that, over all, growth will be close to zero this year and that output is not likely to rise above its precrisis level until 2014.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','Stocks on Wall Street rose broadly Thursday, with the Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes up about 1 percent as investors were encouraged by Spain’s plans for economic reform to deal with its debt crisis.Shares rose despite weak American data that reflected the nation’s sluggish economic growth.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed with a gain of 1 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.4 percent.Data showed second-quarter gross domestic product growth of 1.3 percent, against the earlier estimate of 1.7 percent. At the same time, August durable goods tumbled 13.2 percent, much more than the 5 percent drop expected.“None of these numbers are really trending upward,” said Tim Speiss, head of personal wealth advisers at EisnerAmper in New York. “A lot of investors are starting to wonder how much markets are overvalued.”Still, jobless claims dropped by 23,000 to 359,000, significantly more than the 4,000 drop that had been expected.'"
"'12-09-28,'0','In a statement, the W.T.O. said that the European request was expected to be formally submitted at a meeting of the organization’s dispute settlement body on Oct. 23.The W.T.O. has also concluded that Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense & Space, received $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates, as well as several billion dollars in grants to build the A380 superjumbo and five other best-selling models.The trade panel did not quantify the savings from the lower interest rates, but said that without the loans, Airbus could not have introduced many of its models when it did.In April, Washington rejected the European Union’s list of remedies to eliminate the subsidies to Airbus that the W.T.O. had deemed illegal. The U.S. government said it would seek the trade body’s approval to impose $7 billion to $10 billion in retaliatory measures. A W.T.O panel was expected to rule on that request around the end of this year.On Sunday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Washington had eliminated certain payments that Boeing had been receiving from the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A number of tax breaks and beneficial funding programs to Boeing had also been removed, the trade representative said. The European Commission said Tuesday, however, that these steps did not fully offset the adverse trade effects to Airbus.Charlie Miller, a Boeing spokesman, said he was not surprised by the Union’s move but declined to offer further comment.Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. trade office, said Washington remained ‘‘confident’’ that the remedies announced Sunday had brought the United States into ‘‘ full compliance’’ with its W.T.O. obligations.In a document filed with the W.T.O., the European Commission did not specify what form its sanctions would take. It said a list would be drafted ‘‘in due course’’ and did not say what type of goods and services might be targeted.In a statement, Airbus said it was grateful to the European Commission for ‘‘taking consequential action’’ on its behalf but stressed that it was still prepared to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute.‘‘We regret that Boeing continues a legal battle that should have long been resolved by a mutual agreement,’’ said Maggie Bergsma, an Airbus spokeswoman. ‘‘We made offers time and again, but are ready to fight it through if the other side wishes to do so.’’Trade experts said they hoped the two sides would eventually return to the negotiating table.‘‘Given the size of damage claims on both sides, my guess is that the case will become the lead item for U.S.-E.U. trade negotiations in 2013,’’ Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said by e-mail.Some observers noted that the Union’s move came just two weeks after Airbus’s parent company, EADS, announced that it was in talks about a possible $49 billion merger with BAE Systems of Britain. The combined company would eclipse Boeing as the world’s largest defense and aerospace group.But while the timing was perhaps politically awkward, few analysts expected the latest trade flare-up to influence U.S. regulators charged with reviewing the combination of EADS and BAE.‘‘I’d rather hope that all of these decisions are in the hands of independent authorities,’’ said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ‘‘Right now, I don’t think it matters. Both sides are going to continue doing exactly what they want to support their industries in economic times like these.’’'"

"'12-09-29,'0','While fighting to keep Greece’s place in Europe, Mr. Samaras is waging an uphill battle to contain the damage at home. Unemployment is at 24 percent and rising, and above 50 percent for young people, a situation he called his “No. 1 problem.” The country’s gross domestic product has dropped 25 percent since 2009, and an estimated 400,000 small businesses are at risk of closing in the coming months.This is why Mr. Samaras is pressing for more time — until 2016 instead of 2014 — to carry out a new $15 billion package of deeply unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to the public sector and pensions and new tax brackets, as well as $2.6 billion in new taxes. Greece needs to take these steps in order to unlock $40 billion in financial aid next month from its international lenders. Without that liquidity, Mr. Samaras warned, the country could face collapse.Mr. Samaras said that Thursday had been one of his happiest days since taking office, as his government reached a basic agreement on the austerity measures. But the so-called troika of lenders — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — must still decide whether to sign off on the package when talks resume in Athens next week.Recent history is not promising. Negotiators for the troika left Greece in a huff last week, questioning whether the country could actually make good on its promises after it repeatedly failed to meet financial targets.More wrangling is also expected within Mr. Samaras’s unruly coalition, which in a rare case for modern Greek history has brought together his center-right New Democracy party, the once mighty Socialists and a smaller party, the Democratic Left. Whether the prime minister succeeds will determine whether his government can last through the winter — let alone serve its four-year mandate, as he hopes. Mr. Samaras is determined to see it through. “This is a four-year government,” he said.His message to Greeks was clear: Keep the faith; better days lie ahead. “What I am telling you is, ‘There is hope,’ ” he said. “That is all I can offer.”But his message to Europe was equally clear: Without its help, his promises may ring empty. “We are changing, but at the same time you have to help us, you have to help the situation,” he said. The alternative, he added, could be “the end of Greece.”Mr. Samaras insisted that this round of austerity would be the last. While few Greeks seem to believe him — and many are upset at a corruption scandal now embroiling his New Democracy party — he contended that the measures could be manageable if Greece’s creditors allowed them to be put into effect gradually over a four-year period rather than all at once. The lenders have already given an indication that they are ready to accede to his request.In the meantime, Mr. Samaras is working to lure investment back to the country, and he outlined a pro-European agenda that he said had already gone a long way toward burnishing Greece’s credibility and image. It includes initiatives to free up markets, root out corruption and replace the heavy hand of oligarchs, cartels and favoritism with a system of meritocracy.In a volatile country, Mr. Samaras comes across as rather low octane. A tall and trim 61, he was born into the country’s ruling class and has spent his adult life in politics. Educated at Amherst College, where a former prime minister, George A. Papandreou, was in the same dormitory, he speaks quietly and slowly, smiling only occasionally. Dressed in a gray suit and blue tie, on the day of the interview he said he was fighting a fever.Asked if he had faced the types of hardships that have fallen on many Greeks, he said: “Every one of us in one way or another has faced very difficult hardships. I’m in politics; I stayed in my house for 11 years because of politics.” He was referring to the years in the 1990s when he left the New Democracy party over a policy dispute. “Thanks to my family I did not have problems of that sort,” he added, referring to financial woes. But he said he had empathy for the Greek people. “I feel their pain every second.”New Democracy came to power in part by tapping into populist sentiments, tacking right on immigration in elections that resulted in the entry of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, known for its attacks on immigrants, into Parliament for the first time. Opinion polls now place Golden Dawn third, after New Democracy and the leftist Syriza party.In the interview, Mr. Samaras said “waves of illegal immigrants” were sweeping Greece, a “major problem” that would worsen if Syria imploded and more refugees entered Turkey and then Greece. “Illegal immigrants have taken over Athens,” he said, causing a “public health problem” and a rise in crime.But even as he echoed some of its words, the prime minister said he thought that Golden Dawn was a “bubble that would burst” and that its members were not “ideological followers,” but had joined out of a sense of “anti-system” desperation in worsening economic times.He said he did not believe in outlawing the extremist group, which has voted with New Democracy in significant parliamentary votes. “I believe democracy is so strong you don’t need to take extreme measures,” Mr. Samaras said.Still, the coming months are sure to test Greek democracy. As he contemplated the challenges ahead, Mr. Samaras gestured to a large allegorical painting hanging above his desk, depicting freedom leading the Greek people. “When you come in in the morning and you look at this,” he said, casting his eyes upward, “you gain strength.”'"
"'12-09-29,'0','A federal judge on Friday dismissed a libel lawsuit against former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the online magazine Slate for a column Mr. Spitzer wrote in 2010 about an insurance bid-rigging scandal.The suit had been brought last year by a former executive at the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan, who was the target of a prosecution by Mr. Spitzer when he was the state attorney general. The former executive, William Gilman, accused Mr. Spitzer of defamation and sought at least $60 million.The judge, J. Paul Oetken of Federal District Court in Manhattan, did not provide his reasoning for dismissing the case, but wrote in a one-page order that an opinion would be forthcoming.Marsh agreed in 2005 to pay $850 million to settle a lawsuit by Mr. Spitzer that accused the company of rigging prices and steering business to insurers in exchange for kickbacks. Mr. Gilman was among a group of Marsh executives who were later indicted; he was found guilty of a felony antitrust charge in 2008, but his conviction was reversed in July 2010 after new evidence emerged.Mr. Spitzer wrote his column later that summer, responding to an editorial in The Wall Street Journal that criticized some of his prosecutions as attorney general, including his case against Marsh. Mr. Spitzer did not explicitly mention Mr. Gilman in the column, which carried the headline “They Still Don’t Get It,” but referred generally to “criminal conduct” at the firm.In an interview on Friday, Mr. Spitzer, who now hosts a show on Current TV, said people on Wall Street who shouldered responsibility for triggering the financial crisis were trying to allow the passage of time “to blind us to what was being done that was illegal and improper.”“What the executives at Marsh & McLennan did was heinous, violative of the law, and the company settled for $850 million for a reason,” Mr. Spitzer said. “The importance of the lawsuit is merely that hard as they tried to rewrite history, they can’t be permitted to get away with it.”'"
"'12-09-29,'0','The outcry shows how map services, which Apple treated as an afterthought when it built the first iPhone, have become critical tools for millions of people. And the company’s stumble fits in with its pattern of bungling services that rely heavily on the Internet.Apple has a reputation for obsessive attention to detail in its hardware and software products, down to the beveled edges of the iPhone 5 and the shade of the icons on its screen. But it has stubbed its toe again and again when it comes to releasing reliable, well-designed Internet services. Its less proud moments include Ping, a social network for music that never took off; MobileMe, an error-plagued service for synchronizing data between devices; and, more recently, Siri, the voice-activated virtual assistant that is often hard of hearing.The company’s weakness in this area could become a bigger problem over time as smartphones become more intimately tied to information and software on the Internet — a field where Google, which makes the competing Android phone software, has the home-turf advantage.“I always felt if you had to name an Achilles’ heel at Apple, it’s Internet services,” said Andrew Borovsky, a former Apple product designer who worked on MobileMe and now runs his own design firm in New York. “It’s clearly an issue.”Some have sought to pin the blame for the maps debacle on a relaxing of standards under Mr. Cook, who was elevated from the No. 2 position at Apple just over a year ago. He took over shortly before the death of Steven P. Jobs, a notorious perfectionist known to shelve products that did not pass muster.But numerous interviews with former Apple employees in the wake of the maps controversy made it clear that Mr. Jobs and other executives rarely paid as much attention to Internet services as they did to the devices for which Apple is best known. Nor did they show the kind of consistent foresight in this area that has served the company so well in designing hardware and software.Including a maps app on the first iPhone was not even part of the company’s original plan as the phone’s unveiling approached in January 2007. Just weeks before the event, Mr. Jobs ordered a mapping app to show off the capabilities of the touch-screen device.Two engineers put together a maps app for the presentation in three weeks, said a former Apple engineer who worked on iPhone software, and who declined to be named because he did not want to speak publicly about his previous employer. The company hastily cut a deal with Google to use its map data.At the time, relying on Google, which had introduced its map service a couple of years earlier, made sense. Apple and Google had generally friendly relations, and Google’s chief executive at the time, Eric E. Schmidt, served on Apple’s board.But the relationship chilled in 2008 after Google began building more and more iPhone-like features into Android. That year, Mr. Jobs drove to Google’s headquarters and got into a screaming match with Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and the head of its Android development team, Andy Rubin, as he tried to discourage them from copying the iPhone, according to an account of the meeting in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Mr. Jobs.As the iPhone began to catch on with the public, Apple executives were surprised by the popularity of the map function, according to a former Apple executive who did not want to be named so as not to damage his relations with the company. It began to bother executives how much data about the behavior of iPhone users was flowing back to Google, which could see the coordinates of every iPhone user who downloaded a map, the former executive said.That same year, Apple suffered an embarrassing black eye when it introduced MobileMe, a service that was intended to give iPhone users a convenient way to wirelessly synchronize e-mail, contacts and calendar appointments with computer applications. The summer introduction was so seriously marred by technology problems that Mr. Jobs fired the head of the MobileMe team and replaced him with Eddy Cue, a trusted executive who oversaw the company’s iTunes Store.Former Apple executives said the MobileMe fiasco was a symptom of a lack of appreciation among Apple executives, including Mr. Jobs, of the differences between running an online store like iTunes, where people download music, apps and books, and an online service that is used constantly and must be reliable, like e-mail and maps. Apple’s secrecy around new products also makes it hard to adequately stress-test such services. While MobileMe operated well in private tests by Apple employees, it melted down once it became available to the public, these executives said.“The MobileMe launch clearly demonstrates that we have more to learn about Internet services,” Mr. Jobs wrote in an e-mail to Apple employees at the time. “And learn we will.”With that experience behind him and tensions with Google increasing, Mr. Jobs set out to build Apple’s own map service in 2009, with the acquisition of a start-up called Placebase. Later, Apple bought two other start-ups focused on 3-D mapping technologies.Apple executives have said they felt the company needed to get out of the Google relationship in part because under the terms of their deal, Google would not let Apple offer important map features like turn-by-turn spoken directions. A Google spokesman, Nate Tyler, declined to comment.While Google knew that Apple eventually wanted to build its own maps, there had been no indication that it would do so this year, since there was about a year left on the contract between the two companies, according to people briefed on the negotiations who did not want to be named discussing internal matters.So Google was blindsided when Apple announced in June that it would replace Google’s maps with its own in a new version of its iOS mobile operating system, and was left scrambling to figure out how to respond, these people said.Google is now developing its own maps app for iOS and plans to release it before the end of the year.According to a former Apple executive who has been in touch with his old colleagues, Apple was caught off guard by the map problems. “They’re embarrassed by it,” he said. Many of the problems are a result of merging map data, some of it flawed, from many sources.At the same time, the complaints do not seem to have damaged the response to the iPhone 5, which was released just over a week ago with the new operating system on it. Apple said it sold more than five million of the phones by the end of the first weekend of sales. People with older iPhones and iPads have installed the iOS 6 software with the new maps service on more than 100 million devices, Apple said.The company has had better luck with other online efforts. The iTunes store remains the biggest seller of music in the country, and the iCloud service that replaced MobileMe has been relatively trouble-free.But other Internet efforts have been disappointments, including Ping, a social network for iTunes users that Apple is shutting down after customers largely ignored it. Siri, a feature first introduced with the iPhone 4S last year, has been criticized for its unreliability and frequent downtime.Leslie Grandy, a former Apple manager who ran its online store, said it had been challenging for Apple to rapidly develop new and better versions of its services to compete with Internet-focused rivals.“I think there’s a bigger question of whether hardware companies can be services companies,” she said.'"
"'12-09-29,'0','MOSCOW — Russia’s Parliament voted Friday to bar a prominent opposition lawmaker, Ilya V. Ponomarev, from speaking on the floor for one month after he called members of the majority party “swindlers and thieves.”The use of the pejorative phrase to describe the pro-Kremlin United Russia party was popularized by an anticorruption advocate, Aleksei Navalny, who coined it on a radio broadcast last February, saying: “United Russia is the party of corruption. It is the party of swindlers and thieves.”But while the phrase has been repeated at rallies against President Vladimir V. Putin, and can be seen on bumper stickers and the Internet, uttering it in Parliament is a particularly bold jab, and it prompted a complaint by fellow lawmakers against Mr. Ponomarev in the ethics committee.On Friday, Parliament voted 297 to 132 to censure him and bar him from speaking for one month, beginning on Oct. 16. The ban could silence Mr. Ponomarev during what is likely to be a contentious debate over the federal budget.Mr. Ponomarev, a member of the Just Russia party, has been one of the leaders of the big antigovernment street protests that began after disputed parliamentary elections last December. He also led a rare filibuster in Parliament this summer. On Friday, he said that abuses of power had stained the reputation of Parliament and of United Russia, of whose members “a great number of the people of our country call swindlers and thieves.”'"
"'12-09-29,'0','The Cambodian government has asked the United States to help it recover a 10th-century Khmer sandstone statue from the Norton Simon Museum in California. It says the work was looted from a Cambodian temple complex during the country’s political upheavals in the 1970s.The request was revealed by prosecutors in federal district court in Manhattan on Thursday, during hearings involving a matching statue that the United States government has sought to impound from Sotheby’s. The sculptures, each five feet tall and 600 pounds, depict mythical warriors. The one at the Norton Simon, in Pasadena, Calif., has been on display since 1980, and although Cambodian authorities have long known it was there, they had not sought its return until now.In the case involving the Sotheby’s statue, on Thursday, Judge George B. Daniels cast doubt on whether the government could prevail in its effort to seize the work, based on the filings it has made.“This isn’t the strongest case of knowledge of stolen property and ownership by clear and unambiguous language,” Judge Daniels said. He said the government had “significant hurdles to overcome,” and that he would rule in 30 to 60 days on a motion by Sotheby’s lawyers to dismiss the case.On Friday a Cambodian government spokesman confirmed the request for repatriating the statue at the Norton Simon. “We have asked the United States government to help bring both statues back home,” said the spokesman, Phay Siphan, by phone from Phnom Penh. (The Cambodian government has also requested the return of two life-size statues from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)'"
"'12-09-29,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans increased their spending in August even though their incomes barely grew. Much of the spending increase went to pay higher gas prices, which may have forced consumers to cut back elsewhere.The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in August from July. It was the biggest jump since February.Gas prices rose nearly 50 cents a gallon in July and August, but have since leveled off. Excluding the impact of higher gas prices and other price gains, spending ticked up only 0.1 percent last month.Income grew only 0.1 percent, too. But after accounting for inflation and deducting taxes, income actually fell 0.3 percent — the poorest performance since November.The increase in prices and slower growth in pay forced people to save less.“The U.S. personal income and spending data for August are worse than the headline figures suggest and indicate that subdued jobs growth is hitting incomes,” said Paul Dales, senior United States economist with Capital Economics. The increase “was largely due to extra spending caused by the surge in gasoline prices.”“American household spending and income remain weak, indicating continued subpar growth,” said Sal Gautieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.The combination of weak income growth and a big jump in spending meant that households saved less. The saving rate dropped to 3.7 percent of after-tax income in August, down from 4.1 percent in July.'"

The chemist, Annie Dookhan, 34, was charged with obstruction of justice and pretending to hold a college degree. The scandal prompted the shutdown of the Hinton State Laboratory Institute in Boston and resulted in the resignation of three officials, including the state’s public health commissioner. State police officials say Ms. Dookhan tested more than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants in nine years at the lab.'"
"'12-09-29,'0','League and union negotiators in the N.H.L. lockout, meeting for their first formal bargaining session since Sept. 12, reported modest progress on side issues Friday.But on the core economic issues, the sides remained far apart.“We can’t make them talk about what they don’t want to talk about,” Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner, said of the players’ union after talks concluded at the league offices in Midtown Manhattan.The core economic issues at the center of the dispute were not discussed, according to officials on both sides, but talks were scheduled to continue through the weekend.Mathieu Schneider, a former player who is a special assistant at the N.H.L. Players’ Association, said that player safety was the focus of talks that took place in the morning.Among the topics discussed were extending drug tests, now performed only during the regular season, to the playoffs and off season; imposing restrictions on the length of practices at training camps; and setting standards for morning practices after late-night travel.“We’ve had good discussions on this all along, and this was a good topic to take up as soon as we got back to the table,” Schneider said.'"

"'12-09-29,'0','Like other professionals in security, law enforcement and firearms safety, Mr. Castelveter was baffled by how anyone could forget that they were carrying a gun. “I’m a Vietnam vet, and when I went through training I was taught that my gun was my best friend — and God forbid you should ever lose sight of that fact. I would never, ever not know that I have a gun in my bag.”Yet that was the exactly the excuse offered by a 27-year-old flight attendant who was stopped at a checkpoint at the Philadelphia airport on Sunday. The flight attendant, arriving for work on a US Airways flight, had a valid handgun permit — but of course, not a permit to carry it on an airplane. As it routinely does in such cases, the T.S.A. notified local law enforcement. A Philadelphia police officer who responded tried to unload the 38-caliber handgun weapon but instead accidentally fired it. No one was hurt, and the flight attendant was issued a summary citation for disorderly conduct.It could have seemed like a Keystone Kops episode. Instead, it occurred as air travel has become increasingly tense. The potential for trouble posed by prohibited guns on crowded airplanes is obvious, even beyond any overt issues of terrorism or premeditated crime.Except in rare instances where T.S.A. officials believe the Federal Bureau of Investigation needs to be notified, local law enforcement officials usually handle reports of guns at airport checkpoints.“All we’re permitted to do is confiscate the weapon and call law enforcement agents, who then will take custody of it and determine whether or not you’re arrested,” said Mr. Castelveter, who is part of the security agency’s effort to notify local news media to aggressively publicize reports of guns and other prohibited weapons being found at checkpoints.The growing number of guns being found at airports dovetails with the growth in firearms sales nationally. Last year, requests for background checks for firearms sales submitted under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System of the F.B.I. totaled 16.4 million, up from 14.4 million in 2010 and 8.9 million in 2001, according to F.B.I. data.But firearms safety experts also suspect that some people new to firearms possession may not have basic weapons education, which used to be a stronger focus of gun advocacy groups like the National Rifle Association.Guns at airport checkpoints reflect “the pervasiveness of concealed-carry weapons, which have gone up enormously in the last 10 years because concealed permits have got easier to get,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a Washington research group that promotes what it refers to as centrist views on “divisive social issues,” among them constitutional gun rights.“When people become accustomed to carrying their firearms everywhere they go, even in places like churches and schools in certain states, they can just simply forget they have them,” Mr. Bennett said. “Because concealed-carry permits are now so easy to get, it becomes second nature in kind of a bad way — instead of being thought of as a really significant act — carrying any firearm around.”Finding the T.S.A. screener digging a gun out of your carry-on bag at the airport “does get to the heart of the matter, in that it shows a lack of focused training” in gun handling, said Ron Danielowski, a former Marine marksman and security consultant in the Middle East, and a founder of Pulse O2DA Firearms Training, an Illinois company that provides intensive weapons and self-defense instruction.Mr. Danielowski echoed the advice on the T.S.A.’s blog that people can travel with a firearm in a checked bag, provided the airline is notified in advance and the weapon is contained in a hard-locked case. But he and other firearms advocates note that conflicting state and local laws can still cause problems, even for those who comply with the federal regulations, if they arrive with a gun in a location that has different rules.“That’s a huge mess,” he said of conflicting federal, state and local gun laws that sometimes catch a person otherwise legally transporting a gun. “We’re trying to address that on a local, democratic level. But the first thing right now is, if we’re going to travel with a firearm and plan to go through other states and jurisdictions, we need to make sure that we’re compliant. That’s on us.”The T.S.A. intends to continue to focus attention on guns at checkpoints, even though Mr. Castelveter said that airports themselves often object because of the effect of the topic on the flying experience.Once a gun is found, assuming there is no indication of a federal crime, local laws apply. In some locations, “if you come to the checkpoint with a weapon and law enforcement gets involved, they’ll just tell you take it back to your car, because you’re in a state where you’re allowed to carry one” in most places. “But do that in a place like New York and you could be in Rikers Island in about 30 seconds,” Mr. Castelveter said.“The interesting thing to me is all of these items, from handguns to brass knuckles, a passenger could take from Point A to Point B if it was properly checked” rather than carried through the airport, said Nico Melendez, a T.S.A. official in Los Angeles who posts regularly on the agency’s blog.“Gun owners should all know where their weapons are, for our own safety and for the safety of those we live with and those around us,” Mr. Melendez said. “I always know where mine is. It’s really kind of basic. Weapons are dangerous.”'"
"'12-09-29,'0','Few auto executives are ready to concede that young people will not want actual cars.“‘They like iPhones and iPods more than they like cars’ — you hear that,” said Ralf D. Speth, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, which is undergoing a renaissance due to investment from its new owner, Tata Motors of India. But, he said in an interview here, “everyone still needs to get from A to B.”There is a consensus, though, that younger buyers will want to get from A to B in a different kind of car. It must be more stylish. Performance is still important, but it must come wrapped in technology that appears more environmentally responsible.“They like technology. They like innovation. They like design,” said Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Ferrari, who noted that many of the company’s U.S. customers were young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.The shift in the market reflects not only competition from smartphones and other technology, but also the growth in the number of people around the globe who are living in urban areas. Cars are often unnecessary or even burdensome in places where there is good mass transit or networks of bicycle lanes of the kind that cities like New York and Paris have expanded in recent years.If a younger urban buyer wants any vehicle, it may be a fashionable small car like a BMW Mini or Daimler Smart that is easier to park, or even a radical new vehicle like the battery-powered Renault Twizy, which is beginning to appear on Paris streets. Half scooter, the narrow Twizy has four wheels, but the passenger seat is behind the driver.Younger buyers, raised in a social-networking environment, may also be more open to car sharing as an alternative to car ownership. Rental car companies and car-sharing services like the municipal Autolib’ in Paris or the commercial Zipcar in the United States may become even more important as fleet buyers.The digitally distracted consumer, meantime, may be happy to embrace cars that can drive themselves, freeing the driver to concentrate on Facebook, Twitter or whatever social media may be prevalent when self-driving technologies mature in a decade or so. (Google has already built working prototypes.)More immediately, manufacturers are trying to find ways to balance the craving for constant connectivity with the need for drivers to keep their eyes on the road. Voice recognition technology is already available in cars by Volvo and others as a way to operate some of the onboard electronics, and will become more sophisticated. BMW and others have heads-up displays that project information on the windshield in the driver’s line of sight. These technologies are likely to become less expensive and more common.While executives express confidence they will find products to appeal to the “millennials,” as they are known in marketing speak, the car companies also betray a level of anxiety. At a press event Wednesday night in a Left Bank hall usually used for fashion shows, Volkswagen seemed almost obsessively at pains to show how its model line was tailored to the young.There was nary a driver above 30 in the short promotional films that VW showed between presentations by executives of its new models. There was a heavy emphasis on how the company was working to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. “Sustainability is the key issue of our time,” the narrator intoned.Environmental impact, in fact, has become a main factor for buyers under 30, though many executives are skeptical about whether young drivers are any less interested in performance than their elders. They car companies contend that younger people still want to drive fast — but not feel guilty about it.“If you’re not that good at fuel economy, that can turn off a younger buyer,” said Chris Ellis, head of Jeep sales in Europe. The maker of off-road vehicles is trying to expand its sales on the Continent as part of the alliance between Chrysler, its parent company, and Fiat.Mr. Ellis added, “It still has to drive in a way that is acceptable to the customer.”Carmakers have begun shrinking the size of engines, subtracting cylinders while adding turbochargers to maintain horsepower and acceleration. Smaller engines have become a selling point even in the United States, which would have been unthinkable a few years ago.In Paris, Ford was touting its three-cylinder, one-liter EcoBoost engine. Ford uses a turbocharger to get more power out of a cylinder displacement that would have been regarded as laughably inadequate a few years ago.Cars equipped with the new engine accounted for almost a third of sales of the compact Focus in Europe in August, and Ford plans to offer the EcoBoost in the next generation of the midsize Mondeo, known as the Fusion in the United States. (It has not set a date for the introduction or said whether the three-cylinder version will be sold in the United States.)Daimler and the Renault-Nissan alliance said Friday that they are expanding their existing cooperation with each other to jointly develop a new, four-cylinder turbocharged engine family. The cooperation between the companies is an example of how carmakers are trying to reduce the cost of developing new fuel-saving technologies at a time when the European car market is abysmal.Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, and Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, said at a press conference in Paris that their cooperation on various component and vehicle projects had saved them billions, though they did not provide exact figures. Such cooperation is especially critical for Renault, which serves the midrange, South European markets hit hardest by the euro zone crisis.“We are gearing up for many tough years in Europe,” Mr. Ghosn said. He predicted that the decline in car sales that began in 2008 would continue. “We have to be frugal,” he said. “The sale of products in Europe is going to go down.”Even the high-end carmakers are boasting about their sustainability, partly with youngish buyers in mind. Land Rover has reduced the weight of its Range Rover SUV by about 700 pounds, or 320 kilograms, in the version that will be sold in the United States starting in December. Like the company’s new Jaguar F Series sports car, which will go on the market next year, the Range Rover body and chassis are made almost completely of aluminum to save weight and fuel.Younger buyers also seem more open to the trend toward smaller autos with more premium features — provided the cars look cool. Martin Smith, design director for Ford in Europe, said the company designed the Fiesta to appeal to a fashion-conscious, late-20s city dweller. It became the best-selling car in the world in its subcompact category, he said.Still, Mr. Smith indicated that carmakers had not abandoned hope that, like their parents, the younger generation would graduate to roomier Fords as they aged. As a rule bigger cars are more profitable for carmakers.“Hopefully,” Mr. Smith said, “the overall experience will drive them into other cars as they get family.”'"
"'12-09-29,'0','The latest findings “should remove all the doubts about the strength of the system,” Mr. Jiménez Latorre said. “The bulk of it is solid, and the problems are well identified.”The European Central Bank and the European Commission both issued statements Friday applauding the audit and expressing support for Spain. “This is a major step in implementing the financial assistance program and toward strengthening the viability of and confidence in the Spanish banking sector,” the commission, the administrative arm of the European Union, said in its statement.In Washington, Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also issued a statement, which said in part, “I strongly support the authorities’ commitment to ensure that capital needs are met in a timely manner and that the weakest banks are dealt with effectively.”Still unresolved, though, is an issue over which Spain has been wrangling with its European partners since June, involving the exact terms of the banking rescue. The Spanish government has argued, so far without success, that emergency loans should be channeled straight to the banks rather than through the government, which would add to Spain’s debt load. Spain’s credit rating has gradually been lowered by the main rating agencies, with Moody’s expected to deliver another blow to Madrid as early as this weekend.The poor credit rating is one reason that the Spanish government’s borrowing costs have been higher than those of many other euro zone countries, which could pose an even bigger challenge for the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. Mr. Rajoy and his finance officials have been pondering whether to ask for help through a bond-buying program recently announced by the central bank, which in many ways was designed with Spain in mind.The problem for Mr. Rajoy is the stigma of seeking assistance from the central bank program — along with the requirements for tougher fiscal discipline that might accompany the aid. He is already facing an increasingly restive public, and threats of secession by the economically powerful Catalan region, over the austerity budget measures his government has imposed.And yet, the audit showed at least a potential exit path for Spain from its bank problems.The independent report, which Oliver Wyman based on its own work and on audits from four other firms, indicated that the banks could need as much as 53.745 billion euros to be cleaned up, assuming that mergers and restructuring plans currently under way were completed. The figure would climb to 59.3 billion euros if those plans failed, the report said.The audit confirmed the central role played by Bankia in Spain’s banking crisis, which peaked in early May with the government takeover. Bankia’s new board then asked for 19 billion euros to replenish its capital reserves, on top of the 4.5 billion euros it had already received from a government bailout.According to the report, Bankia could need a slightly higher amount, as much as 24.7 billion euros, to meet required capital levels if Spain’s economy remained in recession.Three other nationalized banks face a combined capital shortfall of 21.5 billion euros. Among the threatened institutions is Banco Popular, a big commercial bank that faces a shortfall of 3.2 billion euros, according to Oliver Wyman.The findings were in line with a forecast the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, made in an interview last month, as well as with a preliminary assessment by Oliver Wyman, which estimated in June that Spanish banks needed 51 billion to 62 billion euros of extra capital.'"

Only the utilities index was positive, up just 0.4 percent. European stocks dropped sharply Friday, with the Euro Stoxx 50 of euro zone blue chips declining 2.1 percent. Madrid’s IBEX 35 was down 1.7 percent, as the early lift from Spain’s new round of spending cuts, which had also bolstered Asian markets overnight, collapsed.“On this last day of the quarter, the focus remains on the situation in Europe, which is causing nervousness,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.The euro fell against the dollar, closing out a second straight week of declines, as uncertainty persisted about Spain’s bailout prospects.An independent audit from the consulting firm Oliver Wyman released on Friday showed that Spain’s banking industry would need 59.3 billion euros, or $76.5 billion, in additional capital to cope with a serious economic downturn. Spain, however, said it would ask for only $51.6 billion in European aid for its banks.The audit report was viewed as positive because the final figure on the country’s banking capital needs was largely in line with market expectations, removing another layer of uncertainty.The euro did trim losses versus the dollar after the news on the bank audit report, but the general stance on the common currency remained cautious.Recent protests against austerity plans in Greece and Spain have also heightened investors’ concerns as the turmoil could impede political maneuvering. However, stocks were off their lows of the day after Spanish bank stress tests were mostly within expectations.""We had been seeing good data recently, but now we seem to be following the slowdown in China and Europe and we’re seeing weakness,"" said Paul Nolte, managing director at Dearborn Partners in Chicago.Interest rates were lower.

"'12-09-29,'0','BERLIN — Germany’s leading opposition party on Friday nominated a quick-witted former finance minister to challenge Chancellor Angela Merkel in next year’s general election, in a jolt to a race that had appeared heavily weighted in favor of the incumbent.The former minister, Peer Steinbrück, 65, vowed in remarks after the announcement of his nomination to put the center-left Social Democrats in a “strategic position” to build a government with the Green Party, a clear rejection of the so-called grand coalition with Ms. Merkel’s center-right Christian Democrats that ruled from 2005 to 2009.“I accept this challenge to win the next election with and for the S.P.D.,” Mr. Steinbrück said, using the German abbreviation for the Social Democratic Party. “We want to replace this government.”The Social Democrats’ executive committee will convene on Monday to make Mr. Steinbrück’s nomination formal. Sigmar Gabriel, the party’s chairman, who had also been considered a possible candidate, said the leadership agreed two weeks ago to nominate Mr. Steinbrück after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the party’s parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.Many Germans remember Mr. Steinbrück, 65, now a member of Parliament, as an effective finance minister and a man of action from the early days of the debt crisis in the euro zone during his tenure as finance minister under Ms. Merkel from 2005 to 2009. Earlier this week, he presented a plan to rein in the financial sector that included a call for banks to create a $258 billion rescue fund.'"

"'12-09-30,'0','Georgia is upside down. Its defense was supposed to carry the Bulldogs, but it has been the offense, with an overhauled line and two freshman running backs, that has been more steady.Todd Gurley, a 6-foot-1, 218-pound freshman who ran for 130 yards, and Keith Marshall, a 5-foot-11, 216-pound freshman who ran for 164 yards, combined for more than half of Georgia’s 560 yards on offense. Marshall had touchdown runs of 75 and 72 yards.The SEC is a line-of-scrimmage league in which success is built from tackle to tackle. Georgia was supposed to be weakest up front on its offensive line, but that line with three new starters seems better than expected, and the Bulldogs led the SEC in scoring before Saturday (47.5 points a game).“We’re trying to be as good as we can individually, but when it comes to a game, it’s always five guys working together and communicating and being cohesive,” said Chris Burnette, the Bulldogs’ right guard. “A lot of people were saying we were this, we were that, but we didn’t pay any attention to it, really.”Gurley scored three touchdowns in the first 18 minutes as Georgia jumped to a 27-10 lead.The Bulldogs then started leaving the ball on the ground or getting it tipped into the air for an interception, and three turnovers later, the Vols were ahead, 30-27.“We were hit by a freight train early in the game, but we were able to fight back and get into it,” Tennessee Coach Derek Dooley said.Tennessee’s line, led by the senior left guard Dallas Thomas, did not allow a sack as Bray threw for 281 yards. Running back Rajion Neal gained 104 yards. The Vols have allowed two sacks this season, but they had no remedy for the Georgia linebacker Alec Ogletree, who had 14 tackles in his first game of the season after a four-game suspension. Safety Bacarri Rambo, who also sat out four games because of a disciplinary suspension, was in on nine tackles.Dooley nearly had the win that could have doused the fire building under him. The son of the former Georgia coach Vince Dooley, Dooley is 14-16 at Tennessee and 4-14 in the SEC, and his job is considered in jeopardy.A loss would have started a smaller fire under Georgia’s Mark Richt. The Bulldogs play at No. 6 South Carolina next Saturday night, and they were expected to roll right through the Vols and into the SEC Eastern Division showdown with Steve Spurrier and the Gamecocks.“It’s nice to have a gut check and come out on top,” Richt said. “I’m going to focus on the positives because we got the win.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','“We will be looking for the sort of broad-based growth in jobs and economic activity that generally signal sustained improvement in labor market conditions and declining unemployment,” Mr. Bernanke said.Last week, however, the markets gave up ground. The central banks aside, it’s easy to see why the bullish mood might darken quickly. A partial list of dangers includes rising tensions in the Mideast, a contentious election campaign and a looming “fiscal cliff” in the United States, an unresolved and multifaceted financial crisis in Europe, and a global economy that is far from robust.Little of this would appear to augur well for stocks, except that the central banks have tilted the odds on the bullish side, at least for now, some analysts say.“A modestly growing economy with the cyclically sensitive sectors at still-depressed levels is a relatively stable and safe, if not exciting, environment,” said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays, in a recent report. “When this is combined with a central bank committed to aggressively supporting growth through higher asset prices, it amounts to a very attractive environment for taking risk.”In fact, Barclays calls the current version of its flagship quarterly research publication “Global Outlook: Don’t Fight the Fed.”OF course, no one knows where the markets are going day to day. After their recent run upward, and even without the emergence of any nasty news, stocks could easily “consolidate,” that is, decline for a while before moving upward again. And because the global economy is already rather weak, an external shock — a disruptive geopolitical event — could alter perceptions abruptly.Some analysts are not upbeat even now. The Economic Cycle Research Institute, an independent forecasting organization with an excellent record, says it believes that the United States is already in recession, and that action by the Fed won’t change that. “Unfortunately, the economy is just going to have to ride out the business cycle,” Lakshman Achuthan, chief operations officer of the institute, said recently. “The Fed’s actions have been increasingly ineffective.” The relationship between the economy and the stock market is complex, he said, and it’s not always clear whether the market is predicting the direction of the economy, reacting to it or responding to other factors.Robert Rodriguez, managing partner and chief executive of FPA, an asset management firm in Los Angeles, says it’s possible that fund managers, seeking to bolster their returns, will “continue to pile into stocks in the remainder of this year and push them to even higher levels.” But he says he believes that the market is already overextended, and his firm has begun to reduce its stock exposure.Mr. Rodriguez anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis and the financial crisis. But, as he acknowledged ruefully in an interview, he “was early, and got out of the market too soon, and could well be doing so again.” Still, he says he fears what he calls “the unintended consequences of the expansionary activities of the central banks.”Another credit bubble is likely if the banks persist in trying to prop up the global economy, he said. As he sees it, the fundamental problem in the United States can’t be solved by the Fed. “We must get our fiscal house in order,” he said, “and we have only a limited amount of time to do it.”For the next several months, though, he suspects that Wall Street’s fascination with the Fed may well keep stocks rising.'"
"'12-09-30,'0','“This project is such an interesting microcosm of the challenges that the transportation industry in total is facing, in moving from heavy steel to lightweight aluminum,” said Randall Scheps, automotive marketing director of Alcoa, and chairman of the aluminum transportation group at the Aluminum Association. Mr. Scheps said the student team looked at various methods of joining, or bonding, metals. It also looked at forming, or bending, metals, and at recycling. “These are all issues that the auto industry is facing,” he said.Companies and foundations have been looking to young innovators for environmentally sustainable and cost-effective solutions to real-world problems. In the case of the shipping pallets, the project was funded with a grant from the Alcoa Foundation, which wants future engineers to think about use of lightweight materials. (Although the use of aluminum clearly benefits Alcoa, an aluminum company, it did not have to be used in the project.)It’s an issue that has taken on urgency in Detroit in anticipation of Obama administration fuel-economy regulations that will require American vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Ford, for instance, that producer of macho, all-terrain trucks, is working on an aluminum version of its popular F-150 pickup.Dr. Glenn Daehn, a professor of materials science and engineering at Ohio State and the students’ research adviser, says the aluminum shipping pallets are an example of “using simple projects to inject ideas into how we might make lighter-weight door systems or seats” — research that Ohio State is working on with companies like Honda and General Motors.Mr. Hopkins said welding is an issue in dealing with aluminum. “There’s just a certain property of aluminum that if you heat it up too much, or for too long, it loses a lot of its strength,” he said.To get around that, the students relied on “conformal interference joining technology,” a method of joining metals through a process involving electromagnetism, as opposed to heat.Then there was the question of how to make the pallets cost-effective. Aluminum pallets on the market can cost more than $200 each, in part because they are welded by hand. Aluminum pallets are used to ship materials that must be kept sterile, or that will be stored for long periods.But the students’ models are all estimated to cost less than $75 each. That was achieved by making the designs simple enough so they could be mass-produced.“They weren’t some crazy designs that would take 20 hours to produce, where you’d have to do it one at a time,” Mr. Hopkins said. “Our designs can be automated. They only have two, separate pieces in a couple of them.” That makes it possible to “knock them out in a short amount of time,” he said.WHILE the project could eventually affect how cars are manufactured, it may not change the world’s shipping pallets. According to Edgar Deomano, technical director of the National Wooden Pallet and Container Association, wood pallets, which account for 90 percent of the domestic market, are not going away, mainly because of cost.“A recycled, or repaired, wood pallet could go for as low as $3 each,” Mr. Deomano said.As for the argument that wooden shipping pallets are responsible for deforestation, he said: “That’s a false impression. Our industry is able to recycle pallets again and again. You don’t have to cut down more trees, you just have to repair existing pallets.”Dr. Daehn says he remains hopeful, however, that a company will “step forward and commercialize” the new aluminum shipping pallets.“We need more than a student project to do that, but I think we’ve shown them the promise is there.”In the meantime, the project has already served Mr. Hopkins well. After graduating from Ohio State in June, he was hired as a metallurgist at Valbruna Slater Stainless in Fort Wayne, Ind.“It was definitely one of my résumé highlights,” he said.'"
"'12-09-30,'0','MOSCOW — In a rare video message, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, the jailed former prime minister of Ukraine, lashed out against President Viktor F. Yanukovich, who is widely viewed as responsible for her imprisonment, and urged voters to defeat Mr. Yanukovich’s party in parliamentary elections next month.In the video, Ms. Tymoshenko declares Ukraine to be a “criminal country” under Mr. Yanukovich and accuses him of “mafia” rule.The video was recorded in a hospital where Ms. Tymoshenko has received treatment for chronic back pain, and was posted on her own party’s Web site. At several points, someone, presumably a prison official, tries to put a hand in front of the camera to block the recording.Ms. Tymoshenko has been in prison for nearly a year, since she was sentenced to a seven-year term on charges of abuse of office related to a natural gas deal with Russia in 2009. She has denied the charges, which are widely viewed as politically motivated. Her lawyers have been fighting for her release, both in Ukraine and at the European Court of Human Rights.Mr. Yanukovich, whose party, the Party of Regions, holds a majority in Parliament, has insisted that he has no authority to pardon her.In the video, Ms. Tymoshenko urges voters to chart a new course for the country. “I want to appeal now to all people,” she said. “If you do not realize that criminals rule Ukraine, that the mafia rules Ukraine, nothing can protect you from what is happening in the country led by Yanukovich.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','“What it proves to me is I am so much better when I keep my mouth shut and disappear,” Hochuli said in a telephone interview. “It’s amazing. I’ve never been so popular because I’ve been gone the last three months. I’m trying not to let it hurt my ego.”As it turns out, on Sunday, Hochuli will work the Cincinnati-Jacksonville game, an anonymous assignment that calls into question the N.F.L.’s sense of theater. It is a far cry from the last time Hochuli’s crew was on the field: for last season’s N.F.C. championship game.But the fact that officials were prepared to return seamlessly on such short notice is largely because of Hochuli, who essentially did during the lockout what the league’s office of officiating does under normal conditions. Hochuli watched very little football during the lockout — a baseball fan, he was watching an Arizona Diamondbacks game last Monday night while Seattle and Green Bay played — but he spent dozens of hours each week making up rules tests, collecting and circulating game film, presiding over conference calls and organizing e-mail round tables.Hochuli played linebacker at Texas-El Paso — “I was small, but I was slow” — and he took up officiating to earn some money during law school. He started in the N.F.L. in 1990, and Mike Pereira, the former vice president for officiating who is now a Fox analyst, said Hochuli was the most knowledgeable rules expert in the entire league, destined to be mentioned among the legends of officiating with Jim Tunney, Jerry Markbreit and Red Cashion. Hochuli’s passion for officiating is so great that his son Shawn is a successful Pacific-12 Conference official, and the two critique each other after their games.During the lockout, Hochuli acted as a personal coach and cheerleader for his colleagues while they waited for a settlement.“The guys were really down and hurting,” said Tunney, who talks regularly with Hochuli and listened in on some of his rules conference calls. “On one conference call a week or so ago, he said: ‘Before we start, let me tell you something. We need to be ready to go professionally. When we walk back on the field, we’re going to be the best officials they’ve ever had.’ ”Of course, what many people really want to see are Hochuli’s arms. At 61, Hochuli thinks that how officials present themselves affects how they perform. So he lifts weights four days a week and does cardio every day. The result: Hochuli looks as if he belongs on a football field.There are those who snicker about Hochuli’s muscles — thus the semi-admiring, somewhat sarcastic nickname Hochules — and the uniform sleeves that seem to be fitted so tight they threaten to cut off his circulation. But players have been caught on microphones marveling at Hochuli. His arms are such a part of his persona that after the labor deal was reached, he told several news outlets he dropped to the floor to do some push-ups in celebration. He was kidding, he said a day later.“That is really sick,” Hochuli said of the obsession with his arms. “I get a kick out of the arm thing. Players come up and say, I want to compare arms. Their arms are the size of my thighs. It’s a joke. It’s a sideshow. My arms are not that big.”During the lockout, when an effort was made to tamp down criticism of the replacement officials, it was often said that the regular officials make mistakes, too. It has been four years since Hochuli blew his whistle and ruled that Jay Cutler, then Denver’s quarterback, had thrown an incomplete pass, not fumbled, at the San Diego 1 in the final minute of a game against the Broncos. Hochuli knew almost immediately that he was wrong, and when the Broncos went on to score the winning touchdown, the avalanche of criticism began. Hochuli apologized repeatedly, but he received hate mail, and Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys’ owner, told reporters he wasn’t surprised Hochuli was involved, because he was a “highly criticized” official.Before Hochuli was off the field, Pereira, then the league’s head of officiating, called the officials’ locker room in Denver. When Hochuli got there, he and Pereira talked for at least five minutes.“I knew it would make him want to think about quitting,” Pereira said. “He was so down. I walked him through his career and what he’s meant to the league and to officiating, and one call is never going to define his body of work. I wanted to prop him up and send him out of the stadium at least knowing he had the backing of the league. I wanted him to know, in my eyes, that he was one of the all-time best.”Hochuli did not quit, of course. And when he takes the field Sunday, he will almost certainly receive a hero’s welcome. Hochuli predicts that the honeymoon for officials will probably last no longer than one quarter. Hochuli’s seems to have already run much longer.'"
"'12-09-30,'0','“We’ve won five straight Atlantic Division titles,” Grousbeck said, adding of the Knicks: “We view that as our division — and they are going to have to come right after us. Well, they’re coming as hard as they can.”Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said he thought the Knicks would be much improved “because they’re going to have a whole season under one system.” He was referring to the team’s in-season coaching change, with Mike Woodson replacing Mike D’Antoni.The Knicks and the Celtics split four games last season for the first time since the 2000-1 season. All four games were competitive; the combined point differential was 16 points. Two of the games were decided by 2 points and a third went into overtime. The only game that did not go down to the final few possessions was the Knicks’ 118-110 victory in New York on April 17.The Knicks won the season opener in Madison Square Garden on Christmas Day, with Carmelo Anthony scoring 37 points. The Celtics prevailed in a national television matchup in March during the height of Linsanity. In that game, Rajon Rondo dominated Jeremy Lin with 18 points, 17 rebounds and 20 assists. It was the Celtics’ 11th straight home victory over the Knicks, dating to Nov. 24, 2006.This season, Boston visits Madison Square Garden on Jan. 7 and March 31.The Knicks lost their starting backcourt to free agency when Lin signed with the Houston Rockets and Landry Fields signed with the Toronto Raptors. The Celtics lost one of their starting guards when Ray Allen signed with the defending champion Miami Heat. The Knicks acquired Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd to replace Lin. The Celtics signed Jason Terry and traded for Courtney Lee to help fill the void left by Allen’s departure. The third-year guard Avery Bradley will also see time once he recovers from shoulder surgery.Among the Celtics’ other additions are Jeff Green, who missed last season because of heart surgery, and the first-round draft picks Jared Sullinger and Fab Melo.Rivers said he was paying no attention to the Lakers or any other team in the Western Conference. He said his team had one rival in mind as the season begins: the team that eliminated the Celtics from the playoffs in each of the last two seasons.“We have one target, and that’s Miami,” Rivers said. “Because at the end of the day, we have to get out of the East and the defending champions are in the East. Whatever happens out West, good luck, I hope to see you.”The Knicks hope to put themselves in the conversation with the Celtics and the Heat. The newly relocated Nets, with a reconfigured roster, hope to do so as well.“Our division is going to be tough,” Rivers said.Grousbeck said he had yet to visit the new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but he is looking forward to two more trips to New York City this season. Beating the Nets in Brooklyn will not top beating the Knicks across the East River, but, he said, “we now have another New York team to worry about. I love it. It’s good for the league.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','So how does a 36-year-old outfielder with bad knees, a resurgent power stroke, veto rights on all trades and $38 million owed to him over the next two years fit into the team’s plans?The Cubs signed Soriano to an eight-year, $136 million contract after he hit 46 home runs and stole 41 bases in 2006 with Washington. He has hit 20 home runs in each of his seasons in Chicago but has never come close to approaching his 2006 numbers.“Sometimes, a big challenge can be evaluating someone by their contract and not by the player, and that’s the case here,” Hoyer said. “Fans are frustrated more by finances than by what’s happening on the field.”Soriano’s image around Wrigley calcified long before 2012 as that of an overpaid underachiever, mainly because of his frequent defensive lapses in addition to the huge contract. He became a symbol of the previous brain trust, which signed a group of expensive free agents who delivered no postseason glory.This season, the ire of Cubs fans peaked in June during a game against Boston. Soriano hit a sharp line drive right at the third baseman but did not run the ball out. When it was dropped, he was heartily booed — perhaps unfairly.“Fans are fans,” Soriano said. “I think I still love them.”The Cubs dealt the veteran pitchers Paul Maholm and Ryan Dempster and catcher Geovany Soto at the trade deadline, leaving Soriano in place. On the night he hit his 30th home run, Soriano was joined in the lineup by seven position players with an average of 345 games of major league experience. Soriano has played in 1,745 games. Six of those players have salaries of less than $1 million. Soriano is making $19 million this season.“We’re looking for assets as we try to move forward,” Hoyer said. “It’s not a secret we’ve had conversations about Alfonso with other teams.”Because he has played at least 10 years in the majors and at least five consecutive years with one team, Soriano has the power to block any trade. When the San Francisco Giants showed interest before the trade deadline, he declined. “My legs don’t handle the wind and the cold,” Soriano said. “I didn’t want to go there.”Soriano also has three children, all 10 or younger, and he likes Chicago, he said. He has been traded twice in his career and said he valued the control he had earned over his destiny.“If I do go, I would like it to be in the off-season,” he said, “and my first choice is to stay here.”But what could have devolved into a prickly situation has been defused less by Soriano’s homers than by what he has come to represent in a very young clubhouse: leadership.It has not been a trait commonly linked with Soriano during his career, and Hoyer acknowledged that when he arrived in Chicago, he had heard rumors about Soriano’s lack of hustle. But Soriano’s clubhouse presence this year has been a revelation.“That’s how he’s been most valuable to us,” Hoyer said. “Our guys need players to look up to, so he does fit on the team.”Soriano called his mentor role, especially for Starlin Castro, a 22-year-old fellow Dominican and an All-Star shortstop, his motivation this year. When he was in New York, Soriano said, veterans like Bernie Williams and Jorge Posada did the same for him.“The players on the Yankees made me feel welcome and comfortable,” Soriano said. “It’s one of the best things for my career, and I want to make these guys feel it, too.”Before a recent game at Wrigley, Castro and Soriano stood shoulder to shoulder as they chatted in shallow left field during batting practice. Soriano pointed with his glove at the hitter and around the field as Castro watched and listened.“He reminds me how lucky I am to be here,” Castro said.During a trip earlier this season, the Cubs dressed up as superheroes. Soriano chose Batman; Castro donned a Robin costume.“We are the duo,” Castro said. “I want him to stay here.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','In return, he would donate two smaller but more valuable and often visited private parcels to the National Park Service: one in the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, the other near a dazzling reservoir about 70 miles from here. He also promised to build 23 miles of trails and new access routes to the forest and wilderness.Opponents saw it as a land grab, one that brought the chasm between rich America and just-getting-by America right to their corner of the Rockies. To the staunchest opponents, it was simple: a powerful out-of-town landowner wanted to close public lands in their backyard so he could have the run of his.“I didn’t know there was such a vitriolic hatred for me in Paonia, and particularly from people I’ve never met,” Mr. Koch said. “With some of those people, it’s class warfare, or it’s some of my brothers’ political activity is sloughing off on me.”Mr. Koch, who is also an avid sailor and won the America’s Cup in 1992, is less of a political lightning rod than two of his brothers. But he is an important supporter of Mitt Romney this election season, and he has donated $3 million to the pro-Romney political action committee Restore Our Future, according to federal campaign finance records. Mr. Koch has also donated smaller amounts to Democrats in previous years.Locally, the reaction to Mr. Koch’s land swap, and to the man himself, has been complicated.Mr. Koch, who also owns an estate near Aspen and homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Massachusetts, is one of the biggest employers around Paonia.His coal mine in Somerset employs 348 people. Gunnison Energy, his gas company, has 20 workers. The ranch has 35 full-time and seasonal employees, and dozens more people are supplying materials, hauling freight and doing construction on it.He gives away hundreds of thousands of dollars to the local rodeo, softball teams, 4-H clubs and the annual Easter egg hunt.“I have a lot of respect for Mr. Koch and the way he treats his employees,” said Frank Mastrullo, who moved to Paonia last year and whose stepson works in the coal mine.Mr. Mastrullo, like others who support the land exchange, said the public would lose almost nothing by giving up a strip of scrub oak and sagebrush that saw little use. He said class divides had animated much of the opposition.“It’s an envy thing,” Mr. Mastrullo said. “No matter what this man wanted to do, they’d oppose him.”Nothing crystallized the divide like the “Tiananmen Sid” incident in July. Mr. Koch lent a World War II-era tank to Paonia’s annual Cherry Days parade, but as it rumbled down Grand Avenue, a local hairdresser named Sid Lewis blocked the tank in protest. For some, the episode was a rallying cry against the encroaching influence of an outsider’s money and power. But many said it was disrespectful, both to a major employer in the valley and to the veterans being honored.Mr. Koch’s plans for his ranch have also fueled intrigue. For the last three years, he has been painstakingly piecing together his own Old West town from relocated historic buildings and new construction made to look old. A halo of dust rises as moving trucks lumber through the recreated main street and crews assemble Victorian buildings.The still-unnamed town — he has contemplated calling it Ragged Edge, or maybe Billsville — is the fulfillment of boyhood dreams that stretch back to his days working on his wealthy father’s ranch in Montana, digging irrigation ditches and baling hay. The town’s saloon, train station, church, jailhouse and 50 or 60 other buildings should be finished by late spring.One day, Mr. Koch plans to fill the buildings with his growing collection of Western memorabilia, creating a private museum featuring a rare photograph of Billy the Kid and other million-dollar vestiges of a vanished time.He has said he wants it to remain a private refuge for his family, historians and school tours, not open to the general public. He does not want to pay for full-time staffing, extra security guards and other liabilities that would come with opening up the town to everyone. For now, guards stop anyone approaching the private road into the ranch, and “No Trespassing” signs dot its borders.“I do want to have a home in my town,” he said. “While I’m still alive, I don’t want to invite the public through my home.”Still, from a rutted county road on (for now) public land, it is a marvel to see: a tiny town rises from scratch, tucked against a curtain of golden aspens and dusty gray spires. It is a view, of course, that curious onlookers would lose if the land exchange went through. Some critics suspect that is the point.“It’s all about privacy,” said Jim Sims, who owns a 160-acre ranch nearby and opposes the deal. “All it does is kick the public off of some prime ground that they should have access to.”For now, the resistance may be working. Any deal, which would require Congressional approval, is at least months away, according to a land group working with Mr. Koch’s Bear Ranch. Members of Colorado’s Congressional delegation tried in 2010 to pass a land-exchange bill, but their efforts stalled in the face of local opposition and midterm elections that reshaped the political atmosphere in Washington.“It’s been more difficult than I thought it would be,” said Tom Glass, the founder of the Western Land Group, which is working on Mr. Koch’s behalf to make the exchange.But they are as determined to move forward as their opponents are to stop them. Recently, Paonia residents found another glossy flier in their mailboxes, extolling the benefits of the land swap and urging them not to believe the falsehoods of those opposed to it.“It’s the code of the West,” Mr. Koch said in an interview. “Stand up for your neighbor, and stand up for yourself.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','JOHN F. KENNEDY was a striking man — by most accounts, the best-looking person ever to occupy the White House — but he lived in an age before Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube, chat groups and discussion threads made that a subject to debate with as much fervor as health care reform and offshore tax havens. Not so this year’s presidential candidates.Thus, if you typed “Is Barack Obama hot?” into Google last week, among the 10,600 results would be a link to a Facebook page “How hot is Barack Obama?,” with instructions to “ ‘like’ this if you think Barack Obama is the hottest U.S. president ever!!!” Results: 1,238 “likes” as of Friday morning, and comments like one from an admirer identified as Juanita Mitchell Dillion: “Fine, Fine, Fine.”Meanwhile, a “Barack Obama shirtless” search got 68,000 hits, most with links to pictures of the president on vacation in Hawaii.A similar search turned up just 8 results on Google to the question “Is Mitt Romney hot?” But there was also a “Mitt Romney is Hot like a Muffin in the Sack” Facebook page with 21 likes, as well as 5,300 Google hits for a “Mitt Romney shirtless” query. (But most of those seemed to be of links to blog posts and pictures about his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan.)The search about the sex appeal of the two candidates also turned up posts about a TV reporter once asking Mr. Obama if his “GQ cover looks,” as she put it, made it hard for him to relate to working-class people. (His somewhat drawn-out answer seemed to be no.) And at the Web site democraticunderground.com, there is a popular discussion thread asking “Is Obama not the best looking president we’ve had in decades?” (The consensus seemed to be yes.)Last week, when he and the first lady were on “The View,” the president made it clear he didn’t seem entirely unaware of his physical appeal, joking (or was he?) with the cast that “I told folks I’m just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys.”'"
"'12-09-30,'0','The auto industry’s race toward a greater number of transmission gears now resembles that of the bicycle industry of 25 years ago, when 10-speed bikes were left in the dust by those with 12, 15 and more speeds. But there’s no comparison in the investment required. Experts say there is not much change left from a billion-dollar investment in a new automatic gearbox that will be produced in numbers of at least 500,000 a year.Automakers that buy new transmission designs from specialist suppliers like ZF in Germany and Aisin in Japan, rather than designing and manufacturing their own, typically pay royalties on intellectual-property rights and license fees for each transmission, adding to the vehicle’s cost.“The biggest benefit in G.M. and Ford working together is it reduces their investment risk,” said David Petrovski, a powertrain analyst at IHS Automotive.“It’s just not economically feasible for them to separately chase after every new fuel-efficiency technology under the sun,” he said. “By collaborating, they’re able to use the best engineering concepts from both sides.”Automatic transmissions with more gear ratios and more sophisticated electronic controls are crucial to improving fuel economy. Mr. Petrovski noted that as automakers replace existing engines with smaller turbocharged versions that use less fuel, the engines typically have to operate at higher speeds to produce maximum output. He cited the industry’s steady march from 3- and 4-speed automatics in the 1980s to 5- and 6-speeds in the 1990s, then the jump to 7- and 8-speed transmissions in the early 2000s. Chrysler is preparing to release a 9-speed automatic, designed by ZF, in 2013.Adding more gears helps to keep the engine operating in a speed range where it has the best performance with the least fuel consumption. An 8-speed automatic can deliver up to 11 percent better fuel economy than a 6-speed, for example, depending on engine, vehicle and drive-axle gearing.An important factor in the move to seven and more gears is the transmission’s ratio spread — the numerical relationship between first and top gear (called the overall ratio spread), or between adjacent gears — for instance, third and fourth gears.Adding more gears is the only way to have a large overall ratio spread (for both good acceleration and quiet highway cruising) along with a small ratio spread between gears (to keep the engine revving at its best power level for a given road speed). The higher the number, the better. The new 9-speeds will have a ratio spread close to 10, compared with a typical 6-speed’s ratio spread of about six.Packing more gears into the compact transmission housings used in smaller vehicles — along with the hardware needed to deliver smooth, imperceptible shifts — is an increasingly tricky challenge, engineers say. They are designing the gearsets to “nest” within each other to save space.However, there is only so much space available under the hood of subcompact and compact cars with front-wheel drive, in part because their transmissions are positioned across the chassis, rather than lengthwise as in trucks, large S.U.V.’s and most sports cars and large luxury sedans. The limited width between the front wheels restricts how wide the transmissions can be — and the number of gears that can fit inside.The lack of space to package seven and more gears is one reason that subcompacts like the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic don’t achieve higher fuel efficiency than the larger Ford Focus and Chevy Cruze. It’s also why compacts like the Focus and Cruze can’t top the economy of the midsize Fusion and Malibu. (The longer vehicles also have lower aerodynamic drag, which helps overall efficiency.)The tiny Chevrolet Spark had only enough space in its engine compartment to accommodate a 4-speed automatic. To quickly satisfy demand for more gear ratios from American customers who don’t want the standard 5-speed manual, G.M. plans to offer a continuously-variable transmission, supplied by Jatco, a Japanese C.V.T. specialist, in coming Sparks. The compact C.V.T. essentially offers an infinite number of gear ratios, enabling the tiny car to close the fuel-economy gap with its larger, more expensive stablemates.'"

But it does set the mood: you’re not here just to navigate a serious collection of hard-to-find natural wines from cult vintners with limited productions, you’re here to have fun.Actually, you’re probably here to eat. Manfreds & Vin was opened last fall by Christian F. Puglisi, a Noma alum who also runs the kitchen at the Michelin-starred Relae across the street. The three restaurants share some culinary DNA even though they offer drastically different experiences. If Noma transforms Nordic food into high art, and if Relae renders it accessible to a wider audience, then Manfreds & Vin turns it into a party.At least that’s how it feels when you’re directed past the open kitchen to one of the handful of tables crammed into the low-ceilinged rooms that are more flea market than Danish modern. An attractively disheveled waiter will hand you a photocopied menu that lists a handful of dishes and wines.It’s of limited use. If you want to drink, ask for one of the wine experts (they’re in the leather aprons) and start a conversation; if you want to eat, order the set menu, which at 245 Danish krone per person, or $43 at 5.65 Danish krone to the dollar, for four small courses is one of the great bargains in what has become one of the most exciting food cities in the world.The set menu works best for groups of two, which allows the tiny kitchen to turn out a total of eight dishes. On a recent night, the lineup started with charred onions with shaved Danish cheese and red sorrel, summer cabbages with kale, and poached cod with apple juice and shaved fennel. The meal took off from there: a farm egg resting in brown butter and blanketed by cauliflower and chervil, smashed potatoes with fresh buttermilk, seared hangar steak and nasturtiums, charred broccoli and a tart parsley purée. The menu ended on a savory note — a fried romaine salad with toasted walnuts and anchovy sauce — but you can order cheese or dessert if you have the room.Don’t let the pretty presentations fool you — this is soulful food, each dish a deeply satisfying collision of tastes and textures. And each dish contains an unexpected touch. Something as seemingly simple as the charred onions is not only balanced by the nutty cheese and lemony sorrel, it’s elevated by a quick drizzle of elderflower vinaigrette.It’s gimmick-free cooking — Mr. Puglisi is a chef’s chef, and he runs a kitchen where creativity and talent are more important than gadgets and novelty. Not that the stylish crowd at Manfreds & Vin seem to worry too much about the ideology or pedigree of the food. They’re here because it’s a good time.'"

This orientation confuses the objectives of businesses and those of educational institutions. Businesses are obligated to return a monetary profit to their shareholders, while colleges are obligated to search for truth. Obviously it takes financial support to search for truth, but the desire for profit should not be the overriding objective of universities or their boards.As a Charlottesville resident, a UVA alum and a community-college educator, I know it wasn’t just faculty members who were outraged by Teresa Sullivan’s ouster — it was the entire university community. A decision of such enormity involving so many stakeholders should never be made via private phone calls. Sullivan has handled this with grace and humility. I have much more faith in her ability to lead UVA through a crisis than in Helen Dragas and other corporate execs, many of whom inherited, rather than earned, their success. For the good of the university, Dragas needs to resign.The article raises two important issues about the future of higher education: whether the college business model is sustainable over the long term and what roles the faculty and the board should play in governance. But you would hope those issues would be resolved through the lens of student outcomes. Just because UVA’s students are successful today doesn’t mean they always will be or that the university can’t do even better. How will new institutional models and leadership improve student learning? How will they lead to stronger outcomes once students enter graduate programs and the job market? And how will they serve the community and the state, including the growing number of low-income and Latino students in Virginia?My wife and I were eating dinner with our 2-year-old son when the Kalamazoo Promise scholarship was announced on the local news. We just looked across the table at each other dumbfounded. I know firsthand what it was like to work as many as three dismal jobs while taking a full-time classload. Our son is a fourth grader now. Having the Promise for him is priceless. He knows exactly what it means, because we talk about college all the time, as if it is mandatory rather than an option. Bless those who made this possible. It is making a difference. This is a great city full of great people.This is not a new experiment. The small lumber town Philomath, Ore., has had a similar foundation for many years, funded by a lumber-company owner, that provides four-year scholarships to every graduate of Philomath High School. The program did seem to help the local economy, but it was no bulwark against the general decline of the timber industry. Younger families began to move in, bringing more liberal ideas and a general distaste for the timber industry. The clash between old and new residents resulted in the foundation’s restricting scholarships to graduates whose families have lived there for two or more generations, who are connected to timber, mining or agriculture and who are studying one of those areas. Free college might look like a way to broaden opportunities for children in an economically depressed area, but, it can also be used to entrench the values of those handing out the money.I was a recipient of this scholarship when it was in its infancy. Neither of my parents worked, so there wasn’t much of a plan for me to go to college; I’ve now graduated with an engineering degree and work happily in the auto industry in Michigan. This scholarship will change lives and provide so many amazing opportunities for its recipients for many years to come. I’ll be forever thankful for it.'"

Sit in a boring room under fluorescent lights on a saggy, secondhand sofa, in the stale air of hours of futility. Break up your band. Have the worst date of your life. Imagine you’re a matador. Watch Nina Simone. Watch Benny Goodman. Watch Al Pacino, meet Al Pacino, be Al Pacino. Get insulted by Shelley Winters. Round up a marathon of the bleakest, most violent spaghetti westerns you can find. Realize you just might be a racist. Endure your mother’s illness. Most of all, try again, repeatedly.Don’t trust us — these are tips from the experts. If you’ve ever seen a painting, or watched a movie, or read a novel, or enjoyed a performance, or followed a television show that moved you on some essential level, you probably wondered: What inspired that? We’ve wondered that, too. So we asked. What follows are the answers, in all their varied glory, to that question. In part it’s an investigation into the enigmatic nature of creative inspiration. (Which, it turns out, is often not so enigmatic. Step 1: Work. Step 2: Be frustrated. Step 3: Repeat.) In part, it’s an attempt to figure out just where creative culture comes from. (Sometimes, from the last Kleenex in the box.) And in part, it’s an excuse to celebrate the best music, books, plays, movies, TV and art on the horizon. We hope you enjoy it. Who knows? You might even be inspired.'"
