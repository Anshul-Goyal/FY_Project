"'06-07-01,'0','""Never before,"" James Baldwin later wrote, ""in the entire history of the American theater, has so much of the truth of black people's lives been seen on the stage.""The play ran for 530 performances. It would not be the only time that Mr. Richards, a small, compact, bespectacled man, brought a new and reverberating voice into the dramatic landscape.In 1981, as head of the National Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center in Waterford, a place where playwrights can work among colleagues and have their plays staged, Mr. Richards selected a submission — one script out of more than a thousand — from another young unknown writer, in this case a poet named August Wilson. The play was ""Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,"" one of the plays in Mr. Wilson's 10-part cycle on the African-American experience in the 20th century. By the time Mr. Richards had refined it and ushered it through the Yale Rep, where he was then artistic director, to Broadway's Cort Theater in 1984, Mr. Wilson's standing as a major figure in American literature had been established.Mr. Richards and Mr. Wilson, who died last year, would form one of the most successful artistic partnerships in American theater, as Mr. Richards directed and collaborated on five other plays by Mr. Wilson —""Fences,"" ""Joe Turner's Come and Gone,"" ""The Piano Lesson,"" ""Two Trains Running"" and ""Seven Guitars."" The two refined and developed them in a long pre-Broadway tryout process at nonprofit theaters around the country that was a trademark of their creative process. Mr. Richards won the 1987 Tony Award for best director for ""Fences.""The team parted ways after ""Seven Guitars"" in 1996, after Mr. Wilson formed a production partnership with Benjamin Mordecai, who was managing director at Yale with Mr. Richards. They selected Marion McClinton to direct Mr. Wilson's next production, ""Jitney,"" which played off Broadway. Though they stayed on civil terms, Mr. Wilson's professional association with Mr. Richards was over.But Mr. Wilson was only one of Mr. Richards's protégés during his more than three decades as head of the Playwrights Conference at the O'Neill Center. There he helped develop the careers of writers like Wendy Wasserstein, Christopher Durang, Lee Blessing and David Henry Hwang, who came to the center right out of college.""Lloyd was a consummate teacher, but when it really comes down to it, when you look at his legacy, it's new playwrights,"" George C. White, the founder of the O'Neill Center, said yesterday. ""I can't think of anybody who has been more of a force for developing playwrights since the 1960's.""In 1979, during Mr. Richards's first season as artistic director of the Yale Rep, James Earl Jones gave him the script for the South African playwright Athol Fugard's ""Lesson From Aloes."" After Mr. Richards's successful production of that play, which later moved to Broadway, Yale Rep would go on to present several of Mr. Fugard's plays, including the world premieres of "" 'Master Harold' ... and the Boys"" and ""The Road to Mecca.""""Lloyd was just a reservoir of wisdom,"" said Charles S. Dutton, who was cast by Mr. Richards in ""Ma Rainey"" when he was a student at the Yale School of Drama. He said he used to tell Mr. Wilson, ""You've got a man who's lived almost every decade of your 10 plays.""Lloyd George Richards was born on June 29, 1919, in Toronto. His father, a Jamaican carpenter and follower of the black nationalist Marcus Garvey, moved the family to Detroit for a job in the auto industry. When Mr. Richards was 9, his father died of diphtheria; a few years after that, his mother lost her eyesight.It was up to Mr. Richards and his brother, Allan, to keep the family afloat, shining shoes and working in a barbershop, an experience to which he would later refer when talking of his immediate reaction to Mr. Wilson's work.Mr. Richards went to Wayne State University (Wayne University at the time) to study law, but he had become interested in theater in a class about Shakespeare in high school. During World War II he volunteered for the Army Air Corps, and was training with Tuskegee's flight program for black soldiers when the war ended.In 1947 he moved to New York to work in the theater, staying at the Y.M.C.A., waiting on tables and acting in Off Broadway productions. He met the director Paul Mann when he auditioned for a one-act play that Mr. Mann was directing at the Equity Library Theater, and soon he was studying and later teaching with Mr. Mann at his actors' workshop.There he met Sidney Poitier, at the time a struggling actor, and a dancer named Barbara Davenport.Mr. Richards married Ms. Davenport in 1957, and they moved 11 years later into a brownstone on the Upper West Side, where she still lives. In addition to their son Scott, who lives in Montclair, N.J., they had another son, Thomas, who lives in Pontedera, Italy.Mr. Poitier told Mr. Richards that if he ever found a play he wanted to act in, he would ask Mr. Richards to direct. In 1957 he found it. Mr. Poitier encouraged Mr. Richards to read ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" and encouraged Mr. Rose to hire him as its director.""He was able to deal with all these people and get the best out of them,"" Mr. Rose said about Mr. Richards. ""He directed it as though we had a group of stars, which, of course, they all turned to be.""Over the next year Mr. Richards worked with Ms. Hansberry, Mr. Poitier and the other actors in the play, including Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, Louis Gossett and Ruby Dee.""Lorraine was such a young, young person, and she and Lloyd seemed to connect to one another,"" Ms. Dee, who played the role of Ruth, the wife of Walter Lee Younger (Mr. Poitier), in the original production, recalled yesterday. Ms. Hansberry would die of cancer in 1965 at 34.""Lloyd was an intense director even though he was light-footed,"" Ms. Dee said. ""I think he knew exactly what the music was here.""For Mr. Richards, the historic significance of the production was only secondary to his desire to direct.""There are many moments, or incidents, in my career when I was discovered the first black person to do whatever,"" he said in a 2005 interview with N. Graham Nesmith in African American Review. ""I never did anything that I did in order to receive that designation — it happened because I was attempting to do the things I wanted to do, and someone gave me an opportunity.""Indeed, after ""A Raisin in the Sun,"" Mr. Richards was asked to direct a Buddy Hackett musical called ""I Had a Ball"" in 1964 and another commercial musical, ""The Yearling,"" the next year, rare assignments for a black director at the time.In 1966 Mr. Richards joined the staff of the actor training program at New York University, one of the first in the country. The same year, Mr. White, of the O'Neill Center, asked Mr. Richards to come to Waterford and direct a play about the Civil War. In 1968 he was offered the job as artistic director of the Playwrights Conference, a position he would hold until 1999.There, Mr. Richards made changes in the way plays were developed, encouraging staged readings and postperformance critiques and emphasizing the role of the dramaturge as a kind of mediator between playwright and director.He also resisted the received theater wisdom that the playwright should keep away from the actors, Mr. White said, and encouraged writers to be involved in their productions.But characteristically, he kept his own interference to a minimum.""He was someone who hired people and then trusted them,"" said Mr. Durang, who worked on his first successful play, ""A History of American Film,"" at the O'Neill Center.In 1979 Mr. Richards replaced Robert Brustein as dean of the Yale School of Drama and artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theater. Mr. Brustein had developed a reputation as a director who made a strong imprint on his productions; Mr. Richards was of the opposite inclination, involving himself in the refining and editing of plays, nurturing the plays on their route to Broadway and elsewhere, but staging them without necessarily leaving a conspicuous personal stamp.""I try to permit the actor to arrive where I want him to arrive, without telling him where I want him to be,"" Mr. Richards said in a 1989 interview with The New York Times. ""You feed them the right things, and keep stimulating them to the point where they make choices. I would rather an actor discover it for himself than me tell him — it's his then.""Mr. Dutton, who was also in ""The Piano Lesson,"" said that despite Mr. Richards's lack of intrusiveness, he carefully steered his productions.""He'd say one word or one sentence, and it would just open the door to a whole world in approaching the character,"" Mr. Dutton said. ""His nuances had nuances.""Mr. Richards retired from Yale in 1991, and from the O'Neill Center in 1999, after discovering, teaching and nurturing some of the most significant playwrights of his time.""Lloyd had only two sons,"" Mr. Dutton said, ""but he had a lot of children.""'"
"'06-07-01,'0','Whether Wie is making birdies or bogeys, galleries remain fascinated by her. For her 7:55 a.m. tee time, which included Brittany Lang (76) and Suzann Pettersen (73), no seat in the grandstand was empty.A year ago, when she shot a final-round 82 at the United States Women's Open, Wie still pulled a large and loud gallery along for a walk. ""I'm pretty used to it by now,"" Wie said. ""I'm pretty used to everyone trying to figure me out. I think it's pretty cool.""Wie has rarely strayed from the spotlight this year, despite being in high school (she just completed her junior year at the Punahou School in Honolulu). In April, she finished tied for third at the Kraft Nabisco Championship. In May, she made the cut in the SK Telecom Open, a men's event on the Asian Tour.Earlier this month, she attempted to qualify for the United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club, coming up five strokes short of a playoff for one spot. She also finished tied for fifth at the L.P.G.A. Championship three weeks ago.Although greatness has been predicted for her, she remains at a disadvantage because she is not playing a full schedule, said David Leadbetter, her coach. Because Wie is not an L.P.G.A. member, she can play in only six L.P.G.A. events, as well as the United States Women's Open and the Women's British Open.""I don't think she's really going to take off to that level until she starts playing on a more regular basis,"" Leadbetter said. ""She's in a stretch now where she is playing a number of tournaments in a few weeks, and it's going to be interesting to see how she plays. But if you look at the rest of the year, she plays once, takes four weeks off. How do you get any sort of continuity or momentum going?""But I'll tell you, she's a heck of a lot better player this year than she was at this time last year, in all departments.""Wie will have to be to win her first title. Pak, who won the L.P.G.A. Championship, is continuing to strike the ball well. Hurst has four victories, including a major.And there is Sorenstam, who played 18 holes Friday with a visible bounce in her step. Her opening round in the 60's was her first in this tournament since 1995, when she won the United States Women's Open for the first time.""I think the fog helped me,"" Sorenstam said. ""It gave me an extra day to work on some things.""Despite the soggy conditions, Sorenstam's white shoes gleamed after her round.""It's dry in the fairway,"" she said.Jane Park, 19, is one of the most decorated amateurs in the game. She made the cut in the 2003 United States Women's Open, where she finished tied for 30th, and she won the United States Women's Amateur in 2004. ""I love the atmosphere here,"" said Park, who attends U.C.L.A. ""It's great to be out here again, seeing all these people and the people I look up to. It inspires me to play my best."" The last amateur to win the United States Women's Open was Catherine Lacoste, in 1967. ...

"'06-07-01,'0','A judge has ruled for Microsoft as part of an antitrust lawsuit brought by the founder of a tablet computer company in one of the last remaining civil lawsuits from a 1998 federal antitrust case against the company.The lawsuit, filed a year ago by Jerrold S. Kaplan, founder of the Go Corporation, was dismissed in an opinion issued Thursday by Judge J. Frederick Motz of Federal District Court in Maryland. The judge wrote that Mr. Kaplan had the option of filing a new lawsuit at a future date.Rachel Wayne, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said the only other remaining complaint tied to the 1998 case involves Novell, which accused Microsoft of unfair competition related to WordPerfect, which Novell sold in 1996. That case is on appeal.Microsoft settled other cases and agreed to pay billions of dollars in lawsuits involving companies including I.B.M. and Sun Microsystems.Mr. Kaplan filed a similar lawsuit in California state court. Ms. Wayne said Microsoft planned to file a motion to dismiss that lawsuit.Mr. Kaplan accused Microsoft of trying to ""kill"" Go in the early 1990's. Mr. Kaplan declined to comment on the case. Founded in 1987 by Mr. Kaplan, the former chief scientist of the Lotus Development Corporation, Go set out to develop a class of portable computers controlled by a pen. Go went out of business in 1994 and was reincorporated in 2005.A portion of the case hinges on the behavior of Microsoft's engineers after they were given access to Go's technology under a nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit cites Microsoft documents that suggest the engineers gathered intelligence to help Microsoft develop a rival product.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','In a brisk proceeding, Mr. Kerik spoke briefly and quietly. He acknowledged accepting the renovations in late 1999 and in 2000 from a large New Jersey contractor, Interstate Industrial Corporation, which has been accused of having ties to organized crime, an accusation it has repeatedly denied. He said he also talked to city officials and Trade Waste regulators about the company, which was seeking a license from the city. At the time, he was the city's correction commissioner.""I admit that I took a gift from the Interstate companies or a subsidiary, and thinking they were clean, I spoke to city officials about Interstate on two occasions and on another occasion permitted my office to be used for a meeting between Trade Waste authorities and representatives of Interstate,"" Mr. Kerik said.Under the plea, Mr. Kerik, who has a security consulting business, will pay $221,000 in fines and penalties for accepting the renovations and failing to report the loan — $28,000 from a friend, the real estate developer Nathan Berman — to the Conflict of Interest Board.The agreement, which ended an exhaustive 18-month grand jury investigation by the offices of Mr. Johnson and Ms. Hearn, focused on Interstate and Mr. Kerik's relationship with the company, allowed him to avoid jail time, more serious bribery charges and a felony conviction.It was nonetheless a stunning fall for Mr. Kerik, 50, who began his remarkable ascent in city government in 1993. Then a third-grade police detective, he became a volunteer bodyguard and chauffeur for Rudolph W. Giuliani in his mayoral campaign. After his election, Mr. Giuliani appointed him to a high-level post in the Correction Department, where he rose to the commissioner's office. The mayor later made him police commissioner, a post he held at the time of the Sept. 11 terror attacks.At a news conference with Mr. Johnson at his office after the plea, Ms. Hearn sought to make clear that Mr. Kerik was treated like a criminal. ""He was arrested and booked, plain and simple,"" she said, ""just like every other perp who gets arrested and processed by the agencies that he used to lead. Make no mistake about it, Mr. Kerik now has a criminal record.""Mr. Kerik's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, called Ms. Hearn's comments hyperbole, saying that Mr. Kerik had not been processed through central booking like a common criminal and had been afforded the opportunity to be processed in the district attorney's office and to walk to court.""The lack of professionalism exhibited by that statement proves her to be bitter that her investigation fell short,"" he said.Mr. Kerik seemed unrepentant when he stood in front of a cluster of reporters and television cameras on the sidewalk in front of the Bronx courthouse.""You know, it's funny; over the last year and a half I've watched and listened as people have picked apart my 30-year career in fighting crime and fighting injustice and tried to destroy everything I've ever done,"" he said.When a reporter asked if he was sorry, Mr. Kerik, who had finished his remarks and had not planned to take questions, turned from the cameras and said to one of his lawyers, ""Let's go.""He climbed into a black chauffeur-driven sedan and was driven away.At the news conference, Mr. Johnson said that the prosecutors had initially weighed more serious charges, but that the nature of the evidence, the difficulty of proving the quid pro quo and legal questions about the statute of limitations prevented them from going forward. Ms. Hearn credited reporting in The Daily News with prompting the investigation in December 2004 after Mr. Kerik withdrew his nomination for homeland security secretary.Mr. Johnson said that Mr. Kerik's conduct had done much to weaken the public's trust in its officials, but that he hoped the conviction and fines would help repair the damage. ""For me, I think that the fact that the citizens of this city have heard an admission of what was done is a major, major factor.""Justice Collins called the outcome ""fair, equitable and proper,"" and while he acknowledged Mr. Kerik's service on 9/11 and in the days thereafter, he said he had ""violated the law for personal gain.""Mr. Giuliani said in a statement that Mr. Kerik ""has acknowledged his violations"" but ""should be evaluated in light of his service to the United States of America and the city of New York.""Among the more surprising aspects of Mr. Kerik's case has been the disclosure that much of the information about his ties to Interstate was known by lawyers inside the Department of Investigation, but it never affected his closely contested candidacy for police commissioner in 2000. At the time, the lawyers knew that Interstate's owners, whom it was investigating for ties to organized crime, had established a relationship with him and had hired his brother and the best man at his wedding.The agency learned of the relationship in June 2000, and the commissioner at the time, Edward J. Kuriansky, talked to Mr. Kerik about it, officials have said.A spokeswoman for Ms. Hearn said that by the commissioner's estimation, those facts alone — without the knowledge available now about Interstate's work on the apartment — did not constitute a ""smoking gun"" that would have been ""fatal"" to Mr. Kerik's candidacy.Asked if the facts known in 2000 had ever been passed along to Mr. Giuliani, who has said he was never told about Mr. Kerik's relationship with the company, Ms. Hearn did not answer directly. But instead, she said through a spokeswoman that Mr. Kuriansky went to meetings with the mayor and his senior staff every day.""D.O.I. has been told that references about Bernie Kerik's nomination to police commissioner were made in the context of one or more of those meetings,"" said the spokeswoman, Emily Gest. ""You'll have to ask Mr. Kuriansky to whom he spoke about Mr. Kerik's candidacy and what was discussed specifically. D.O.I. will not speak about Ed Kuriansky's memory.""Several efforts to reach Mr. Kuriansky by phone and through family members were unsuccessful.The proceeding yesterday in the Bronx had an unusual impact miles away in Lower Manhattan. There, it left the Bernard B. Kerik Correctional Complex, a city jail on Centre Street, which Mr. Giuliani named for his friend, as perhaps the only jail in the country named for a man with a criminal record.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','""I just think we've got to work through the mission rules and see where we are,” he said. “The guys are back at JSC doing that right now. So we'll see.""A different issue that had caused some concern -- whether fuel level sensors that caused a delay in the last flight would act up again -- was not a problem this morning. The sensors passed their test.The 12-day mission is mainly dedicated mainly to carrying food, water, spare parts, oxygen and other supplies to the International Space Station, along with a new crew member, Thomas Reiter of Germany, who will be the first astronaut from the European Space Agency to serve on the orbiting laboratory for a long term.But far more important to the future of the space program is the issue of flaws that doomed two previous missions, those of the Challenger in 1986 and the Columbia in 2003. This is only the second flight since the loss of the Columbia and its crew of seven, caused by a 1.67-pound piece of foam that fell from the shuttle's giant external fuel tank during ascent and punched a lethal hole in its left wing.NASA spent two years redesigning the tank and developed potential repair methods. But shortly after the Discovery's liftoff in its return-to-flight mission a year ago, several smaller but still hazardous pieces of foam fell from the tank.Andrew S. W. Thomas, an astronaut aboard that flight, recalled in an interview on Friday that as it circled the Earth, ""there were people saying, 'We're the last shuttle flight.'""For that reason, the launching will be closely monitored by batteries of cameras both at the space center and at other locations along the flight path.There is also an escape plan if damage is detected during the flight. The shuttle would dock at the orbiting space station and the astronauts would move into it for weeks or months until a rescue mission by a second shuttle could be launched.A combined crew of nine would have to live under relatively cramped conditions in 1,800 square feet of habitable space. (The average new American home is more than 2,400 square feet.) Michael T. Suffredini, the manager for the International Space Station, said that under this ""safe haven"" plan, the space station was well stocked with the food, water and oxygen that the combined crew would need, with ""quite a bit of margin.""But NASA would then be faced with the unhappy prospect of flying another shuttle with the same design flaws that caused the damage on the Discovery flight.For all of the concerns about falling foam, however, many officials and astronauts say the biggest worries are the oldest ones, most prominently the shuttle's main engines and solid rocket boosters during the crucial, bone-rattling eight and a half minutes of flight before the main engines cut off.""Flying the shuttle is not without risk for many reasons way beyond foam,"" Mr. Griffin, the NASA administrator, said Friday at a preflight news conference, ""and in fact, I worry that we spend so much time worrying about foam that we won't worry about other things that could get us.""The three main engines burn more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen that is pumped in from the external tank. And while they can at least be turned off if something goes wrong, the two solid rocket boosters flanking the huge fuel tank burn until their propellant is used up.The initial ascent is ""a controlled explosion,"" said Mike Mullane, a former astronaut, and ""the most terrifying part of the flight."" By comparison, foam damage is a problem that affects re-entry.""If I was aboard that rocket,"" he added, ""I wouldn't be thinking at all about re-entry.""A storm on Saturday afternoon, in the 10-minute time window when the launching pad is in alignment with the space station, would force a postponement because of the potential for other kinds of damage.At the enormous speeds of launching, raindrops become bullets that can damage the shuttle's skin. NASA will not launch if there is rain on the launching pad or in the flight path, if lightning has been detected within 11.5 miles of the pad, or if winds are more than about 34 miles per hour. High anvil-shaped thunderclouds that are likely to produce lightning must be at least 20 miles away.If weather or a last-minute technical problem causes the space agency to put off the flight on Saturday, a second attempt will take place on Sunday. If the weather proves uncooperative on Sunday — and right now the weather for Sunday looks much like the weather for Saturday, with the same 60 percent chance of a scrub — then NASA will probably stand down until Tuesday.If problems persist, or if a new issue emerges that requires more study and repair, the current launching window will last until July 19, with the next opportunities coming between Aug. 28 and Sept. 14.In NASA's preflight review this month, some leading engineers argued against launching the current mission until areas of the fuel tank that still shed small amounts of foam could be redesigned.But Mr. Griffin overruled the engineers, saying he did not agree with their assertion that a foam incident was ""probable"" over the life of the program and that the result would be ""catastrophic.""He also said that the risk was to the vehicle and not the crew, who could wait aboard the space station for rescue if the shuttle was damaged during ascent, and that he wanted to leave time to complete the 17 missions planned before President Bush's deadline for ending the shuttle program in 2010.On Friday, Mr. Griffin defended that decision, contrasting the open discussion with the process that led up to the Columbia disaster, in which managers were found to have squelched dissent. This month's preflight review was a healthy exchange of ideas and decision-making about difficult issues, he said, adding, ""What you're seeing is a good process.""""I think sometimes people mistake the desire to hear all of the opinions with the ability to agree with all of the opinions,"" he said. ""Agreement is not offered. What is offered is a willingness and a desire to hear, and an obligation to speak.""After the Columbia disaster, NASA was widely accused of letting scheduling pressures override safety concerns. But Mr. Griffin said schedules could not be ignored.""This may be politically incorrect,"" he said, ""but there are no activities that humans undertake that don't have a schedule associated with them. It matters if you finish a job this year or in the next decade.""Trying to work in 17 flights before 2010, he said, was ""a schedule we can meet, but we need to get on with things."" And he added:""I do not think — I absolutely do not think and do not accept — that we are being unduly influenced by schedule pressure. But we pay attention to schedule because time is money, and that matters.""The technical problem that cropped up this morning involves a heater attached to a Vernier thruster toward the back of the shuttle’s left side.The Verniers are six small, quiet jets used for subtle, fine-tuned maneuvering during rendezvous with the space station and when the crew is sleeping, said Kyle Herring, a NASA spokesman.Although flight rules call for postponing liftoff if all of the heaters are not working, there is flexibility in applying the rules, he said, adding, ""Flight rules are guidelines to be followed, not deities to be worshipped.""NASA officials suggested that there might be ways to work around the problem. The shuttle pilots are trained to maneuver without the fine-tuning capabilities of the Verniers.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','Fertility doctors also encounter this anguish. Donation agencies typically list a donor's religion, but Jewish donors are scarce.""Not only won't they be able to pass on their genes, but many feel a loss that they won't be able to fulfill an obligation to their heritage,"" said Dr. Alan Copperman, a reproductive endocrinologist at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York.Rabbi Brander's synagogue gave him a yearlong sabbatical, which he took in Israel studying Jewish law regarding reproduction and the latest reproductive technologies in Israeli hospitals. He came home with answers for his congregants, and he said he soon started receiving dozens of calls from other rabbis around the country.Since then, many Jewish writing and rulings have emerged on these issues.The vast majority of rabbis view the practice of egg donation leniently. Jewish law has turned out to be supportive, largely based on the biblical charge to ""be fruitful and multiply.""""This is one of the Torah's prime directives, because it's the very first commandment given to Adam,"" said Dr. Miryam Wahrman, a professor of biology at William Paterson University of New Jersey who writes about bioethics and Judaism. ""It has led to the sanctioning of virtually any technique that can help couples have babies.""The answer to the question of who passes on Judaism, the birth mother or the egg donor, varies among branches of Judaism.In Reform Judaism, the point is moot. ""We determine who is Jewish much more by upbringing and commitment than by birth,"" said Rabbi Harry Danziger, president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. In 1983, with mixed marriages on the rise, the conference resolved that a child is presumed to be Jewish if one parent is Jewish, as long as the parents and child formally identify with Judaism.Conservative Judaism clarified its position in 1997, when the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly took up the question of surrogacy. ""The sole position is that the religious status of the child follows that of the gestational mother in cases involving surrogacy and in all other cases,"" said Rabbi Joel Meyers, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly. The assembly holds that children born to a non-Jewish surrogate would require conversion to be recognized as Jewish.In the Orthodox tradition, rabbis are split on the subject. They look to Halachic sources — the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish texts — and come to different conclusions.""It would seem from the Talmud that perhaps maternity is not just defined by the genetic gift, but by the nurturing process that happens within the fetal development,"" Rabbi Brander said. ""Others say no, it should be defined simply by the genetic gift.""Adding to the complexity is the concern of some rabbis that the use of anonymous donors could lead to unwitting marriage between family members.""Most Orthodox rabbis say using a Jewish donor egg is better, because then you don't have to worry about whether the donor is Jewish or not,"" said Rabbi Brander. ""Some say you should use a non-Jewish donor's egg, so there will never be a concern about this child marrying someone who might be related to them.""In practice, when the donor is not Jewish, most Orthodox rabbis perform a conversion on the infant, just in case. There is a longstanding tradition of infant conversion in cases of adoption.""On core matters of Jewish identity, there's no harm in an unneeded conversion,"" said Rabbi Michael Broyde, a judge with the Beth Din of America, the largest American Orthodox rabbinical court. ""It's good to clarify doubt by a simple mechanism.""These days, many more rabbis have studied reproductive technologies in the context of Jewish law, and, like Rabbi Brander, can offer comfort to their congregants.""We can tell them: 'Don't worry. You can embrace the gift of science, which is a gift from God, without having to worry about the issue of your child being Jewish,' "" Rabbi Brander said. ""And celebrate that Judaism can embrace this with enthusiasm.""'"
"'06-07-01,'0','Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for Ms. Kroes, said the commission intended to decide on the fines before the end of July. But he would not say whether this burst of activity would forestall any penalties.Even if Microsoft met its deadline and delivered the documentation, the commission could impose the fines anyway for not having delivered the protocols in the form the commission wanted by Dec. 15.Ms. Kroes accused Microsoft on Dec. 15 of having provided ""incomplete and inaccurate"" material. The independent trustee in the case called the material ""totally unfit"" for use by rival software makers, and a consulting firm for the commission agreed.After what Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel and lead lawyer on the European case, called a ""breakthrough"" hearing in Brussels in March, Microsoft says it finally knew what the commission wanted and it has been rushing to provide it. But Mr. Smith said he knew the commission might impose the daily fines anyway.Microsoft plans to hand over the last batch of computer codes sought by the commission on July 18. Mr. Smith said the deadline for delivering the communications protocols had been set with the commission's monitoring trustee, Neil Barrett, a British computer expert.""We pulled together people from across the company and took them off jobs to work on this project,"" Mr. Smith said by telephone from Redmond, Wash., this week. ""It is really something that has strained our resources to the limit.""Some people are literally spending 24 hours a day at the office,"" Mr. Smith added.The European Commission ruled in March 2004 that Microsoft had used its Windows operating system to dominate the market in software for servers, the computers that form the backbone of most office computer systems and the Internet.But Microsoft appealed the decision and the commission's record fine of 497.2 million euros. The European Court of First Instance is not expected to rule on the appeal until next year. But in December 2004, the same court ruled that Microsoft had to disclose the protocols before the appeal was decided.For the last 18 months, the commission and Microsoft have been at odds over the protocols. To break the impasse, the commission appointed Mr. Barrett, a London author and occasional Microsoft critic, as trustee in the dispute last October.Even then, Microsoft and the commission battled, until a closed hearing of Microsoft and commission staff lawyers on March 29-30 in Brussels, when the company changed tack, according to those involved. Thomas Pfenning, a German engineer who had worked on Microsoft protocols in Redmond, where Microsoft is based, since 1995, approached Mr. Barrett after the hearing. Mr. Barrett agreed to meet again with Microsoft in London.A week later, on April 6, three Microsoft engineers — Henry Sanders, a general manager for Windows networking; Bill Laing, general manager of the server division; and Iain McDonald, director of program management for Windows server products — flew to London and met with Mr. Barrett, two of his assistants and three representatives of the European Commission for two days.Both sides agreed on a format for the protocols and the timetable for delivering them, Mr. Sanders said. On his way to Heathrow Airport, Mr. McDonald gazed at the London Underground map and suggested naming stages of the project after stops on London's Circle Line.Microsoft has delivered the first five batches of protocols, code-named Tower, Liverpool, Moorgate, King's Cross and Baker.On Friday, it delivered Edgware Road. On July 18, the journey is to end at Paddington station.The protocols cover server software and elements of Microsoft's new desktop operating system, Vista, which will not be sold until 2007.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','Gooden, Jeffries and Wilcox are restricted free agents; their teams (Cleveland, Washington and Seattle) can keep them by matching another team's offer. N.B.A. rules also discourage stars from changing teams. The best players available can earn millions more by staying put.So chances are there will be no wild spending sprees or bidding wars. Five teams have substantial salary-cap space: Charlotte, Toronto, Chicago, Atlanta and the New Orleans Hornets. Utah, Houston and the Los Angeles Clippers also have some room.The period for negotiating with free agents opened at midnight. Teams and players can agree to deals but cannot sign them until July 12. Trades may not be consummated until then.Wallace was virtually anonymous when the Pistons acquired him from Orlando in the Grant Hill trade in 2000. He has since become the N.B.A.'s fiercest shot blocker and rebounder, a four-time defensive player of the year and a linchpin of the Pistons' 2004 championship team.""We have every intention of re-signing Ben,"" said Joe Dumars, the Pistons' president. ""I would love to see him finish his career in Detroit.""Although he is not a scorer, Wallace, who averaged 7.3 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.2 blocked shots a game last season, is the most intriguing free agent. He could turn an average team into a playoff team and a playoff team into a contender. His defection from Detroit — the Eastern Conference champion in 2004 and 2005 — could also cripple the Pistons' ability to remain among the elite teams.The Bulls and the Hornets are expected to aggressively pursue Wallace, and they have the cap space to offer a maximum deal, starting at more than $14 million.Under N.B.A. rules, the Pistons can offer higher annual raises (10.5 percent versus 8 percent) and an extra year (six years versus five years). But Detroit wants to avoid the luxury tax and is mindful of Wallace's age (32 in September). He also clashed with Coach Flip Saunders last season.Wallace's agent, Arn Tellem, said of the competition, ""It's always been Detroit's to lose.""Whoever loses out on Wallace will instead chase Przybilla, Portland's 7-1 center. After five ho-hum years in the N.B.A., he emerged as a defensive force last season, averaging 7 rebounds and 2.32 blocks a game.The most compelling story of the off-season will not involve a free agent. Allen Iverson, the league's Most Valuable Player in 2001 and one of the league's most bankable stars, is being shopped by Philadelphia.Boston has been the most aggressive suitor, but the Celtics need a third team to make a deal. The Sixers tried to involve Utah (Carlos Boozer would have landed in Philadelphia, and Wally Szczerbiak in Utah), but the deal fell apart. Boston acquired point guard Sebastian Telfair from Portland on draft night, and he could be moved again. The Celtics may have to part with one or both of their top prospects: power forward Al Jefferson and guard Gerald Green.Cleveland, which could use Gooden in a sign-and-trade arrangement, could also be lured into a three-way deal. Atlanta has shown interest in Iverson, but the Hawks' involvement is complicated by a legal battle over team ownership.The Denver Nuggets made a run at Iverson before the trading deadline in February and remain a possibility.The Nuggets could offer power forward Nenê in a sign-and-trade deal. They are also shopping the temperamental forward Kenyon Martin.Others expected to be offered in trades are Boozer; the Knicks' Steve Francis and Stephon Marbury; Milwaukee's Jamaal Magloire; Portland's Zach Randolph and Darius Miles; Seattle's Rashard Lewis; and Indiana's Jamaal Tinsley.The stars of the 2003 draft are eligible for contract extensions: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','""We're starting from scratch again,"" said Sam Yasgur, a Sullivan County lawyer whose father, Max, died in 1973 but still occupies an exalted place in counterculture history. ""For the county to become a destination like the Berkshires is going to require a major mentality shift.""The complex has also received $15 million in state funds, mostly for infrastructure. Anticipating growth, Bethel, which for years tried to forget the festival, has given $2.6 million for a new sewer system along Route 17B, the byway famously clogged with hippies in 1969.""It's the 21st-century equivalent of protecting the battlefields of the Civil War,"" Dennis Barrie, a consultant and founding director of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said of the site, which has had a contentious post-Woodstock history and which purists hoped would remain completely undeveloped.Mr. Gerry is an unlikely savior. He forbade his eldest daughter, Annalise, to go to Woodstock, but she went anyway, and ""disappeared for five days,"" he said. He was persuaded to buy the property by another daughter, Robyn, now 48, who missed out on the festival. A behind-the-scenes player, Mr. Gerry had a fortune tied to the county's mountainous terrain, about 100 miles north of Manhattan, where television reception was poor. Many in these parts still remember him as their television repairman. He now runs Granite Associates, which manages the family's assets. (The center is not a business investment, he said.)During the last decade Mr. Gerry quietly amassed property surrounding the Woodstock site, including a neighboring farm where the sleek concert pavilion is now. His architect, Paul E. Westlake Jr., is Mr. Gerry's third, after he dismissed Richard Meier, designer of the Getty Center in Los Angeles, for a concept that ""looked like a flying saucer,"" Mr. Gerry said. The interior of the Woodstock museum integrates local stone and wood beams in an attempt to recall the ad hoc, lashed-timber-and-canvas structures on the original concert site.Mr. Gerry is taking a resolute, build-it-and-they-will-come stance. The son of Russian immigrants named Gorowitz, he still lives in the hamlet of Ferndale and has doled out beautification grants to nearby towns for roadside flower baskets and what seems like the country's largest concentration of gazebos.""Families used to come from somewhere, and that's where they stayed,"" he said. ""I can't imagine finding success and then moving to a building in Manhattan with 300 strangers, like a bunch of little ants going home at night. Not that I don't love New York,"" he added.Sullivan County is a patchwork of shuttered diners, faded billboards and dilapidated summer bungalow colonies that commune with New Age retreats and organic farms.For years the economy revolved around what are now mostly defunct Jewish resorts like Grossinger's that nurtured comedians like Alan King and Milton Berle. ""We sat shiva for these hotels for 25 years,"" said John Conway, the county historian, referring to the traditional Jewish period of mourning. ""It kept us from getting on with our lives.""In recent years a stream of Manhattanites seeking reasonable prices and a low-key vibe have snapped up weekend homes. The moneyed Orvis crowd casts bamboo fly rods into the fabled trout pools of the Beaver Kill.The new Bethel Woods center is inspiring a mini-gold-rush. Judith Maidenbaum, a Manhattan psychoanalyst and a cafe owner in Kauneonga Lake in Sullivan County, recently paid $100,000 for a handsome Colonial-era house she intends to turn into a B&B, anticipating that the area might finally take off. ""No one knew Woodstock was going to be Woodstock,"" she said.But the Woodstock ethos remains deeply ingrained. Barbara Hahn, now 70, whose living room is a riot of Hummel figurines, sat with her Shih Tzu, Mickey, on her lap, and recalled being a nurse in the ""bad-trip tent."" With a grandmotherly demeanor, she recalled as if it were just yesterday how she lifted off from Grossinger's airstrip in an Army helicopter, bearing thousands of tetracycline tablets.""My first patient dove into shallow water and split his head open,"" she recalled. ""I asked, 'Are you still tripping?,' and he said, 'The trip is over.' ""The festival site has become a Graceland-style pilgrimage stop, its reverential gathering spot the 5½-ton monument erected by a local welder. Duke Devlin, the site's gray-bearded unofficial greeter, who came to the festival and never left the region, waggishly refers to the marker as ""the Tomb of the Unknown Hippie.""Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Tulane University, said the site would only grow in historical significance. ""It was where a generational wave gathered and broke,"" he said. ""It is the one spot a hundred years from now that will be identified with the 60's.""When Mr. Gerry's foundation bought the site in 1996, a small fraternity of preservationists rallied to protect it. The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it was ""nationally significant"" and asked that permanent construction not be placed within the natural amphitheater where the original concert was held.In deference to history, the museum will look out over the sacred slope. Mr. Barrie and the exhibition team are on the prowl for coveted artifacts, like the yellow legal pads on which the co-producer Michael Lang scribbled the original site layouts.Some purists argue that the complex should have been completely concealed. ""The big preservation issue is, 'What is the true site of Woodstock?' "" said Michael William Doyle, an associate professor of history at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., who consulted with one preservation group. ""Is it the staging area or the place where 400,000 to 500,000 troops massed all the way to the thruway?""The end result is ""bittersweet,"" he said.""The site has been kept true to its original purpose,"" he said, although it no longer replicates the exact visual experience of 1969. That would be impossible: the Woodstock festival became free when gate-crashers famously dismantled the chain-link fences; Mr. Gerry has miles of elegant split rail.Indeed, the litany of rules for Saturday's opening — no hibachis or coolers, no lawn chairs at pop-music concerts, only one ""factory-sealed"" plastic bottle of water per person — has sparked amused contempt among the aging flower children who still populate these hills, their drug of choice now Advil.""It's the antithesis of the original spirit,"" said Jeryl Abramson, who with her husband, Roy Howard, has hosted an alternative Woodstock gathering since 1996. ""Six-dollar water and no lawn chairs for the geriatrics!""Blue, 55, whose real name is Robin S. Hallock and who was featured in a 1969 Life magazine article wearing love beads and what she called ""three days of mascara,"" said, ""Woodstock was beautiful, pure, sacred and natural."" Now, she added: ""I picture limousines on one side and us old hippies on the other. It doesn't sound like much fun.""But Country Joe McDonald, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., and whose ""I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag"" was an antiwar anthem, said he thought it was ""wonderful"" that the site would again be used for outdoor music.""I got no dog with the guy who bought it, even if he is a capitalist pig,"" he said. ""It's not a sacred piece of land to me; the event is sacred. Woodstock happened. It will live on.""'"
"'06-07-01,'0','EVERYONE knows about how much iPods cost. But how much does it cost Apple to make them?Apple will not say, and that bothers Robert Renck, who runs the private research firm R. L. Renck & Company. Since January, Mr. Renck has been advising clients against owning Apple shares. His assessment came to light last week in a column by Herb Greenberg in The Wall Street Journal and on MarketWatch.com.Mr. Renck has a rare sell recommendation on Apple stock, mainly because of its ""penchant for secrecy."" The minimal financial disclosure by Apple makes it a ""have faith, trust me"" stock, he argues. Because Apple breaks out its profits by geographic location (as it has traditionally done), rather than by product line, analysts and investors can not properly assess the business, he said.Mr. Greenberg seems to agree. ""Apple is a very different company than it was several years ago,"" he wrote on his blog. ""The way it once disclosed segment information isn't necessarily relevant to the Apple of today"" (blogs.marketwatch.com/Greenberg).Geographic disclosure was adequate when pretty much all Apple sold were computers, Mr. Renck said. But the iPod has changed everything. Sales of Macintosh computers now trail those of iPod, which last year made up 46 percent of revenue. ""Apple clearly has its feet in two separate and distinct business models, namely computer manufacturing and software creation, and the consumer electronics industry,"" Mr. Renck said.Apple said it did not comment on analyst reports, but Mr. Greenberg noted that on a recent conference call with analysts, several of them asked Peter Oppenheimer, the chief financial officer, about the iPod's gross margin. To which he responded, ""Our competitors would just love to know what our specific gross margins are.""""And we just don't want to help them.""One poster on the Greenberg blog went so far as to praise Apple for making things tough on analysts. ""How about actually doing their job and analyze the company they are covering?"" the poster wrote. ""What a thought — actually doing some independent research without the companies giving them all the information on a platter. I applaud Apple for making the analysts work.""'"
"'06-07-01,'0','Referring to ""Treasures of the World's Cultures,"" its recent exhibition in Beijing, Mr. MacGregor wrote in The London Spectator: ""This is more than about generating tourism to Britain. How China understands the world around it will be a fundamental question for us in decades to come. Collections like the British Museum's have an important role to play.""This same show, which included everything from Egyptian mummies and Assyrian reliefs to Islamic astrolabes and Benin bronzes, was previously seen by 1.3 million people in Japan and 600,000 in South Korea. And along with the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum is planning further exhibitions in China showcasing world cultures, starting with ancient Egypt.Another priority region is Africa, where the museum is able to share its collection — and knowledge — of African art while helping to strengthen African museums. ""Hazina: Traditions, Trade and Transitions in Eastern Africa,"" a show at the Nairobi Gallery in Kenya through Sept. 30, is a good example of such a partnership. It draws on British and Kenyan collections, but has been organized by a curator from the National Museums of Kenya.For its Africa program, which also includes projects in Egypt, Mozambique, Sudan, Ethiopia, Mali and Ghana, the museum has in fact received some British government financing. But the main benefits should accrue to Africa: the program's declared aim is ""to work with museum colleagues in Africa to increase understanding of the rich diversity and cultural heritage of African countries and peoples.""The other face of the British Museum's cultural strategy is to organize shows in London that highlight world cultures. And here, reflecting a need for greater British understanding of today's convulsed world and this country's own increasingly multiethnic population, one emphasis is the Middle East.Last winter, ""Forgotten Empire: The World of Ancient Persia,"" an exhibition at the museum's Bloomsbury headquarters, was immensely successful. Yet equally as significant as the show's popularity was the fact that during a period of diplomatic strains between Iran and the West, the museum was able to borrow exceptional objects from museums in Tehran and other Iranian cities.Now, through Sept. 2, the British Museum will be host of ""Word Into Art: Artists of the Modern Middle East,"" a show focusing on traditional and modern forms of calligraphic art through some 80 artists whose work the museum has acquired over the last 25 years.""In the 1980's we went back to our founding principle of collecting everything,"" said Venetia Porter, the exhibition's curator. ""Over time, we found we had been collecting more past than present. In the Middle East, we stopped in the 1850's. This show is an example of how we can use our collections to look at today's world — politics and history — through art.""In this case, Ms. Porter explained, she chose to refer to the ""Middle East"" rather than the Islamic world because, while the calligraphic tradition is rooted in Islam's objection to the portrayal of living beings, the exhibition includes one Israeli artist, Michal Rovner, as well as some Arab Christians. And with a good number of the artists now living in the United States and Europe, some examples of figurative art are also on display.What is presented here through art is a far more varied and complex image of the Middle East than is normally offered through the news media. The first section, ""Sacred Script,"" looks at the contemporary practice of Koranic calligraphy, which, while inspired by faith, is often highly stylized. In the second section, ""Literature and Art,"" calligraphic interpretation of both ancient and modern Arab and Persian poetry is much freer.A third section, ""Deconstructing the Word,"" shows artists moving toward abstraction, with words and letters used with less concern for their meaning. In the final section, ""Identity, History and Politics,"" the artists do not hesitate to depict human beings in paintings, collages and photographs. Many of these works are inspired by conflict: the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's, the Lebanese civil war, the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and the Palestinian conflict.This show, then, is part of Mr. MacGregor's cultural diplomacy but directed at the museum's mainly first-world visitors. And in a way it represents a mission statement for him. ""We have included works that directly address the issues that exercise us all,"" he wrote earlier this month in The Guardian, ""political and religious turmoil, violence, displacement, exile, the struggle for liberties of all kinds.""Evidently, he believes that enlightenment is as relevant today as it was in 1753.'"
"'06-07-01,'0','A toll road across Pennsylvania, the planners informed Congress in 1939, would attract only 715 cars per day. The next year the Pennsylvania Turnpike opened. It was soon carrying 6,000 cars a day and more than paying for itself, but the federal bias against tolls persisted anyway.There were good political reasons for Eisenhower to insist that new Interstates be financed by federal gas taxes instead of tolls: drivers have always resented stopping at toll booths, and members of Congress have always enjoyed doling out money. To further win over critics worried about this new federal role, the program was justified on national security grounds (sound familiar?) and named the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.Drivers loved the freeways at first, but then the roads deteriorated and the lanes clogged. Engineers wanted to ease congestion by adding lanes, but they couldn't even afford to maintain the existing roads. The gas tax revenue shrank because of inflation and because Congress began earmarking it for thousands of pet projects: parks, promenades, museums, streetcars and bridges to nowhere.Some road enthusiasts — and their lobbyists — have never stopped dreaming of new federal money, which explains the applause for Young. But more pragmatic engineers know that Young will never get his $600 billion, and that much of it would be wasted anyhow. They also realize that there's no way to prevent traffic jams unless you charge drivers — like airplane passengers — a premium at busy times.The best way to help drivers is to abandon the Interstate model and adopt two reforms. One is for states to keep the taxes paid by their drivers instead of sending the money to Washington — an idea that has been endorsed by the conservative caucus in the House as a cure for their colleagues' earmarking mania.The other is to end the taboo against tolls. The highway of the future is the Pennsylvania Turnpike, only with electronic toll collectors instead of booths. By relying on drivers instead of Congress for money, road builders in congested places like Southern California and Houston have finally been adding lanes. By raising the tolls at peak times, they're making sure that traffic keeps moving even at rush hour.These changes are still tough to make politically because voters have gotten so used to the old toll-free Interstates. But once they see the cars speeding along in new lanes, their nostalgia tends to fade.The Interstate system was lovely in its youth, and on its birthday I suppose we should fondly recall those days when the concrete was new and the lanes were clear and the price seemed right. But there is no such thing as a freeway. After 50 years, it's time to pay the toll.'"

"'06-07-02,'0','From the age of eleven until I departed for the minor seminary, aged thirteen, to begin my education for the priesthood, I served Father Cooney's Mass at seven o'clock every weekday morning in what he called his ""old bit of a church,"" dedicated to Saint Augustine the missionary to the English. On Sundays the people stood three deep in the aisles; latecomers huddled out in the yard. To reduce the pressure he celebrated an extra Mass on the southern border of the parish in a disused army hut next to a pet cemetery, where dogs, cats, and horses were buried beneath headstones. Father Cooney would gaze bleakly out of the hut window, disparaging ""the pagan English customs over the way."" I served Mass at the Camp, as we called it, before cycling up to Saint Augustine's to assist as censer bearer at the sung High Mass. In the afternoon I returned to serve at Solemn Benediction, when Father Cooney led the singing of his favorite hymn:Lord, for tomorrow and its needs I do not pray.But Father Cooney was struggling to supply the needs of tomorrow in the form of a larger church. Holding up the offertory plates he would reproach us: ""Copper! Copper! Where's the silver!"" In the meantime he was watching the pennies. Around the church and the presbytery he wore a frayed, black-trying-to-be-green cassock. In winter he went shod in army boots; in summer, black canvas sneakers-what we called plimsolls-sometimes without socks. He chopped his own hair. When I stood close to him in the sanctuary on summer days, he smelled like a sack of fertilizer.At High Mass, the segment of charcoal cake, painstakingly excised with a razor blade, was minuscule, the incense grains sparse. When I swung the censer high to make the smoke billow, he would come suddenly out of his meditative mode. ""Not so briskly, child!"" he would hiss. When we buried parishioners in the Catholic section of the local cemetery, the charcoal was a morsel of white ash by the time we reached the graveside. It seemed to me strange, Father Cooney swinging a cold, smokeless censer at the coffin. At Low Mass he would ease a teardrop of wine into the chalice. The candles on the altar were dark, guttering stubs appropriated from Our Lady's votive rack. He would light them at the last moment, and snuff them with a singed pinch before he had even finished the words of the Last Gospel.He was a shy man. If we met outside church he would incline his head, silently acknowledging the bond between himself and his daily Mass server. Sometimes he made a peculiar noise, a substitute for saying anything definite: ""Wisswiss ... wisswiss."" When the children gathered around him in the school yard he would make a nuisance-fly gesture: ""Very good! So! ... wisswiss ... Run along now!"" Addressing women, young or middle-aged, he would stand sideways on to them, bleakly descrying objects of curious interest in the distance. But I have seen him comforting in his arms a widow wracked with grief at her husband's graveside.He was tireless in the service of the sick and the dying. I would see him out in all weathers on his rusty bicycle, visiting the inmates at the Claybury mental asylum and the bedridden at King George V Hospital. Careering unsteadily along the street, narrowly missed by buses and lorries, he gripped the handlebars with one hard-knuckled hand; the other would nurse the Sacrament within his breast pocket.He was self-effacing. When he dropped an object from his arthritic hands, he would whisper to himself, bending over painfully: ""Wisswiss ... Imbecile it is!"" If he caught the servers fooling around before High Mass, he would mutter: ""Boys will be boys as the hills are green far off!"" But he could get exasperated with our choir when they droned on beyond the Offertory. ""Orate, frates ... Enough of that!""My mother used to say that when you confessed your sins to Father Cooney it was ""like going on trial for your life."" Often he made me repeat my purpose of amendment: ""Say it again ... As if you meant it, now!"" But he always ended with the heartfelt murmur ""Be sure now and pray for me-the unworthy sinner.""On Sundays he would preach on the gospel of the day before straying to his weekly hobbyhorse, the News of the World, which ""desecrated the Sabbath by its very existence,"" lingering hissingly over that final sibilant. Then he would excoriate the barbershops which sold ""prophylactics,"" which I associated in my innocence with mysterious idols of a false religion. ""No dacent, upright Catholic gentleman,"" he would say, ""should give custom to such a one as does the Divil's business now!""Father Cooney recruited me as a candidate for the priesthood in this way. One Sunday evening I arrived at church early for Solemn Benediction. After vesting I looked into the sacristy. The room was silent, deserted. On the press stood the chalice in readiness for Mass the following morning. I had an urge to touch the receptacle. I went on tiptoe across the parquet flooring and grasped the embossed stem of the sacred cup. At that moment I heard a gasp. Looking back, I was seized with terror at the sight of Father Cooney perched on a stool behind the open sacristy door. He followed me with his eyes as I walked slowly past him, trembling, as if I had committed a profanity. He said not a word.The following day, after early morning Mass, Father Cooney asked me what I hoped to be when I grew up. I said confidently that I hoped to be a priest. Within a day it was settled that I should try my vocation at a minor seminary, a boarding college where young boys began their long training for the priesthood. When Father Cooney put my name forward to the bishop as a candidate for the priesthood I was approaching my thirteenth birthday. I was already a Johnny-come-lately: many boys of my generation had begun their priestly formation at the age of eleven.On the appointed day, my mother took me to an interview with the Right Reverend Bishop George Andrew Beck of Brentwood. She was dressed in her purple coat with padded shoulders, which she kept for special occasions; it was smart but her dress showed a few inches below the hem. I was dressed in my elder brother's navy blue jacket, temporarily stitched up at the sleeves. We sat at the front of the upper deck of the London Transport bus because Mum thought it a treat to have a view of the scenery on a journey. Riding northward from the bus stop outside Trebor's mint factory, we passed Hill's car showroom, festooned with bunting snapping in the spring breeze. Then we crossed the river Roding, with its smell of the sewage plant, and passed under the Central Line railway bridge on our way to the towering Majestic cinema. In all that journey, I reflected, there was not a single sacred image to be seen. That was how I had begun to think.Bishop Beck's diocese took in the county of Essex with its new towns and the poor districts of London's East End, but he lived in the prosperous suburb of Woodford Green. The bishop's house was set back from the road amidst clipped shrubberies. A gleaming black limousine stood on the gravel drive. Monsignor Shannon, the vicar general, greeted us at the door. He was a stout man in a black suit, a cigarette perched between his fingers. He had a flushed face as if he had just climbed out of a steaming bath. He spoke to us softly, advising us to address the bishop as ""My Lord."" He ushered us into a room where the bishop sat at a desk with his back to French windows. He got up and held out his ringed hand for us to kiss.He was a lean, dark-haired, exhausted-looking man with a sallow face. He was watching me intently through half horn-rimmed spectacles. I sat bolt upright on a straight-backed ornate chair trying to look alert and decent. He spoke for a while about Father Cooney's recommendation. Looking up at the ceiling, he said: ""How lucky you are to have Father Cooney as your parish priest."" Then he asked my mother if she would mind waiting outside.He handed me a piece of paper and a pencil and dictated a passage from Saint John's gospel, which I did well. Then he wanted to know how many bedrooms we had in our house, and about the sleeping arrangements. I said that my three brothers and I, and sometimes my father too, slept in one room, sharing three single beds. He asked if my father and elder brother went to church, and I said that Dad never went to church, even at Christmas. He wanted to know how I liked my school. I said I liked it well enough. I had no inclination to tell him of the fights in the school yard and the impure larks in the evil-smelling latrines.""If you are to be a priest one day,"" he said eventually, ""you will have to study hard to be an educated man. Ordination alters your entire soul ... You must become a holy man.""He asked how I felt about going away to a boarding school, the minor seminary. ""You might be homesick,"" he said. ""What do you think about that?""I tried not to betray my anxiety. I was afraid that I might say something that would make him withdraw the suggestion. ""I would like that very much,"" I whispered.Then he called my mother back, and it was my turn to go out into the hallway, where Monsignor Shannon was at the ready with a biscuit and a glass of milk.When Mum emerged, accompanied by the bishop, I could tell from her expression, a pious look she wore in church after taking Communion, that everything had been agreeably settled. The bishop explained that since our diocese was poor it had no minor or senior seminaries of its own. He would have me lodged in a seminary owned by one of the larger, more prosperous dioceses of England. ""It will be a long way from home,"" he said, with a warning look.I tried to appear intrepid.On the bus, I surveyed the godless landscape, rejoicing inwardly that I was soon destined to depart for a very different world, where there would be constant visible reminders of the Mother of God and the kingdom of heaven. Eventually Mum patted me on the arm and said she was proud of me. When we reached home, the house that went with my father's job on the sports ground, she looked down at me with her lustrous gray eyes. ""I just wonder whether it's really you,"" she said. ""But we'll see ... I should be so proud! And as your saintly grandmother used to say: Gain a priest-never lose a son.""Later Dad came in from the sports ground wearing his overalls. Dad and Mum had not been speaking to each other for some days. He had not been consulted about my visit to the bishop or its purpose. He appeared less pleased than Mum as she reported the proceedings of the morning. He was blinking frequently, as he often did when he was puzzled or nervous. He said: ""Are you sure, son?""I had not the capacity to consider what it meant for Dad to be informed, without reference to his opinion, that I would leave home that autumn to begin my education for the priesthood. I did not consider his feelings or his opinion of any significance. I was filled with a sense of glowing ripeness and anticipation.My mother, Kathleen, whose maiden name was Egan, was desperate on learning in the autumn of 1939, days after Britain declared war on Germany, that she was pregnant again. She was twenty-five years of age. It would be her third child under three and the family was destitute. In those days the family lived in East Ham, a working-class district close to the London docks north of the river Thames. According to Mum's stories, Dad was out all day seeking casual labor by the hour on the wharves. He had a withered, unbending left leg and was always among the last to be hired.If she had another baby, how should she manage? And to bring another child into a world at war! Mum began to pray day and night that she would lose the baby. Then she grew anxious. Was it a mortal sin for a pregnant mother to pray for a miscarriage? She went to see her parish priest of those days, Father Heenan.

A specialist in time trials, Zabriskie started the last Tour de France by winning a long one and becoming the race leader until he crashed days later during a team time trial.Another rider from the United States, Floyd Landis, the leader of the Swiss team Phonak, was ninth in the field, nine seconds behind the winner. He lost about five seconds before he started because he noticed a slit in his rear tire. Landis summoned a mechanic to replace the wheel, then set off down the starting ramp.The Tour was originally scheduled to include 22 teams and 198 riders but, because of a doping scandal in Madrid, the Communidad Valenciana team lost its invitation. The Astana-Würth team withdrew because it could not meet the minimum requirement of six riders after five of its nine were suspended.As a disciplinary move, the team directors agreed that no suspended rider could be replaced in the Tour.""All that is just sad for cycling, but it is good that they are cleaning up,"" Hushovd told The A.P. ""I hope the public will support us as they always have at the Tour de France.""Two riders who were considered favorites to win this year's Tour were among those suspended: Jan Ullrich of Germany, the Tour champion in 1997, a five-time runner-up and last year's third-place finisher; and Ivan Basso of Italy, who was second last year and won the Giro d'Italia, the sport's No. 2 multiday race, in May.Two other top riders — Francisco Mancebo of Spain and Alexander Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, who finished fourth and fifth at last year's Tour — are also gone. Mancebo was suspended by his team, and Vinokourov lost out when Astana withdrew Friday.Vinokourov, who finished third in the 2003 Tour, has not been implicated in the doping scandal that ended his team's chances. But under the Tour's rules, he could not switch to another team less than 72 hours before the start.""This is the first year I'm going to try and see what I can do,"" Hincapie told The A.P. ""I know I've trained hard; I don't know how far I can go. But I'm ready and I started the Tour well, and I just hope I can continue to improve.""'"
"'06-07-02,'0','Israeli troops have been in southern Gaza for several days, and are positioned for a large-scale ground invasion, though the troops have not yet been sent into heavily populated parts of Gaza. Israel has been carrying out frequent air raids against Palestinian government offices, including bombing the empty Interior Ministry building on Friday morning. Roads, bridges and an electrical power station have been attacked, and power has been cut or greatly reduced to many parts of the territory. The power shortages have required the use of generators, which in turn has led to a shortage of fuel.In attacking the prime minister's office, Israel signaled that it was prepared to take action against the most senior figures in Hamas. On Thursday, Israeli troops in the West Bank arrested eight Hamas members who serve in the Palestinian cabinet and more than 20 Hamas legislators.Israel has sought to pressure Palestinian leaders with similar tactics in the past. It bombed the empty Gaza headquarters of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and kept him confined to his West Bank compound for three years until he died in November 2004.On Saturday a Palestinian official offered the most specific information yet on the condition of Corporal Shalit, saying he suffered three wounds when he was seized last Sunday, but had been treated by a Palestinian doctor and was in stable condition.The official, Ziad Abu Ein, the deputy minister for prisoners for Palestinians, spoke at a news conference in Ramallah in the West Bank.""He has three wounds, I guess shrapnel wounds,"" Mr. Abu Ein said of Corporal Shalit, whose capture by Palestinian militants last Sunday spawned the current crisis. ""He is fine now.""Mr. Abu Ein said his information came from people involved in talks on the possible release of the soldier.Releasing Corporal Shalit is ""the key"" to ending the crisis in Gaza, President Bush said Saturday in a telephone call with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, the White House National Security Council spokesman, Frederick Jones, told Reuters.On Saturday, Palestinian militants holding the soldier demanded the release of 1,000 prisoners of various nationalities, and Israel rejected that call. In the past, Israel has traded large numbers of prisoners to win the release of captured Israelis, but the government said Saturday that it would not negotiate with the Palestinians. ""Our serviceman must be released immediately and unconditionally,"" said Mark Regev, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry.Israel holds thousands of Palestinians in its jails. Many are on trial or have been convicted of involvement in violence, though some are being detained without charge.The Palestinian demand was made in a statement issued by the three groups that claimed responsibility for capturing the soldier, including the armed wing of Hamas, the group that leads the Palestinian government. The militants said that Israel's ""political leadership is still under the influence of their military and security commanders, who know nothing but the language of invasion, destruction and killing.""Mr. Abu Ein did not say when Corporal Shalit was treated or where he was being held. Israeli television, citing Israeli officials, reported Friday that he had been wounded in the abdomen and the arm and was believed to be in or near Rafah, on the Gaza Strip's southern border with Egypt. Egypt has been in contact with the Palestinians in an attempt to resolve the crisis, though there were no signs of progress on Saturday.Mahmoud Abbas, president of the Palestinian Authority, was optimistic. ""Things have not reached an impasse and efforts continue to find a solution that is acceptable to all parties,"" he told reporters in Gaza City.In southern Gaza, a new contingent of Israeli tanks and other armored vehicles entered the territory east of the town of Khan Yunis on Saturday and came under fire from Palestinians, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian witnesses.Military officials said the Israeli forces were conducting a ""specific operation"" and were not expected to remain in the area for long. For the past few days, the Israelis have had a much larger force positioned at an airport that has not been used for years and is several miles to the south, near Rafah. There has been sporadic shooting, but no major clashes. The Israelis also have an armored force just outside the northeastern border of Gaza and have carried out airstrikes and heavy shelling in northern Gaza. The Palestinians have been firing rockets into Israel.'"
"'06-07-02,'0','THE sign outside Nancy Pelosi's office bears the mark of her feminist roots: it identifies her as ""Ms. Pelosi,"" using the honorific created half a century ago to give women an alternative to disclosing their marital status.But mostly Mrs. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, goes by just that — Mrs. Pelosi.Across the Capitol, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, is referred to as Mrs. Clinton at every roll call. Yet the women in the Senate are split: seven use Mrs., but the other six go by Ms., including three who are married: Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine; Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana; and Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan.Outside politics, such titles are mostly meaningless these days, rendered irrelevant by the increasing casualness of society in a time when couples merge their last names. Like clothing and hairstyles, the title an elected woman adopts is arguably just another superficial measure of extra scrutiny that male lawmakers do not have to contend with.But among the many strange formalities of politics is a set of titles that demand gender distinctions (think of ""Madam Secretary"" when Madeleine K. Albright first got the job of secretary of state) and in some cases imply marital status. And that leaves women a choice, one that can raise some political questions. Is a traditional Mrs. more appealing? Or could she irritate a liberal feminist constituency in the process? In a job that requires name recognition, should a woman risk changing her name?""It's one of those decisions women get to make, unlike some of our other decisions that they are visibly working to take away from us,"" Representative Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, a Mrs. and liberal Democrat, noted dryly.'"

Federal Reserve policy makers on Thursday raised short-term rates for a 17th consecutive time. But a statement released after their meeting said that further rate increases depended ""on the outlook for inflation and economic growth,"" signaling, perhaps, that the central bank might not increase rates again at its next meeting.The market gave up some ground on Friday, however, with technology companies falling particularly hard, after Apple Computer said that it was reviewing stock options grants made between 1997 and 2001. One of the grants had been made to Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, the company said.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 161.13 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 11,150.22. The S.& P. 500 gained 25.70 points, or 2.1 percent, to close at 1,270.20. The Nasdaq composite index rose 50.62 points, or 2.4 percent, to close at 2,172.09.

So far, the state has allocated $240 million for the project.The sports center, at 133rd Street and Convent Avenue, was completed in 1993 and has served athletes from City College, A. Philip Randolph Campus High School and the neighborhood. Oluchi Emerenini, a biology major and a sprinter and long jumper at City College, who was working out at the track on Wednesday night, is one of the students who stand to lose out.""Where are we supposed to practice?"" Ms. Emerenini said. ""We can't compete with other people if we don't have a place to practice.""But soon the field will vanish, and the teams must find a new one.Maurice Collins, the principal of the high school, said that he learned of the demolition plans only this spring, when City College officials addressed Community Board 9, and that by then it was a ""fait accompli.""In response, Mary Lou Edmondson, a City College spokeswoman, said, ""We went back to the planners many times to figure out how to accommodate the research center and save the field."" But, she added, they could not.'"
"'06-07-02,'0','MOTHERS are famous for badgering their offspring about the importance of good posture, with admonitions like ""Don't slouch"" or ""Do you want to have rounded shoulders?""Enforcing decent posture habits on dogs is trickier. Even the cleverest breeds don't respond to human critiques of their shoulder position, no matter how eloquently or vehemently phrased. Proper carriage has to be encouraged through alternate means — for example, by serving meals atop the Ultra Bowl Booster from Wetnoz International, a pet supply company based in Austin, Tex.Intended to save dogs the trouble of stooping for their kibble, the Booster holds dishes several inches aloft; it's specifically proportioned to cradle the company's signature steel bowls, which resemble the pod-shaped chairs popular in the 1960's.Mark Kimbrough, the company's founder, says the Booster helps to ease mealtime awkwardness for large dogs, who must dip their heads a sizable distance to reach earthbound bowls.""Then, if you think about geriatric dogs, they have difficulty with mobility,"" he said. ""To be able to raise the bowl and have it easily accessible is very advantageous for them.""The Ultra Bowl Booster is hardly the only dog dish stand on the market. But when Mr. Kimbrough began researching the options in early 2003, he said, he noticed that virtually all such stands were clunky and ugly, and made from thick pieces of wood or wrought-iron bars. The high-end market would be receptive, he thought, to a posture-correcting stand that blended into a home's interior design. ""More often than not, when the doorbell rings, you kind of hurry around and pick up all the dog bowls off the floor and kind of shove them into the closet,"" he said. ""We wanted something that you could leave on display.""'"

"'06-07-02,'0','Hurricanes aren't the only thing vacationers have to worry about this summer. After a malaria outbreak last month on Great Exuma Island in the Bahamas, travelers are being advised to take precautions against the mosquito-borne threat.At least 16 people have tested positive for the potentially fatal disease since the first case was reported early last month, according to an update issued by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, which is maintaining close contact with the Bahamas Ministry of Health regarding the outbreak. Most of the people who were infected were Bahamas residents; one was a United States citizen who traveled there in May. The Bahamas has responded with intense surveillance and mosquito control measures on Great Exuma, above, including repeated spraying of the airport area.Although malaria is not considered endemic on the islands of the Bahamas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, www.cdc.gov/travel, is temporarily recommending that travelers to Great Exuma take prophylactic chloroquine, an antimalarial medication, as a preventative measure. For the best protection, travelers should continue taking the drug the recommended four weeks or so after leaving the area where there is a risk of malaria. Because antimalarial drugs do not give 100 percent protection, travelers are also advised to use mosquito repellents containing 30 to 50 percent DEET. Symptoms of malaria resemble those of the flu, and can include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and fatigue.So far no cases of malaria have been reported beyond Exuma and there are no health advisories for Nassau, New Providence Island, Grand Bahama Island, Abaco, Bimini or Eleuthera. Except for most of Haiti and parts of the Dominican Republic, there is no risk of malaria on other Caribbean islands. Since October 2004, there have been several reported cases of malaria in tourist areas of the Dominican Republic including La Altagracia Province in the eastern region, which has beach resorts, the most recent consular information sheet on the country issued by the State Department reported.'"

"'06-07-02,'0','But penalty kicks are the great equalizer, rewarding teams like Portugal, which yesterday showed no initiative for great chunks of time. Luiz Felipe Scolari, who has won 12 straight World Cup matches, could not have known that his lads would pull it out this way. He also coached the Brazilian team that sent England home in the quarterfinals four years ago in Japan.This time, Cristiano Ronaldo, the 21-year-old pretty boy, flicked the winner under the roof of the goal. That came after he was shoved by Rooney, his Manchester United teammate, during Rooney's temper tantrum.He had been questionable for this match after being on the receiving end of the worst foul of that hideous previous match when the Netherlands' hit man, Khalid Boulahrouz, a k a the Cannibal, dived into him early with both cleats flying, damaging his thigh.But Ronaldo recovered and quietly helped put Portugal where it had not been since losing to England in the semifinals in 1966, the year of Eusébio. The Portuguese have qualified only two other times for the World Cup, and once, in 2002, they were actually defeated by the United States, which by itself makes this reversal four years later so amazing.People had wondered if England would be affected by the heat, around 85 degrees, but the authorities decided to close the canvaslike flaps over the stadium. The roof kept out the heat but trapped the smoke and other fetid air, perhaps contributing to the game of few chances.• The match, however, was well officiated by Horacio Elizondo of Argentina, who met many Portuguese flops with a stern glare and an upraised palm or just plain ignored their quivering bodies, soon to recover.But Elizondo was paying attention when Rooney, the pugnacious face of English football, changed the dynamics in the match by losing his cool, shoving and cursing. Outside, it was more of the same, with English fans drinking and milling around all over this coal and steel town.The swarm of English fans without tickets to the match calls into question the wisdom of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, and the German hosts to hold alternate fan fests in the same town as a match. It's bad enough to have many thousands of English fans with tickets, but to encourage a virtual army to come to town seems to invite trouble, unless the purpose is to sell beer.But now England is out, and a nation that has never won the championship is still alive. Those who enjoy dark horses have dreamed of success by Trinidad and Tobago or Ghana or Serbia and Montenegro, or a repeat by the spunky South Koreans, who reached the semifinals at home four years ago.I have a new affinity for outsiders, since the American news media have been gravely downgraded to lumpen status at the press centers once our lads were sent home in the minimum three matches. We are being seated in the top row of the stadium, where the cigarette smoke gathers, and not getting desks to work on. But this is the pecking order of world football.The concept delighted a British soldier, based in Germany, whom I met on the train here yesterday. When I told him that the Yank reporters were being sent to Upper Slobovia, he was delighted. ""So you're a third-world nation, are you?"" he said.At a tournament dominated by the big boys, all pitiful wretches from the lower depths, like American soccer types, can now latch on to Portugal as the patron saint of the marginal.'"

"'06-07-03,'1','But G.M.'s board, which held an emergency session last week, has only said it would take the situation ""under advisement.""The idea of a French company being a savior to an American icon prompted expressions of wonder in both countries.La Tribune, a French business daily, noted that Renault's past efforts to invade the American market ended in costly fiascoes, but that with General Motors now ""a shadow of itself,"" an alliance could give Renault another chance to establish itself in North America.The Free Press observed in an editorial that while the thought that a ""100 percent American outfit, red-blooded, blue collar and rock solid,"" might end up being run by a foreign executive ""doesn't sit right for this quintessential American business,"" it may be the best thing for G.M. ""even if it's not good for the U.S.A.""Mr. Ghosn, a Frenchman who was born in Brazil, has experience in the American industry, as the chairman and chief executive of Michelin North America from 1990 to 1996, before he joined Renault.People with knowledge of G.M.'s thinking said the company was not likely to act on the proposal until after the July 4th holiday. G.M.'s operations and those of other automobile companies in the United States are shut this week for annual summer vacations.G.M.'s stock, which rose sharply on Friday, rose again in early trading today but by midday had retreated again, falling 32 cents to $29.47 a share. Renault and Nissan shares rose.If a broad alliance among the three companies were formed — something that is not yet being discussed — the combined total production of 15 million vehicles a year would account for one-quarter of the global market. Toyota has about 14 percent.A three-way alliance would bring with it Mr. Ghosn, who was sent to Japan by Renault seven years ago to turn Nissan around.By slashing costs, restoring morale and rolling out a run of new designs, Mr. Ghosn transformed Nissan into a highly profitable company and made himself a household name, not just in Japan but in the global automobile industry as well.With the Nissan overhaul complete, Mr. Ghosn returned to France last year to undertake a less-extensive turnaround effort at Renault.Adam Jonas, the European automotive analyst at Morgan Stanley, said Mr. Ghosn probably would ""require absolute control"" of G.M.'s operations.""The risk is that we lose Carlos Ghosn to Detroit,"" Mr. Jonas said during a webcast held by the brokerage firm.Although G.M.'s board gave Mr. Wagoner a vote of confidence this spring when the company's financial crisis was at its nadir, Jonathan Steinmetz, Morgan Stanley's auto analyst in New York, said the directors would have adifficult time disregarding Mr. Ghosn, given his success at Nissan.Although many industry observers contend that the probability of a wide-ranging alliance is fairly low, Mr. Steinmetz said he thinks some kind of partnership will come out of Mr. Kerkorian's proposal.""It's not just kite-flying"" by Mr. Kerkorian, he said.People with knowledge of the two foreign companies' thinking said last week that Renault and Nissan could link their engineering, design and manufacturing operations with G.M., which lost $10.6 billion in 2005.G.M., for its part, plans to close all or parts of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs through 2008.As of last week, there had been no discussion of the role that Mr. Ghosn would play or the future of Mr. Wagoner, these people said.Mr. Ghosn has said in the past that he would consider expanding the Renault-Nissan alliance to other automakers. Renault owns 44 percent of Nissan's shares, and Nissan in turn owns 15 percent of Renault's.Though G.M. makes and sells more vehicles, the company's total market valued is much lower than either Renault or Nissan because of its financial problems.Based on closing share prices Friday, investors valued G.M. at about $17 billion, Renault at $31 billion and Nissan, the most profitable of the three, at $49 billion.Since the end of March 1999, shortly after Renault and Nissan reached preliminary agreement on their alliance, Renault shares have tripled in dollar terms, and Nissan shares have done almost as well. General Motors shares fell 60 percent over the period, and its main American rival, Ford, fared even worse.Renault's bond rating is at the lower end of investment grade, and Egan Jones, a bond rating agency warned that while a deal with G.M. ""might be a long-term positive,"" it would ""place substantial pressure on credit quality.""Moody's, which rates General Motors debt at B3, well below investment grade, said an arrangement with Renault and Nissan ""could have positive credit implications for G.M.,"" although no immediate rating change was likely. Moody's warned that it ""could prove difficult to achieve a common view on the product and marketing strategies of the many vehicle brands involved in such an alliance.""'"

"'06-07-03,'1','TOKYO, July 3 — The board of Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker, voted today to explore a proposal to create a new global auto giant by forming a three-way alliance with General Motors and with Nissan's controlling shareholder, Renault of France.Renault's board is scheduled to meet today in Paris discuss the same proposal, put forward by a group of dissident G.M. shareholders led by the billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian.Together, the three companies would produce about 15 million vehicles per year, accounting for one-quarter of the global market, almost twice the production of Toyota, the second largest carmaker.Such an alliance could also put the charismatic chief executive of Renault and Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, in charge of fixing the huge but struggling General Motors. Mr. Ghosn won global renown when he was sent by Renault seven years ago to turn around Nissan. By slashing costs, restoring morale and rolling out eye-catching new designs, he brought Nissan back from the brink of oblivion, made it profitable and earned one of the most respected names in the industry, not to mention a promotion to run Renault.However, G.M. would present Mr. Ghosn with a different set of challenges, including reining in spiraling pension and health costs for retired employees and regaining market share from aggressive Asian rivals.'"

"'06-07-03,'1','""Getting knocked out was a situation we hadn't prepared for,"" Parreira said.If the Brazilian team was not prepared for defeat, the Brazilian news media certainly were.Parreira and midfielder Ronaldinho, who had an inconsequential tournament though he is considered the world's best player, were assigned the brunt of the blame. Parreira was criticized for abandoning Brazil's engaging style, known as the beautiful game, and for relying on a more cautious, defensive posture reflecting modern soccer.It seemed not to matter that Parreira had brought Brazil a World Cup title in 1994 in the United States. O Globo, a leading Rio daily, described Parreira's current style as ""football without fun, without life, without joy, without personality, without the Brazilian way of playing.""The newspaper Folha de São Paulo called Parreira a ""complete disaster."" One of its columnists wrote that ""anyone who refuses to play the beautiful game deserves every punishment.""Ronaldinho was blistered for his seeming indifference. He was featured in commercials and on magazine covers around the world but failed to meet expectations, not unlike the buildup and disappointment for the skier Bode Miller of the United States at the Winter Olympics in Turin.Estado de São Paulo ran a headline that said, ""Ronaldinho was the big letdown of the Cup."" The article said he ""played badly, he didn't dribble, he didn't have a shot at goal, he misplaced passes and did not, at any moment, take responsibility.""Saturday's defeat, the paper said of Ronaldinho, ""was a portrait of his participation in the World Cup: apathetic, bureaucratic, mediocre and afraid of deciding.""The criticism seemed to resonate with Brazil's fans here. Marcello Sader, 34, who waited in the train station Sunday with his brother Elias, said: ""We didn't have anyone in the middle to get the ball to Ronaldo. That was a big failure.""Cafu and Roberto Carlos, Brazil's aging outside backs, also came under heavy criticism.Ronaldo, overweight and lacking mobility, did not assert himself at forward until the final minutes. Later, Brazil's players, numbed by defeat, made no excuses. ""We lost because we didn't impose our style of play,"" the midfielder Kaká said.Ronaldo said, ""France was the better team.""Emerson, another midfielder, said, ""I'm sad because we made a lot of people cry, including my family.""Some Brazilian supporters apparently did more than cry. According to Agence France-Presse, Nilda Amorim, 61, of Rio was rushed to the hospital just after Saturday's match.""She's in an oxygen tent,"" a friend of Amorim's told the news agency. ""She couldn't handle the tension of the last minutes.""Brazil could not tie the score in a frenetic finish after Thierry Henry of France volleyed in a free kick from Zidane in the 57th minute.Zidane, the 34-year-old French midfielder, maintained his calm in that frantic stretch. He has postponed retirement plans for at least one more match. He retired from the national team in 2004 but returned last year.Saturday, he skewered Brazil with his sharp passing and theatrical dribbling, just as he did eight years earlier with two goals in a 3-0 victory over Brazil in the final of the 1998 World Cup.""Zidane was the magician in the game,"" Pelé said. Franz Beckenbauer, Germany's soccer icon, said simply that Zidane was ""one of the greatest players in history.""Michel Platini, the former French star, told Agence France-Presse: ""Technically, I think he is the king of what's fundamental in the game — control and passing. I don't think anyone can match him when it comes to controlling or receiving the ball.""The French press, which has been warring with Zidane after calling him too old to be effective, gushed with enthusiasm Sunday, even after Zidane refused to speak with reporters at a postmatch news conference.La Provence called Zidane a ""master without equal."" In terms of aggressiveness and ""beautiful gestures,"" the paper said, ""he was more Brazilian than the Brazilians.""'"
"'06-07-03,'1','But Mr. Coburn's plan, hailed by conservatives, is also sponsored by a Democrat, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, and applauded by liberal groups that support activist government. The result is a showcase of clashing assumptions and the oddest of coalitions, uniting Phyllis Schlafly, a prominent critic of gay rights, with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.Liberal groups, while also praising openness, are hoping for a new appreciation of what government does, like providing clean water and feeding the hungry. ""We need to remind people where Uncle Sam helps us each day,"" said Gary Bass, director of OMB Watch, a liberal group that got its start monitoring the White House Office of Management and Budget.The House unanimously passed a version of the proposal in late June, though in a form that has drawn outside criticism. The House bill creates a database that would omit contracts, which typically go to businesses, but would include about $300 billion in grants, which usually go to nonprofit groups.""Contracts are awarded in a much more competitive environment,"" said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, a Virginia Republican who was a sponsor of the bill. That makes them more self-policing, he said. Mr. Davis, whose district includes many government contractors, said grants ""are more susceptible to abuse.""But liberal critics see a revival of what they call old partisan efforts to ""de-fund the left,"" by reducing grants to liberal groups or adding conditions that limit their activities.Mr. Coburn joined them in criticizing the House omission of contracts. Including them in the database, he said, is ""the only way you're going to bust these indecent relationships of former Pentagon employees working for defense contractors and getting sweetheart deals from buddies inside.""When told of Mr. Coburn's statement, Mr. Davis said, ""As usual, I think he's headline grabbing."" While Mr. Davis supports more openness in contracting, he said including contracts would ""gum up the works"" legislatively since more Congressional committees would be involved.Spending hawks have sought a spending database for years. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington group, tried to build one itself, but search-engine technology now makes the task easier.On the right, support for the plan reflects an old concern about spending and a new faith in the power of blogs. Supporters picture a citizen army of e-watchdogs, greatly increasing the influence of antispending groups in Washington.""Now that you've got the Internet, you'll have tens of thousands of watchdogs,"" said Bridgett G. Wagner of the Heritage Foundation, who is leading a coalition of conservative groups that support the Coburn bill. ""That's what people see in it.""Among the bill's leading supporters is Mark Tapscott, the editorial page editor of The Washington Examiner, who has promoted it there and on his blog, Tapscott's Copy Desk. While most spending is already a matter of public record, Mr. Tapscott argues that it is often buried in obscure documents.""The spending cannot be sufficiently scrubbed,"" Mr. Tapscott said. Whether the database causes spending to rise or fall (he guesses it will fall), ""what's important to me is the principle of the public's right to know,"" Mr. Tapscott said.A number of blogs popular among conservatives have praised Mr. Coburn's bill. Instapundit, among the most popular, has pushed it. Seeker Blog called it ""the best news I've heard out of D.C. this year."" Captain's Quarters demanded ""Give us the Pork Database,"" and Porkopolis hailed the measure with the slogan, ""Show Me the Money.""While the bill has few overt critics, it may encounter resistance from Congressional insiders who have used their influence to secure projects back home. When Mr. Coburn tried to attach the measure to a lobbying reform bill this spring, Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican known for his zeal in aiding his state, killed it on procedural grounds.Not everyone is convinced more sunshine will matter. ""All this information is out there right now"" and being mined by watchdog groups, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. While it was ""certainly appropriate"" to build a database, he said: ""I don't think it would dramatically change public perception of the appropriate size and scope of government. That's a much deeper issue.""One important challenge involves tracking subcontractors. Money awarded, for example, to Lockheed, to build a military plane, might get divided among hundreds of parts suppliers. The database, Mr. Coburn said, would seek to list them all.The push for openness runs counter to the trend of increased secrecy among government officials who cite the need to protect national security. Criticizing that trend, Mr. Tapscott said, ""people in the Pentagon, like bureaucrats everywhere, overclassify too much because of the basic instinct to protect yourself.""But Mr. Coburn said he was comfortable with the overall level of secrecy. His database would adhere to current disclosure rules, he said.What if sunlight so cleanses the government that the public wants more of it? Grover Norquist, an antitax advocate who supports the House bill, just laughed. ""They might say, 'Oh my goodness, look at all the good work that's being done,' "" he said. ""But I'm willing to take that chance.""'"
"'06-07-03,'1','BETHEL, N.Y., July 2 — The Turks built mosques over churches. The Italians built churches over Roman temples. America has sacred sites of its own, and over one is rising the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts.Elegantly appointed and landscaped, with commanding views of inviting countryside, and far removed from the mud, chaos, euphoria and chemical wooziness for which its location is remembered, Bethel Woods will serve as a slicked-down, spruced-up memorial to a place as biblically significant to rock 'n' roll as Noah's Flood or Exodus: the Woodstock Festival of 1969.Summer programs began at Bethel Woods Saturday night and with an uprightness that Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and those VW busloads of worshipful zealots 37 years ago might not have understood. This was ""Woodstock for the Capri-pants set,"" as a companion described it.Ghosts of the past may have lingered over the evening, but in the flesh it was the New York Philharmonic, there to give this send-off class. Gershwin, Broadway and popular classics, along with jokes and patter by the evening's conductor, Bramwell Tovey, were received by upscale patrons in the 4,800-seat covered pavilion and by larger, more casual crowds of picnickers and lawn sitters to the rear. The festival press release says it has room for 12,000 of the latter and also that this opening night was sold out.The singer Audra McDonald had the burden of star power shifted fully on her back when the fellow celebrity Lang Lang reported in the day before saying he was feeling ill and could not play the piano. Vanishing star-pianists (Lang Lang was replaced by young Alexander Kobrin) were not the only potential obstacles to this opening.'"

Premiums for beneficiaries are 38 percent lower than expected and taxpayers are expected to save $30 billion over the next five years, according to official government estimates.A recent Consumers Union study found that these same strategies will help save beneficiaries between $380 and $800 per drug per year and may ""delay or eliminate altogether"" the coverage gap.With a record like this in just six months, it's not surprising that survey after survey finds that seniors are saving on their prescription drugs, strongly approve of the program and recommend that other seniors sign up.

"'06-07-04,'0','WASHINGTON, July 3 (Dow Jones/AP) — The Federal Communications Commission has ruled that issuers of prepaid calling cards must pay connection fees and help subsidize phone service in rural areas.AT&T Inc. will have to repay the $553 million in access fees — charges paid to other carriers to connect calls — and Universal Service Fund payments that its predecessor, then known as the AT&T Corporation, had withheld on phone calling cards.AT&T had argued that because its cards offered enhancements like advertising, the cards were information services exempt from fees that apply to telecommunications services.In February 2005, the commission ruled against AT&T, potentially leaving the company on the hook for the withheld payments. AT&T had challenged the decision in court.""We are pleased the commission clarified the regulatory status of prepaid calling cards,"" an AT&T spokesman said in a statement.The commission also said that providers of prepaid calling cards cannot reduce payments by classifying certain calls as Internet traffic.Regulators said that calling cards that use ""Internet in the middle"" technology must make rural phone-subsidy contributions and pay access fees.'"
"'06-07-04,'0','Sorenstam's victory comes in a year in which her dominance has been threatened by challengers of all ages. After winning 10 times in 2005, she had one win this year heading into the Open. When she tapped in for an easy par on the final hole, she kissed her putter before lifting her eyes skyward.""To come here this week with not such a great season and then to win, I think, is pretty ironic,"" Sorenstam said.She later added: ""I enjoy what I do, whether or not I've won a few tournaments in the last few months. When you push yourself so hard and you reach such a level to reach that next step, sometimes you might have to go backwards to get forward.""That might sound funny, but I think that's just the way it is.""Sorenstam's childhood coach from Sweden, Henri Reis, has been traveling with her, and the two spent chunks of the championship week working on her grip. After a handful of shots, Sorenstam said, she began to hit the ball more squarely.The impression had grown that Sorenstam was slipping, with her longtime rivals, Karrie Webb and Se Ri Pak, each scooping up a major this year, and with 16-year-old Michelle Wie grabbing headlines.""In Sweden, they expect even more,"" Reis said, referring to Sorenstam's fans. ""They expect her to win every tournament.""During the playoff, Reis walked alongside Sorenstam's boyfriend, Mike McGee, a golf agent and the son of Jerry McGee, a longtime touring professional. They watched as Sorenstam put pressure on Hurst early and kept pounding fairways and greens while Hurst misfired.Sorenstam took a two-shot lead on the first hole when she rolled in a 6-footer for birdie and Hurst began with a bogey, three-putting from 60 feet on the fringe. After Sorenstam birdied the third hole, she led by three shots. Hurst made a double bogey on No. 6 after driving into a bunker, and at the turn, Sorenstam's lead was up to five.They had matched each other through a 36-hole marathon Sunday, but Hurst could not keep up in the playoff as her putts kept falling short. ""I'm generally an aggressive putter,"" Hurst said. ""When you can't get them to the hole, obviously, you can't make anything. That's where I felt it put me behind the eight ball, not making any putts out there.""On the par-4 12th hole, Sorenstam curled in a 12-foot birdie putt after Hurst missed a 15-footer along the same line. The lead was six.Hurst had a final flourish when she made a birdie from 60 feet on the final green. But the stage belonged to Sorenstam, who finished with two putts and regained her footing in a sport with many new faces.All week, Sorenstam had heard the fans' encouragement, she said. Even Tiger Woods, who is sometimes her practice partner, left her messages. ""He's been calling me every day,"" she said.As the gallery began to leave, Sorenstam stayed a little longer, kissing her trophy, posing for photographs and breaking into her shy smile. She said she did not know where she stood among the game's greats, only that she had exceeded her every dream.In the happy commotion of the day, Sorenstam also made a promise to Hurst about that autographed golf ball.""Of course I'm going to give her one,"" Sorenstam said. ""But I said: 'You can ask for anything any time. You don't have to wait until the 18th hole of the U.S. Open.' ""'"

"'06-07-04,'0','LONDON, July 3 — The energy company BP said Monday that its oil and gas output fell for the fourth consecutive quarter and that a refinery explosion in Texas last year would cost it $500 million more than it had anticipated.In a trading update, BP said that production in the second quarter fell by 2.5 percent, to 4.01 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, largely because of changes to its Venezuelan operations. BP is struggling to increase its output as Venezuela enforces its demand for a majority share in operations by foreign companies and as a storm-damaged platform in the Gulf of Mexico takes months to repair.BP said the quarterly production drop was mainly the result of divestments, primarily its obligation to shift its assets in Venezuela to a state-controlled joint venture.The company said the new $500 million charge, related to a Texas City refinery explosion last year in which 15 workers died, was in addition to a $700 million charge announced last year.Shares of BP rose despite the negative news, closing up 1.2 percent, to 638 pence ($11.75) on the London Stock Exchange.Last week in the United States, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Justice Department accused BP of manipulating the price of propane in 2004, causing consumer heating costs to soar.

The commission, which acts as the main competition authority for the 25 countries in the European Union, told Microsoft in December that it had failed to comply with the March 2004 ruling.Since then, the commission has said that the company could be fined up to two million euros (about $2.6 million) a day.""We have differing views regarding compliance, but we are hoping that despite this, we can get to a point where we can move on from here,"" Brad Smith, the legal counsel for Microsoft, said in a telephone interview.The commission refused to comment on the closed meeting Monday with the national regulators.People tracking the meeting said there had been some debate about whether to push ahead with a new fine now, as Microsoft prepared to submit information that it hoped would meet the requirements of the 2004 ruling.'"

The company said it intends to cooperate fully with the agency. It also said it requested an extension for filing its annual financial report with the S.E.C. to July 17.Delta Petroleum, based in Denver, said the S.E.C. had asked the company to cooperate with its staff in an inquiry into possible stock options backdating, and said it would do so.The company received a subpoena in June from United States prosecutors seeking records on stock options dating back to 1996.'"
"'06-07-04,'0','One year later, counterterrorism police officers are investigating 70 cases ""spanning London, the U.K. and the globe,"" said Peter Clarke, the chief of London's antiterrorism police, in a public statement on Monday in advance of the commemoration on Friday. ""That is the nature of what we face. The defense of the capital often starts many thousands of miles away.""The theme was echoed in Parliament when Tom Watson, a junior defense minister, told lawmakers that the battle in Afghanistan was intended to ensure that it never again became a haven for Al Qaeda or the Taliban. ""The risks are too great to us, our allies and the Afghan people for us to stand aside and allow the terrorists to return,"" he said.Earlier, Brig. Ed Butler, the commander of Britain's 3,000 troops in southern Afghanistan deployed as part of a NATO force, told the BBC that his force levels were under review and that he was seeking additional equipment to take account of the ""changing circumstances.""But Mr. Watson denied that British commanders in Afghanistan had asked for extra infantry or air cover.British troops have been moving into Helmand Province since May on what was first depicted as a mission to protect reconstruction projects. But there has been a steady flow of accounts detailing sustained, close-quarters fighting with insurgents linked to the Taliban. ""We knew it was going to be a tough fight,"" Brigadier Butler said. ""The Afghan has fighting in his blood.""After a flurry of news reports saying Britain would send up to 1,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan to cope with a more intense Taliban campaign than expected, the office of Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday, ""If extra resources are needed, extra resources will be found, but that's first and foremost a matter for military assessment and for military commanders to decide, not for politicians to decide.""Discussion of the fighting has stirred fears that the British mission there may be transformed into out-and-out combat, recalling Britain's ill-fated imperial adventures in Afghanistan in the 19th century. ""The cost of succeeding in Afghanistan may be very high indeed,"" Liam Fox, the opposition Conservative spokesman on defense, told Parliament. ""But the cost of failure would be intolerable.""British military commanders have denied that British troops have been drawn into what Maj. Gen. Peter Wall, deputy chief of joint operations, last week called ""mission creep."" But, he acknowledged, ""I do think that we should have expected a reaction from the Taliban — perhaps it has been a little more virulent than we had hoped.""With the July 7 anniversary approaching, the police and lawmakers have taken to warning that the threat of terror attacks has not been reduced. Mr. Clarke, the London counterterrorism chief, said three, and possibly four, attack plans had been thwarted in the past year. ""There are some 60 individuals awaiting trial in the U.K. for terrorist-related offenses,"" he said. ""This is unprecedented, and the flow of new cases shows no sign of abating. If anything it is accelerating.""Such arguments have been used by the police and the government to support their demand to increase the period allowed for detention without charge. It had earlier been increased from 14 days.A report published Monday by Parliament's influential Home Affairs Committee revived the argument. ""The growing number of cases and the increase in suspects monitored by the police and security services make it entirely possible, and perhaps increasingly likely, that there will be cases that do provide that justification,"" it said. ""We believe, therefore, that the 28-day limit may well prove inadequate.""Indeed, Mr. Clarke said, the counterterrorism officer, the police need to ""intervene at earlier stages — to attack the fund-raising, to disrupt the logistics, to detect hostile reconnaissance — because when we get to the point of attack the options are too limited and too dangerous.""'"

"'06-07-04,'0','Of those that have closed, 13 are textile factories that have relocated, most to Egypt, but some to Jordan, Mr. Masri added.Elsewhere in Gaza, more than 20 other Palestinian companies are considering or are in the process of moving to Arab countries as far away as Morocco and Algeria, he and other Palestinian business leaders said.Palestinians say Israel closes Karni in part as punishment when there are heightened tensions. Israel closed all of the Gaza crossings after two of its soldiers were killed and a third, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, was seized and taken to Gaza on June 25.Karni reopened Sunday to allow in badly needed supplies, like fuel, food and medicine. No Palestinian exports were allowed out, and the crossing was closed in both directions on Monday.Israel says the decision is based on the threat of Palestinian attacks on Karni and other Gaza crossing points, which have been hit frequently.""We know it would be best if Karni could be kept open all the time,"" said Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the Israeli government agency that handles issues related to Gaza. ""The Palestinians always complain when it is closed, but they haven't done their part. We often give them information about a possible attack, but they do not take any action.""Some business executives acknowledge that the election victory in January by the Palestinian militant group Hamas and internal feuding have also prompted their decisions to seek out a more stable place to do business, though they say they would much prefer to stay put and build Gaza.""The Gaza Strip is full of thugs these days,"" said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political science professor at Al Azhar University who recently organized a conference on the Gaza economy, where business leaders aired their grievances. ""As a Palestinian I'm ashamed to say that, but it is part of the problem.""Nabil al-Bowab's family is one of the largest clothing manufacturers in Gaza. It had four factories in the industrial zone near Karni, where 1,200 workers made garments for markets in Israel, Europe and the United States. But he faced mounting problems meeting deadlines set by his foreign partners.In March he closed three factories and laid off 900 workers, moving to Cairo with his brother to set up another factory. ""When the Israeli government made things too difficult, I had to look elsewhere,"" said Mr. Bowab, 45.While other Gazan manufacturers — like the Bilal family, another major Gaza clothing manufacturer — are pressing ahead in Egypt, Mr. Bowab decided the business climate there was less than welcoming. ""In Gaza you need two hours to set up a business,"" he said. ""In Egypt you need at least two years.""He has returned to Gaza for now, but his operations are limping along at a fraction of their former output, with two factories operating at partial capacity. His factories are lined with finished shirts and pants in plastic wrapping. But his Israeli partners often refuse to accept them if they do not arrive on time.When the Karni crossing is open the backlog is huge, and the Israelis conduct rigorous security checks. That means a shipment may sit on the Palestinian side for days and not make it out before Karni is closed again.""The Israeli government is trying to punish Hamas, but they are punishing all of the Palestinian people,"" Mr. Bowab said. ""I support the peace process. I do business with Israelis and have Israeli friends. Why should I suffer?""When Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip last year, the Gazans imagined a range of business projects, but so far none have prospered.One promising venture was to take over the greenhouses left by departing settlers and grow produce for Israel and Europe. The Palestinians planted strawberries, sweet peppers, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers shortly after the Israelis left in September, and planned to harvest 17,000 tons, worth $20 million, during the first half of this year.They came close to reaching their production goals, but with Karni frequently closed, only 10 percent of the produce was exported, bringing in just $2 million. Most of the remainder rotted or was used as animal feed, said Ayed Abu Ramadan, the executive manager of the Palestine Economic Development Company, which runs the greenhouses.""We'll plant again this September,"" he said. ""But our investors are getting hesitant, and our reputation was damaged because we were not able to deliver during the last season.""Another plan was to crush the rubble from the 1,500 homes of Jewish settlers torn down by the Israeli military before it left and use it to pave roads. The Palestinians plan to move all of the rubble to one former settlement, but not a single truckload has yet been removed.Palestinian squatters moved into the first settlement selected, said Khaled Abdel Shafi, a Palestinian who runs the United Nations Development Program in Gaza, which is handling the rubble removal project. A second site was claimed by militants for a training ground.A third location, the former settlement of Rafiah Yam, was selected, and the cleanup operation was to start on Saturday. But after Corporal Shalit was seized, a large Israeli military contingent rumbled into southern Gaza, making it a no-go zone until the crisis passes.""We have the plans and we have the donors for many important projects,"" Mr. Abdel Shafi said. ""But so far the results have been disastrous.""'"

Mr. Enders oversees the military side of EADS, which makes helicopters and missiles, rather than the commercial aviation side.That was a condition of the main German shareholder of EADS, DaimlerChrysler (the major French shareholders are the Lagardère Group and the French state). DaimlerChrysler had hoped to eliminate the two-headed management, but agreed to leave that for another day. ""This was a pragmatic solution,"" said a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, Hartmut Schick.Mr. Streiff, though he has long experience at the French industrial conglomerate Saint-Gobain, has no background in aerospace. Part of his appeal to DaimlerChrysler is that his company has supplied components to its Mercedes-Benz car unit, and he has ties to executives there.""There's an odd contradiction,"" said Nick Cunningham, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London. ""Gallois is clearly good news, but how is he supposed to sort out Airbus if it's not reporting to him?""Mr. Cunningham added that ""none of these guys walk on water, and the problems at Airbus run pretty deep.""Further complicating matters, EADS is in negotiations to buy out its minority partner in Airbus, BAE Systems, for 2.75 billion euros ($3.5 billion) as BAE turns its focus to the lucrative American military market. That valuation, calculated by the investment bank Rothschild, surprised analysts as being low, and it has sowed uneasiness about the value of EADS as a whole.Shares of the company plunged in trading in Paris on Monday before recovering much of the loss later in the day.Whatever their reservations, analysts said the shake-up was crucial to stabilizing EADS. Reports that Mr. Forgeard sold shares in EADS before the announcement of the A380 delay eroded the confidence of investors, though Mr. Forgeard said there was no link between the events.Removing Mr. Forgeard was ""just an essential move to make,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ""The perception was that Forgeard was not acting in the interests of shareholders.""The turmoil overshadowed a landmark victory for EADS. Last week, it won its first direct contract from the Pentagon, to supply up to 352 light utility helicopters. The contract could be worth $3 billion.Several analysts view the buyout of BAE Systems as a chance for EADS to gain control over a wayward child. Once Airbus becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of EADS, the company will be able to exercise more control over its operations. Among the disputes surrounding the delay of the A380 was how long it took Airbus to inform the EADS board.""We will certainly be able get into the day-to-day operational business of Airbus"" after the buyout, said Christian Poppe, the head of communications at EADS in Munich. ""The control will be more intensive.""By all accounts, Airbus needs a firm hand on the tiller. The company, which is based in Toulouse, France, must solve a wiring problem in the A380 that has thrown back its production schedule by six months. Customers are furious; at least one has threatened to cancel orders for the 555-seat plane.Airbus is also scrambling to revamp the design for its new midsize plane in time to introduce it at the Farnborough Air Show in England in mid-July. The plane — which has been known as the A350 but may now take the name A370 — was overhauled from nose to tail after Airbus customers like Singapore Airlines said it did not measure up to Boeing's rival 787.These multiple demands are stretching engineers at Airbus. Rewiring the A380 is a particularly painstaking task. The wires are bundled into ""harnesses"" that run the length of the aircraft. With airlines demanding customized electronic features, the wiring varies from plane to plane.""It's clear that many things are going on at the same time,"" a spokeswoman for Airbus, Barbara Kracht, said. ""But I wouldn't say this wiring issue and the definition of the A350 are the same.""She said that Airbus had not heard about any looming cancellations of A380 orders from customers. The chief commercial officer of Airbus, John J. Leahy, was on the road meeting with airlines on Monday.The next few weeks will be critical to determining whether Boeing can exploit the delays in the A380. Boeing is promoting the 747-8, a stretch version of its jumbo jet, as an alternative to the A380. The plane has attracted little interest from airlines, except in a freighter version.""If someone like Cathay Pacific were to come on board, that would be extremely bad news for the A380,"" Mr. Aboulafia said.'"
"'06-07-04,'0','MINNEAPOLIS — For fans who prefer that their heroes remain predictable, Jean Nouvel has been a bit of a puzzle lately.Two decades ago he established his reputation with the Institute of the Arab World in Paris, whose southern facade, an enormous grid of filigreed steel apertures, suggested inscrutable camera lenses. In the ensuing years this architect could generally be counted on for big, bold forms; a fetishistic obsession with technology; and a magician's bag of optical tricks.His most recent projects, however, like the phallic, candy-colored Agbar Tower in Barcelona and the anarchic mix at the Musée du Quai Branly in Paris, have drifted toward the wildly eccentric, as if Mr. Nouvel, now 60, were more interested in letting his imagination roam unfettered than in impressing critics and academics.The new Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis should offer comfort to those who miss the 1980's Nouvel. Rising at the edge of the Mississippi, its confident forms are rooted in a vision of a muscular industrial America, and its structural bravura will certainly please the techno-fetishists. As a thoughtful response to the American city's evolving role as a haven for cultural tourism, it also coaxes new meaning out of a haggard landscape.The site is a Modernist heaven on a former industrial strip along the riverfront. Just next to the complex is a grain elevator, similar to those that Le Corbusier once lauded as the American equivalent of the Parthenon, the ""magnificent first fruits of a new age."" An electric generating plant looms across the river; to the north, water rushes through a series of locks beneath an industrial bridge.Like so many cities, of course, Minneapolis has gradually undergone an economic transformation. Most of the city's old flour mills were shut down long ago. The concrete grain elevator alongside the theater complex has been preserved as a historic monument, and a nearby row of warehouses has been converted into co-ops. Mr. Nouvel's design takes its initial cues from the city's early history. The complex's scale fits nicely with the structure next door. The boxy, piled-up forms echo the electric power plant across the street, anchoring the theater in the city's early industrial ethos rather than in the shopping centers and office towers downtown.'"
"'06-07-04,'0','The 1999 movie ""Beowulf,"" starring Christopher Lambert, similarly gave the story a science-fiction twist, on the theory, presumably, that Grendel and his mum are so weird that they must have come from another galaxy.There are also two animated versions: a 1998 short with Derek Jacobi as the voice of the narrator, and Joseph Fiennes as Beowulf, and coming next year a full-length $70 million ""Beowulf,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, with a screenplay by Neil Gaiman, using the same computer technology as ""Polar Express."" The cast includes Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar and an inspired choice for Grendel's mother, that terrifying embodiment of the maternal instinct gone amok, Angelina Jolie.An action movie of sorts, ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" directed by Sturla Gunnarsson and starring Gerard Butler, Stellan Skarsgard, Ingvar Sigurdsson and Sarah Polley, opens in New York on Friday. And an operatic version is coming to Lincoln Center later this month: ""Grendel,"" directed by Julie Taymor, with a score by her companion, Elliot Goldenthal, and a libretto by J. D. McClatchy that is a sort of spinoff of a spinoff, based on John Gardner's 1971 novel of the same title.Some of the recent popularity of ""Beowulf"" surely derives from Seamus Heaney's splendid translation into contemporary English, which became a surprising best seller in 2000, but even more compelling, to filmmakers at least, is the box office success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies, which have ""Beowulf"" embedded in their DNA. J. R. R. Tolkien, the author of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, taught Old English at Oxford and was one of the first scholars to pay attention to ""Beowulf"" for its genuine literary merit and not just because it was a way station in the development of our language. In his own writing he borrowed freely from the poem, most obviously for the character of Smaug, the cunning dragon.Most of the subsequent ""Beowulf"" adapters have flinched a little, however, from what in the poem is the sheer malignance of Grendel and his mother, explained there by the belief that they are descendants of Cain. The Gardner novel, the inspiration for the opera, is told from Grendel's point of view and turns him into the hero of the story: an existential quester trying to sort out his own identity. And in the Gunnarsson movie the great monster is just misunderstood, the victim of what amounts to racial prejudice.At first Grendel is a blond little moppet, a sort of miniature Bigfoot, who would be perfectly presentable if someone would just shave his beard and wax his excessively hairy legs. Nor is there any hint of an unhealthy relationship with Mom. The great trauma of Grendel's life is the ethnic-cleansing murder of his father by Hrothgar, and it is simply misplaced revenge or the lack of a good therapist — and not all-purpose malevolence — that prompts the grown-up monster's raids on the mead hall. He has no beef at all with Beowulf and his Geats. Beowulf, for his part, begins to have doubts about why he is in a foreign country, doing another king's dirty work, in the first place. This, Mr. Gunnarsson, a native of Iceland, has said is because he intended the movie partly as a veiled commentary on American involvement in Iraq. In other words, the movie is, of all things, a politically correct ""Beowulf,"" though it has some spectacular scenery and is historically accurate in at least one respect, reminding us that not the least of the hardships suffered by those early Norse warriors was the lack of shampoo.It's tempting to say that every age gets the ""Beowulf"" it deserves, or one that suggests what's most on people's minds: the kooky sci-fi version; the brooding, existential one; the sensitive anti-epic. What the original audience for ""Beowulf"" had on its mind was terror. They listened to the poem in circumstances much like the ones it describes, huddled together around a fire and fretting about what lurked outside in the darkness, and they knew something that some of the modern adapters may have lost sight of: that in the right circumstances it's extremely pleasant to be scared out of your wits. Far more entertaining than a lonely troll with grief issues, or one working through identity questions, is the thing from the night who (to adapt Mr. Heaney) bites into your bone lappings, bolts down your blood and gorges on you in lumps.'"
"'06-07-04,'0','Being laid off from work is always stressful and can even cause physical problems. Now, new research suggests that when the layoff occurs near retirement age, the effects on health can be much greater.Researchers from Yale who studied people who lost their jobs after age 50 found that they had twice the risk of stroke and heart attack as people their age who were still working.The researchers, led by Dr. William T. Gallo, followed the health of almost 600 people for 10 years after they were laid off.""The true costs of late career unemployment exceed financial deprivation, and include substantial health consequences,"" the researchers wrote in the June issue of the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine.Apart from the loss of income, the study said, layoffs near retirement can disrupt longstanding social networks. And someone laid off after age 50 is also likely to have more trouble finding another job than a younger worker.'"

The official had no additional details.Yonhap news agency said the missile was medium-range, and Japan's Kyodo News agency reported that it landed six minutes after launch.The launchings came in defiance of warnings from President Bush and the governments of Japan, South Korea and China.

"'06-07-05,'0','Noting that the missile firings were timed to coincide with Independence Day in America, Masuhisa Kobayashi, chief strategist in the Tokyo office of Barclays, said, ""The United States government is clearly being provoked, and all eyes are now on its response.""Many Asian markets started the trading day off sharply, but rebounded as the trading day wore on and investors appeared to conclude that a military confrontation was not imminent. For example, the South Korean benchmark index, known as the Kospi, was off by as much as 2.1 percent in early trading, but retraced more than three-quarters of the loss before the close.While most of the North Korea missiles appeared to fall harmlessly into the sea, the test launch of so many weapons at once was widely seen here as an act of defiance by the isolated Communist regime, especially after repeated public warnings from the United States, Japan, China and other nations not to go through with a missile test.Japan immediately responded by announcing fresh economic sanctions against Pyongyang, including the turning back of a North Korean ferry as it tried to enter a Japanese port on Wednesday. Tokyo also asked the United Nations Security Council to discuss the tests.Economic sanctions would probably have little direct effect on regional trade and investment because North Korea's economy is already tiny and impoverished, with very limited economic contacts with the outside world. Economists estimate the country's gross domestic product at just $40 billion, only a bit more than the amount the billionaire investor Warren Buffet pledged to charity last week.The larger danger for now would seem to be any chilling of investor and consumer sentiment, analysts said. The timing is unfortunate for Japan, whose $4.6 trillion economy is finally showing signs of returning to normal after a decade-long funk.A series of reports of strong economic statistics have many people here believing that the Bank of Japan will raise its short-term interest rates to 0.25 percent from effectively zero, perhaps as soon as next week. But an extended crisis over the missile tests may lead it to delay action, analysts warned.""This isn't as bad as Sept. 11, but it could hurt sentiment,"" Mr. Kobayashi said. ""The Bank of Japan may have to keep rates low to cushion any impact.""In Japanese stock markets, some of the biggest decliners today were automobile and electronics manufacturers, whose sales are vulnerable to swings in consumer confidence. Honda Motor fell 2.2 percent; Toyota Motor and Matsushita Electric Industrial, maker of Panasonic, also slipped.Among the few gainers were Japanese weapons makers, who could see sales rise if regional tensions do. Howa Machinery, a maker of military firearms, jumped 6.3 percent. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, a producer of fighter planes and missiles, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, a building of warships, posted smaller gains.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Noting that a North Korean intercontinental missile ""tumbled into the sea"" after a short flight, he quickly said that fact ""doesn't, frankly, diminish my desire to solve this problem.""When he was asked what diplomatic steps could be taken to further isolated a country that is already one of the most insular in the world, Mr. Bush replied somewhat indirectly, saying that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the plight of ordinary North Koreans, who have been suffering from shortages of basic necessities for years, even as its leadership spends heavily to maintain a sizable army.Mr. Bush said the ""international community"" must continue to pressure Kim Jong Il, the North Korean dictator, to renounce his missile ambitions. ""There is a better way forward for his people,"" Mr. Bush said.His remarks followed a flurry of diplomatic activity and reaction in Washington, at the United Nations in New York and abroad over the latest sword-rattling by North Korea, a small barrage of launchings that began before dawn today in defiance of warnings from President Bush and the governments of Japan, South Korea and China.In New York, Kenzo Oshima, the United Nations ambassador from Japan, which requested the Security Council session, said after a preliminary round of talks, ""We hope that the response of the council is swift, strong and resolute.""There were hints, however, that harshly punitive measures would be resisted by China and Russia.Japan and South Korea imposed some economic penalties on North Korea today, and Mr. Oshima said that the council would be considering possible sanctions.The White House spokesman, Tony Snow, said that intelligence reports were indicating that North Korea may fire a few more short- or medium-range missiles in the next few days.One of the seven missiles fired over the Sea of Japan today was the intercontinental missile that had been at the center of recent tensions with North Korea, known as the Taepodong 2. American spy satellites have been watching the missile for more than a month as it was set up and fueled on a remote launching pad.The multistage missile is designed to be capable of reaching Alaska, and perhaps the West Coast of the United States, but American officials who tracked its launching said it fell into the Sea of Japan before its first stage burned out.""The Taepodong obviously was a failure — that tells you something about capabilities,"" Stephen Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, told reporters on a conference call Tuesday evening in Washington.But other officials warned that even a failed launching was of some use to the North Koreans, as their engineers diagnose what went wrong and learn how to improve the liquid-fueled rocket.Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said today that the international condemnation of the missile firings shows that North Korea ""perhaps miscalculated"" and should ""change its behavior.""""Whatever they thought they were doing, they got a very strong response from the international community,"" Ms. Rice said.The secretary, who appeared at a question-answer session in Washington with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, said ""a number of tools"" are available to get the North Koreans to stop engaging in the ""brinksmanship"" that it has long embraced.Some analysts have speculated that North Korea could have conducted the launchings as a way of increasing pressure on the United States to agree to bilateral negotiations in place of the long-stalled six-nation talks on its nuclear program.But Mr. Snow today said that ""this is not a U.S.-North Korea issue, and we are not going to permit the leader of the North Korea to transform it into that.""The two countries most immediately threatened by North Korean missiles, Japan and South Korea, both reacted strongly today to news of the test firings. Officials in Tokyo announced that they were suspending charter flights between Japan and North Korea, and halting for six months the once-a-week ferry service that is the only scheduled direct passenger and trade link between the two countries. In Seoul, officials said that they would withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer that the North had sought this year.Both countries, however, emphasized that they were not giving up on diplomatic efforts. ""Nothing can be solved without dialogue,"" said Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. ""Both dialogue and pressure are necessary.""China, North Korea's closest ally, issued a statement expressing ""serious concern"" over the launchings. But the statement also called on all sides to ""maintain calm and restraint,"" and to avoid moves that would ""add to tensions and further complicate the situation.""Wang Guangya, China's ambassador to the United Nations, called the test-firings regrettable. He noted that the Security Council had responded to an earlier round of North Korean missile tests with a statement of concern.In the past, China has resisted moves to impose United Nations sanctions on North Korea, but Mr. Oshima suggested that old positions could change because the new situation was ""far more serious.""The American ambassador to the United Nations, John R. Bolton, said after the morning session that ""no member defended what the North Koreans have done.""""There is support for sending a clear signal to Pyongyang,"" he said, referring to the North Korean capital.Mr. Bolton, who sometimes spoke disdainfully of the United Nations before becoming Washington's envoy to the organization, said today that the ""North Korean provocation"" was ""precisely what the Security Council is designed to handle, and we hope the council will rise to the occasion.""European officials also sharply condemned the launchings, but acknowledged that the options for punishing North Korea were limited.A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, Mikhail Kamynin, said on NTV television that the missile launchings ""complicate the situation surrounding the Korean nuclear program,"" according to news agencies.One of the missiles reportedly landed in the sea about 155 miles from the Russian port city of Vladivostok.In Brussels, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization went further, urging North Korea to return to the negotiating table but also calling for consequences.""North Korea's missile proliferation and provocative actions necessitate a firm response from the international community,"" a NATO statement said, calling the launching tests ""a serious threat to the region and the international community at large.""In Germany and France, officials condemned what they called a ""provocative step"" by Pyongyang.The missiles have been the source of considerable diplomatic tension in recent weeks, because of North Korea's declarations that it already possesses nuclear weapons. American intelligence agencies have told President Bush they believe the North has produced enough atomic material for six or more weapons, but it is unclear whether they have actually used it to make nuclear devices.In any case, the country is not believed to have developed a warhead small enough to fit atop one of its missiles, and it has never conducted a nuclear test, to the knowledge of American officials.The other missiles that the North fired today appeared to be a mix of short-range Scud-C missiles and intermediate-range Rodong missiles, of the kind that the North has sold to Iran, Pakistan and other nations. Those missiles also landed in the Sea of Japan.None of the launchings was announced in advance. But the first came just minutes after the space shuttle Discovery lifted off in Florida — an event the North Koreans could monitor on television.Administration officials said they could only speculate about whether the missile launching had been timed to coincide with the shuttle launching or with Independence Day, but outside analysts had little doubt.""It's very in-your-face to do it on the Fourth of July,"" said Ashton B. Carter, a Harvard professor who, with former defense secretary William J. Perry, had urged the Bush administration to destroy the Taepodong missile on the launching pad, advice the administration rejected.""Hooray if it failed,"" Mr. Carter said.The last missile was fired about 12 hours after the first, officials said.While the test itself was a sign of North Korea's defiance of the United States, for the administration, the outcome was as favorable as officials could have hoped for: the North's capacity was called into question, and the North's enigmatic leader, Kim Jong Il, has now put himself at odds with the two countries that have provided him aid, China and South Korea.""Our hope is that the Chinese are going to be furious,"" said one senior American official, who declined to be identified.Another official noted that only days ago, the Chinese indicated that they were trying to put together an ""informal"" meeting of the long-dormant six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program.The North has boycotted those talks since September, citing American efforts to close down the banks it uses overseas.But North Korea had apparently not responded to the Chinese invitation, and American officials said last week that the Chinese would not have made that gesture if they believed that they were about to be embarrassed by the country that they once considered a close ally.The launching also makes it difficult for the South Koreans to continue their policy of providing aid and investment to the North, a program that has caused deep rifts with Washington. Administration officials said that Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the main negotiator with North Korea, would leave for Asia on Wednesday, and that they expected him to use the launchings to try to bring South Korea and China around to agree to impose some kinds of sanctions.At the same time, the launching is likely to strengthen the hand of hard-liners in the Bush administration who have long argued that the six-party talks were bound to fail. They now have what one American diplomat called ""a clear runway"" to press for a gradually escalating series of sanctions, which some officials clearly hope will bring down Mr. Kim's government.But it is far from clear that China — which provides the North with its oil and much of its food — would go along with any move for sanctions.The firing ended weeks of speculation about the intentions of Pyongyang, which had rolled out the Taepodong 2, its new long-range missile, in full view of American spy satellites, and came despite severe warnings from the United States and countries in this region that a test would entail further isolation and sanctions. The first missile was fired around 3:30 a.m. today, local time, according to the Japanese government.American officials said they believe the Taepodong 2 was the third missile fired, with the U.S. Northern Command saying that it was launched at 5 a.m. Korea time (about 4 p.m. Tuesday, Eastern time).It was also unclear why North Korea fired short- and mid-range missiles, which it has tested successfully in the past and of which it is said to own several hundred.""One theory is that they knew that there was a probability that things with the Taepodong 2 wouldn't work, so it was good to fire off a few missiles that would actually work,"" said a senior Bush administration official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak about this issue.In 1998, the last time the North tested a missile outside its territory, Pyongyang fired the Taepodong 1, which flew over Japan before falling into the sea. That test set off a negative reaction in the region, especially in Japan, which responded by strengthening its military and its alliance with the United States. In 1999, the North announced a moratorium on missile launches — a ban that it said last month no longer applied.Intelligence from American satellite photographs indicated in mid-June that the North was proceeding with the test-firing of the Taepodong 2 at a launching pad on North Korea's remote east coast. Satellite photographs showed that the North Koreans had taken steps to put fuel into the missile, but the missile sat there until Wednesday morning, leading to speculation that the North was simply staging the event in order to gain attention from the United States.American officials had suggested that they might try to use missile defense systems to shoot down the Taepodong 2 in midair.Bad weather in this region was said to have delayed the launching, because poor visibility would prevent the North from tracking its missile. But the North contradicted expert opinion by launching its long-range missile in predawn darkness today.'"

Mr. Bush's spokesman, Tony Snow, only went so far as to call the launching ""provocative behavior.""The Japanese government said it would take ""severe actions"" against the North, possibly including economic sanctions. Those could include shutting down the ferry service to North Korea and attempting to stem the flow of the transfer of cash to the North from Koreans in Japan, though officials acknowledge that would be difficult.At the United Nations, John R. Bolton, the United States ambassador, was ""urgently consulting"" with other members of the Security Council to try to schedule a meeting of the panel, according to his spokesman, Richard A. Grenell. Later in the evening, it was announced that the Council would meet to take up the matter at 10 a.m. Wednesday at the request of Japan. Mr. Hadley acknowledged that ""what we really don't have a fix on is, you know, what's the intention of all this, what is the purpose of all this? "" He noted it was a violation of North Korea's previous pledges to hold to a moratorium on missile tests.It was also unclear why North Korea fired short- and mid-range missiles, which it has tested successfully in the past and of which it is said to own several hundred.""One theory is that they knew that there was a probability that things with the Taepodong 2 wouldn't work, so it was good to fire off a few missiles that would actually work,"" said a senior Bush administration official, who asked that his name not be used because he was not authorized to speak about this issue.In 1998, the last time the North tested a missile outside its territory, Pyongyang fired the Taepodong 1, which flew over Japan before falling into the sea. That test set off a negative reaction in the region, especially in Japan, which responded by strengthening its military and its alliance with the United States.Wednesday's tests are likely to increase calls inside Japan to strengthen its missile defense efforts with the United States, and could increase support for hawkish candidates in the race to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who is scheduled to retire in September.Shinzo Abe, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, who is the leading candidate to succeed Mr. Koizumi and who has gained popularity in recent years by being tough on North Korea and China, said the tests were ""a serious problem from the standpoint of our national security, peace and stability of the international community and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.""The tests are sure to anger China — which expended considerable diplomatic prestige in pressing the North not to go ahead with the launching and to rejoin the six-nation talks — and raise doubts anew about the real extent of Beijing's influence on Pyongyang. The Chinese foreign ministry said it had no comment to make yet on the launching.In South Korea, whose government publicly urged the North not to test-fire but privately played down the risk, opponents of the government's engagement policy toward the North might gain support in presidential elections next year.Intelligence from American satellite photographs indicated in mid-June that the North was proceeding with the test-firing of the Taepodong 2 at a launching pad on North Korea's remote east coast. Satellite photographs showed that the North Koreans had taken steps to put fuel into the missile, but the missile sat there until Wednesday morning, leading to speculation that the North was simply staging the event in order to gain attention from the United States.American officials had suggested that they might use the missile defense shield to shoot down the Taepodong 2 in midair. Bad weather in this region was said to have delayed the launching, because poor visibility would prevent the North from tracking its missile.But the North contradicted expert opinion by launching its long-range missile in predawn darkness today.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Mr. Lieberman's decision to consider running without the Democratic nomination is a sign of just how difficult the road may be for him. Ned Lamont, a wealthy businessman and political novice, has proved to be a formidable candidate, criticizing Mr. Lieberman for his support for the war in Iraq and for other policies backed by President Bush. Mr. Lamont followed Mr. Lieberman in the Willimantic parade.While several Democratic leaders have declined to say what they would do should Mr. Lieberman lose the state primary, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York pledged yesterday to support the winner.""I have been pleased to support him in his campaign for re-election and hope that he is our party's nominee,"" Mrs. Clinton said of Mr. Lieberman in a statement. ""But I want to be clear that I will support the nominee chosen by Connecticut Democrats in their primary.""Polls show that Mr. Lieberman would be a strong contender in a three-way race with Mr. Lamont and the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger, a former state representative who is relatively unknown.Mr. Lieberman enjoys strong backing with Republicans and independent voters. Indeed, several of his most enthusiastic supporters here said they were not registered Democrats and were eager to see him run on a third line.""I think he's one of the most honest people in Congress right now,"" said Jack Pelto, a 66-year-old resident of Lebanon who called himself an independent with Republican leanings. ""He's not sticking to any party line. He's taking stands for what he believes in and that deserves enormous respect. He's somebody who takes this country's future seriously.""But seemingly bolstered by Senator Lieberman's attempt at an independent nomination, the Lamont campaign outdid the Lieberman enthusiasts in both size and volume.A few feet ahead of Mr. Lamont along the route was a large papier-mâché float depicting a kiss between Mr. Lieberman and President Bush, a reference to their interaction at the State of the Union address last year.""Joe's always been willing to take a bit of a gamble and it's a gamble he's going to lose now,"" said Jeff Talbot, 45, a graphic designer who created the float. Once a registered Republican, he is now a Democrat. ""I'm not anti-Republican,"" he said, ""but I am very disturbed with the distorted views that are coming out of the leadership in our country. And we need someone representing us who understands that.""Mr. Lieberman responded to all of this by passing out chocolate Kisses, telling volunteers to ""give a kiss"" to anyone who jeered at him. He said the shouts were a sign of ""too much hate in our politics.""""It's dividing our country and it's making it harder for our government to get anything done for the people who send us there,"" he said. ""I'd rather be a hugger than a hater.""Mr. Lamont, who in recent weeks has scaled back some of his attacks on Mr. Lieberman, disputed that portrayal, saying that the shouts showed ""passion, not anger"" among voters. He said that he was confident that he would have support from Democrats who had not voted in the last several elections, adding that support from party loyalists would surge if he won the primary.""I think Senator Lieberman undermines the Democrats at a time when we are trying to present a constructive alternative,"" he said. ""We have people who are very emotional about their desire to see change in Washington and the way business is done there.""All along the parade route were signs of a feisty few weeks ahead. As one man barked out ""Betrayal, you've betrayed us!"" an aide to Mr. Lieberman tried to quiet him down. And as a Lamont campaign worker chatted with a boy wearing a Lieberman button, he stuck a Lamont sticker over it.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Experts who have studied shifts in cargo traffic say Hong Kong is fast approaching a point beyond which business lost to Guangdong's expanding ports will not return, even if the government heeds highly unusual calls in the industry to intervene to enable Hong Kong to compete.""We're asking how desperate this situation is and getting very pessimistic answers,"" said Evan Auyang, a consultant at McKinsey & Company, which is studying the cargo industry in the Pearl River Delta.At a minimum, according to experts, Hong Kong's shipping industry will change as its relative importance in the Pearl River Delta region declines.Manufacturing migrated northward to Shenzhen and elsewhere in Guangdong in the late 1980's, and with the development of ports along the Pearl River, shipping activity can now follow the factories. ""This is a structural change, and no one can stop it,"" said James Wang, the head of transport studies at Hong Kong University. ""Hong Kong used to be the entrepôt, the gateway to China. Now China has its own gateways.""Yantian and other ports in the Pearl River Delta, including harbors under construction, are little more than a decade old.They now claim more than 40 percent of container traffic in the delta — business that was almost entirely Hong Kong's until the late 1990's.The most immediate cause of this shift is cost. Trucking charges and the fees levied by vessels calling at Kwai Chung mean that shipping a container from Hong Kong costs roughly $300 more compared with mainland ports.Hong Kong's longstanding advantages — fast turnarounds at the wharves, sophisticated logistics capabilities, efficient banking — no longer justify its ranking among the world's priciest ports.As companies like Targus are discovering, mainland ports now provide roughly comparable services. Until recently, two factors appear to have lulled Hong Kong into complacency. For one thing, explosive economic growth in southern China produced large yearly increases in cargo volumes, leaving Kwai Chung and its rivals to share an ever larger pie. For another, substantial declines in direct shipments were masked by increases in transshipping — essentially vessel-to-vessel transfers, a low-value activity that brings relatively little economic benefit.The wake-up call came late last year, when a steady fall in direct shipments — factory-to-container-to-truck-to-cargo hold — turned into a plunge. Hong Kong is now losing direct cargo traffic from southern China at a rate of 9 percent a year.Apparently for the first time, shippers, traders and the industries dependent upon them, which account for a quarter of Hong Kong's employment and almost $40 billion in economic output, are facing the long-term implications of a process that began when China first built deep-water container ports near Hong Kong in the mid-1990's.McKinsey, the consulting firm, estimates that a third of this economic activity is at risk.""Hong Kong's competitiveness is eroding,"" said Frank Jensen, general manager for marketing and logistics at Modern Terminals, the city's No. 2 terminal operator. ""The 9 percent figure last year illustrates well enough the urgent need for change.""Freight forwarders, manufacturers and industry analysts say the shift in activity to mainland ports could accelerate significantly in the coming years. Modern Terminals and its rival here, Hutchison Port Holdings, are expanding in southern China; neither is investing significantly in Hong Kong's waterfront.The challenge, all sides say, is to equalize costs so that Hong Kong can compete for direct cargo shipments.Hong Kong has already negotiated with Guangdong to relax some of the many regulations and restrictions imposed on Hong Kong truckers; it is now trying to eliminate bottlenecks at Chinese customs barriers, which add significantly to the costs of cross-border truck traffic.But officials here have left two central issues unresolved. To make Hong Kong cost-competitive, the city will have to allow mainland truckers to operate here or let Hong Kong companies hire mainland drivers — moves that government officials say would threaten the jobs of about 7,000 Hong Kong drivers.Equally, Hong Kong officials have failed to negotiate lower terminal-handling charges with shipping lines serving Kwai Chung. These charges, which are set by international shipping conferences, account for a third of the difference between costs in Hong Kong and southern China.Even if there is progress on these issues, many executives and experts say, Hong Kong will need to rely more on high-end cargo that justifies Kwai Chung's costs, and on its ability to stay ahead of the mainland by offering advanced services like container bundling and multicountry cargo consolidation.In the meantime, a growing sense of urgency is producing uncharacteristic calls among many in the industry for Hong Kong to abandon laissez-faire policies. While different constituents argue for different policies, the overall goal is to integrate Hong Kong and southern China more quickly by negotiating the removal of all remaining barriers to the free cross-border flow of goods. To some, these calls for official intervention are nearly as historic a shift as that occurring in the industry itself.""We want the government involved,"" said Sonny Ho, executive director of the Hong Kong Shippers' Council. ""It is responsible for the sustained growth of Hong Kong's ports. A lot of jobs depend on this.""'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Sharapova is the only one of this year's semifinalists who has held up the champion's trophy, winning in 2004. This will be Mauresmo's fourth semifinal and Clijsters's second.Henin-Hardenne reached three consecutive semifinals from 2001 to 2003. She advanced to the final in 2001 before losing to Venus Williams, who also defeated her in 2002. In 2003, Henin-Hardenne lost in the semifinals to Serena Williams.""That was a time when the Williamses scared the opposition,"" Henin-Hardenne said. ""Those days are done. I have lots of respect for the women who are still here and who are certainly as strong as the Williams sisters. But my state of mind, I think, will be a little different this time.""Her quarterfinal Tuesday was already unusual because she was not facing one of the game's established threats. Instead, she faced the 26-year-old Bremond, who was ranked 129th in the world and had never advanced beyond the second round of a Grand Slam tournament.It was all so new to Bremond that when she finished her upset of Ai Sugiyama on Monday in the fourth round, she thought she would have a full day to recover before the quarterfinals. But she quickly learned that there would be little rest for the weary and that she would have to come right back Tuesday on the grand stage of Court 1.""When I walked out there, the stadium seemed huge, but the court seemed tiny and the net seemed high,"" Bremond said. ""I needed some time to get my bearings.""She might have felt more vulnerable than she looked, mixing aggressive forehands with regular forays to the net. But she could not stop Henin-Hardenne from winning, 6-4, 6-4.The most lopsided quarterfinal was, surprisingly, Sharapova's 6-1, 6-4 dismissal of the seventh-seeded Elena Dementieva of Russia.Sharapova, the self-assured Russian who has long been based in Florida, is the closest the United States has to an American singles player remaining in the tournament.In doubles, the Bryan twins, Bob and Mike, advanced to the men's semifinals Tuesday. And Martina Navratilova, at age 49 — in what she insists is really, truly her last Wimbledon — plays Wednesday in the women's quarterfinals with teammate Liezel Huber of South Africa.Against Dementieva, Sharapova seemed to be operating at a much higher speed early in the match. But that changed after she took a 3-0 lead in the second set: a naked man walked on to Sharapova's side of the court and performed a clumsy cartwheel.Sharapova, eager to keep her focus, turned her back. But she was aware that security officials did not react immediately, she said, noting that she even saw some of the guards laughing. The man was eventually removed from the court.Sharapova double-faulted on the next point, but managed to hold her serve to take a 4-0 lead. Dementieva then reeled off the next three games. In the end, however, the quality of Sharapova's serve and her nerve on grass overcame the inconsistency of Dementieva's returns.""It's just amazing how focused she can be, how she can fight from the first point till the end,"" Dementieva said.But Dementieva did not restrict herself to compliments. When pressed, she became the latest of many to complain about Sharapova's grunting/shrieking/moaning. ""I think the umpire should calm her down a little bit,"" Dementieva said, suggesting that she will say something to the umpire the next time she beats Sharapova.But, she said, when she was losing by 6-1, 4-1, ""it doesn't look good if you're going to go to the umpire and talking about how loud she screaming on the court.""Mauresmo and Clijsters had their own trouble Tuesday.Mauresmo, serving and volleying regularly, had the wildest ride of the day before beating the ninth-seeded Anastasia Myskina of Russia, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Clijsters had to work hard to close out Li, the first Chinese singles player to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event, 6-4, 7-5. In a match full of baseline power and explosive lateral movement, Li did not seem overwhelmed by the occasion or Clijsters's trademark athleticism.Afterward, Clijsters said she believed that Li, ranked 30th, had the potential to be a top-10 player with her forceful backhand as her biggest building block.The question now is whether Clijsters can break the recent pattern against Henin-Hardenne, who has beaten her in their last four meetings in a Grand Slam, most recently in the French Open semifinals last month. This will be the 22nd installment of their rivalry as professionals, their first at Wimbledon. Whoever wins will not have to face anyone named Williams in the final.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','European stocks rebounded as optimism about increased mergers and acquisitions in the financial industry lifted shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Banca Popolare Italiana.The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index added 0.2 percent to 322.87 in London, after earlier sliding 0.4 percent. It was the index's fifth day of gains, recouping some of last quarter's losses, which was prompted by concerns about higher worldwide borrowing costs.Trading volume was lower than usual in Europe, with the United States markets closed yesterday for the Independence Day holiday.Stocks in Japan also rose, led by Toyota Motor, after Asian carmakers grabbed more share of the United States market. DaimlerChrysler, whose American sales lost ground, paced a decline for automotive shares in Europe.The Japanese Nikkei 225 stock average added 0.4 percent, to 15,638.50, and was lifted when the Credit Suisse Group recommended that investors buy more of Japan's equities.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Three summer-driven operations — an amusement park, a bicycle shop and an ice cream truck vendor — have changed to avoid the vagaries of the season.For nearly 30 years attendance at Holiday World, an amusement park in rural Santa Claus, Ind., climbed steadily, reaching 883,751 in 2004. Last year, however, the number dropped more than 12,000. The primary reason: Hurricane Dennis, which pushed inward and stalled over the area, bringing three weeks of rain and cool temperatures in late June and early July.While little can be done about the weather, the addition this year of a new section at the park — Thanksgiving — has left Will Koch, president and general manager, a little more confident about dealing with such events in the future.Opened as the park celebrates its 60th year in business, Thanksgiving's main attraction is The Voyage, a $6.5 million investment billed as one of the three longest and fastest wooden roller coasters in the world. Its marketing pitch includes the claim that it allows riders to experience ""24.2 seconds"" of weightlessness as the ride plunges down its steepest drop at a 66-degree angle.""Our biggest challenge is to stand out from our competitors,"" said Mr. Koch (pronounced ""cook""). ""We're surrounded by parks that have been much bigger than us. Bigger rides and more of them.""Mr. Koch tries to appeal to families. The park, which has won many industry awards for value, cleanliness and friendliness, gives away free soft drinks and sunscreen lotion. Last year alone, customers consumed some 420,000 gallons of drinks, enough to fill the water park's first wave pool.At the same time, when adding rides, the owners look for those that will put Holiday World on the map. ""Marquee rides,"" Mr. Koch calls them, and in the case of The Voyager, he chose a wooden roller coaster as opposed to steel because he thought it had broader demographic appeal.Holiday World opened in 1946 as Santa Claus Land, a seven-acre amusement park devised by Mr. Koch's grandfather, Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist concerned that people drawn to Santa Claus had nothing to see. Over the years the park grew, adding sections like Fourth of July and Halloween.It now covers more than 100 acres and although there are 60 year-round employees and 1,500 seasonal ones, it remains a family business.""When I need to make a decision I call my brother and sister and they say, 'O.K.,' "" Mr. Koch said. ""We cover about 110 acres and I'm thankful to my father and grandfather because I have about another 90 acres to grow out on.""A blessing, but a challenge at the same time.""We are still very much focused on growth,"" he said, noting that he would like to see attendance grow to two million. ""But we don't want to lose that small park feel.""While most cycling road races and events like triathlons are held during the summer, John Huenink, owner of Transition Cycle in Pewaukee, Wis., is working to make his custom-fit bicycle shop more viable by catering to the needs of enthusiasts throughout the year.His bicycles are a world away from those typically found at the local bike shop. Of the 30 bicycles he has on the floor, not one sells for less than $1,100 and for customers at this store it's all about the fit and having the ability to go the distance.Mr. Huenink got into cycling in college and his interest evolved into a job as a service manager at a local bicycle shop. He went on to manage a mid-to-large-size bike shop, but he was not really doing what he wanted, which was to be a custom bike fitter.""I couldn't generate the clients, so I put together a store with that in mind,"" he said.In 2003, he took out a $35,000 home equity loan and a partner invested another $35,000 to open a high-end cycling shop. They started with six bicycles, some clothing and ""$50 left to haggle over,"" Mr. Huenink said. What they were ultimately selling, however, was expertise for customers on the right fit for their bike.Their customers are not the occasional cyclist, but people who race competitively, compete in events like triathlons, or just cover a lot of miles. Some travel from three hours away for the service and Mr. Huenink does what he can to make it worth the trip.His shop has comfortable sofas by large windows overlooking Lake Pewaukee, and there are eight computerized monitors that measure output on various courses so cyclists can set up their bikes and compete against each other even in the winter months. With so many athletes looking for advice in running and swimming, Mr. Huenink has formed a partnership with a local personal trainer to provide overall conditioning advice and services for his clients. In all, he has some $130,000 invested in inventory, his sales are up 47 percent this year over last and he has bought out his partner.But his efforts to provide a swimming area for stroke analysis and training has not gone as smoothly. A $25,000 stationary pool (meant for use by triathletes) is unused in the shop as he tries to meet the requirements necessary to get a license from the state.""My $25,000 has been sitting there for five months now,"" he said.Rising gasoline prices have made bringing the Mister Softee jingle to neighborhoods more expensive for José Rivera this summer. As a result, he has raised his ice cream cone prices a quarter to $1.75 and sundaes and milkshakes are up 50 cents to $3.50.Not an easy decision for Mr. Rivera, but his fuel prices have doubled in the last two years and there are only so many other ways to cut corners.Unlike the days when the ice cream trucks trolled neighborhoods on a regular schedule, Mr. Rivera and other vendors are going to parties, staking out softball games and hiring themselves out for organized events.At noon on a recent Monday, Mr. Rivera discussed the changes as he wrapped up a preplanned visit to a Bronx school for the blind where he doled out 500 ice cream cones.Rising gasoline prices are only part of the reason, he said. Lifestyles have changed, too. Children are off at camp rather than playing in the streets and a vast array of ice cream is as near as the corner store.Mr. Rivera says his main goal ""is for the kids to be happy,"" but make no mistake, he has $150,000 invested in the operation — $75,000 for the truck and $75,000 for his route — and under his license from New York City, he has only 214 days to be on the street.Like the best bartender, Mr. Rivera knows what his little customers take, be it a milkshake, dip cone or sundae.""I treat my customers like gold,"" he said.While in one breath he will tell you there is little he can do to expand his market, in the next he is waxing on about a multitude of colored sprinkles, cookie toppings and what flavors he has for the Slushee machine.He typically works noon to 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. and yesterday he was not expecting to watch fireworks with his family.""The hardest thing is time lost with loved ones,"" he said. ""I lost my girlfriend because of my business.""Mr. Rivera is really not complaining though. While he will not divulge how much he makes each season, he does allow that it is more than his brother, a doctor, earns.""And I have four months off for vacation,"" he said.'"
"'06-07-05,'0','""They're pretty much leasing up all the vacant office space in Redmond,"" said Rob Odle, director of planning and community development for the city of Redmond.Microsoft had planned to add 2.1 million square feet over 15 to 20 years, but overcrowding at its headquarters and a heated battle with Google and Yahoo forced the company to step up the pace.The move comes none too soon. The latest version of the Windows operating system, Vista, has been hit with delays and will not reach store shelves until January. The update of Office business software, which was to be released this year, will not be out until January. Google has started making inroads in office applications, one of Microsoft's core businesses, with its release of spreadsheet and word processing software. Google, the search giant, has also overtaken Microsoft in online searches and accounted for 49 percent of them in May, versus 10.6 percent for Microsoft, according to Nielsen/NetRatings, a New York market research firm.""They see themselves as somewhat beleaguered, and that's been their pattern since the beginning,"" said Rob Helm, director of research at Directions on Microsoft, a research firm in Kirkland, Wash., that tracks only Microsoft. ""There's always been a bogeyman driving significant parts of their business strategy.""Microsoft's increased spending should be a boon for the Seattle area, where unemployment has stubbornly floated from 4 percent to 5 percent for well over a year. The company plans to hire 4,000 to 5,000 new employees this year, more than half of whom will be located in the United States. (Microsoft would not say how many people it expects to hire in Redmond.) For every new technology-related job, nearly four new jobs — mostly in the service sector — are created in Washington State, according to the Technology Alliance, a state trade group based in Seattle.""The real reason you want these jobs is for the multiplier effect,"" said Bill McSherry, director of economic development at the Puget Sound Regional Council in Seattle.But some local residents do not applaud Microsoft's expansion. For them, it means increased traffic, higher home prices and crowded parks. Roads are clogged and median housing prices on the Eastside, the area east of Lake Washington where Redmond is located, have soared 17 percent, to $484,500, in May from a year ago.""There are two times a day when people come and go to Microsoft that traffic is so bad you have to stay home,"" said Jack Bittner, 59, a resident of the Grasslawn neighborhood, which is next to Microsoft. ""It's almost gridlock now.""Mr. Bittner and his wife have even considered selling his house, which they bought for $86,000 in 1987, and moving to Bellingham, a city north of Seattle. He expects he could get around $600,000 for his four-bedroom ranch.Transportation has become the largest issue for the growing region. And for its part, Microsoft has vowed to spend $35 million on transportation improvements in Redmond, including an overpass over Route 520 near its campus, sewer upgrades and turn lanes on nearby roads.But even a sizable cash infusion would merely be a temporary solution to a problem that has been steadily worsening for years. The area's roads and bridges, some of which are earthquake hazards, already struggle to handle the company's 30,000 employees. The Route 520 bridge, which crosses Lake Washington and connects Seattle to Redmond, was built in 1963 to handle 15,000 vehicles a day. Now, 115,000 vehicles cross it daily. Increased traffic, windstorms, earthquakes and boating and traffic accidents have further shortened the bridge's life and required extensive repairs. State officials worry a strong windstorm or earthquake could damage the bridge beyond repair.""The economic impacts would be catastrophic,"" said John Milton, SR-520 project director with Washington's state transportation department. ""It's the feeder for two of the major employment centers in the area.""Privately, Microsoft officials bristle at the notion that the transportation burden is theirs. But Microsoft's size makes it a convenient target for complaint among Redmond residents.""Almost immediately after Microsoft began expanding in the late 1990's, the traffic in our neighborhood just went nuts,"" Mr. Bittner said. ""That makes me not too excited about this expansion.""'"
"'06-07-05,'0','Jewish Israelis lead separate lives from the Arab Israelis who make up 20 percent of the country. Dealings are usually commercial, not social. Arabs complain that they suffer from discrimination and suspicion because of their identification with Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.The question the show's producers posed is one many Israelis ask themselves: Could Jewish and Arab Israelis get along, absent political and historical tensions? And will those tensions ever truly be absent?The results for the Movsowitzes and the Ahmed Abdullahs were mixed.Mrs. Movsowitz, 39, a willowy part-time secretary and mother of three sons, forms a fast bond with Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah's husband, the soft-spoken Karim Ahmed Abdullah, a 36-year-old construction worker who is home every afternoon to care for his three sons.Like her, Mr. Ahmed Abdullah is the primary caregiver, spending more time with his children than his wife, who works long days running the family's restaurant in their village, Ein Nakuba, in the Jerusalem foothills. Their roles are considered unorthodox in traditional Arab society.The show, which follows the formula of the ""Wife Swap"" franchise created in Britain, includes the mothers' reading each other's manuals describing the rules of their houses.Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah is surprised by the busy work schedule of Sean Movsowitz, a sales and marketing manager. But she is equally surprised that so many of the domestic responsibilities fall to Mrs. Movsowitz.""What's written here is more suited to Arab women who are usually shuttered inside their homes,"" Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah says.Her first encounter with Mr. Movsowitz, 41, is not a smooth one.Her own extended family welcomed Mrs. Movsowitz with a multicourse dinner of traditional Arab food; Mr. Movsowitz and his sons do not offer Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah anything to eat or a cup of coffee. Instead she has to make dinner, and they ask awkward questions.""Where are you from?"" asks Mr. Movsowitz, his brow furrowed, after hearing Ms. Ahmed Abdullah's thick Arab accent.Later he addresses the cameras in private and confesses, ""I'm not O.K. with her being alone here with my kids in my home.""Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah quickly chastises him for what she sees as his chauvinist ways.""Your house rules are worse than they are in Hebron,"" she said, referring to the stereotype that Palestinians hold about those from the West Bank town Hebron. ""Do you know what a Hebron Arab is? It's one who is thickheaded and conservative.""Throughout their week together, riddled with altercations, Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah and Mr. Movsowitz seem incapable of seeing each other as anything but caricatures.They argue about politics and which television channel on which to watch the news. She prefers Al Jazeera; he, CNN. She calls him a racist. He says she has ""chutzpah"" to call him names. When she gives a birthday party for his youngest son and buys a cake with wishes written in the icing in Arabic and teaches the children how to dance to Arabic music, Mr. Movsowitz urges her to tone things down.Eventually a spat over whether to listen to songs sung in Arabic after the guests leave turns into a major fight. A teary-eyed, exasperated Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah packs her bags and leaves the night before the show is to end.Mr. Movsowitz and Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah each complained that the production team pressured them to be confrontational, a charge the producers deny.In contrast, Mrs. Movsowitz thrives in her new setting despite her poor Arabic, and Mr. Ahmed Abdullah seems happy to have her around, especially when she announces to the extended family that he should be accorded more respect.On the Friday of the taping, with just minutes to go before the Jewish Sabbath begins at sunset, the Muslim call to prayer blasts from a nearby minaret. Mrs. Movsowitz suddenly remembers that she has no wine for the evening's ritual blessings.As observant Muslims forbidden to drink alcohol, the family has no wine, but Mr. Ahmed Abdullah rushes to get her some through a Jewish family he knows nearby. Soon after, curious family members look on as Mrs. Movsowitz lights the Sabbath candles.Mrs. Ahmed Abdullah is also preparing for the Sabbath and trying her best to remember the Jewish dietary laws. She sets the table with the family's finest linen and dishes and looks disappointed when Mr. Movsowitz says that as a non-Jew, she cannot light the Sabbath candles. When he offers her a drink of the Sabbath wine, it is her turn to decline as a Muslim.The show's director, Roy Oz, said filming that moment was deeply moving.""Suddenly both religions meet but at the same time cannot meet,"" Mr. Oz said. ""You leave with something from this episode; it makes you ask questions.""'"
"'06-07-05,'0','The reasonable reader (and, certainly, the reasonable vegetarian reader) might be wondering why Ms. Slonosky gives her family hot dogs at all. But that reader probably does not have children and has never worried about getting enough protein into their little carb-stuffed bodies. Besides, why try to deny a kid a hot dog?Americans eat almost $2 billion worth of hot dogs a year, whether deep-fried Italian style in Jersey, spiked with sport peppers in Chicago or batter-dipped in Texas. Almost 30 million hot dogs will be eaten at the nation's ballparks this year.Still, the national appetite for conventional hot dogs is waning. The amount of packaged hot dogs sold has dropped by more than 6 percent over the past four years, to 772.4 million pounds from 825.8 million pounds, according to a new report from ACNielsen, the market research company. (Figures don't include sales at Wal-Mart, which doesn't release such data.)Hot dogs labeled organic, although still a tiny slice of the market, have boomed. During the same period, the number of pounds of organic dogs sold has increased 21 percent, to 1.2 million.Stephen McDonnell, who founded the natural meat company Applegate Farms in 1987 and remains its chief executive, argues that the hot dog revolution should center on beef from animals that eat only pasture rather than the standard diet of grain. Beef from cattle raised on grass is leaner and has a healthier dose of omega-3 fatty acids, the kind found in fish like salmon and mackerel. As a result, he said, the dogs are healthier.After working for a decade on the formula, Mr. McDonnell this month introduced low-priced nitrate-free hot dogs made with grass-fed beef from Uruguay.Sold under the name the Great Organic Hot Dog, they look just like those plump, salty, chemically pink dogs served on buns at sporting events and from street carts. The suggested price is $4.99 a pound; that's a dollar or so more than a pound of Ball Park franks, although on the third of July Great Organics were $5.69 at one Brooklyn supermarket.Mr. McDonnell's hot dog even eats like the inexpensive hot dogs that dominate the market, with that slightly rubbery, juicy texture. And that was his secret plan: make the organic grass-fed dog taste just like the mass-market favorite.""If we can introduce a whole new group of people to healthy food through a hot dog, oh my god, the lateral impact is enormous,"" Mr. McDonnell said.Although serious hot dog fans prefer the snap of a natural casing, Mr. Applegate's dogs — like most — are formed with a cellulose casing, which is removed before packaging. ""We don't do skin at this point because we are after the mainstream shopper,"" he said. ""You can't take America's favorite food and change it to that degree and expect widespread acceptance.""Mr. McDonnell is selling a couple of other styles of organic hot dogs that are made from animals raised on grain. The new dogs will be the first completely grass-fed wienies in the country to be sold at mainstream markets like Publix and Safeway.Staff members of the Dining section held a blind taste test of several organic and grass-fed skinless uncured hot dogs aimed at the mass market. The Applegate grass-fed dogs were a close second to Nathan's, a conventional hot dog thrown in as a ringer.The Applegate dog had not quite half the fat of Nathan's, and about 25 percent less sodium.We also found that two versions of Organic Valley's organic uncured hot dogs provided a perfect snapshot of the difference the new vegetable juice curing technique can make. The company's original organic dogs, which have been made since the late 1990's, were everything one would fear in an uncured organic dog: without an effective alternative to nitrites, they had a dense, dry texture and an unappealing brown color.The new versions, made from Midwestern cattle whose diet was at least 85 percent grass, were springier and juicy. It was night and day.Beyond the mass market are the elite athletes of the grass-fed hot dog movement. These are boutique dogs, made in smaller batches with beef from herds raised not far from where the dogs are sold. They have a more distinctive flavor and texture than any mass-market versions we tasted and are showing up in increasing numbers, both at farmers' markets and at new high-end hot dog stands in New York and San Francisco.The emphasis is on local beef, in keeping with the emerging notion that local sustainable food is a better economic and social choice than a mass-marketed product, even one that carries an organic label.Among those I've tasted on both coasts, the Dines Farms beef dog is a favorite. Made from animals that graze on Catskill Mountains pasture in Oak Hill, N.Y., the hot dogs have a natural casing that snaps lightly, revealing a fine-textured interior with lots of juice and a pleasant, meaty flavor.They are available in packages at only a handful of Greenmarkets and natural food stores in New York City. And for $2.50 ($3.50 with toppings), you can get one steamed and nestled in a bun from Amy's Bread at Sparky's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, or on Bleecker Street in Manhattan.On the other coast, when the Giants are playing a home game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, Sue Moore and Larry Bain roll out their Let's Be Frank cart and start grilling their version of the new hot dog. It is made with pastured beef from the 80,000-acre Hearst Ranch in San Simeon, Calif., and stuffed into lamb casings. (The franks can be bought online at letsbefrankdogs.com.)On a nice day, from their cart at the ballpark and another at Crissy Field, a park near the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, they can sell 400.Let's Be Franks are more russet than pink, and their pleasantly rough texture and extra-juicy bite makes them more robust, more like a sausage than most hot dogs from grass-fed beef.Getting the texture of nitrate-free grass-fed beef to mimic a mass-market hot dog is tricky. The nature of the fat in an animal fed on pasture is different from that of one raised on grain. There is less saturated fat, and the animals tend to be leaner, so when the meat is being chopped into hot dog paste, dog makers have to carefully balance temperature, water levels and the pace of emulsification.""To the American palate corn-fed beef fat tastes like butter,"" Mr. McDonnell said. ""You have to deal with the leanness issue and the fat taste issue or most Americans are not going to accept a natural version of a hot dog.""Ms. Moore of Let's Be Frank said it took five attempts and six months to find a recipe that both tasted authentic and had a texture that was enough like a hot dog.""We just really wanted to do excellent street food,"" she said. But they also wanted to offer a healthier alternative.""What people can't get their minds around is that hot dogs can be good for them,"" she said. ""So instead of saying that, we say it's an old-fashioned hot dog.""Their hot dog is also an inexpensive way to deliver the gospel of locally raised grass-fed beef to the masses. Many hot dog eaters are not going to drop a lot of cash on an aged grass-fed porterhouse, but they might spend $5 to see what the buzz is about.Using local grass-fed beef in a hot dog or a hamburger reduces consumption of fuel in transportation and feed production and helps local ranchers stay in business, Ms. Moore said. Let's Be Frank uses grass-fed cuts that restaurateurs and retailers generally don't buy — the plate, the shoulder clod and the chuck roll. And the company hopes to go national, relying on a network of regional ranchers and processors.Grass-fed purists who use local beef raise an eyebrow at Mr. McDonnell for importing his beef all the way from Uruguay. He does so because the meat costs less — important in moving grass-fed dogs to the masses. Grazing land in the United States is expensive, and the beef business isn't designed for large pasture-feeding operations.""In Uruguay there's just 2,000-acre farm after 2,000-acre farm,"" he said. ""It's open grass. It's in the culture of Uruguay.""Besides, he said, beef isn't like fruit or vegetables, which can suffer when transported thousands of miles.And then there are those in the healthy-dog game who think grass fed isn't necessarily better and nitrates aren't necessarily bad for you. Bill Niman, the onetime rancher from Northern California who began the beef and pork company that bears his name, introduced Fearless Franks in 1997.The name played to people afraid of what lands in conventional dogs. It was one of the first in the market that tasted good and was made without hormones or antibiotics. His animals, grown on ranches in the West, start out eating pasture grass and are finished on grain. He maintains that the mix creates the kind of flavor Americans like.Most grass-fed animals eat hay and other feed when the grass isn't growing in winter months, a feeding method that Mr. Niman says is less sustainable and energy-efficient than using a highly caloric grain diet at the end of the animal's life.And he offers both a version without sodium nitrate, largely to get on the shelves of Whole Foods, and one that uses the compound as a preservative.Hebrew National hasn't failed to notice the consumer appetite for a healthier dog. Its parent, ConAgra Foods, last month began a television campaign focused on the unique aspects of Hebrew National franks. They aren't organic or necessarily nutritionally better than many brands, but they are made in accordance with kosher dietary laws, which means the cuts of meat from the front half of the animal are used and the butchering and processing meet specific religious standards.For many parents looking for a healthier way to keep their youngsters in hot dogs, all the action on the hot dog is welcome news.Nati Porat, a nursery-school teacher in Park Slope, Brooklyn, has started buying nitrate-free hot dogs designated organic or natural. ""I don't know if I should be trusting them, but I kind of have faith,"" she said. ""I never ate hot dogs before I had kids. I was actually health-conscious.""'"

"'06-07-06,'1','With the launch, Rossiiskaya Gazeta reported, North Korea has broken its 1999 agreement to place a moratorium on missile development and testing. In an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States, Japan, Great Britain, and France called for sanctions against North Korea. Russia, despite, as Kommersant noted, nearly being hit by North Korean missiles, opposed such measures, as did ChinaEXPANDING WARTIME POWERS: In its third and final reading, the State Duma passed several amendments to federal laws aimed at broadening the legal basis for the war on terrorism. Among the more notable changes was an amendment giving the president the authority to make decisions on the use of special forces against terrorists operating in Russia. Another amendment would give the president control over the use of armed forces abroad without having to consult with the Federation Council as in the past. Norms governing press activities during antiterrorist operations were not substantially altered. Also unchanged by this round of hearings was an earlier amendment to the Codex on Criminal Procedure, allowing Russia to hold secret trials for severe crimes in the absence of the accused if he is present somewhere in the Russian Federation.HIGH U.S. INTEREST RATES A CONCERN: The head of the Federal Service for Financial Markets, Oleg Vyugin, says that a United States interest rate of 10 percent would render the Russian financial market uncompetitive. Currently the American interest rate is hovering at 5.25 percent, but it has not always been that low. In the 1970's, rates frequently rose above 10 percent and even reached 19 percent in 1981. Russian market experts, however, see no major risk ahead. ""Interest rates are not always a main factor in determining the level of investment,"" says Aleksei Trifonov, head of the analytical office of the Forex Club. ""Often economic dynamics and political stability are most important."" Ultimately, the newspaper said, Russia has no regime dedicated to financial politics and will remain at the mercy of the United States federal reserve.NO PROGRESS ON RESOURCE LAW: Debate over the law ""On Resources"" has stalled. The law, which has been under discussion for over two years, will not come into effect for at least another year. At issue are norms governing the use of mines as well as those regulating government interference in competition for resources by specific companies. According to Torgul Bagirov, President of the Moscow International Oil Club, the latest edition of the law is beneficial to Gazprom and Rosneft. Currently, the law gives the government power to single handedly dissolve agreements with resource developers if they fail to meet a number of requirements. In addition, foreign investors involved in the development of ""strategic"" mines must hand over their control to Russian companies for compensation in cash or forge alliances with Russian companies, so that 50 percent of the company shares are in Russian hands.CHAIKA, PUTIN PRESS EUROPEANS OVER EXTRADITION: At the seventh European Conference of Procurator Generals held in Moscow Wednesday, Russia's new Procurator General, Yuri Chaika, proposed developing a mechanism to solve conflicts over extradition of accused criminals. In the last several years, European countries, especially Britain, have regularly ignored Russian demands for extradition of individuals, most notably the media magnate Boris Berezovskii; Akhmad Zakaev, emissary from the Chechen Republic; and top Yukos executives. Mr. Chaika promised that if unsuccessful, he would submit his proposal to the European Union. President Vladimir V. Putin also pressed this issue: ""It is difficult for us to explain the refusal on the part of certain countries to extradite witnesses with involvement in terrorism,"" the president said.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','At a White House appearance with Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada, Mr. Bush played down American differences with Moscow and Beijing.""You know, diplomacy takes a while, particularly when you're dealing with a variety of partners, and so we're spending time diplomatically, making sure that voice is unified,"" the president said. ""Let's send a common message: You won't be rewarded for ignoring the rest of the world.""Still, China and Russia gave little sign today that they were willing to consider sanctions. ""We think the Security Council should make a necessary response, but the response should be helpful to maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and should help diplomatic efforts,"" Jiang Yu, the spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said in a news conference in Beijing.Asked whether China — the North's biggest trading partner and aid donor — was considering cutting aid as a result of the tests, Ms. Jiang said, ""At present we are not taking this aspect into consideration.""In Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin said he was disappointed by the test firings, but added that North Korea was correct to say it had the legal right to conduct them.North Korea said it was no longer bound by past moratoriums on the test firing of missiles because the United States and Japan had broken previous agreements.In its statement, the North said Wednesday's missile launchings were successful. Experts said, however, that the Taepodong 2 failed just 42 seconds after takeoff.North Korea's continued defiance appears intended to press the United States into direct talks with North Korea, analysts and politicians said. The country has demanded that Washington stop cracking down on banks that do business with North Korea, and has twice invited Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the main negotiator with North Korea, to visit Pyongyang.For its part, Washington wants the stalled six-nation talks over the North's nuclear program, which include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia, to be revived instead, and it has refused to meet bilaterally with North Korea on the issue.""These actions by North Korea are an act of defiance meant to remind the U.S. that to ignore it comes at a price,"" said Peter Beck, director of Northeast Asia at the International Crisis Group in Seoul.""The tests may also have been intended to rally the North Korean people, to justify the hardships that they are undergoing,"" Mr. Beck said, adding that one of the biggest anti-American rallies in years was held in Pyongyang last week.At a National Assembly hearing here, South Korea's Defense Minister, Yoon Kwang Ung, said that North Korea may fire additional missiles. Mr. Yoon said he was basing his assessment on ""the traffic of equipment and personnel in and out of launch sites.""The South Korean media reported Wednesday that North Korea has three or four more mid-range missiles sitting on launch pads. According to experts, North Korea is believed to have about 200 mid-range and 600 short-range missiles in all.The missile launchings have drawn contrasting responses from South Korea and Japan, America's two allies in the region.Caught between its alliance with the United States and its policy of engaging the North, South Korea condemned the tests but appeared unlikely to impose more than a few very limited penalties against the North.In the long term, few people here expect South Korea, which is the North's second largest trading partner and aid donor after China, to significantly alter its policy of engagement of the North. What both China and South Korea fear almost as much as military confrontation, experts say, is the sudden collapse of the North Korean regime and a subsequent flood of millions of refugees. At a National Assembly hearing, Lee Jong Seok, the Minister of Unification, said that cabinet-level meetings between the North and South will go ahead as scheduled next week, and that economic joint ventures will proceed. Military talks between the two Koreas are also scheduled for later this month.By contrast, Japan has taken a very tough stance. Fukushiro Nukaga, the head of Japan's Defense Agency, told a parliamentary committee today that Japan will step up its efforts to establish a missile defense shield with the United States.""We would like to cooperate with the United States and put our joint missile interception into shape as quickly as possible,"" Mr. Nukaga said.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','Microsoft has been developing its own hand-held music and video player to challenge Apple Computer's iPod and expects to have it in stores in time for the holiday season, entertainment industry executives briefed on the company's plans said last night.Microsoft's digital device would be equipped with at least one feature the iPod lacks: wireless Internet capability that would allow users to download music without being connected to a PC.Microsoft's device, which is similar to an existing player that uses the company's software, would also have a more advanced video screen, according to the executives, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the device.The company has also held negotiations, the executives said, with major record companies and some major television networks in order to settle on terms that would allow it to sell music and video content online through a service similar to Apple's iTunes Music Store.The portable player would represent Microsoft's most ambitious effort yet to compete with the iPod, which has generated billions of dollars in sales and turned Apple into the dominant retailer of digital players and music.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission signaled an escalation in the effort to clean up option grants yesterday by warning Mercury Interactive Corporation that it might bar three directors from serving on boards of public companies.Mercury Interactive, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., and makes software to test computer programs, said the S.E.C. was considering charges that two directors, Igal Kohavi and Yair Shamir, and Giora Yaron, the chairman, knew or should have known about manipulation of grant dates.Company executives held a conference call yesterday to discuss the Monday announcement that it found 54 intentional acts of options backdating starting as far back as 1994.The accounting at the Marvell Technology Group is being scrutinized, Quest Software will restate all financial results since 2000 and Openwave Systems received two subpoenas as the inquiry into stock option grants widened.Mercury, Marvell, Openwave and Quest are among at least 62 companies whose options grants to executives and directors are under scrutiny by the S.E.C., the Justice Department or internal review panels.At issue is the timing of grants and their cost. Quest, a maker of database management programs based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., said yesterday that option grants were made to executives before administrative approvals were obtained for the awards.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','He learned the value of money early, supplementing the family's meager income by delivering newspapers, cutting grass and baling hay.Those childhood lessons would be reinforced when he studied economics under the tutelage of Pinkney Walker, an economics professor at the University of Missouri who became his mentor.In the late 1960's, Mr. Lay landed his first real job, with the Houston-based Humble Oil and Refining, later part of Exxon. As one executive responsible for setting up Humble Oil's corporate development department, Mr. Lay received what seemed a princely salary of $13,000 a year. It was around this time that he married his college girlfriend, Judith Ayers. They had two children.While working at Humble, Mr. Lay began to pursue a doctorate in night school at the University of Houston. Then, with the draft board back in Missouri eager to get hold of him, Mr. Lay applied to the Navy's officer candidate school in Rhode Island and was accepted, heading out in January 1968. That led to his first experience in Washington; after officers' school, he was assigned to the Pentagon as an economist.When his time in the military was up, Mr. Lay was preparing to return to the corporate world when he heard from Mr. Walker, who had been named by President Richard M. Nixon to the Federal Power Commission. Mr. Walker persuaded his star student to join him as his technical assistant.After Washington, Mr. Lay did return to the business world, leaving for a job at the Florida Gas Corporation. His next big break came in 1981, when he moved to Houston, a city that would remain his home for decades to come. There, he joined a larger pipeline company, Transco, as president and chief operating officer.The 1980's was a decade of crucial developments in Mr. Lay's life. It was then that he would marry his second wife, create Enron and forge ties to political leaders.In 1981, as his first marriage was failing, he followed a former boss to Transco, a pipeline company in Houston. He later married Linda Phillips Herrold, who had once been his secretary at Florida Gas.When Mr. Lay was at Transco, many of the pipeline industry's financial contracts at the time were built on a faith that oil prices would continue rising; the arrangements required the companies to buy a set percentage of a gas well's production, at preset, ever-increasing rates.But when oil prices fell in the early 80's, the cost of gas dropped, too, leaving the pipeline companies on the hook for buying fuel at excessive prices. The problem hit Transco hard. So Mr. Lay corralled a group of Transco analysts, and urged them to play around with a new idea: setting up a spot market for gas, which would allow producers to sell the gas directly to customers — taking the pipeline operators and distributors out of the middle.The idea was a rollicking success and alleviated Transco's financial bind. Mr. Lay emerged as something of a legend in the industry, a man who had transformed near certain disaster into a new business. Plenty of other companies sat up and took notice.By May 1984, Mr. Lay was approached by a smaller rival, Houston Natural Gas, or H.N.G., about taking over the company as chairman and chief executive. He took the job, assuming the helm of a major corporation for the first time at the age of 42.In less than a year, H.N.G. was on the path to becoming Enron. Internorth, an Omaha energy company, was fighting off a corporate takeover and, as a defensive maneuver, approached Mr. Lay about merging the two companies. Mr. Lay was intrigued, and on May 2, 1985, the merger of the two companies was announced. The merged company became loaded down with high-interest debt, used to finance the deal.By 1986, after some internal struggles, Mr. Lay was fully in charge of the company, which by then had been rechristened Enron.At Enron, Mr. Lay recruited Jeffrey K. Skilling, a McKinsey & Company consultant, in 1988 and the two began moving it away from its staid pipeline business and pushed it deeper into trading, first in natural gas and later in electricity.As he moved up the ranks of Houston's business elite, Mr. Lay also made connections in the city's deep political pool. He would establish a close relationship with Vice President George H. W. Bush, making large campaign contributions and heading critical committees. He was co-chairman of Mr. Bush's 1992 re-election committee and the chairman of the Republican National Convention held in Houston that year.His relationship with the Bush family was solidified in July 1990, when Mr. Lay helped to orchestrate the World Economic Summit in Houston at the request of the first President Bush. What had seemed to be an organizational mess before Mr. Lay stepped in proved to be an international showcase.Mr. Lay continued his close contact with Washington — remaining close friends with Mr. Bush, later golfing with President Bill Clinton, and eventually establishing a close relationship with George W. Bush, while he was the governor of Texas.When the younger Mr. Bush set off on his quest to win the 2000 presidential election, Mr. Lay served as a major player, playing host at big fund-raisers and contributing plenty of his own money to the effort. After Mr. Bush won the election, Mr. Lay was considered for the job of Treasury secretary, but was passed over.Still, there was no disguising his close relationship to the Bush family; at the inauguration, the first President Bush and his wife flew to Washington with Mr. Lay on an Enron corporate plane. Mr. Lay's survivors, all of Houston, include his wife, Linda; a son, Mark; a daughter, Elizabeth Vittor; and three stepchildren, Robyn Lay, Beau Herrold and David Herrold.People who found themselves on the other side of Mr. Lay's goals and ambitions found him determined, strong-willed and effective. Curtis L. Hébert Jr., the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, frequently disagreed with Mr. Lay on how much and how quickly the nation should deregulate electricity markets.Neither convinced the other, but Mr. Lay did not have to. His Republican colleagues frequently outvoted Mr. Hébert.""Ken Lay was a charming fellow and always presented himself as such, even though we didn't agree,"" Mr. Hebert said. ""I think that was part of his success.""It was, perhaps, also part of his eventual failure.Bill Burton, a Texas lawyer who had known Mr. Lay for more than 10 years, compared Mr. Lay to Icarus, the figure in Greek mythology who was given wings made of feather and wax but fell into the sea when he flew too close to the sun.""The Enron and Ken Lay stories are best told in an English literature class, or a classics class,"" Mr. Burton told an interviewer in 2002, ""where you are trying to explain what hubris is all about.""'"
"'06-07-06,'1','MOSCOW, July 5 — Russia's Parliament passed a law on Wednesday that grants exclusive rights for exporting natural gas to Gazprom, the state-owned energy operator that is already the world's largest gas company.To take effect, the law must be signed by President Vladimir V. Putin, who has not commented on the legislation.The law would be a boon for Gazprom, already a company with many perquisites bestowed by the state. Gazprom currently relies on a de facto monopoly in Russia and supplies about a quarter of Europe's natural gas. In March, Gazprom agreed to export 70 billion cubic meters a year to China, beginning later this decade. The law makes formal Gazprom's pricing power over Russian gas to both these markets. The lower chamber, the Duma, voted 355 to 64 in favor of the law, which came as a flat rejection of the pressure by the United States and Europe for Russia to liberalize its natural gas sector, just nine days before a summit meeting on energy policies that will be attended by President Bush.Western leaders say opening Russia's energy sector to competition and foreign investment will encourage production and maybe damp world energy prices, issues likely to be central to the Group of 8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg next week.In Russia, supporters of the monopoly law say that lowering prices through competition is not in Russia's interest as an energy-exporting nation. Russia benefits when prices are high.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','Last year, at least $4.9 billion worth of contracts, coded as small business, went to 13 of the largest government contractors, according to a review by The New York Times of contracting data provided by Eagle Eye, a research firm based in Virginia.""The S.B.A.'s handling of small business contracting is a mess,"" said Harry C. Alford, president and chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce. ""They know about this problem and yet it continues to happen. The agency is either unwilling or unable to deal with it.""Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Small Business Committee and a frequent critic of the agency, agrees. ""They've known about this for years and continued to put out these reports saying 'we've exceeded our goal of awarding contracts to small businesses,' "" Ms. Velázquez said in an interview. ""But every study points out that they are not truly achieving those goals. Small businesses don't want a handout, but they want a shot at competing on a level playing field.""The Small Business Administration, however, gives itself high marks. In a news release last week, the agency said that it had awarded more than a quarter of contracts to small businesses.""This is excellent news for small businesses doing business with the federal government,"" said the departing S.B.A. administrator, Hector V. Barreto, in the release. ""For the third year in a row, the federal government has met or exceeded its small-business contracting goal. The president and his administration are committed to helping small businesses get their fair share of government contracts.""GTSI was able to compete for the Air Force contract because of a provision in the law that allows companies to compete for small-business contracts even when they grow larger.In 1996, GTSI was awarded a 10-year General Services Administration contract for a company with 500 employees or fewer, which the government considers a small business, said Paul Liberty, a spokesman for GTSI. ""Since the company was classified as a small business at the time of the contract, it maintains that status until the contract ends,"" Mr. Liberty said.The contract ends next year, and GTSI may no longer qualify as a small business, but until then the company can compete for contracts as a small business. ""We don't make the rules, we just follow them,"" Mr. Liberty said.Ms. Bozzetto, the owner of MySource, said this loophole in federal contracting laws provided much larger competitors like GTSI an unfair advantage over her sole proprietorship.""When you have small companies like mine with a few employees trying to compete for contracts with a company with 500 employees and $1 billion in revenue, we don't stand a chance,"" Ms. Bozzetto said. ""It's ludicrous to call a company that big a small business.""Rob Doolittle, a spokesman for General Dynamics, which was listed as having 47 contracts, said those probably resulted from acquisitions.""We've acquired a number of companies in the Northern Virginia area, and if they had small-business contracts prior to that they would still be listed as small-business contracts,"" Mr. Doolittle said.Officials at Northrop Grumman, which was listed as having 121 contracts, also said the company was most likely included because it acquired smaller concerns with existing contracts. The company said those business units would not be eligible for small-business contracts in the future.A spokesman for Boeing, listed as having 37 contracts, said the company was listed because it had acquired some small businesses with contracts or because its subsidiaries had received contracts as small businesses.""The government is looking at these companies as small business and not at Boeing as a whole,"" said Bob Jorgensen, a Boeing spokesman. ""They feel these companies shouldn't be penalized because they are associated with a large company.""In its own study this month, Eagle Eye found that the percentage of federal contracts given to small businesses dropped in 2005 to 17 percent from 20 percent, but that included larger companies so the percentage could be much smaller. The instances of large companies' being awarded small-business contracts have grown to the point that the S.B.A.'s Office of Inspector General listed it as one of the most serious management challenges facing the agency this year.Under federal contracting laws, a small business is determined by revenue and number of employees, under standards set by the Small Business Administration. Any manufacturer with fewer than 500 workers is viewed as small. And in the service and retail industries, the threshold is typically $6.5 million in revenue. But because the agency has more than three dozen classifications for size, a company can be listed as small for some contracts and large for others.If a business is given a contract while it is classified as a small business, it retains that classification for the life of the contract, regardless of how much it grows, as was the case with GTSI. These contracts are called ""multiple award schedules,"" which are big umbrella contracts that the federal government uses to buy goods and services and are supposed to help agencies make more efficient purchases.Schedule contracts are maintained by the General Services Administration, which requires companies to reclassify their status every five years. This allows them to compete as small businesses during that time.Government studies show that large companies sometimes improperly receive small-business contracts because of errors by federal agency contracting officers who fail to check if companies were indeed small or relied on inaccurate information to determine their size.Two weeks ago, a Government Accountability Office audit of a contracting program for the Department of Commerce found several examples of contracting officers who were unable to document the size of companies awarded small business contracts. The audit also found instances of companies continuing to be listed and awarded contracts as small businesses even after being acquired or merged with larger contractors.The S.B.A.'s inspector general said the audits raised serious issues for the federal government and small businesses.""If agencies are permitted to count contracts as meeting their annual small-business goals even though the contracts are actually being performed by larger business, this creates a disincentive for those agencies to identify other small-business opportunities, and legitimate small business lose out,"" Eric M. Thorson, the inspector general, said in an interview.The agency has also tried to correct database errors and has removed hundreds of companies that have been erroneously miscoded as small businesses.""We're not saying that the misreporting issue is not important, but you can't say that the information shows that small businesses are losing business to large businesses,"" said Gary M. Jackson, assistant administrator for size standards at the S.B.A. ""It's the policies that were in place. We think that the changes we've made will make the reporting of small-business contracts much more accurate.""'"
"'06-07-06,'1','""I'm there for the U.S.T.A. to assist or work with whoever they want me to work with,"" Chris Evert said. ""It just would be great to give back to junior tennis, to try to talk to them, inspire them, give them back the hunger I think has been lacking for a while in the U.S.A.""Approximately 20 boys and girls from 14 to 18 are expected to take part in the residential program.""We certainly have run into opposition,"" said Franklin Johnson, the U.S.T.A. president. ""I just think since we are in fact accountable for the result, I think for us to hang back and defer to others is not the right policy. We have to take the initiative and be responsible. Obviously, a lot of kids are going to want to go to different academies or keep their own private coaches, and we're not going to turn our back on those people.""The U.S.T.A. already finances training programs and provides travel grants and coaching to promising players, as well as young professionals. But until now its officials have resisted adopting an academy-style approach. A proposal to create a U.S.T.A. residential program in Daytona Beach, Fla., was close to approval in 2001, but met with considerable resistance from existing academies.""I think it's too bad they wasted five years, but it's better late than never, because bringing many of the best American players together in one spot to compete and develop is a good idea,"" said Tom Gullikson, the former United States Davis Cup captain who helped formulate the 2001 plan.Private academies in the United States, like the IMG-owned Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Fla., typically have large contingents of foreign players enrolled and are too expensive for many American families. Other countries, including France and Australia, have national residential training programs.Arlen Kantarian, the U.S.T.A.'s chief executive for professional tennis, said the grand plan was to create two other residential programs: one in Carson, Calif., and another in Queens at the National Tennis Center, site of the United States Open.Kantarian added that John McEnroe, a three-time Wimbledon champion, had expressed preliminary interest in playing a role in the New York training center.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','""Pepsi, to their great credit, turned the letter over to Coke, who brought the matter to us,"" said David E. Nahmias, United States attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.An agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, posing as a Pepsi employee, then began negotiating with the sender of the letter, who called himself ""Dirk.""Using a cellphone number provided by Dirk, investigators were able to trace a web of calls that led them to Ibrahim Dimson, 30, of the Bronx; Edmund Duhaney, 43, of Decatur, Ga.; and Joya Williams, 41, of Norcross, Ga.Ms. Williams is listed in the criminal complaint as an executive administrative assistant at Coca-Cola.Mr. Deutsch declined to say how long Ms. Williams had been with Coca-Cola or whether she was still employed there. A person close to the company who asked not to be identified said she reported directly to Javier Sánchez-Lamelas, global brand director of Coca-Cola.Federal agents said they had videotaped Ms. Williams rummaging through files and stuffing documents into bags. They said the tape showed her holding a glass vial containing a product sample that was also offered for sale.Mr. Dimson met federal agents, who were still undercover, at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson Airport. There, a manila envelope with documents stamped ""highly confidential"" and the drink sample were traded for $30,000 packed in a Girl Scout cookie box, the complaint said.Mr. Dimson then met with Mr. Duhaney and they drove to Mr. Duhaney's house in Decatur, the complaint said. It is unclear what personal relationship, if any, may exist among the three co-conspirators.The three were taken into custody Wednesday, the day that federal investigators say the final payoff was to have taken place. They are expected to make their first court appearance before a federal magistrate judge Thursday in Atlanta.In a statement to employees after the arrests, E. Neville Isdell, chief executive of Coca-Cola, said the company would tighten its security.""I have directed a thorough review of our information-protection policies, procedures and practices to ensure that we continue to rigorously safeguard our intellectual capital,"" the statement said.Mr. Nahmias, the United States attorney, said PepsiCo had acted as a ""good corporate citizen,"" but that it could have been legally liable if it had tried to buy the trade secrets.He said that if those arrested were convicted on both charges, they could face maximum sentences of 30 years in prison.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','Apple Computer said yesterday that its executives were being sued by shareholders because of the company's announcement last week that it might have manipulated stock option grants.Two lawsuits filed in California make claims against current and former executives and directors as to how the company awarded the grants, Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said in a statement. Apple said it was evaluating its response to the lawsuits.Apple reported last week that it had started an internal investigation into grants made from 1997 to 2001, including one to its chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. Apple hired independent counsel to perform the investigation and said the grant awarded to Mr. Jobs was subsequently canceled and did not result in a financial gain.The company had no comment on the lawsuits beyond the statement, a spokesman, Steve Dowling, said.The suits were filed in Federal District Court for the Northern District of California and the State Superior Court for Santa Clara County, Apple said in the statement.Shares of Apple fell 95 cents to $57. Apple announces financial results July 19.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','Reports about the missile tests came as investors also weighed a jobs report from Automatic Data Processing showing that nonfarm employment surged by 368,000 jobs in June.Analysts said the new employment numbers, which came in at more than double what economists expected, were a sign the economy was still growing at a strong pace. Investors remained concerned that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again in August.The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.28 points yesterday, or 0.72 percent, to 1,270.91. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 76.20 points, or 0.68 percent, to 11,151.82, , and the Nasdaq composite index lost 37.09 points, or 1.69 percent, to 2,153.34.Markets in Asia and Europe closed modestly lower while the dollar gained against many foreign currencies. The main South Korean index declined less than 0.5 percent. In Europe, stock indexes in Britain, France and Germany all dropped at least 1 percent.Investors bid the Japanese yen, the South Korean won and the Taiwan dollar down against the euro and the American dollar. Gold rose nearly $14 an ounce, reaching $629.70. The price of silver jumped 4.5 percent, to close at $11.415 an ounce.Concerns that Japan would postpone a long-awaited increase in short-term interest rates because of the diplomatic tensions with North Korea helped drive those moves, analysts said. The missile crisis could undermine regional growth rates if investors shift large amounts of capital to safe-haven investments like gold and if consumers decide to put off big purchases, the analysts said.Noting that the missile firings were timed to coincide with Independence Day in America, Masuhisa Kobayashi, chief strategist in the Tokyo office of Barclays, said, ""The United States government is clearly being provoked, and all eyes are now on its response.""Many Asian markets started the trading day off sharply lower, but rebounded as the day wore on and investors appeared to conclude that a military confrontation was not imminent. For example, the South Korean benchmark index, known as the Kospi, was off by as much as 2.1 percent in early trading, but retraced more than three-quarters of the loss before the close.While most of the missiles appeared to fall harmlessly into the sea, the test launching of so many at once was widely seen as an act of defiance by the isolated Communist government, especially after repeated public warnings from the United States, Japan, China and other nations not to go through with a test.Japan immediately responded by announcing fresh economic sanctions against Pyongyang, including the turning back of a North Korean ferry as it tried to enter a Japanese port. The United Nations Security Council met in an emergency session to consider a resolution threatening sanctions. Despite support from the United States, Japan and Britain, China and Russia resisted the measure.Economic sanctions would probably have little direct effect on regional trade and investment because North Korea's economy is already tiny and impoverished, with very limited economic contacts with the outside world. Economists estimate the country's gross domestic product at just $40 billion.The larger danger for now would seem to be any chilling of investor and consumer sentiment, analysts said. The timing is unfortunate for Japan, whose $4.6 trillion economy is finally showing signs of returning to normal after a decade-long funk.A series of reports of strong economic statistics have many people believing that the Bank of Japan will raise its short-term interest rates to 0.25 percent from effectively zero, perhaps as soon as next week. But an extended crisis over the missile tests may lead it to delay action, analysts warned.In the Treasury markets, bonds dropped again yesterday. The price of the 10-year note fell 18/32, to 998/32. The yield edged up to 5.22 percent, from 5.15 percent on Monday.Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:'"
"'06-07-06,'1','""This investment is a catalyst to help spur implementations of WiMax globally,"" said Sean Maloney, executive vice president and general manager of Intel's mobility group. ""People have told us they want access to high-speed Internet wherever they are.""There are now 175 tests of WiMax going on around the world, Mr. Maloney said. He added that Intel planned to continue working with other companies in the WiMax market, and emphasized that the relationship with Clearwire was not exclusive.Motorola said it planned to sell wireless networking equipment to Clearwire. It declined to provide financial details.""Intel is basically setting the stage for WiMax to become the standard"" when cellular companies upgrade their networks, said Jagdish Rebello, wireless communications and consumer electronics at iSuppli, a consumer electronics market research firm. ""Intel has not been able to get traction with the carriers, and in Clearwire they have a good partner.""Intel is hoping that WiMax will have the same success as WiFi, and has already made a sizable investment in the technology in its own labs.The company is working to build WiMax ability into the next version of its Centrino chipset by the end of 2007, Mr. Maloney said. He said he expected Centrino with WiMax to take off over a period of two to three years, following much the same path as WiFi.""WiMax is the big sister of WiFi,"" he said. ""Eventually we see the two technologies merging.""The companies announced the investment after the close of regular trading Wednesday. Shares of Intel fell 61 cents, to $18.75. Motorola fell 33 cents, to $19.94. Both stocks rose slightly in after-hours trading.The investment in Clearwire is Intel Capital's biggest to date, by a large margin. The unit typically invests less than $5 million in companies working on emerging technologies, in most cases receiving a 20 percent stake. It said it would own a minority stake in Clearwire but would not specify its size.The investment sheds new light on Intel's strategy in the mobile communications market. Last month Intel sold its money-losing mobile chip business for $600 million. The decision to back Clearwire indicates that Intel is still anxious to expand its role in mobile computing and communications, analysts said.Clearwire announced in May that it hoped to raise $400 million in an initial public offering later this year. However, the company said Wednesday that it was canceling that plan. It did not explain its decision. The company offers WiMax service in 27 regions around the country, with about 18,000 subscribers in the United States and 11,500 in Belgium and Ireland.Mr. McCaw owns 47 percent of Clearwire's outstanding shares and controls 87 percent of the voting rights through a holding company. The company has yet to turn a profit. Last year it reported a net loss of $140 million on revenue of $33.5 million in 2005.'"
"'06-07-06,'1','Mr. Appleby perhaps had a greater impact in the less affluent neighborhoods of several cities, including New York at some of its most difficult times.""He was particularly effective in the housing area,"" said John E. Zucotti, the first deputy mayor in the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame. ""Tom laid the basis for housing programs that were introduced over the next 15 years, especially rehabilitation programs. And those programs expanded as the city's fiscal situation was resolved.""""In a period of scarce resources,"" Mr. Zucotti said, ""Tom made a little money go a very long way.""L. Thomas Appleby was born on Jan. 10, 1924, in Waterloo, Iowa. His father, Paul H. Appleby, wrote editorials for The Des Moines Register, and was later under secretary of agriculture in the Roosevelt administration.In World War II, Mr. Appleby served as an Army sergeant and saw action in France and Germany, including on D-Day and at the Battle of the Bulge.In 1949, he graduated from Grinnell College, and in 1955 he received a master's degree in public administration from the University of Minnesota.On a summer break from Grinnell after his junior year, Mr. Appleby worked as a student intern for the Syracuse Housing and Planning Commission. It was his first contact with the field of housing administration.From 1961 to 1965, he was the housing development administrator for New Haven, and from 1965 to 1969 he was executive director of the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency. In 1976, after his first stint with the United Nations corporation, Mr. Appleby was chosen by Mayor Beame to lead the city's Housing Development Administration, the forerunner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.In an interview after his appointment, Mr. Appleby disagreed with one of the most controversial statements made by his predecessor, Roger Starr. Mr. Starr had said that the city should adopt a policy of ""planned shrinkage"" of certain slum areas, like the South Bronx, by helping accelerate the population losses already occurring in those areas. Mr. Starr saw that as an alternative to continued service cuts forced by the fiscal crisis.Mr. Appleby countered: ""I don't think that as a matter of city policy we should accelerate losses of population in those areas. I don't think we can turn our backs on any areas.""A resident of Ossining, N.Y., Mr. Appleby is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Doris Chambers; a sister, Mary Ellen Sarbaugh of Gwynedd, Pa.; a son, Paul, of Forest Hills, Queens; two daughters, Ruth Appleby of Summit, N.J., and Karen Appleby of Ossining; and three grandchildren.Known as a soft-spoken, detail-minded man concerned with administrative efficiency rather than as an outspoken housing policy advocate, Mr. Appleby once said that he had come into his city housing post ""with no political clout; the mayor chose me because I was a professional who he thought could do the job.""Asked if that meant he had great faith in his abilities, Mr. Appleby said, ""Either that or I'm dumb.""'"

"'06-07-06,'1','South Korean officials indicated that they would withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer the North had sought in aid this year. South Korea has already delivered 350,000 tons of fertilizer this year.But South Korean officials made it clear they would maintain their basic efforts to engage North Korea through economic cooperation, a policy exemplified by a joint industrial complex in Kaesong, North Korea.China, North Korea's most significant ally, took the softest line of the three major regional powers, calling for calm from all sides.""We are seriously concerned about the events that have occurred,"" Liu Jianchao, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said in a statement.Japan toughened its foreign policy after North Korea launched a midrange missile, the Taepodong 1, over its territory in 1998. Japanese analysts said the launchings early Wednesday, and North Korea's growing defiance in the face of international condemnation, would further harden Japan's position.""This time, it's more serious than in 1998,"" said Yasunori Sone, a professor of politics at Keio University. ""North Korea is challenging everybody this time, even China and South Korea. I think the consequences in Japan will be even greater.""The rising threat from North Korea, Japanese analysts said, is likely to help Japan's political leadership persuade the Japanese public of the need to strengthen military ties with the United States, transform Japan's Self-Defense Forces into a full-fledged military and eventually revise Japan's pacifist Constitution.These changes could further strain Japan's relations with South Korea and China, which suffered under Japanese militarism and remain sensitive to any signs of its revival. Disputes with China and South Korea over territory and Mr. Koizumi's annual visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, where Japanese war criminals are enshrined, have already undermined Japanese influence in the region, said Kiichi Fujiwara, a professor of international relations at the University of Tokyo.""Our relations with South Korea and China are at their worst, and without their support we can't do anything against North Korea,"" Mr. Fujiwara said. ""If we want to be tough against North Korea with economic sanctions, we need the support of China and South Korea.""It is unlikely, regional analysts said, that China and South Korea, the North's two biggest trading partners, would agree to sanctions. Both countries have increased their economic activities with the North in recent years, partly to prevent it from collapsing and destabilizing the region, and partly to encourage the North to adopt economic reforms.Yoon Duk Min, a regional security specialist at the government-affiliated Institute for Foreign Affairs and National Security in Seoul, said South Korea, which has been accused of being soft on the North, would adopt a relatively tough stance toward the North in the short term.""There will be increasing doubts about the government's policy of engagement — criticism that we have been betrayed by North Korea by these launchings,"" Mr. Yoon said.But Mr. Yoon and other experts said South Korea was likely to resume its engagement policy after some period despite pressure from the United States and Japan to join them in an economic squeezing of the North. A consensus has taken root in South Korea that a conflict with the North should be avoided at all costs, and that improving relations remains the only feasible option even if that causes difficulties in the South's alliance with the United States.""Whatever happens, the current government, or whatever government that follows it, will find it very difficult to discard the engagement policy,"" said Hamm Taik Young, a political scientist at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. ""The cold war is over. We can't live on by branding North Korea as the enemy. North Korea is there. We have to deal with it.""Political analysts said the tests were a slap in the face for Beijing, though many expect it to still seek middle ground between North Korea and the United States and Japan.""This is a very frustrating development for our leaders, but the basic strategy will probably stay in place,"" said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at People's University in Beijing. ""They will not abandon their patient approach in seeking a long-term, peaceful solution.""'"

"'06-07-06,'1','Despite some signs of a weakening market, Manhattan's lofty real estate prices were little changed during the last quarter, according to a series of market reports released yesterday.The reports showed that the number of apartments on the market rose and the number of sales fell during the second quarter of the year, a shift that suggests an increase in bargaining power for buyers rather than sellers.But with the economy strong and apartments in demand, buyers so far have not been able to translate that market power into lower prices over all. According to one report, released by Prudential Douglas Elliman, average sales prices of Manhattan apartments were up to $1.39 million, an increase of 6.6 percent over the prices in the first quarter of this year and 5.2 percent above those in the same period a year ago.""People out there wondering whether it is the right time to buy should make a decision based on their lifestyle, not by trying to sharpshoot the market,"" said Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group.

"'06-07-06,'1','That discussion is not exactly out in the open, but television dramas provide the useful service of distancing the leadership from controversial messages. It has allowed those in power to continue to promote their religious credentials, a necessity as people here steadily become more religious, while also working to tame religious movements.Syrian television began to confront social problems in the 1980's with a political satire, ""Mirrors."" Another popular satirical series, ""Spotlight,"" started in 2001. It addressed topics like AIDS, polygamy and corruption, which are not normally discussed in this socially conservative society.But Najdat Anzour, the producer of ""Renegades,"" took things a step further last Ramadan with a series that depicted those who said they were killing innocent people in the name of God as cold-blooded killers.""Nobody tells me to do this,"" Mr. Anzour said, as he chain-smoked and ran his hand over his sweep of white hair. ""It is a joy, my pleasure. But it is also to defend our country.""Like many countries in the Middle East, Syria has had to confront not only a rise in religious identification but growing support for political Islam. The victory of Hamas in Palestinian elections in January and the failure of pan-Arabism, Socialism and Communism all have contributed to that trend and helped create an environment in which radical, intolerant interpretations of Islam have a better chance of taking hold, officials say.""There is a strain that teaches that there are two worlds: the world of Islam and the world it is at war against,"" said Muhammad Habash, a member of Parliament and director of a liberal Islamic Studies Center in Damascus. ""This is very dangerous, because according to some interpretations even some Islamic countries are considered part of this zone of war, because they are seen as not being fully Islamic.""For Syrian leaders, keeping a lid on such ideas is essential to maintaining order in a country with many ethnic groups and no clear shared sense of national identity.""What has happened in the world has fed the growth of religious identity, especially after the collapse of other ideologies like Arab nationalism or secularism,"" Mr. Ali said.This Ramadan, Mr. Ali will take up a variety of delicate issues in a series called ""Always,"" which he said he had finished shooting. The show centers on a group of friends who left Damascus after school only to return years later to confront social, political and economic changes, among them a growth in religiosity.""The city changed on different levels,"" Mr. Ali said. ""In recent years, religious thinking and ideology have spread, which is an expression of the collapse of political ideals, the collapse of dreams and ambitions.""If Mr. Ali's series is a bit subtle, Mr. Anzour's episode about the London bombings is a club over the head. In that program, one of 30 in the series, terrorists are condemned and Westerners are shown in an unflattering light. The only ones generally portrayed as decent and moral are observant Muslims who are tolerant and peaceful, as portrayed by the family of Yassin al-Bach, the missing man.Consider this interchange between his sister, Jasmine, and a colleague, Chris, in the restaurant where she works:Chris: ""What kind of woman are you? You should be hiding away at home.""Jasmine: ""Chris, what are you talking about?Chris: ""Is this the Islam you have been going on about all this time that you are so proud of? Is this the religion of peace? Killing innocent people and bombing civilians?""Jasmine: ""Those bombers were not acting on behalf of Islam. Islam is the religion of peace. It cannot by its nature be related to such violence. They misused Islam for their own purposes.""The overarching message of the show — which will be broadcast around the Middle East on satellite television — is that terrorists are terrorists and that they kill even good Muslims.""He is only 33,"" Mr. Bach's mother says tearfully in one of the final scenes. ""The head of my family. He is a religious Muslim who prays and fasts. He never committed a sin. Those people who killed innocents are not real Muslims. They attacked innocent people like my son. I am calling on Muslims all over the world to fight those who are killing in the name of Islam.""'"

"'06-07-08,'0','And, in a sharp contrast to the kind of less cautious statements he made about Iraq before the invasion in 2003, which were based on sometimes contradictory intelligence reports, he cast doubt on North Korea's claim that it possesses what it calls a ""nuclear deterrent.""Mr. Bush challenged a reporter who, in posing a question, asserted that the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il had increased the size of his nuclear arsenal during Mr. Bush's presidency. ""I don't think we know that,"" the president shot back. But, in what may have been a sign of his wariness about intelligence assessments of opaque nations, he pointedly declined to say what assessment he believed was correct.""Maybe you know but you're not telling,"" one reporter said. Mr. Bush said, ""That's an option,"" and then, to laughter, added, ""Or maybe I don't know and don't want to tell you I don't know.""A new national intelligence estimate of North Korea's capabilities was completed earlier this year, but the administration has declined to publish a declassified version of it. According to officials who are familiar with its contents, it concludes that North Korea probably produced enough fuel for six or more nuclear weapons, from a supply of 8,000 spent reactor fuel rods that the country boasts it reprocessed after throwing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency out of the country three years ago.""What we don't know is whether they turned those into weapons,"" said one senior intelligence official in a recent interview who asked not to be named because he was discussing intelligence issues. ""You can assume it, but it is just an assumption.""Mr. Bush's discussion of ""red lines"" — a term drawn from the cold war limits over steps the United States and Soviet Union agreed not to take for fear they could spiral into outright war — was important because until now his aides have said such limits do not work in North Korea's case. Three years ago, one of Mr. Bush's senior aides said it would be useless to tell North Korea that turning its spent fuel into plutonium was a ""red line"" because the United States had no effective way to enforce the threat. The North Koreans went ahead anyway, lines or no lines.It was the ambitious North Korean program to extend the reach of its missiles — along with its work on producing nuclear warheads — that many proponents of the missile defense plan cited to justify the Pentagon's huge expenditures on the new defensive system, which is costing about $9 billion a year and is still in the early stages of a long and complex development process.After deciding to field a first batch of interceptors without fully testing them, in what commanders have called a ""thin line"" of defense against a small-scale attack, the Pentagon interrupted its testing for more than a year after a series of failures. The testing of missiles and radars has now resumed, with an important set of test shots expected to begin as early as this summer. If they succeed, officials have told Congress, there will be better ground for confidence that the system would be able to intercept a missile launched from North Korea or from Iran.As things stand now, though, there is considerable uncertainty over both sides of the technology race: How long it will take North Korea to produce a missile capable of posing a serious risk to the United States, and how long it will take to build a reliable defensive system?Though North Korea and the struggle over responding to the missile tests dominated the news conference, Mr. Bush denied that the United States was trimming back on its search for Osama bin Laden by disbanding a unit within the Central Intelligence Agency that focused on that hunt.""We got a lot of assets looking for Osama bin Laden,"" Mr. Bush said. ""So whatever you want to read in that story, it's just not true, period."" He added later: ""In my judgment, it's just a matter of time, unless we stop looking. And we're not going to stop looking so long as I'm the president, not only for Osama bin Laden, but anybody else who plots and plans attacks against the United States of America.""He repeated his conviction that the United States would prevail in Iraq, but also seemed intent on dampening speculation about significant reductions of forces in coming months. ""An artificial timetable of withdrawal and early withdrawal before this finishes sends the message to the enemy: 'We were right about America,' "" Mr. Bush said, repeating his argument that Al Qaeda seeks to turn Iraq into a haven for training.But when the subject turned back to North Korea, Mr. Bush by turns argued that Mr. Kim was untrustworthy — he cited the country's violation of a 1994 accord with the Clinton administration — and that the only path was to negotiate with him. But he rejected conducting one-on-one negotiations, insisting that he needed China and other neighbors at the table so that Mr. Kim did not make the United States to appear the blockade to an agreement.""One thing I'm not going to let us do is get caught in the trap of sitting at the table alone with the North Koreans,"" Mr. Bush insisted, rejecting the criticism by Democrats who say such talks would be the only way to break the logjam.""If you want to solve a problem diplomatically, you need partners to do so,"" Mr. Bush said, adding later that his worry about ""handling this issue bilaterally is that you run out of options very quickly.""But in citing anew the need to team up with China and South Korea, Mr. Bush was skipping past the warnings of members of his own administration that neither country would agree to sanctions. Both are worried about a North Korean collapse, and both have continued supplying North Korea with food, energy and investment — even while Japan and the United States try to turn off the spigot.Mr. Bush has been careful never to criticize either country publicly. But he seemed to do so obliquely when he said, with some frustration in his voice: ""The problem with diplomacy, it takes a while to get something done. If you're acting alone, you can move quickly. When you're rallying world opinion and trying to, you know, come up with the right language at the United Nations to send a clear signal, it takes a while.""'"
"'06-07-08,'0','Mrs. Clinton, who is running for re-election this year, reacted to the court ruling in a statement; she was traveling on the West Coast yesterday, and at one point ignored shouted questions from reporters about the decision.""Senator Clinton supports full equality for people in committed relationships, including health insurance, life insurance and pensions, and hospital visitation and believes we have to keep working to reach those goals,"" said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton.Asked if Mrs. Clinton's support for ""full equality"" was tantamount to supporting gay marriage, Ms. Hanley said the senator supported civil unions, a legal arrangement that includes the civil benefits of marriage but does not disturb tradition.Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, said Mrs. Clinton's position was at odds with the personal wishes of many gay New Yorkers.""All of these rights are important, but full equality means marriage equality, period,"" Mr. Foreman said.Alan Van Capelle, a gay rights leader in New York who has criticized Mrs. Clinton's position in the past, sought to isolate her from other prominent Democrats in New York who support gay marriage.""I am glad Senator Clinton supports specific benefits for people in committed relationships, and one day I hope she will stand with Eliot Spitzer, Alan Hevesi, Dennis Rivera and hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who are working to make sure gay and lesbian people have the freedom to marry,"" said Mr. Van Capelle, who is executive director of the Empire State Pride Agenda.New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, also said yesterday that he supported civil unions and that the Legislature, not the Court of Appeals, should decide any policy on gay marriage.His view drew criticism from the gay rights advocates along the same lines that Mrs. Clinton faced, but it was less fierce.Because she is widely viewed as a possible Democratic candidate for the White House in 2008, Mrs. Clinton's view on gay marriage has national implications, advocates said. And some of them are still irritated that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, signed a bill in office banning federal recognition of gay marriage, and suggested that gay marriage was an issue that contributed to the defeat of John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','An administrative law judge has allowed the Swiss drug maker Roche Holding to continue to import into the United States an experimental anemia drug involved in a patent fight between Roche and a rival, Amgen, the companies said yesterday.The companies said that the judge at the International Trade Commission had determined that Roche could import its experimental drug peg-EPO, also known as Cera, under a special exception for clinical trials.Amgen, the biotechnology company based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., had requested that the trade commission prohibit Roche from importing the drug, which is not yet approved.Roche said the decision cleared the way for it to focus on obtaining regulatory approval. It has said it intends to file this year for clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to sell the drug.Amgen is trying to stave off competition from Roche's drug Cera, which could rival Amgen's anemia drug Epogen. Amgen earned $6 billion in 2005 from sales of Epogen and a related version called Aranesp.Roche argued that Cera did not infringe Amgen's patent because it was linked to a chemical that made it last longer in the body than Epogen.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','Dr. Joseph J. Schildkraut, a Harvard psychiatrist whose studies of antidepressants and their effects on brain chemistry shed light on the biochemical basis of depression and mood disorders, died on June 26 in Boston. He was 72 and a resident of nearby Chestnut Hill.His death was announced by Harvard.In the 1960's Dr. Schildkraut wrote what has become his principal research paper. It was a look at catecholamines, a class of naturally occurring compounds that act as messenger chemicals within the brain.He studied one of the compounds, norepinephrine, in patients before and during treatment with antidepressants and found that depression inhibited its effectiveness as a chemical messenger, or neurotransmitter. He then used his findings to theorize broadly about the biochemical underpinnings of mental illnesses.Those findings, published in 1965 in The American Journal of Psychiatry, ""captured the imagination of the field and helped us to understand the biology of psychiatric disorders,"" said Dr. Alan I. Green, chairman of the psychiatry department at Dartmouth Medical School.""One important implication from that paper was that you could then identify different subgroups of patients with similar disorders through the study of biochemical processes,"" added Dr. Green, a former collaborator with Dr. Schildkraut at Harvard.Dr. Schildkraut went on to study the biochemical actions of antipsychotic drugs. He helped to found the Neuropsychopharmacology Laboratory at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center in Boston, where he worked to find clinical applications for his research.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','Nonetheless, the size and sober grandeur of Mr. Pei's building still suggests a museum awaiting a collection. But at least the museum exists, something that at times seemed less than certain.""Stop, start, stop, start,"" Mr. Pei, 89, said good-naturedly of the journey he began when he first visited Luxembourg in 1989.The debate over Modern-versus-contemporary bubbled on for years, but the Grand Duchy's politicians were also divided over the museum's location, with the Dräi Eechelen Park district finally chosen after much haggling. When it was decided to erect the museum on the ruins of one abandoned fortress and beside another, fresh disputes erupted over what to do with the fortresses. Finally, in 1997, it was agreed that the museum of Modern art should be built over Fort Thüngen and linked to a new Fortress Museum created next door. And this is what Mr. Pei's design reflected when construction began in 1999.But the museum's troubles were still not over. A dispute over the stone to be used at the museum — Mr. Pei insisted on a honey-colored French stone — led to a four-year legal wrangle and further delays. Then, late in the day, the director of the new Fortress Museum said he did not want it to be connected to the museum of Modern art.""The original idea was to go from the old into the new,"" Mr. Pei noted, explaining how he imagined visitors entering his building's sun-splashed atrium. ""Instead we had to turn things round and make the entrance at what was meant to be the back.""In truth, the museum has not suffered enormously, since gardens and a plaza now lead to an entrance beneath the intersection of two dramatic stone-faced walls. Something resembling a moat around the building also highlights the ruins of the old 18th-century fortress.If from some angles the museum's exterior itself evokes a fortress, it is one topped by an angular, 100-foot-high glass cupola. As a result, the main floor is full of light. A lower floor has an auditorium and two small galleries, while larger galleries on the second floor are top-lighted. Mr. Pei has also designed wonderfully sculptured stone staircases and added an octagonal glass pavilion reached along a passage leading into the gardens.Yet, for all the museum's welcoming mood, it may take time for contemporary art, with its emphasis on Conceptual and video art, to feel at home in a building as classically modern as this.Cai Guo-Qiang's installation ""The Net"" makes a brave effort at occupying the atrium's floor: it comprises an overturned boat punctured with golden arrows and held up at one end by a pole, as if it were an animal trap; a rope connects it to a large bird cage filled with chattering canaries. Nari Ward's installation of hanging bottles, ""Bottle Messenger,"" also looks good in the pavilion.Among works commissioned by the museum is ""Studio,"" by Tobias Putrih and Sancho Silva, in which the artists have filled a gallery with furniture made of plywood sections that can be attached and detached to make chairs, tables, beds, cupboards and the like. So visitors are invited to make their own furniture.Perhaps most impressive, though, is Wim Delvoye's ""Chapel,"" an installation that fills a small gallery with iron pillars, Gothic arches and seemingly abstract stained-glass windows. Close inspection of the windows reveals not religious images, but an array of X-rays of body parts, including the heads — or, rather skulls — of two people kissing, seen from different angles.With the building completed, the museum itself is very much a work in progress. Preferring not to look back at art the museum cannot afford, Ms. Beaud describes it as a museum for the 21st century. But next year it will already have a new role to play. In 2007 Luxembourg will hold the rotating title of Cultural Capital of Europe. With its new museum, the Grand Duchy will now have something to show off.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','But critics contend that Microsoft's supremacy can be a shortcoming. The firm is enmeshed in a long-running antitrust dispute with the European Union over Microsoft's dominance — some say bullying — of the marketplace.The stock has also been depressed by repeated delays in introducing two products: Vista, the next-generation operating system, and a new version of Office. Analysts fear further postponements as Microsoft tries for a simultaneous release.Barbara Walchli, manager of the Aquila Rocky Mountain Equity fund, said that as Microsoft stumbles, other companies keep pressing forward with technological advances. ""It's a threat they aren't necessarily attacking as well as they can, and so they're creating opportunities for other people,"" she said.Those opportunities will grow, she said, if Microsoft clings to its reliance on delivering software through arrangements with PC makers. ""More and more software is being bought on the Internet, not on PC's,"" Ms. Walchli said. ""That's the next big wave of threats that the company has to watch out for.""One company that, she says, ""will benefit as the Microsoft model becomes less successful"" is a small supplier of business software with an appropriate name, given the Vista and Office delays: RightNow Technologies.But there is some evidence that Microsoft may not be so set in its ways. Its founder, Bill Gates, does not seem to be. Another middle-aged man thirsting for change might have bought a motorcycle. Instead, Mr. Gates has announced that he will give up day-to-day management to concentrate on philanthropy. He will be spending billions that he earned at Microsoft, and billions more that his friend, Warren E. Buffett, will be funneling into the Gates FoundationMary Meeker, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, told the bank's clients that Mr. Gates's decision was ""good for Bill, good for Microsoft and good for the world."" She said that it would help the company to stay ""current in the rapidly evolving world of technology"" and that Mr. Gates's ""absence will likely create a newfound sense of motivation among a group of very aggressive and talented people.""Ms. Meeker rates Internet and consumer software stocks as generally attractive. Within that context, she is neutral on Microsoft shares.ONE area in which Mr. Mowrey sees Microsoft devoting energy creatively and profitably is games. ""The Xbox machines are fantastic, the games are great, and Sony can't do anything to save itself,"" he said, comparing Microsoft with one of its leading competitors in the business.He is also pleased by Microsoft's ""shift into the living room,"" the company's development of applications that allow computing to be integrated better into everyday life. One example is Media Center, which incorporates software for digital photography and for playing videos and music. The company bills it as ""your all-in-one PC and home entertainment center"" on its Web site.The idea makes sense because ""everyone's got a digital camera and downloads music, even if they steal it,"" Mr. Mowrey said. A more important aspect of endeavors like Media Center is that they reveal the maturing company's desire to recapture the brilliance of its youth.""Whether it's some grand growth driver or not, I like that Microsoft is spearheading the effort,"" he said.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','THE media columnist Jack Shafer was confused, and maybe a little jealous. He wondered last week why a two-year-old article by Paul Boutin, his fellow Slate writer, was suddenly drawing huge traffic numbers. Mr. Boutin's article was a light, news-free feature about a Web site (tired.com) that asks users if they are tired, and if they are, to explain why. Mr. Shafer, meanwhile, was pounding away on columns about the hottest media topics — and drawing considerably less traffic.""Not to take anything away from Boutin,"" Mr. Shafer wrote, ""but the piece isn't anywhere near his best"" (slate.com).Mr. Shafer found a reason for the sudden surge of traffic: somebody had come across the old article and posted it to Digg. com, where registered users vote on which articles are the most (or the least) interesting or worthwhile.Chris Anderson, editor of Wired magazine, would no doubt see this as a perfect example of ""the long tail"" in full wag. The lengthening of the long tail means that old or minimally popular stuff — like an old Slate article or a new album by an obscure Bolivian folk musician — is becoming more valuable thanks to the falling costs of production, storage and distribution. Or as Mr. Anderson puts it on his blog, markets are ""increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of 'hits' at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail"" (longtail.com).He first wrote about this phenomenon in Wired two years ago, igniting a lively online conversation that continues. His book on the subject ""The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More"" will hit shelves on Tuesday.'"
"'06-07-08,'0','""Unfortunately, the Vatican listened to irresponsible suggestions by a clergyman in Hong Kong and issued a severe condemnation"" of the appointments, Ye Xiaowen, the director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs, said in an interview.Cardinal Zen said that some Chinese government officials saw him as siding with the Vatican against his country. He described that as ""a really foolish way of thinking,"" adding: ""I may also contribute to the Chinese side because I can explain to them what is the normal operation of a church in China or elsewhere, to free them from many fears they have against the church.""Cardinal Zen has legions of defenders in the West, and even some on the mainland. China's Confucian tradition, never stamped out under Communism, confers high status on scholars, and Cardinal Zen is widely admired as a thoughtful, soft-spoken man who speaks several Chinese languages in addition to fluent English, Italian and Latin.Lu Xinhua, the commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong, said that he had not met the cardinal since his arrival here early this year but that he hoped to do so. ""I've heard he is a teacher, and from talking to him I can deepen myself,"" he said.CARDINAL ZEN grew up in a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Shanghai, where as a boy he enjoyed family trips to a Salesian church atop a hill on the city's outskirts.""That holy shrine is really an attraction, and so when we were children it was a big event to be able to go on pilgrimage"" there, he recalled in an interview.The family, never well off, fell into poverty following the Japanese capture of Shanghai in 1937. His father first lost his job doing technical drawings and then had a stroke that left him paralyzed. But the son pursued his education, for free, with the Salesian order, and went to Hong Kong and then Turin, Italy, to study for the priesthood.Like many here, he watched with fascination and then horror as the democracy protests unfolded in Beijing in the spring of 1989. The killings of protesters in and around Tiananmen Square was a turning point in his life, he said, motivating him to spend the next seven years traveling to mainland seminaries to teach.""This force supported me from 1989 to 1996 to spend half of my life in China nurturing people who can work for the church and become shepherds of the church in China,"" Cardinal Zen said in his speech on June 4 this year.He kept fairly quiet about his own political views during those years, as he developed close friendships in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere with many priests and bishops in both the government-supervised churches and the ""underground."" The underground churches are closely watched by the police and face levels of persecution that vary widely among provinces.It was after he became Hong Kong's junior bishop, in 1996, that he began to develop a reputation for strong comments about civil liberties. But he became much more outspoken after September 2002, when he took over the Hong Kong diocese following the death of the senior bishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal John Wu. He soon emerged as a leader in the successful campaign to block the imposition of stringent internal security regulations here, an effort that brought 500,000 people into the streets on July 1, 2003.Cardinal Zen is frequently criticized for campaigning for greater democracy in Hong Kong but opposing elections for church leaders. He denies that this poses a contradiction.""The faith community is a free community, so you may join and you may not join,"" he said. ""You must be a member of a state, a nation, and then, there, you must have your rights to be one of the community, and to defend your own rights — you must have a voice.""The cardinal said that a more independent church in the mainland would stick to religious issues and not become the same beacon for democracy that it has been in Hong Kong. ""I don't think they can afford that because they have to concentrate on fighting for their freedom,"" he said.SOME of his critics, including within the Roman Catholic Church, have suggested that his bluntness and strong emphasis on civil liberties could upset delicate, informal contacts between the Holy See and Beijing aimed at re-establishing diplomatic relations severed after the Communist takeover of China in 1949.While Cardinal Zen has frosty relations with the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, he has won the respect of the Foreign Ministry, which wants the Holy See to break its ties to Taiwan — a step the cardinal has been willing to accept.""He wants to play a role in Sino-Vatican relations, and we understand that,"" said Mr. Lu, the Foreign Ministry official in Hong Kong.There has been speculation that Cardinal Zen might be summoned to Rome, but the cardinal has a longer-term ambition: to return to the city of his youth as a teacher of priests, ideally living at a seminary that has a view of the shrine he used to visit as a boy.""Surely, in Shanghai I would be watched very carefully, so there is no danger for them to let me go to Shanghai,"" he said wistfully, before reflecting on the likelihood of such a move. ""But now it's impossible, because nobody would dare to invite me.""'"

"'06-07-09,'0','LOVE IS LIKE SOUNDS Late snow fell this early morning of spring. At dawn I rose from bed, restless, and looked Out of my window, to wonder if there the snow Fell outside your bedroom, and you watching. I played my game of solitaire. The cards Came out the same the third time through the deck. The game was stuck. I threw the cards together, And watched the snow that could not do but fall. Love is like sounds, whose last reverberations Hang on the leaves of strange trees, on mountains As distant as the curving of the earth, Where the snow hangs still in the middle of the air. EXILE Each of us waking to the window's light Has found the curtains changed, our pictures gone; Our furniture has vanished in the night And left us to an unfamiliar dawn; Even the contours of the room are strange And everything is change. Waking, our minds construct of memory What figure stretched beside us, or what voice Shouted to pull us from our luxury - And all the mornings leaning to our choice. To put away - both child and murderer - The toys we played with just a month ago, That wisdom come, and make our progress sure, Began our exile with our lust to grow. (Remembering a train I tore apart Because it knew my heart.) We move to move, and this perversity Betrays us into loving only loss. We seek betrayal. When we cross the sea, It is the distance from our past we cross. Not only from the intellectual child Time has removed us, but unyieldingly Cuts down the groves in which our Indians filed And where the black of pines was mystery. (I walked the streets of where I lived and grew, And all the streets were new.) The room of love is always rearranged. Someone has torn the corner of a chair So that the past we call upon has changed, The scene deprived by an intruding tear. Exiled by death from people we have known, We are reduced again by years, and try To call them back and clothe the barren bone, Not to admit that people ever die. (A boy who talked and read and grew with me Fell from a maple tree.) But we are still alone, who love the dead, And always miss their action's character, Caught in the cage of living, visited By no faint ghosts, by no gray men that were. In years, and in the numbering of space, Moving away from what we grew to know, We stray like paper blown from place to place, Impelled by every element to go. (I think of haying on an August day, Forking the stacks of hay.) We can remember trees and attitudes That foreign landscapes do not imitate; They grow distinct within the interludes Of memory beneath a stranger state. The favorite toy was banished, and our act Was banishment of the self; then growing, we Betrayed the girls we loved, for our love lacked Self-knowledge of its real perversity. (I loved her, but I told her I did not, And grew, and then forgot.) It was mechanical, and in our age, That cruelty should be our way of speech; Our movement is a single pilgrimage, Never returning; action does not teach. In isolation from our present love We make her up, consulting memory, Imagining to watch her image move On daily avenues across a sea. (All day I saw her daydreamed figure stand Out of the reach of hand.) Each door and window is a spectral frame In which her shape is for the moment found; Each lucky scrap of paper bears her name, And half-heard phrases imitate its sound. Imagining, by exile kept from fact, We build of distance mental rock and tree, And make of memory creative act, Persons and worlds no waking eye can see. (From lacking her, I built her new again, And loved the image then.) The manufactured country is so green The eyes of sleep are blinded by its shine; We spend our lust in that imagined scene But never wake to cross its borderline. No man can knock his human fist upon The door built by his mind, or hear the voice He meditated come again if gone; We live outside the country of our choice. (I wanted X. When X moved in with me, I could not wait to flee.) Our humanness betrays us to the cage Within whose limits each is free to walk, But where no one can hear our prayers or rage And none of us can break the walls to talk. Exiled by years, by death no dream conceals, By worlds that must remain unvisited, And by the wounds that growing never heals, We are as solitary as the dead, Wanting to king it in that perfect land We make and understand. And in this world whose pattern is unmade, Phases of splintered light and shapeless sand, We shatter through our motions and evade Whatever hand might reach and touch our hand. Newdigate Prize, Oxford, 1953 WE'VE COME TO EXPECT We've come to expect earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, and tidal waves from our whitecoated brothers whose laboratories shed radiation on land and landscape, disabling cities. Foresighted citizens outfit granite arks in Idaho's brown hills, stocked against flood, famine, pestilence, war, and hunger of neighbors, with bulgur, freeze-dried Stroganoff, and Uzis. Let's remember: Our great-grandfathers holed up in mountains with pistols and pemmican, their manhood sufficient, should they avoid peritonitis and gangrene, to perform the mechanic alchemy which liquefied landscape, dirt to nuggets, and sluiced a state golden. Let's remember not only the local wars over claims but a late conflict of siblings in aristocracy and the stock market, sharing destruction. Or recollect the brothers who stayed back east laboring in the shoe factory, or their bosses who summered hunting in Scotland and reside forever in the Protestant Cemetery at Rome among cats, the pyramid of Cestius, and Keats's grave. What use are those forefathers to our condition? We want comfort: Shall we consult Jefferson? Alas, he's busy conducting a call-in show for Republican-Democrats. Franklin? He is occupied obliterating SIN from Webster's project. If we approach doddering George Washington, he only smiles at us in his foolishness. Shall we call upon Abraham Lincoln for succor? No: The Great Emancipator succumbs to Grant's whiskey. As we approach the present, passing double Roosevelts, we do not help ourselves - not with old Eisenhower cursing at caddies; not with Nixon cursing. But if we return past Jonathan Edwards, past Cotton Mather, to the Israelites of the Mayflower - who make covenant with Jehovah's promised wilderness and the manna of Indian corn, who stay secure in Adam's fall and the broken promises of the remnant - we discover ancestors appropriate to our lapsarian state: Their rage sustains us THE PAINTED BED ""Even when I danced erect by the Nile's garden I constructed Necropolis. ""Ten million fellaheen cells of my body floated stones to establish a white museum."" Grisly, foul, and terrific is the speech of bones, thighs and arms slackened into desiccated sacs of flesh hanging from an armature where muscle was, and fat. ""I lie on the painted bed diminishing, concentrated on the journey I undertake to repose without pain in the palace of darkness, my body beside your body."" SECRETS You climbed Hawk's Crag, a cellphone in your baggy shorts, and gazed into the leafing trees and famous blue water. You telephoned, in love with the skin of the world. I heard you puff as you started to climb down, still talking, switching your phone from hand to hand as the stone holds required. You sang show tunes sitting above me, clicking your fingers, swaying your shadowy torso. We attended to each other in a sensuous dazzle as global as suffering until gradual gathering spilled like water over the stone dam and we soared level across the long-lived lake. But how can one flesh and consciousness adhere to another, knowing that every adherence ends in separation? I longed for your return, your face lit by a candle, your smile private as a kore's under an inconstant flame - and dreamt I stared into the flat and black of water, afraid to drown. It is half a year since we slept beside each other all night. I wake hollow as a thighbone with its marrow picked out. In falling snow, a crow pecks under the empty birdfeeder. When the house lights go out in wind and heavy snow, the afternoon already black, I lie frightened in darkness on the unsheeted bed. No one comes to my door. Old age concludes in making wills and trusts and inventories, in knees that buckle going downstairs.

"'06-07-09,'0','Congressional analysts say the surprise windfall could shrink the deficit this year to $300 billion, from $318 billion in 2005 and an all-time high of $412 billion in 2004.Republicans are already arguing that the revenue jump proves that their tax cuts, especially the 2003 tax cut on stock dividends, would spur the economy and ultimately increase revenues.""The tax relief we delivered has helped unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of America and kept our economy the envy of the world,"" President Bush said in his weekly radio address on Saturday.Democrats and many independent budget analysts note that overall revenues have barely climbed back to the levels reached in 2000, and that the government has borrowed trillions of dollars against Social Security surpluses just as the first of the nation's baby boomers are nearing retirement.""The fact is that revenues are way below what the administration said they would be a few years ago,"" said Thomas S. Kahn, staff director for Democrats on the House Budget Committee. ""The long-term prognosis is still very, very bleak, and the administration doesn't have any kind of long-term plan.""One reason the run-up in taxes looks good is because the past five years looked so bad. Revenues are up, but they have lagged well behind economic growth.The surge could also evaporate as quickly as it appeared. Over the past decade, tax revenues have become much more volatile, alternately soaring and plunging in the wake of swings in the stock market and repeatedly defying government projections.Nevertheless, the short-term change has been striking. At the beginning of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projected that this year's deficit would be $371 billion and the White House Office of Management and Budget put the figure at $423 billion.Corporate tax payments are expected to exceed $300 billion, up from $131 billion three years ago. The other big increase is an extraordinary jump in individual taxes that were not withheld from paychecks, usually a reflection of taxes on investment income and executive bonuses.The jump in receipts is providing Mr. Bush and Republicans in Congress with a new opportunity to assert that tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are working and that Congress should make them permanent.Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative political fund-raising group, said: ""The supply-siders were absolutely right. All the major sources of revenue have grown, especially in areas where we said they would.""But budget analysts, supporters and critics of Mr. Bush alike, cautioned that this year's windfall would do little to improve the government's long-term budget woes.Government spending under Mr. Bush continued to climb rapidly this year, more than twice as fast as the economy. Spending on the war in Iraq has accelerated, to about $120 billion this year.Far more ominously, the nation's oldest baby boomers will be eligible for Social Security benefits in just two years. Conservatives and liberals alike predict a huge escalation in costs of Social Security and Medicare over the next several decades.""The long-term outlook is such a deep well of sorrow that I can't get much happiness out of this year,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a former White House economist under President Bush.Despite almost five years of economic growth, individual income taxes — the biggest component of federal tax revenues — have yet to reach the levels of 2000. Even with surging payments for investment profits and business income, individual tax payments in 2005 were only $972 billion — below the $1 trillion reached in 2000, even without adjusting for inflation.Over all, individual and corporate taxes have lagged well behind the economy's growth over the past five years. Government spending, by contrast, mushroomed far faster than the economy.And federal debt has ballooned to $8.3 trillion, up from $5.6 trillion when Mr. Bush took office. Republicans are trying to raise the authorized debt ceiling to $9.6 trillion.War costs for Iraq and Afghanistan have totaled more than $300 billion since 2003, and the Bush administration has not included any war costs in its budget estimates beyond next year.Domestic discretionary programs, like education and space exploration, have slowed their growth after climbing rapidly in Mr. Bush's first term. But entitlement programs, particularly Medicaid and Medicare, are climbing rapidly as a result of rising medical prices and Mr. Bush's prescription drug program.Outlays for Medicare have climbed 15 percent this year and are expected to hit $300 billion. About half of that increase results from the new prescription drug program, which is expected to cost nearly $1 trillion over the next 10 years.""Even if spending is not going up as fast as it was before, it's not coming down,"" said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that advocates budget discipline.Despite a public outcry this year over pork-barrel spending sought by individual lawmakers for local projects, Mr. Bixby said, the main causes of higher spending stem from the war in Iraq and entitlement programs.Both supporters and critics of Mr. Bush cautioned against attributing much long-term significance to the recent fiscal improvement, in part because tax revenues have become more volatile.In the late 1990's, revenues exceeded predictions by more than $100 billion a year. After the recession of 2001, revenues plunged about $100 billion below what could be explained by slower economic growth and higher unemployment.One reason for the increased volatility may be that, contrary to a popular assumption, a disproportionate share of income taxes is paid by wealthy households, and their incomes are based much more on the swings of the stock market than on wages and salaries. About one-third of all income taxes are paid by households in the top 1 percent of income earners, who make more than about $300,000 a year. Because those households also earn the overwhelming share of taxable investment income and executive bonuses, both their incomes and their tax liabilities swing sharply in bull and bear markets.""These people have incomes that fluctuate much more rapidly, so when the economy is doing well and the stock market is doing well, tax revenues will be up,"" said Brian Riedl, a budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization. ""Rapidly fluctuating tax revenues will continue to be the norm for years to come.""Compared with the size of the economy, tax revenues are still below historical norms and far below what the administration predicted as recently as 2003.Tax receipts amounted to about 17.5 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2005, far below the level five years ago and still slightly below the average of 18 percent since World War II. Spending, by contrast, is running at about 20 percent of gross domestic product .""Spending has not been restrained,"" Mr. Riedl said. ""One hundred percent of the reduced deficit is because taxpayers are sending more money to Washington.""'"
"'06-07-09,'0','In Dili, residents said they were relieved. ""I guarantee Horta is the best we have,"" said Oldegar Massinga, who works for a United Nations agency, in a telephone interview. ""Now he has to send the refugees back home and put a police post in every place in Dili.""The immediate challenge for Mr. Ramos-Horta, who was foreign minister in the previous government, will be to convince the more than 100,000 people who fled Dili and outlying areas during violence last month to return home. The refugees are living in makeshift camps but have said they were reluctant to leave the camps, watched over by the Australians and other members of the 2,700-troop peacekeeping force, while armed groups still roam the capital.The violence in the capital, Dili, spun out of control in May after 600 soldiers were dismissed from East Timor's army of 1,400. Battles between members of the army and the police spread into general gang warfare and looting, bringing the government to a standstill.It was the first major breakdown of law and order since East Timor, with a population of less than a million, declared independence in 2002 after three years of rule by the United Nations, and three decades of occupation by neighboring Indonesia.The recent violence came after the United Nations and the World Bank had praised East Timor as a model example of a new nation. Several billion dollars in international aid was spent to help East Timor build its own army, police force and judicial system, and on the United Nations peacekeeping force that came to East Timor after a vote in favor of independence in 1999.Mr. Ramos-Horta, 56, shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 with the Roman Catholic bishop of Dili, Carlos Ximenes Belo. They were cited for their courage in resisting and campaigning against occupation by Indonesia, which invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975.While the bishop stayed in East Timor, Mr. Ramos-Horta traveled the world after the invasion, trying to raise awareness about the plight of his people. A recent United Nations-backed commission estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed in East Timor by the Indonesian military.Two weeks ago, a special envoy of the United Nations, Ian Martin, arrived in East Timor with a team of experts to assess what kind of new aid the United Nations might provide. Mr. Martin has said that a United Nations police force would likely be dispatched, and that a peacekeeping force was a possibility.In the past two weeks, Mr. Ramos-Horta has been critical of Mr. Alkatiri, the ousted prime minister, saying that he was almost certainly involved in arming a civilian militia. He also criticized the former prime minister's failure to organize public-works programs for the large numbers of unemployed young men in East Timor.While East Timor has one of the world's lowest per capita incomes, it possesses large oil deposits and has recently accrued more than $600 million in oil revenue that remains virtually untouched. Mr. Ramos-Horta said in a recent interview that it was imperative for a new government to provide employment programs.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','A six-story building that covers a full city block just south of the campus once housed Trico Products, a homegrown company that started making windshield wipers in 1917 and once had three plants in the area. But Trico transferred thousands of jobs to Mexico and Texas and closed its last Buffalo factory in 2004.Many companies, especially steel makers and other manufacturers, plied a similar route, with people following jobs out of Buffalo. The city's population plummeted to 282,864 in 2004 from 580,132 in 1950. According to the State Department of Labor, the region lost 21,300 manufacturing jobs from 2001 to 2005.While no one expects the new biotechnology sector to fill the gaping job void left by heavy industry, the Center of Excellence has already yielded dividends. By the end of last year, 2,386 jobs had been created at the center or with new spinoff companies, according to the center.Marnie LaVigne, the center's director of business development, said 1,667 jobs had been retained because the center helped keep some companies in Buffalo or recruited new companies to replace those that left.The center's growth has often been obscured by the continued decline of the industrial sector. Last month, a bankruptcy judge approved a plan by the region's largest private employer, Delphi Corporation, the auto-parts maker, to reduce the work force at its plant in nearby Lockport, which employs about 3,800.The complexity of the science itself, which involves collecting and analyzing genetic and molecular data using supercomputers, also makes the venture somewhat abstract to many in a traditionally blue-collar city.""Bioinformatics seems to be a word people remember because they don't know what it means,"" said Bruce A. Holm, the executive director of the Center of Excellence and a senior vice provost at the University at Buffalo, part of the State University of New York.The center, proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki in his 2001 State of the State address, has received $89.4 million from the state, $27.7 million from the federal government, and $60 million in private investment.Conceived as a research facility, it has expanded into what Dr. Holm called a ""lab-bench-to-bedside approach.""""You approach the questions from a different viewpoint: you see what impact the research has on actual patients,"" said Steven R. Gill, an associate professor at the university who studies bacteria that cause diseases and those occurring naturally in the human body. ""And that's what the research is really for: to help. Geneticists and researchers get trapped in looking at a very small question; they can have blinders on. Working with a clinician, you see the big picture.""The center also strives to combine science and business. Differences over its philosophy contributed to the departure of its first executive director, Jeffrey Skolnick, whom Mr. Pataki called a ""superstar"" in announcing his appointment in 2002. Late last year, Mr. Skolnick left for Georgia Tech, taking 20 top researchers with him. As a result, a new recruiting campaign opened to attract 20 top scientists and their research teams.Dr. Holm said combining research and business had always been a goal of the center. ""If you just focus in that one area,"" Dr. Holm said of research, ""you're not going to get economic development.""The center's staff helps scientists and doctors to seek financing for their research and to set up their own companies to market the resulting products.""Scientists tend not to be very good at running a business, and a lot of times, not very interested in it,"" Dr. Holm said. ""Once they discover something, they think the whole world will just adopt it.""So far, 15 new companies have grown out of the center, including Empire Genomics, founded by the center's director of science and technology, Norma J. Nowak, to create tests for genetic abnormalities; Buffalo BioBlower, which received a $3 million appropriation from the Defense Department to develop a system to clean contaminated air by heating and compressing it as it is blown through a rotary pump; and Pneuma Partners, a company founded by Dr. Holm that is developing an inhalant to combat respiratory failure.Several more companies are in the works.Officials said that by stressing commercialization of scientific advances, the Buffalo region could realize the benefits of discoveries. Before the center's creation, the leading medication for the treatment of multiple sclerosis was developed and tested at the University at Buffalo, but licensed to an outside company.""We're not trying to be all things to everyone,"" said Ms. LaVigne, the center's business development director. ""What we're attempting to do is not only bring these technologies to market sooner, but try to retain as much economic impact as possible.""'"
"'06-07-09,'0','""It was windy, but that had nothing to do with it,"" said Joe Torre, who was playing third base for the N.L. ""He killed that ball. The ball didn't come down.""Jackson was named to the team as a replacement for Tony Oliva, and he was happy to simply be on the same field with so many of his heroes. When Jackson pinch-hit for Vida Blue in the third inning, Sal Bando, his teammate with the Oakland Athletics, teasingly warned him not to strike out.After Jackson took a strike and was late in fouling off two fastballs, he kept thinking about what Bando had said. With the count at 1-2, Ellis, who had been successful with fastballs to Jackson, switched to an off-speed pitch.""Dock threw a slider, and I hit it over the roof,"" Jackson said.Before the game, Curt Gowdy, the play-by-play announcer, mentioned how the 30-mile-an-hour winds blowing from the plate to right field could influence the game. The wind was a factor. Hank Aaron, Johnny Bench, Frank Robinson, Harmon Killebrew and Roberto Clemente homered, too, but Jackson's rocket would have been gone if the wind had been blowing in his face.""It was a monster,"" Torre said.Jackson and Robinson both had two-run homers as the A.L. jumped ahead, 4-3, and won for the first time since 1962. But instead of sparking a renaissance by the A.L., the victory was followed by 11 more losses to the N.L.These days, the A.L. dominates the All-Star Game and, excluding the tie in 2002, has an eight-game winning streak.""We want to try and stop that this year and do a little better for the National League,"" said Astros Manager Phil Garner, who is guiding the N.L.Ellis and Blue started the 1971 game, which was the last time two African-American pitchers were the starters. Torre said the players did not make a ""big deal"" about the distinction, but it is more noticeable now as the number of African-American players has diminished. Tom Gordon is the only African-American All-Star pitcher on either team this season.In 1976, Ellis, who was with the Yankees, hit Jackson, who was with the Baltimore Orioles, in the face with a pitch. Jackson had to be removed from the field on a stretcher. Ellis has said that he owed Jackson because of the memorable homer. Jackson said he challenged Ellis ""to hit me in the head"" that day because the teams were sniping at each other. Ellis did.""I don't think it was a payback, but Dock was an odd guy,"" Jackson said. ""I know when I see Dock today, it's not comfortable. I go the other way.""During the telecast, Gowdy explained how Aaron and Willie Mays had never played at Tiger Stadium and called that a perfect endorsement for interleague play. Twenty-six years later, interleague play was born.While Gowdy did not say a word to endorse a Home Run Derby the day before the game, that was eventually born, too, and officially recognized in 1985. But back in 1971, thanks to Jackson and five others, the real derby occurred in the game.Carl Crawford had never tried to steal home in his life. Not in Little League, not in high school and not in the minor leagues. Yet Crawford, who is as fast as anyone in the major leagues, was still daring enough to make the mad sprint for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays against the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday.""I figured I could do it,"" Crawford said.Crawford figured right. He first thought about swiping home when Curt Schilling pitched from the windup on Tuesday, but Schilling saw Crawford creeping down the third-base line and shifted to the stretch position. Jason Johnson was not as perceptive as Schilling one night later.While Johnson waited for a sign, Crawford was about 15 feet off the base. He took another step, then another and another, and Johnson did not look at him. As soon as Johnson moved his left leg to start his windup, Crawford was a blur. The play was not even close.""That's the most exciting stolen base I've ever had,"" said Crawford, who is the eighth player to steal 200 bases before his 25th birthday.As exciting as Crawford's steal was, it could be difficult for him to do it again. Teams will instruct their pitchers to work from the stretch position, enabling them to be quicker to the plate, if Crawford is on third.""It'll be tough to do it again,"" Crawford said. ""But, if the pitcher goes into the windup, I could do it.""Bob Dylan obviously likes baseball. He penned a song about Catfish Hunter and included Willie Mays in another tune. But Dylan may like minor league baseball the best. He definitely prefers the coziness of it.For the third straight summer, Dylan's tour will consist of playing shows at minor league ballparks. Dylan, who will play 17 concerts, will open at Fifth Third Ballpark in Comstock, Mich., on Aug. 12. Among the other towns Dylan will play are Cooperstown, N.Y.; Rochester; Wappingers Falls, N.Y.; and New Britain, Conn.""I think he likes the vibe, the whole experience of playing a ballpark,"" said Jerry Mickelson, one of the owners of Jam Productions, which is promoting the tour. ""It's like going back 20 years in time.""The general admission tickets are about $50, and children under 12 are admitted free. Mickelson said the tour was appealing to fans because the ballparks would have reasonably priced food and beverages, not the overpriced items that are common at a concert for someone of Dylan's stature.Dylan recently donated a baseball-themed episode of his XM Radio show to the National Baseball Hall of Fame's library archive. On it, Dylan sang ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" a cappella and also played famous radio clips.But anyone expecting Dylan to offer musings about his favorite player, his favorite team or to give a shout-out to the Columbus Clippers when he is at Cooper Stadium, will be disappointed. Dylan will be on stages between second base and center field, but, while he is there, the focus will not be on baseball.""He's doing his show,"" Mickelson said. ""He's doing music. Bob doesn't speak much, other than his music, in the first place.""Nick Johnson, the first baseman for the Washington Nationals, knows that it is useless to call Larry Bowa, his uncle and the Yankees' third-base coach, after the Yankees have endured a frustrating loss.""He never picks up his phone,"" Johnson said.After Johnson had a depressing game this season, his cellphone rang. He recognized Bowa's number and did not answer it. Bowa called again. Johnson ignored it again. Then Johnson's mother, Paula Graf, called. Johnson answered that call.""She told me he called her and said: 'What's wrong with Nick? Why won't he answer his phone?' "" Johnson recalled. ""She said, 'Who does that sound like?' ""'"
"'06-07-09,'0','And that is why Regier, on several occasions in the past few weeks, said he was budgeting for an increase to keep intact the core of a team that is coming off a strong season.Buffalo won a franchise-record 52 games and had its playoff run end with a Game 7 loss in the Eastern Conference finals to the eventual Stanley Cup champion, Carolina.""I have a sense that it's going to move up a few million dollars,"" Regier said recently, referring to his budget. ""Whether it's four or five or six, I don't have an exact number.""The group of Sabres players heading for arbitration — the hearings are scheduled to run from July 20 to Aug. 4 — includes the co-captain Daniel Brière and Maxim Afinogenov, who is coming off a career year after leading the team with 73 points (22 goals, 51 assists) last season.The group also includes Brian Campbell, who is also coming off a career year in which he led Buffalo's defensemen with 44 points (12 goals, 32 assists), and Henrik Tallinder, who emerged as a top-four defenseman.Although it is difficult to judge what raises the players will receive, it is evident that Afinogenov, who made a little more than $1 million last year, Campbell ($459,900) and Tallinder ($591,800) are in for significant increases based on their contributions last season.Buffalo can continue negotiating with players before their arbitration hearings, although any new deals struck would include pay raises.Arbitration awards in the recent past have ranged from modest to significant. The former Washington defenseman Brendan Witt was awarded a $500,000 raise in August 2004, while forward Milan Hejduk had his salary jump from $3.2 million to $5.7 million.Buffalo had two arbitration cases in 2004, with Brière receiving a $950,000 raise and goaltender Martin Biron's salary boosted by $600,000. Those increases were negated by an across-the-board 24 percent paycut after the lockout that wiped out the 2004-5 season. But salaries are back on the rise, especially with the N.H.L.'s cap increasing to $44 million from $39 million last season.This off-season, the Sabres have saved themselves nearly $3 million with the loss of two free agents, defenseman Jay McKee, who signed with St. Louis, and forward Mike Grier, now with San Jose.Buffalo could add to those savings by seeking to trade Biron, who is scheduled to make $2.128 million next season, a number deemed too expensive for a backup after he lost the starter's job to Ryan Miller. But not all of Biron's salary would be saved because the Sabres would still have to secure Biron's replacement through a trade or free agency.The Sabres are also negotiating a long-term contract with Miller, who will command a significant raise after making a mere $501,600. Miller had a stellar year in which he went 30-14-3 in the regular season and 11-7 in the playoffs.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','DES MOINES, Iowa, July 8 (AP) — As demand for livestock veterinarians continues to grow, experts are worried that there will not be enough new ones to cover the industry's needs.That is especially worrisome if diseases like avian flu break out, experts said.""If we don't have food-animal practitioners in the field as the first line of defense to detect some of these things, that's a real vulnerability we have,"" said Mike Chaddock, a former Michigan state veterinarian who now works for the Association of American Veterinary Colleges.According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, the need for livestock veterinarians will grow by as much as 13 percent a year.Officials said the Department of Agriculture, the nation's biggest employer of veterinarians, would be short as many as 400 veterinarians in coming years without an increased recruiting effort and a slowdown in retirements.Mr. Chaddock said the nation's 28 veterinary schools graduate about 2,500 students a year, but fewer than 10 percent of the graduates go into jobs dealing with food animals.Bennie Osburn, dean of the veterinary school at the University of California, Davis, said his home state educated only a fraction of the veterinarians that it needed. Many can make as much as $100,000 out of school, he added.In Iowa, officials said only 17 of the 106 students who graduated from Iowa State University's College of Veterinary Medicine this spring planned to stay in the state. Just 22 planned to devote part of their practice to large animals.'"

His deal was loaded with incentives: the opportunity to watch a Chicago Cubs game, free of charge, on the day he worked, an additional free pass for a future game, and the opportunity to meet players after the games.""The 35 cents wasn't bad either,"" he said. ""That was enough money for five packs of baseball cards.""The son of a real estate lawyer, Meyer knew that location was the key to success, so he would find the right place to wait for players after games — ""somewhere between the clubhouse and the team bus,"" he said — hoping to get the autographs of stars like Ernie Banks, Warren Spahn and Ralph Kiner.""Many of the players would just brush you off and jump on the bus,"" Meyer said. ""But players from the Brooklyn Dodgers, especially Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson, were always the nicest to us.""It was Robinson, Meyer said, who spent the most time with Wrigley's junior maintenance team.""Jackie would have all of us line up, sign every autograph and ask each of us for our names,"" said Meyer, now 65 and a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, in Los Angeles.

"'06-07-09,'0','Lining the north and south sides of the plaza are aging Chinese takeout restaurants, humid fried-chicken joints and sad-seeming doughnut shops. Completing the tableau is the Queens Plaza Municipal Parking Garage, a brown concrete structure resembling a 1970's filmmaker's idea of an intergalactic battle station.Queens Plaza feels tired, and for decades it seemed defeated. Prostitutes, pimps and gangs roamed freely. Crime was so out of control that some people living nearby hated even to walk to the subway. If the view of Manhattan from the Queensboro Bridge, as F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote in ""The Great Gatsby,"" seemed to promise ""all the mystery and the beauty in the world,"" the view of Queens Plaza from that vantage point offered neither. But change is afoot, and Joey Hot Dog isn't the only one who sees it.Workers for a year-old business improvement district can be seen patrolling the gum-spotted sidewalks in red jumpsuits, sweeping up debris and emptying trash baskets. Guards from private security forces are visible from afternoon till night, and the police are more of a presence than ever.The city has announced plans to add greenery and pedestrian walkways. Met Life, now one of the area's largest employers, has moved hundreds of employees from its former headquarters on Madison Square Park to an old carriage factory, officially christened One MetLife Place, and a developer plans to replace the parking garage with a 1.5 million-square-foot office complex. Perhaps most telling, condominiums in a new luxury tower called the Queens Plaza, just north of Queens Plaza North, went on the market in April.Whether any of those developments will truly transform the area is not in dispute — some have already begun to do so. But as the neighborhood begins to change, Joey Hot Dog and other plaza regulars often wonder if anyone can ever forget what the place used to be.Until 1909, Queens had no plaza to speak of. That was the year the arched steel spine of the Queensboro Bridge was completed, 11 years after Queens officially became part of the City of New York, a moment when the population of Manhattan was poised to burst into the relatively untouched borough to the east. The bridge and the plaza that was created to accompany it on the Queens side were a sight to behold, and arrived with appropriate fanfare.When work on the bridge was finished, 50,000 people gathered to celebrate its opening, according to Vincent Seyfried's book ""300 Years of Long Island City."" The mayor, the governor and the secretary of war made speeches, a parade passed through the new plaza, and thousands of red lamps glowed from the bridge's cables. The ceremony culminated in a fireworks display, designed to resemble Niagara Falls, which poured over the side of the bridge.To accommodate all the people who would pour in from Manhattan, a byway called Jane Street was widened by 90 feet to become Bridge Plaza North and South (today's Queens Plaza North and South). Dividing the inbound and outbound traffic lanes was a series of grass-covered squares, separated by cross streets. Inside each square, landscapers used flowers and shrubs to create horticultural sculptures, including a 75-foot crescent with a Japanese cherry tree at its center.Photographs of the plaza taken in the weeks before it opened show a startlingly spacious and uncluttered setting. Few buildings lined the plaza, and a flagpole at its center, made from the mast of Shamrock, the yacht of Sir Thomas Lipton of tea fame, stood in proud isolation. Queens Plaza at its inception was nothing less than a dignified, serene portal of a great city.Almost immediately, however, the plaza began falling victim to its success. The bridge, designed to accommodate multiple lanes of horse-drawn buggies, automobiles, bicycles and pedestrians, could not possibly accommodate all who wanted to travel between Queens and Manhattan. By 1915, a great tangle of elevated subway tracks had been strung over the heart of the plaza, producing one of the most complex overhead interchanges of all time and bringing ear-splitting noise to those below.Still, business boomed as companies moved into the open spaces near the plaza, which provided easy access to the city. The Brewster Building, a large brick factory that was topped by a clock tower and was completed in 1910, turned out horse-drawn carriages and later automobiles, including, for a few years, Rolls-Royces. Businesses like the Long Island Savings Bank and the Silvercup Bakery — which would tout itself in neon as maker of the ""world's finest bread"" — also established quarters. Development brought traffic. In 1909, the year the bridge opened, 459 vehicles crossed the span in a single day. By 1928, the count was 86,000.From the 1920's through World War II, Queens Plaza evolved into an ever-busier nexus of factories, warehouses and commuters — always commuters. By the 1950's, when Joey Hot Dog — real name, Joseph Calasso — took over his father's cart and corner, the plaza was often so crowded that pedestrians couldn't pass one another without bumping shoulders.""We sold a lot more hot dogs,"" Joey Hot Dog said of that period. A frank cost 15 cents — the typical truck driver ate five — and a Coke was a dime. Workers at Silvercup and the Barricini candy factory nearby provided a steady customer base, and youngsters from Queensbridge Houses, a public housing project near Queens Plaza on the East River, would stop by with quarters for a hot dog and a soda, the Joey Hot Dog version of a combo meal.If Joey Hot Dog had a heyday, this was it, and perhaps it was also the heyday of the plaza that surrounded him.But in the late 1950's and the 1960's, urban decay began eating away at many corners of New York, including once-vibrant business districts that saw their tenants flee for the suburbs. Queens Plaza was no exception. By the 1970's and 80's, the streets had been taken over by trash, broken glass, drugs and pimps. Newly freed inmates from Rikers Island began disembarking daily in the plaza, courtesy of an early-morning bus that deposited them there from the jails.Prostitution spread through the neighborhood, to the point that women employed by local businesses complained of being followed around by men when they left work at the end of the day. The Q-Plaza Motel, at Vernon Boulevard and Queens Plaza South, became notorious as a hot-sheets establishment. ""They had sheets on the windows — no curtains,"" said Joe Cancemi, a longtime customer of Joey Hot Dog.Every day, the area seemed to have more ex-cons, more pimps and hookers, more squeegee men and pushers. ""I don't know how anybody could have lived in the neighborhood years ago,"" Mr. Cancemi said. ""Because it was so desolate, at any time, anything could crawl out of the works.""The arrival of strip clubs that had been driven out of Times Square in the 1990's, as a result of a crackdown by the Giuliani administration, did not help the plaza's reputation. Paradoxically, it was at that time the plaza began springing back to life.Crime dropped, as it did throughout the city, and police crackdowns and dogged courtroom work by the Queens district attorney's office began to suppress prostitution. Prostitutes still show up occasionally, say people who work in the area, but a huge difference is visible between current conditions and those a decade ago.In the last years of the 20th century, public officials and private developers also seemed to realize that a largely underdeveloped area only one subway stop from Manhattan offered immense potential. In 2001, the Department of City Planning rezoned a 37-block area of Long Island City, which included Queens Plaza, to allow larger-scale residential and commercial buildings. That November, Met Life moved 900 employees into a renovated Brewster Building, its red brick scrubbed and its large arched windows adorned with crisp green paint.Then the city began looking for a developer willing to scrap the crusty brown municipal garage and replace it with an office tower. Officials settled on Tishman Speyer, which has said it will begin to build after securing an anchor tenant. In January, a developer announced plans to convert the Q-Plaza Motel into a luxury hotel.With changes afoot, several businesses in the plaza, including Graybar Electric, agreed to help finance the new Long Island City Business Improvement District. Last July, the group began sending out daily security patrols; its workers also collect several hundred 30-gallon bags of trash a day.""It's quite a bit,"" said Andrew Ebenstein, operations manager for the business improvement district. ""If you're around Queens Plaza in all the a.m. hours, the thousands of coffee cups that used to litter the south side are no longer there.""In April 2005, the push to beautify Queens Plaza went federal. Congress approved a $10.6 million grant to help convert the John F. Kennedy Commuter Triangle (read: parking lot), the 1.5-acre parcel at the plaza's eastern end, into a park. New pedestrian crossings will be installed, along with greenways stretching west to the bridge's entrance. Construction is expected to begin in a year and be completed by 2009, when the bridge celebrates its 100th anniversary.In an interview, City Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden expressed excitement about plans for the site. The desolate space, she said, ""is going to be the most magnificent, verdant, luxurious green park.""Despite all the improvements, Queens Plaza is not exactly a real neighborhood, since few people live in or around it. The low-lying streets running north and south from the elevated subway station, the heart of the plaza, are home to barely 1,000 people, according to the 2000 Census, most of them living in small apartment buildings and the occasional tenement.That is poised to change. By summer's end, the first tenants will move into the Queens Plaza, the 10-story, 66-unit red brick condominium on 27th Street, a half-block from the plaza itself. A recent tour of model units revealed GE Profile stainless-steel appliances, two-person showerheads, video intercoms, granite countertops and, on one side, balconies with views of Manhattan. One-bedroom apartments start at $420,000.The Developers Group, which built the Queens Plaza, is planning another condo tower in the area, this one directly on the plaza at Crescent Street, a space currently occupied by an unprepossessing white two-story building. The site is just two blocks from Joey Hot Dog's corner.A few months ago, Joey watched solemnly as workers hauled out machinery from the Venus Trimming and Binding Company, just across the street, which was closing its Queens Plaza factory. Joey got the movers as customers, but the workers, like many others, are gone now.Around noon, business began to pick up. Several men wearing work uniforms or construction outfits crowded around the cart. A white Cadillac stopped by, then a mail truck. Soon, eight people were standing around, eating one or two or three hot dogs. ""You want more?"" Joey Hot Dog asked each customer. Everyone did. The mayor of Queens Plaza was once again holding court.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','Those factors ""have caused risk aversion to go up,"" Mr. Divecha said. ""People are pulling money from what they consider to be risky places. But that's a misevaluation. Emerging markets are where you've got domestic growth.""Still, he said, a decline was not out of order after a three-year climb of more than 200 percent, especially when a wide array of markets around the world were falling.In the second quarter, diversified emerging-market funds lost 5.1 percent. The decline erased some of their return over the last year, but investors in just about anything else would be happy to take what is left: the average emerging-market fund rose 34.3 percent in the 12 months through June.Mr. Divecha said he and his colleagues had lightened their holdings as the advance matured and valuations became too high. But after the steep, swift decline, some buying opportunities may arise soon, he said. ""We still think fundamentals are very, very good,"" he said, ""so if prices go down, it makes them more attractive.""Mr. Divecha is a top-down value investor: ""Our philosophy first is to pick countries, and we look for cheapness more than anything else,"" he explained. He said his favorite places now were Brazil and Taiwan.The appeal of Brazil is its very high interest rates, relative to inflation. (Its equivalent of the federal funds rate is 16 percent, he said, while inflation is 5 percent.) He expects rates to decline, which would benefit banks in particular.His preferred sector in Taiwan is technology, which he finds a bargain, trading at 12 times earnings and offering an average dividend yield of 4 percent. Investors are shunning Taiwan technology companies out of fear that China will usurp their business, but he noted that many mainland Chinese manufacturers were owned by Taiwanese companies.With so much Taiwanese production outsourced, valuations should be higher, not lower, in Mr. Divecha's opinion. ""The market has got that fundamentally wrong,"" he said.George Greig, manager of the William Blair International Growth fund, said that emerging markets had reached ""really precarious valuations all over the world,"" but that the decline had corrected much of the imbalance. ""Certainly the markets where we were most concerned about valuations three months ago — India, Brazil, Eastern Europe — are all much more attractive now,"" he said.Mr. Greig's biggest emerging-market exposure is to Asia, especially China and India. He is also heavily invested in Brazil and South Africa.His favorite holdings in India include the industrial company Bharat Forge and the Housing Development Finance Corporation. In South Africa, he likes Sasol, which he described as ""a very inexpensive energy stock at a time when these stocks are still doing pretty well.""His Brazilian positions include the energy company Petrobras and a play on domestic consumption, Natura Cosmetics.Hugh Young, head of equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, has been a fan of emerging markets for many years. Unlike Mr. Divecha and Mr. Greig, he does not think that the decline, as severe as it has been, has sufficiently worked off the extremes.""This is the correction we've been looking for all year,"" Mr. Young said. ""Emerging markets simply have been too strong, and with interest-rate, energy, inflation and growth fears, a fall was to be expected. Now it's up to earnings to catch up — maybe in a year — before markets rise again.""In the meantime, he finds some emerging-market stocks worth keeping. Among his favorites are Siam Cement in Thailand; the phone service provider China Mobile; Housing Development Finance (one of the Indian companies Mr. Greig mentioned); Samsung Electronics in South Korea; and Ayala Land, a developer in the Philippines.Earnings growth in emerging markets will depend to some extent on economic conditions in the developed world, where many customers for their exports live. Asian economies in particular rely on foreign trade, and they have borne the brunt of the decline in share prices.""The fundamental concern is that Asia is still predominantly export-led and that a slowdown in export demand represents a risk to the markets,"" said Edmund Harriss, manager of the Guinness Atkinson Asia Focus fund. But that fear may be unwarranted, he said, for countries that have developed thriving domestic economies and whose stock markets have declined sharply nevertheless.""There's a consumer story that can stand up on its own in China and India and probably in Korea,"" Mr. Harriss said. He conceded, though, that ""for the rest, exports are still an important part of Asia's prospects.""His favorite stocks come from consumer, technology and heavy industrial companies. He expressed enthusiasm for the Hong Kong clothing retailer Esprit Holdings. ""I just love that company,"" he said.Two Taiwan technology holdings are Hon Hai Precision Industry and High Tech Computer. They may be vulnerable to a slowdown in American spending, but Mr. Harriss said their bosses had the ability to navigate through such a problem.""Even if they hit the skids,"" he said, ""they've got the management depth and skills to say: 'This is where the problem is. We're going to do this and this.' ""Other stocks he highlighted are Pohang Iron and Steel of Korea; Denway Motors, a Chinese maker of Honda cars; and the Chinese energy producers PetroChina and Cnooc.Another Asia specialist, Mark W. Headley, president of Matthews International Capital Management, is betting heavily on growth in the region's domestic economy. His portfolios include Cipla, an Indian maker of generic drugs, and Agile Property Holdings, a developer in China.THE growth of domestic economies has made emerging markets less dependent on the developed world, but not independent, Mr. Headley cautioned.""Domestic consumption is sustainable, even in the face of a U.S. slowdown,"" he said. If the economy in the United States collapses, however, all bets are off, he said.Mr. Divecha warned of a small chance that the decline in emerging markets was the financial equivalent of ""a canary in a coal mine"" and that economies ""are on the cusp of something really big globally."" If so, he said, ""I don't think we'll know for a year or two.""Mr. Greig takes a more benign view of the decline, saying it may not seem so scary to investors of the future when they peer back. He recalled several sharp drops in American stocks in the 1980's.""If you looked backward from the late 1990's at the charts, you couldn't even see those pullbacks,"" he said. ""I see this as the same sort of episode in the evolution of emerging markets. There is a lot of growth still to go for.""'"
"'06-07-09,'0','That includes directors and producers, who are used to controlling and who are for Ms. Duncan among the most challenging clients to work with. ""Those people want to get out there and produce their own little show,"" she said. ""They come up with their own words. They'll shout, 'Get to work,' and the dog will just stand there. We actually teach people how to be better people.""Ms. Duncan said her business has grown 40 percent in a year, to about 65 dogs and their owners. Some make the trek from as far away as Beverly Hills (an hour and a half commute) for the training sessions held in an arena built for horses.Most of the dogs are shepherds or collies, which are bred for farm work but as pets spend much of their time on the living room couch. In classes the dogs enter the ring with the sheep and their owners and learn to respond to whistles and commands.The classes — which usually include two runs, broken up for rest and water — are not cheap. A series of four classes costs $160.Cesar Millan, a celebrated author and dog trainer to Hollywood's elite, best known for his television show, ""Dog Whisperer,"" said most dogs are not connected to their owners and are owned largely for emotional comfort — for people, that is. ""But it's not good therapy for the dogs,"" he said.Nor is the frantic creative energy prevalent in Hollywood good for the dogs, either, he said. ""You have to have calm, assertive energy.""Sheepherding might never have come to Malibu if it weren't for Cathleen Summers, a producer of the ""Stakeout"" movies and the wife of Mr. Crowley. In the 1990's they would drive 40 miles north of Los Angeles to work with Ms. Duncan, who has been training dogs to herd sheep for 15 years.""It was a long drive when you work the hours we do,"" said Ms. Summers, who has two English shepherds, Iris and Dash. ""You can only work dogs 10 to 15 minutes at a time, so the commute was a big constraint.""Ms. Summers persuaded Ms. Duncan to set up classes in Malibu, which is closer to the west side of Los Angeles, where she and her husband live. ""When we started, we took a lot of Hollywood friends, producers mostly, and we would talk about movies,"" Ms. Summers said.Ms. Duncan's business has mostly grown through word of mouth. On Sundays and Thursdays, she drives 160 miles round trip from the Drummond Ranch in Vincent, Calif., of which she was a founder in 1993, to Malibu, a trailer filled with sheep in tow. Getting them there is no easy feat. One recent Sunday, classes were delayed an hour because she and the sheep were stuck in a traffic jam on Interstate 405.On a Sunday in June, Paul Davidoski smiled broadly after he and his Australian shepherd, Noel, enjoyed a spirited run in the arena. Noel wasn't always so good-natured, he said. ""She'd nip at people and lunge at them,"" said Mr. Davidoski, who recently sold his company, which made parts for movie cameras. He said he and his wife, Patti, tried several ways to calm the dog, even hiring a trainer for 15 weeks. Friends suggested he put Noel to sleep.Mrs. Davidoski read about the classes online. Now they drive 40 minutes (or longer if traffic is backed up) from Agoura Hills in the San Fernando Valley to Malibu for Sunday classes. ""She sleeps better, and she doesn't bite,"" Mrs. Davidoski said.OF course, a good dog story has a catfight. In January a turf war broke out at the Malibu Equestrian Park, where Ms. Duncan first set up her Malibu classes. The park was also home to the Trancas Riders and Ropers, a horse club.According to The Malibu Times, Trancas became concerned about the dogs, claiming they made the horses skittish, which Ms. Duncan disputed. On Jan. 12, a sheriff's deputy was dispatched to the park to break up a fracas between sheepherders and members of the equestrian club, the newspaper reported. ""People were calling us the Hatfields and the McCoys,"" Ms. Duncan said.The dispute had a public airing before the Malibu Parks and Recreation Commission, but before it could be resolved Ms. Duncan relocated to the private estate, which is in a canyon far from the traffic-clogged Pacific Coast Highway.Not every dog owner, though, is comfortable with the unpredictable nature of animals. Recently, Shayne Harris, 11, was in the arena with her miniature Australian shepherd, Dizzy. The dog was shadowing a fast-moving sheep, who wanted no part of the lesson. The sheep jumped over a water trough, then rammed its head into a wooden fence. It tried to butt Dizzy twice, but the dog held its ground. The sheep finally lay down and refused to move.Other dog owners in the bleachers watched in horror. Several debated whether the errant sheep should be dispatched to its trailer like an unruly actor pitching a fit on a set. One woman worried her dog would be trampled. Others complained the weather was too hot. Worse, much of the crowd was cranky because 15 people showed up for the morning class, which meant most dogs had only a single run in the arena.Shayne, though, kept her cool. ""It's only a sheep,"" she said later, her green flip-flop shaped earrings reflecting the midday sun. ""It teaches me how to handle my dog because he never listens.""For her father, Mark, a recording engineer who lives in Malibu, sheepherding is a way to distance his daughter from the Hollywood crowd, some of whom give their children nose jobs as a birthday present.""At this age things could go in a positive direction or it cannot,"" Mr. Harris said. ""They are surrounded by so much money and stuff, drugs and other things.""Ms. Duncan said that she has felt like asking some dog owners not to come back. (In un-Hollywood fashion she refused to name names.) Instead, she welcomes everyone, even the wife of a chief executive who once brought a bottle of Evian for her dog and a small red carpet.""I look at it as a challenge for me to get inside their heads,"" she said. ""You have to break them down. I guess you could say it's a big therapy session. For the dog owners, that is.""'"

"'06-07-09,'0','Though neither designer is especially interested in politics, Mr. Lagerfeld said the reason both may have chosen the same theme is the extent to which religion, and fear, can undermine rational thought. And certainly armor is a symbol of protection.It is rare, in any case, to see such freedom on the runway. Mr. Galliano said he wanted armorlike sleeves to ""morph"" into 1940's suits. Among the most original (and wearable) looks were minicoats in dark shaggy layers of fox and yak hair. They seemed to combine the glamour of Hollywood and the raw energy of punk.Though Mr. Galliano takes an exaggerated approach to fashion, turning layers of green tulle into ambulatory topiary and creating crackled surfaces with foiled fabrics, there is inevitably a new technique being tried. This, too, is couture's purpose. The bubbly ruched train of a blue and white evening dress could have been inspired by the shape of Hefty bags piled at a curb, but the technique may someday produce a hip down jacket.""Glenda and Elton,"" purred the soft, cookie-baking-crimp-the-edges-of-your-pastry voice of Martha Stewart. Before the start of the Chanel show, in a specially constructed tent with a revolving platform for the audience, Ms. Stewart took snapshots of the guests, including Elton John and Glenda Bailey, the editor of Harper's Bazaar.As if aware that Chanel's privileged clients can lend a musty scent of rosewater to couture, Mr. Lagerfeld seems determined to make the clothes connect with the pace of modern life. In this exceptional show, hemlines were several inches above the knees, with a breezy sense of proportion, as if he imagined all the day looks moving briskly along an urban sidewalk. A fuzzy caterpillar of yarn traced the edges of a trim tweed suit, but on the whole decoration was kept to a minimum. The focus was on the almost sculptural fit of jackets, and the smaller shoulder line of tiny cap-sleeved tunics. To make the body seem even smaller, Mr. Lagerfeld had sleeves built out just slightly in the upper part of the arm and then narrowed toward the wrist.""It's couture,"" he said with a huge grin. Well, he loves to say that.And it's surprising that no one has thought to mimic how young women layer jeans under skirts. Mr. Lagerfeld's solution was to send stone-washed and black denim to the custom shoemaker Massaro and have thigh-high boots made with jeweled amber-colored heels. He showed the boots with the exquisitely embroidered and beribboned evening clothes, too.As the new Balenciaga exhibition here makes clear, couture allows designers to refine and refine an idea. Balenciaga's particular obsession was with sleeves. Jean Paul Gaultier, who on Friday closed the fall couture collections, had a long black coat with an exotic bird embroidered on one sleeve, its red plumes quivering above the shoulder. Though the collection didn't quite come together, Mr. Gaultier displayed some great Surrealist magic, especially with chiffon dresses sliced into skeletal pieces and a shapely silver-fox coat with deep organza pleats.Valentino, who received the Legion of Honor on Thursday, and celebrated with a black-tie dinner at his chateau, appealed to the client who has everything — well, maybe not a gorgeous chiffon dress clinging to one shoulder with tiny pearls rushing over the bodice. Microcheck tweeds and sun-ray pleats were the story for day, but the stunners were red-carpet numbers that looked as if the models had been dipped naked into small glittering stones.The light hand of Christian Lacroix spun a veil of powder blue chiffon over a pearl gray silk taffeta dress, and came up with a short A-line coat in silver-appliquéd felt with a chartreuse fox collar. Beautiful and minimalist, but it would be nice to see him apply his modernity to more day clothes. Giorgio Armani's trouble is that he has a fixed idea of couture: all taut lines and sweetheart bodices trimmed out like a chocolate box. Dresses with asymmetrical pleating and tumbling organza ruffles were at least proof that he knows how to lighten up.Mr. Tisci's collection was heavy weather. Staged in a dark room, on a black lacquered runway, with many black clothes cut with more drama than flair, the collection could easily be mistaken for ready-to-wear. There is no question that Mr. Tisci is talented, but he needs to simmer down and consider that couture's privilege is to take a few ideas — a proportion, a shoulder line — and refine them to perfection.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','Despite the recent sell-off in equities, though, domestic stock funds have managed gains of 10.9 percent over the last 12 months, which is almost exactly in line with historical norms.What was not normal was the degree of speculation that stock investors exhibited earlier this year, in the fourth year of an aging bull market. Traditionally, investors bet big on risky assets early in a bull market, and then gradually become more conservative. But in the first quarter, investors were pouring money into speculative stocks, like those in emerging-market funds, which rose 12.3 percent in the first three months of this year. That helped to feed heightened interest in foreign stocks in general.Unfortunately, those emerging-market stock funds were slammed harder than domestic holdings during the second-quarter storm that began in May, when the Fed started to sound hawkish on inflation. The average diversified emerging-market stock fund lost 5.1 percent over the last three months, according to Morningstar; stock funds that specialize in Latin America declined 3.2 percent, on average.To be sure, over the last five years, emerging-market stock portfolios are still among the best performers, with annualized gains of 20.8 percent. That compares with an average loss of 0.1 percent for large-cap domestic growth funds.Nevertheless, the recent rockiness in emerging markets is part of a larger theme, said Jeffrey J. Schappe, chief investment officer at BB&T Asset Management in Raleigh, N.C. ""We're seeing a very significant correction,"" he said, ""in the riskiest asset classes.""Tom Roseen, senior research analyst at Lipper, the fund tracker, said that among domestic stock funds, ""the area that probably got punished the worst was science and technology."" The average technology fund lost 9.7 percent of its value in the second quarter, while telecommunications funds, on average, dropped 4.4 percent.AMONG general domestic stock funds, those that invest in growth-oriented equities were hit much harder than so-called value funds. The average large-cap growth fund lost 4.7 percent, while the average large-cap value fund fell 0.1 percent.Investors in the second quarter also saw a long-anticipated end to small-stock dominance. For the first time in a long while, large blue-chip stock funds outperformed riskier small-company stock portfolios by a meaningful margin. Small-cap growth funds sank 6.7 percent.Already, professional money managers have begun shifting their emphasis back toward large-cap stocks.According a June survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group, a vast majority are now bullish on large-cap shares in general. When asked about their view of small-cap growth and small-cap value stocks, meanwhile, more money managers called themselves bearish than said they were bullish.Mr. Roseen of Lipper said he would not be surprised if the same shift in attitude occurred among mutual fund investors. He said those investors, fearful of rising market volatility, ""now have a 'pay me now' mentality,"" which is likely to renew interest in large-cap portfolios. Such funds tend to throw off more dividends than their small-cap counterparts.A shift toward stability and away from speculation has already begun to drive some investors out of the emerging markets. While international stock funds in general continued to attract net inflows of new money in May, investors redeemed a net $916 million out of emerging-market stock funds, according to Lipper.Because of hefty losses in the emerging markets and Japan — the average Japanese stock fund was down 7.8 percent in the last quarter — the average international stock fund fell 1.5 percent. Still, that was better than the performance of domestic portfolios.Whether investors in the United States continue to bet big overseas may well depend on how the domestic stock market performs for the remainder of the year.Some market watchers said the volatility that began in May could mean a rocky summer for equities. Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac, said he thought that the equity market was headed for ""an old-fashioned bear market"" sometime later this year. ""We've got a bull that's running out of reasons to be bullish,"" he said.Mr. Hirsch added that because this was the second year of a presidential term, the markets were ripe for a real downturn. These midterm years have historically been the worst for stocks.Others are not so pessimistic. Neil J. Hennessy, president and portfolio manager of Hennessy Funds, said that while economic and corporate-profit growth might be slowing somewhat, the underlying health of the economy was still strong.""By historic standards, we still have relatively low interest rates, low unemployment and low inflation,"" he said.Mr. Hennessy said the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed as high as 11,642.65 on May 10 before falling nearly 1,000 points by mid-June, could hit 12,000 by the end of the year. ""We've got 180 days before year's end,"" he said. ""All it would take is 10 days of 100-point moves, and everything could be a wash for the rest of the year.""REGARDLESS of the economic outlook, Mr. Schappe of BB&T Asset Management said investors should consider focusing more on higher-quality stocks. Just as blue-chip stocks and stock funds are likely to hold up better in a downturn, they may also provide decent growth if the market regains its footing this year, he said. Wall Street, he said, has largely overlooked the strong earnings and fundamentals of large-cap companies lately.An emphasis on quality also applies to foreign investing, he said. Investors would do well to embrace high-quality large-cap foreign stocks and stock funds in the developed markets, he said, rather than playing the momentum game of the emerging markets or fleeing international equities altogether.Investors enjoyed huge returns with seemingly little risk even in highly volatile investments at the start of the year. But that was when equity prices were going through the roof. If the second quarter proved anything, Mr. Schappe said, it was that ""risk is being put back"" into the risk-return relationship.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','After the 29th Street redemption center closed, Mr. Gadsden, a fixture at the building, persuaded the superintendent to let canners continue storing and sorting their wares outside on the sidewalk. Then, in the summer of 2005, he and several other canners, all members of a committee formed by Picture the Homeless, an advocacy group led by homeless people, approached Eldar Rakhamimov, who owns a redemption center in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.Mr. Rakhamimov, a stocky Russian immigrant, agreed to visit the site at least twice a week in his battered truck to buy recyclable containers from the canners, who, in the past six months, have swelled in number to 25 from about 5. Some canners complain that Mr. Rakhamimov pays only four cents per container, a penny less than they would get at a supermarket. Mr. Gadsden, for his part, said that he was satisfied because he could still pull in $700 or $800 a month, enough to share a two-bedroom rental in the Pelham Parkway neighborhood in the Bronx. He recently moved there after spending nearly a decade on the streets.""You have to treat it like a regular job,"" said Mr. Gadsden, who often works as many as four 12-hour night shifts a week, trawling a strategic network of routes that takes him from 11th Avenue to First Avenue and from 14th Street to 51st Street. Beyond that, he said, he more or less lives at the redemption center, retreating to his apartment only two or three times each week, after the truck makes a pickup.Apart from the center, Mr. Gadsden's livelihood depends on a rickety grocery cart, which he calls Betsy. Carts are the trusty steeds of a canner's trade, and they come in many varieties: metal shopping carts and canvas mail carts; carts adorned with stuffed animal figureheads; carts stuffed with foam mattresses and sprouting salvaged umbrellas. In keeping with a canners' tradition, Mr. Gadsden surrounded the well of his cart with a sort of picket fence built from broomsticks. The contraption allows him to transport as many as 15 overstuffed garbage bags — or, as he puts it, ""$150""— at a time.On days when Mr. Rakhamimov is scheduled to make a pickup, a fleet of carts assembles at the 29th Street center. The canners stand sorting their pickings into car-sized piles of boxes and bags: glass with glass, metal with metal, plastic with plastic.A couple from Ecuador, Nestor Laso, 78, and Maria Laso, 66, are among the most prolific. Before taking up canning, they worked on a farm in their native land.Asked to compare canning with farming, Mr. Laso smiled weakly. ""You suffer here, too,"" he said through an interpreter. ""But at least you can try to improve your living conditions.""Along with the Lasos, the crowd often includes a teenage brother and sister from Mexico and an irascible man with dreadlocks known as Slim.A diverse group, they are bound together by a tenuous allegiance to Mr. Gadsden. Some refer to him as the ""owner."" They pay him a few dollars a week, and in return, he looks after carts left otherwise unattended for a stretch. He regularly sweeps the pavement in front of the warehouse to keep neighbors from complaining. As a matter of good business, no one is allowed to use drugs on the block, an edict Mr. Gadsden has sometimes enforced with his fists.""I don't care what people do,"" he likes to say. ""Just don't do it here.""ON the rare occasions when Mr. Gadsden takes time off, he leaves the business in the hands of a canner and former building superintendent, Phillip Jackson.One recent morning, Mr. Jackson and a few cohorts sat around on crates listening to jazz on a portable radio and sharing a pint of cheap vodka. As soon as the truck arrived, Mr. Jackson leaped into action, snatching up a broom and using it to jam a pile of bulging trash bags into the truck.Next door, in a renovated warehouse that serves as the studio of the artist Jeff Koons, a crew of fashionably dressed artist's assistants went about their tasks. Galleries have been cropping up all over this rapidly gentrifying part of Chelsea, leading some canners to wonder if their own presence will always be tolerated. ""I just pray that everything will work out,"" Mr. Gadsden said.But on this day, after a mountain of glass and aluminum was loaded onto the truck, the mood of the crowd suddenly lightened. Mr. Rakhamimov pulled out his wallet and began shouting out the canners' names: ""Jackson! Laso! Slim!""One at a time, they stripped off their work gloves and stepped forward.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','Morgan Elizabeth Russell, the daughter of Marsha Russell and Dana Russell of Scipio, N.Y., was married there yesterday afternoon to John Christopher McCormick, a son of Phyllis McCormick of West Norwalk, Conn., and the late Willard F.

"'06-07-09,'0','In many societies, the term ""child bride"" calls to mind impetuous sweethearts, a ladder cautiously positioned beneath a bedroom window, a silent kiss in the moonlight and a young couple making an anxious getaway to a justice of the peace. But this is not a ready image the world over. In Afghanistan, a child bride is very often just that: a child, even a preteen, her innocence betrothed to someone older, even much, much older.Rather than a willing union between a man and woman, marriage is frequently a transaction among families, and the younger the bride, the higher the price she may fetch. Girls are valuable workers in a land where survival is scratched from the grudging soil of a half-acre parcel. In her parents' home, a girl can till fields, tend livestock and cook meals. In her husband's home, she is more useful yet. She can have sex and bear children.Afghanistan is not alone in this predilection toward early wedlock. Globally, the number of child brides is hard to tabulate; they live mostly in places where births, deaths and the human milestones in between go unrecorded. But there are estimates. About 1 in 7 girls in the developing world (excluding China) gets married before her 15th birthday, according to analyses done by the Population Council, an international research group.In the huge Indian states of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, the proportion is 36 percent; in Bangladesh, 37 percent; in northwest Nigeria, 48 percent; in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, 50 percent. Tens of millions of girls are having babies before their bodies are mature enough, increasing the likelihood of death from hemorrhaging, obstructed labor and other complications.Stephanie Sinclair's striking photographs of child brides in Afghanistan remind me of my own travels over remote landscapes during the time of the Taliban, when recurring years of drought had parched the final resources from millions of the destitute. Fathers then were especially keen to convert their daughters into brides. It was a way to deliver the girl from hunger — and a way to at least temporarily ward off famine for the rest of the family. Young boys were sold into bondage with the same painful practicality. Rarely have I seen anything more heartbreaking than the tears of a relinquished child.The drought has since passed, but the poverty remains, as does the widespread custom of early marriage. Some Afghans readily use their daughters to settle debts and assuage disputes. Polygamy is practiced. A man named Mohammed Fazal, 45, told Sinclair that village elders had urged him to take his second wife, 13-year-old Majabin, in lieu of money owed him by the girl's father. The two men had been gambling at cards while also ingesting opium and hashish.'"
"'06-07-09,'0','""I tend to go more for the acting than a voice that sounds like the original,"" said Ken Duer, president of Phuuz Entertainment in Los Angeles. ""But it's up to the client. When I worked on 'Lupin III,' they wanted comparable voices, so we held a lot of auditions to find actors who were good, and who sounded like the Japanese cast.""When the English voices are recorded, the actors have to match the words to the characters' mouth movements, which were originally timed to the Japanese dialogue. ""That's the hardest part of the job,"" said Chris Patton, the voice of Sousuke, the highly trained, terminally dense hero of ""Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu!"" ""If you're passionate about acting and telling the story, you go in and chain yourself to the fact that you're going to have to match those flaps.""Because each actor records alone, to allow for greater concentration on synchronizing the mouth movements, it is difficult to generate the chemistry needed to make, say, the fractious romance between Sousuke and the hot-tempered Kaname (Luci Christian) in the farcical ""Fumoffu!"" believable. Mr. Patton and Ms. Christian never saw each other during the recording sessions, so there was no chance for the kind of give and take actors in live-action series use to explore character relationships.""If I have Luci read first, Chris has something to work off,"" Mr. Rush said. ""Then I can tell him, 'It didn't sound like you were really talking to her,' or 'You're a little angrier with her.' If I don't like the chemistry in certain scenes, we can redo it parts of it, but that's pretty rare.""Although they too worked in isolation, Vic Mignogna and the child actor Aaron Dismuke created a deep, believable bond as Edward and Alphonse Elric in the popular fantasy-adventure ""Fullmetal Alchemist"" (shown on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim). The brothers try to use alchemy to revive their dead mother, but when the spell fails catastrophically, Edward loses his left leg and sacrifices his right arm to preserve Alphonse's soul in a suit of armor. Edward receives prosthetic steel limbs, while Alphonse remains a spirit housed in an empty metal shell.Aaron Dismuke faced a special problem when he was cast as Alphonse: he was only 11 and needed to complete the recordings before his voice changed. He imbues Alphonse with a gentle honesty typified in the wrenching moment when Edward says to his brother: ""I wouldn't blame you if you did, Al, but I've got to know: Do you hate me for all that's happened?"" Stunned, Alphonse replies, ""Brother, I could never hate you.""Mr. Mignogna said: ""Aaron is brilliant as Al, but we were probably halfway through the series before I met him at an anime convention in Dallas. It was like I'd known him my whole life: I ran up to him and yelled, 'Al, it's me!' ""The challenges for the writers can also be daunting. Japanese humor runs to difficult-to-translate puns and wordplays, and jokes or clues may be hidden in the characters' names. In the original Japanese, the hero's name in ""Tenchi Muyo!"" can be read as ""Earth and Heaven"" or as ""This Side Up.""""A joke may not make sense in English, so I have to explain why it's funny in Japanese,"" said the producer and translator Yurika Araki-Dennis. ""If there's no lip sync, we may add a line or a subtitle to explain something.""If the series is going straight to DVD, the audience will mainly be serious anime fans, which means we have to stick very close to the original. If there are too many discrepancies, they complain. If the show is intended for a broader TV audience, we have a little room to play with the interpretation.""Even if American viewers can be harsh judges of the English versions of their favorite series, they are often unclear about what makes a dub work, Mr. Rush said. ""When I meet people and tell them what I do for a living, a lot of times I get, 'You need to talk to my son, he can do all kinds of voices.' But it's not just a matter of doing voices. The acting has to come across so you believe what you're hearing and you buy into the story.""'"

Heck, we cut our teeth on Preston Sturges comedies or were terrorized by the gangsters of Humphrey Bogart and Sheldon Leonard in the 1930's. Now, old in years, young in spirit, we still line up at the box office, often filling theaters in the afternoon, when everyone else is working, raising children or at school.Listen up, Hollywood. Your grandma is calling.Duh! What took them so long? But now that we have their attention with ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,"" ""Ladies in Lavender"" and the rest, they proceed to muck it all up with Ms. Seidelman's ""Boynton Beach Club."" In case they didn't notice, none of the previous films featured aged Gidgets frolicking by the pool in unseemly beach attire. Actually they may want to leave the whole thing to the British.

I happen to be reading Geoff Emerick's wonderfully detailed book ""Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles"" right now, and having been through the mixing process with my amateur band, I know how important the discussions of (and fights over) mixes can be. The compromises are the resulting art.So let people have their fun and make sincere attempts to show what it could have been like. But I hope they all know that the way things happened back then is part of what made the Beatles the best.Re: ""An Amazing Race to Opening Night"" by Sarah Lyall [June 25]:My husband and I were in the audience for the opening-night performance of the winner of ""The Play's the Thing,"" the reality-show competition for writers.

I'm pleased to report that we had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The actors were polished, even the two children, and the quite complicated set changes went off without a hitch. Was the play the thing? I can say only that it was interesting, dramatic, full of good dialogue and left us wondering what the ending meant.'"

This casual new spot on the Napeague Stretch, the section of Route 27 between Amagansett and Montauk, is much more a Montauk kind of place than a sophisticated Hamptons restaurant.They call it ""lobster madness"" — a one-and-a-quarter-pound lobster for $9.95, offered from noon to 7 p.m. It is one reason why, at 6:30 on a Friday evening in mid-June, the dining room was filled with families and other budget-conscious diners. Parents were ordering the lobsters while the children had a bargain of their own: two quarter-pound cheeseburgers with first-rate French fries and creamy coleslaw for $11; four quarter-pound burgers for $18. Even the smaller version was big enough for two youngsters to share. The burgers were good, too, cooked precisely to order and running with juices.27 Lobster is an ultracasual spot with bare wood tables, paper napkins and placemats. The spare, all-white dining room is dominated by an imposing wooden horseshoe bar. Outside are umbrella tables, white fairy lights and spectacular sunsets.Service is as casual as the decor. The sweet young staff has smiles that light up the room and go a long way toward compensating for the auction-style delivery of dishes by servers who typically ask, ""Who gets the lobster roll?""By 10 p.m., the bar had become the focal point of the place, with its three 50-inch plasma televisions and its more than 30 tropical and frozen drinks.

"'06-07-10,'1','Aides to President Bush said they had not yet reached any conclusions about what legislation should look like. Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush, said lawyers for the White House, State Department and Justice Department were still reviewing the court's decision in the case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who is expected to take a leading role on the issue as a member of the Armed Services Committee, argued that the administration's version of the military commissions had to be ""reined in"" to make clear, for instance, that evidence gathered by coercive interrogation techniques could not be introduced as evidence.""I'm trying to get my colleagues to think about the international community's reception to what we do,"" said Mr. Graham, a former military lawyer. ""We've got a chance to improve our image.""In its decision, the Supreme Court said, on a 5-to-3 vote, that the planned commissions were unauthorized by federal statute and violated international law.Administration officials, who have been consulting with Mr. Graham, are looking to him to play a central part in drafting legislation. Senators John W. Warner of Virginia, who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and John McCain of Arizona also are expected to be at the forefront for the Republicans, while Senator Carl Levin of Michigan is quite likely to emerge as a point man for the Democrats.On the Judiciary Committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Republican chairman, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the committee's ranking Democrat, who first proposed Congressional action on military tribunals in 2001, are also expected to play central roles.The Supreme Court decision left lawmakers with the challenge of resolving a complicated legal issue under the pressure of a heated election season and a limited amount of time left on their calendar.While both parties are united in saying they want to act quickly, they face fights over what form of trial to use and whether the protections of the Geneva Conventions apply to terrorism suspects.In hearings on Capitol Hill this week, the House Armed Services Committee will take testimony from lawyers, including several sympathetic to the administration. Two Senate committees, Judiciary and Armed Services, will take testimony from constitutional lawyers and top military lawyers, who some Republican senators believe were ignored in the White House discussions that led to the establishment of commissions. The only administration officials scheduled to testify are lawyers from the Justice Department and the Pentagon.While Republicans are divided on central issues, Democrats have their own challenge. They see the court's decision as a rare rebuke to Mr. Bush, and they hope to turn the debate into a broader one over presidential power. But they said they also recognized that they must cooperate on legislation or risk being portrayed as weak on terrorism.Some Republicans and many Democrats say that the administration may have hurt itself by rebuffing efforts as early as 2001 by Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to set up some kind of military commission. ""Congress is going to want to be a full partner, and not a rubber stamp for this process,"" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas and a close ally of the White House.The central question is what kind of forum to set up. Commissions allow the government wide berth in introducing evidence, including hearsay, which is banned in military courts, and restrict the rights of the accused to be present in the court and to see the evidence against them. Military courts-martial, while not as strict as civilian courts, restrict the kind of evidence that can be introduced and allow the accused to interview witnesses and see even classified evidence.The White House has long resisted anything like courts-martial, saying they could require the government to choose between dropping the charges and disclosing more than it wants to about the sources and nature of the intelligence used to develop a case against the detainees.Senator Warner, who will direct the hearings as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he wanted a system that relied ""as much as possible"" on the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which the court decision said governed the treatment of detainees.Many lawmakers said they supported an approach based on some tweaking of the military system. Senators Graham and Specter, along with Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, advocate allowing hearsay, as well as a procedure to deal with classified evidence. The rules would be looser than in a court-martial but stricter than in a commission.""We have to have a system that operates in the war on terror and one that doesn't tie us into knots trying to prosecute the people who have killed Americans in large numbers,"" Mr. Hunter said.John C. Yoo, a professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked on orders expanding presidential power in the treatment of detainees as a former lawyer for the Justice Department, said, ""The debate that people are having is whether it's going to be a short bill that just overrules Hamdan completely, which you could do in one sentence, or whether it's going to be a much more comprehensive law that tries to set out essentially a code of procedure for the military commission.""But any effort simply to codify the president's order establishing commissions would be fiercely resisted by influential Democrats.""The Supreme Court said the president cannot continue to break the law,"" said Mr. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat. ""The worst thing to do would be to simply paper that over and say we'll make it possible for him to break the law.""An effort by Mr. Leahy in 2001 to introduce legislation establishing tribunals was rebuffed by the White House. ""They said no, they knew what they were doing, they would do it alone,"" Mr. Leahy said. ""What's happened? Five years, there have been no trials, no convictions, nothing has happened, we've had our reputation severely hurt throughout the rest of the world.""Mr. Graham similarly called it ""a mistake"" to give Congressional blessing to the military commissions as envisioned in Mr. Bush's presidential order. ""We have a chance to start over,"" he said.Another central question is whether the Geneva Conventions extend to accused terrorists. Mr. Graham and Mr. Cornyn say no, and Mr. Graham wants Congress to pass legislation overturning the court's finding that Common Article 3 of the conventions applies to detainees. The article's provisions outlawing degrading treatments, he believes, could mean that American soldiers would be subject to prosecution in the war on terror.But Mr. Cornyn, a former judge, said that the reference to Article 3 meant simply that any court must be established within the military justice system.""Congress should not, and the court did not hold that, they are entitled to the whole panoply of rights that the prisoner of war would be entitled to under circumstances where the Geneva Conventions apply,"" Mr. Cornyn said.Other Republicans, though, fear that any system that does not pay heed to the court's mentioning of the Geneva Conventions risks being rejected by the court again.""We've got to structure this law in such a way that if it ever came back up through the Supreme Court, it will not be struck down,"" Mr. Warner said. ""It's important for the credibility of the United States to put this issue at rest and let the world realize we're affording them the protections as the Supreme Court outlined.""Democrats will argue that harsh conditions at Guantánamo have made the prison a rallying cry for new terrorist recruits.""The issue we believe is most prescient is not the balance between security and liberty, where on issues like this the parties are relatively close, but on competence,"" said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ""They just don't do it right, wherever they go. By their stubbornness and refusal to work with Congress, they've made us worse off in Guantánamo today.""Congress has rearranged its schedule to debate the issue this month, and those leading the debate say that they want to vote on new legislation, if any is needed, by September.'"
"'06-07-10,'1','A Defense Ministry spokesman, Sitanshu Kar, would not comment on the report other than to say, ""The missile took off successfully, and the rest of the data need to be analyzed, in a day or two, to come to a conclusion.""India and neighboring Pakistan have often traded rounds of missile and nuclear tests in times of tension between them. But relations between the nations have improved lately, and the governments have a standing agreement to inform each other before such tests. On Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry confirmed that India had told it about the test in advance.While short-range missiles are enough to keep India and Pakistan in mutual range, analysts have seen India's development of long-range ballistic missiles, and the continuing development of its nuclear weapons program, as a strategic step to keep China in check. The listed range of the Agni 3, hundreds of miles longer than that of other missiles India has tested, would put more of China's major cities within striking distance.In the past two years, tensions between India and China have lessened somewhat, and direct border trade between them reopened last week along the storied Silk Road through the Himalayas for the first time since they fought a war 44 years ago.The BBC reported that before the launching on Sunday, India had twice postponed tests on the Agni 3, once for technical reasons and once because of concern about the international response while it was trying to seal its civilian nuclear deal with the Bush administration. In May, the Indian defense minister, Pranab Mukherjee, was quoted as saying that the missile was ready but that India was observing ""self-imposed restraint"" before testing.The nuclear deal between India and the United States is under review by Congress and would, in effect, remove all United States restrictions on nuclear trade with India that are in place because India has refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The only other countries to refuse are Israel and Pakistan. North Korea withdrew from the treaty three years ago.Under the deal, the United States would give vital help to the Indian civilian nuclear program, including uranium for fuel for civilian reactors. The United States would not provide any fuel for Indian weapons, but critics have pointed out that it would essentially free the limited Indian uranium supplies for weapons production. The agreement contains no restriction on how much or how fast India could increase the size of its nuclear arsenal.'"

"'06-07-10,'1','BERLIN, July 9 (Reuters) — Iran has barred a senior United Nations nuclear inspector who has criticized the government from visiting the country, a Western diplomat said Sunday.The diplomat was confirming a report in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, in which the International Atomic Energy Agency section chief for Iran, Chris Charlier of Belgium, was reported as saying that he had not been allowed into Iran for several months.""I haven't been allowed to travel to Iran since April,"" he was quoted as saying.

"'06-07-10,'1','For devotees of North African music, Hakim needs no introductions, but he received several anyway, with fanfare befitting a star nicknamed the Lion of Egypt, at Central Park SummerStage on Saturday. He was called the ""king of shaabi music,"" referring to his rhythmic street pop. ""This is the kind of thing that makes you proud to be Egyptian,"" a guest presenter said, and was met with earsplitting cheers from the crowd.People chanted Hakim's name. Young men sat on friends' shoulders, waving Egyptian flags. A woman clapping finger cymbals practiced her belly-dance moves.""See that over there?"" another host asked, pointing at a plain gray structure. ""That's Hakim's trailer.""Perhaps the intros ended anticlimactically, but Hakim made a properly grand entrance. After a long overture by his orchestra (which included a horn section, flute, keyboards, accordion, tabla, hand drums, electric bass and a rock drum kit) Hakim ran onstage singing ""El Salam,"" one of his biggest hits, from the 2002 album ""Talakik."" He wore faded jeans with a long wallet chain, a jeweled belt buckle and a crisp white shirt printed with English phrases like ""Do not disturb."" He blew kisses and immediately broke into his signature hip swivel.A consummate, warmhearted showman, Hakim did not stop moving for two hours. On record many of his songs start with a mawal (a slow, somber a cappella vocal), but on Saturday he mostly avoided this device, keeping the energy as high as possible. He engaged the audience in call and response while the band pumped out fast, serpentine beats. Soon a disoriented hippie fan stripped to his shorts and gyrated wildly. (He was later spotted resting face down on the ground.)Hakim is a proponent of cross-cultural unity. He was one of the first artists to update traditional shaabi with electric instruments, and he has collaborated with Western artists, including James Brown; he now plans to work with the reggaetón star Don Omar. Fittingly, the highlight of this thoroughly enjoyable show was ""Ah Ya Albi,"" a duet with the Dominican-American R&B singer Karina Pasian. (The Puerto Rican vocalist Olga Tañon sang the original recorded version.)Ms. Pasian, a petite teenager, had sounded too much like her idol and fellow pianist Alicia Keys during her opening set, even covering ""If I Ain't Got You."" When she joined Hakim onstage, she had a scarf decorated with gold coins wrapped around her Capri pants. As she confidently sang her part in Spanish, clinking those coins while dancing, it was easy to see why Island Def Jam had signed her at age 14.'"

Mr. Jordan has 11-year-old twins. In the same interview, Ms. Whitman said, ""Obviously I was really disappointed, because Jeff has made a huge difference to eBay,"" she said, adding ""He's got two relatively young children."" Ms. Whitman added that ""I have two children in college. It goes really fast.""Mr. Jordan said he remained ""wildly optimistic"" about PayPal's future, pointing out that last year, PayPal accounted for 10 percent of all e-commerce payments in the United States.In the first quarter of 2006, PayPal transferred nearly $9 billion in payments, a 41 percent increase over the previous year. In 2005, PayPal's revenue exceeded $1 billion, just under a quarter of the company's overall revenue of $4.552 billion.Mr. Jordan, who has served in several roles at the company since he arrived in 1999, took over at PayPal in December 2004. Last year, Ms. Whitman hired John J. Donahoe, a former managing director at Bain & Company, a management consulting firm where Ms. Whitman has also worked.One executive who recently left the company said he believed that Mr. Donahoe, who is currently president of eBay's marketplace unit, might have supplanted Mr. Jordan as the leading contender for the chief executive job, and for that reason Mr. Jordan chose to leave.Ms. Whitman, however, would not discuss succession plans. ""I'm here for the long term,"" she said, and added that ""there has been a lot of speculation, but the answer is, I'm here for the long term.""Nor, said Ms. Whitman, was she especially concerned about the drop in eBay's share price. ""I've said for many years that we manage a company, not a stock,"" she said. ""We control what we can control."" She added that the company's job was to deliver results and ""the stock price will take care of itself.""Tim Boyd, a research analyst with Caris & Company, called Mr. Jordan ""a great asset"" for eBay. ""Certainly there's no question it's a loss. He's probably the most important long-term veteran they've lost.""Several observers, including Mr. Boyd, who is recommending eBay stock, said they thought Wall Street overreacted to Mr. Jordan's departure. Mr. Boyd points out that eBay's revenue continues to grow — 40 percent last year, after a 51 percent increase the previous year — its operating margin remains a healthy 36 percent and it still dominates the European e-commerce market.The announcement of Mr. Jordan's departure came two months after the company said that Maynard Webb, the chief operating officer, would retire in August. Others who have left eBay recently include Lynn Reedy and Michael Dearing, both senior vice presidents.Mr. Jordan will be succeeded by Rajiv Dutta, who has been serving as president of Skype, the Internet phone service that eBay acquired last year for $2.6 billion. Alex Kazim, vice president of products for Skype, will become its president.The longer-term issue facing eBay is the challenge of Google, which is luring the kind of sellers who helped build eBay into a powerhouse and which recently unveiled an online payment service called Google Checkout, a rival to PayPal.""Many of eBay's challenges correlate closely with Google's rise to prominence over the past three to four years,"" said Derek Brown, an analyst with Pacific Growth Equities who has had a sell recommendation on the stock since 2003. ""It's a matter that is likely to become increasingly prominent as Google encroaches more directly on eBay's business."" (Mr. Brown said he owned shares in Google.)One trend that analysts are reporting is sellers leaving eBay and setting up their own Web-based stores, using keywords they buy from Google to drive traffic to their sites. ""I think the rate of decline of the popularity of eBay's auction model has accelerated,"" said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Company. ""You add to that a behemoth like Google and the trend is unstoppable.""The announcement of Mr. Jordan's departure came shortly after Google introduced Google Checkout, a simple way to store credit card information with participating merchants.""Google really thought about this one,"" said Mr. Rashtchy, who has a hold rating on eBay stock. Mr. Rashtchy said he was particularly impressed by the ease of using the new Google feature.Last week eBay added Google Checkout to a list of payment services its sellers cannot use, which will continue ""for the foreseeable future,"" said Hani Durzy, a spokesman for eBay, based in San Jose, Calif. Mr. Boyd of Caris pointed out that Google was offering discounts to sellers who sign up for Checkout. ""They're basically subsidizing advertisers to adopt Google Checkout,"" he said.Ms. Whitman said the timing of the announcement of Mr. Jordan's departure was ""completely coincidental"" with Google Checkout, adding that several other management changes had to be decided before the announcement. Ms. Whitman said that a move like this required coordination of many moving parts.'"
"'06-07-10,'1','Paula ""never confused her workaday world with the lives of the rich and superrich with whom she was in daily contact,"" Mr. Bamberger writes approvingly. He himself has more problems in this area, as he vicariously appreciates Night's home outside Philadelphia (""it was maybe the grandest of all the horse-country estates""), Night's staff, Night's fresh fruit and Night's ""chicken with perfect grill lines."" The last two were shared by Night's cast and crew, and the book takes note of his generosity.But back to Paula: in a story that will live in legend, Mr. Bamberger reveals how she was not welcomed with sufficient deference at the home of the powerful Disney executive Nina Jacobson. Ms. Jacobson is blasted for having taken her son to a birthday party instead of dedicating her Sunday to Night's precise timetable for script-reading. ""What could Nina be doing that's more important than getting Night's new script?"" Mr. Bamberger asks. (The italics are his.) Then the coup de grâce: Paula was offered ""low-carb soup from the refrigerator."" The implications are clear: it may have come from a can.The book describes Night's sustained petulance over this snubbing in terms that are, by any standards known on Planet Earth, astounding. So is Mr. Bamberger's ability to pipe-cleaner any anecdote until it twists into a lesson about Night. Night reminds himself of Bob Dylan — and Mr. Dylan's ability to affect a wide and diverse audience is very like Night's, according to the book. When the film's leading lady, Bryce Dallas Howard, is covered with welts after having been dragged across grass and twigs, Night is the injured party. ""I can't have a reputation as a director who doesn't protect his actors,"" he is quoted as saying.There's a howler on every page for a while. But eventually there's also something real. If only because he had to finish this book so hurriedly (it has a final section dated April 18, 2006), Mr. Bamberger stops genuflecting long enough to capture a Wizard of Oz poignancy about his subject. This happens despite the fact that Night is ""devastated"" when not enough cast and crew members show up for his ""Wizard of Oz"" screening.""Beneath Night's zeal were great reserves of sadness and desperation,"" the book finally acknowledges. Its overall sense of the filmmaker's self-importance certainly jibes with that impression. There are glimpses of a childhood full of parental pressure, with an emphasis on whopping accomplishments. When Mr. Shyamalan appeared on the cover of Newsweek, his father told him that Time had a bigger circulation. His mother is an obstetrician who once removed a record-breaking 80-pound ovarian cyst. ""No wonder Night was such a stat man,"" Mr. Bamberger says.There are actually other people who figure in ""The Man Who Heard Voices."" Eventually the book shifts its emphasis and finds time for them. The boozy antics of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle stand out, as does the personal style of Paul Giamatti, the new film's leading man. ""Dude, I am so 'Lady,' "" he told Mr. Shyamalan as he accepted the role.Although Mr. Bamberger treats this film set as if it were the only one that has ever been made, he does a decent job of explaining the function of each cast and crew member. Then there are the executives' roles. ""Lady in the Water"" was made by Warner Brothers, but the book expresses some kind of backhanded gratitude from Mr. Shyamalan to Disney, because what hurt him eventually made him stronger. By that standard, ""The Man Who Heard Voices"" will do him a world of good.'"

"'06-07-10,'1','Neither won the Wimbledon title, but Nadal and Henin-Hardenne underscored the learned skill of adaptation. And this may be Federer's most important legacy. Beyond his jazz-riff movements on the court and his classy carriage off it, beyond his major titles and worldly perspective, he has set the bar for intelligent tennis.""If I have helped players to sort of play an all-around game on all surfaces — and I saw Nadal coming into net more today, too, using the slice more often — if I have brought this to the game, I'm very happy,"" Federer said.•In a striped shirt, designer jeans and, yes, that ubiquitous, clubby blazer, Federer sat at a table in a small room across from center court, where, an hour earlier, he took his fourth straight Wimbledon title.Federer owns eight majors, one on every surface but clay. But he was a French Open finalist last month and one win from holding all four majors in his hand before Nadal stopped him.He scored revenge at Wimbledon against Nadal, his charming nemesis, while validating his credibility as the No. 1 player in the world and re-establishing his poised superiority. But the captivating rivalry with Nadal is, in part, of Federer's making.""My game is to adapt to the opponent and to the surfaces,"" Federer said.His approach is catchy. Perhaps no one looks up to Federer, nearly 25 years old, more than the 20-year-old Nadal. He pounds, Federer feathers. Nadal grinds, Federer glides. But Nadal is motivated by the talent Federer possesses.""We going to see,"" Nadal said. ""I want to improve. I just have 20 years. He has 25. So maybe, maybe in the future I can improve.""Versatility isn't a talent, but a desire to extend ability. Where did Nadal find this spirit of court innovation? Not at an American academy.Nadal's parents resisted that siren's song. He stayed close to home, hardly straying from Majorca, remaining far from the Nick Bollettieri-style compounds in Florida.Instead, Nadal grew up with dimension, was raised a chameleon. He was a natural right-hander, but he was transformed into a lefty for strategic purposes. He spoke almost no English two years ago, but he has expanded his vocabulary by constantly asking, ""How do you say?"" He then pronounces the word over and over for practice.Nadal applied his eagerness to learn and adjust as he decoded the subtleties of grass during Wimbledon.""I know more the movements, the strategy on court, the way to serve and play more aggressive with my forehand than with my backhand,"" Nadal said yesterday. ""I need change a little bit, or play a little bit more slow, not with a lot of topspin. Sometimes you can play, but not every ball, no? That's the real important points for improve on this surface, no?""•Such court awareness isn't a virtue of American tennis academies. And the forehand factories are not the answer to the country's talent deficit. But in a desperate attempt to do something, anything, about the vacuum, the United States Tennis Association announced last week that it would house a new program to produce stars at the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Fla.""We've got to do everything,"" Patrick McEnroe, the United States Davis Cup coach, said during a U.S.T.A. news conference. ""We can't sit there and say, 'Hey, someone makes better widgets now, so we should forget how good we can make our widgets.' ""The widget player is the problem, though. The numbing baseline games, the one-dimensional plans, the mechanical style, these characteristics will only send Americans down the rankings. Nuance has to be a part of the U.S.T.A. program at the Evert Academy if it is to succeed at producing players as resourceful as they are robotic.""All of the sudden, all the clay-courters, they can also now compete at a very, very high level, also on the other surfaces,"" Federer said. ""And it shows, with Nadal being in the final here. Really, what you need to be is a good player to get to the top of a Grand Slam finals.""Intelligence isn't manufactured, but nurtured. None of the Wimbledon finalists — men or women — came directly from an American academy.""I use my skills, my technique, my tactics and my mind to try to win matches,"" Federer said. ""And it's been working.""Welcome to the Federer Era, in which there is little room for shallow, superficial tennis.'"
"'06-07-10,'1','Why are corporations moving back to New York? Manhattan's appeal is obvious: the Big Apple is the best place for top executives to ""network face to face with their peers in the hub of the financial, legal and communications industries,"" as the article puts it. But that's an advantage New York has offered ever since it became America's largest city.In the past, however, this face-to-face communication came at a high price: in order to keep their top executives in Manhattan, companies also had to pay the rent on large office buildings and fill those buildings with thousands of lower-level employees, paying those employees wages high enough to compensate for New York's high cost of living. Many companies decided that the benefits of a New York headquarters weren't worth the cost.Now, however, it's possible for many of the people who would formerly have worked at corporate headquarters to work somewhere else instead, communicating with management electronically. And that makes it worthwhile to move top executives back to the center of things.The same thing may be happening in the financial industry, which these days is New York's principal ""export"" — that is, New Yorkers sell all sorts of things to each other, but they mainly sell financial services to other Americans and the rest of the world.If you looked only at the employment numbers, you might think that New York's export base is in trouble. A recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York points out that over the past 30 years, finance-sector employment has been shifting away from New York City toward lower-cost locations, both in the outer parts of the New York metropolitan area and in places like Dallas and San Antonio.But what seems to be happening is that only relatively low-paid finance jobs are moving out of New York, while highly paid jobs are actually moving in. The Fed study shows that New York's share of U.S. financial industry earnings, as opposed to employment, is actually higher now than it was in 1970. And it's a good guess that financial firms, like corporate headquarters, find it easier to put their top people in New York now that the back-office work can be carried out someplace cheaper.The story of the New York economy isn't entirely a happy one. The city has essentially lost all of its manufacturing, and it's now in the process of outsourcing both routine office work and many middle-management functions to other parts of the country.What's left is an urban economy that offers a mix of very highly paid financial jobs and low-wage service jobs, with relatively little in the middle. Economic disparities in New York, as in the United States as a whole, are wider than they have been since the 1920's.But for once, let me focus on the positive: the world's greatest city, a city that a generation ago seemed to be in irreversible decline, seems to be doing O.K.'"

"'06-07-11,'1','But Democrats and independent budget analysts say that government revenues are now only barely above their level of six years ago, before the economy went into a brief recession. They say that this year’s tax receipts appear to be a surge only because the last five years were so weak.The White House said today that tax receipts in this fiscal year will total $2.4 trillion, $119 billion higher than expected, mainly because of a jump in corporate tax payments. Those are up 19 percent for the fiscal year, compared with an 11 percent increase in overall tax collections. A rise in tax collections on executive bonuses and stock-market profits also contributed to the improved flow of revenue.The Treasury greatly benefited from rapid economic expansion during the first quarter, which reached an annual rate of 5.6 percent. Many economists expect the growth rate to slow considerably for the rest of 2006, and settle closer to a more sustainable 3 percent.Mr. Bush also used his speech to press the Senate to give him the authority to veto parts of spending bills line by line, rather than have to sign or veto the whole bill. Last month, the House passed a bill that would give the president the power to strike individual sections of legislation, but the Senate is viewed as much less likely to go along with the idea.“We cannot depend on just a growing economy to keep cutting the deficit,” Mr. Bush said. “That’s just one part of the equation. We’ve got to cut out wasteful spending.”Since Mr. Bush took office in 2001, total federal debt has soared to $8.3 trillion from $5.6 trillion at the end of the Clinton administration. Over all, collection of taxes from businesses and individuals has not kept up with economic growth over the past five years, but government spending has grown much faster than the economy. The war in Iraq has added considerably to the financial burden: some $300 billion has been spent on it since 2003.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','BOSTON, July 10 — The EMC Corporation, the maker of data storage equipment, said on Monday that it would fall short of its profit and revenue goals for the second quarter, citing a lack of inventory to meet customer demand for one of its newest data storage systems.EMC, whose stock was recently hurt by concerns about the cost of its latest acquisition, said it now expected net income of 12 cents a share — a penny a share short of the 13-cent estimate the company offered June 7. Quarterly revenue was $2.575 billion, about 3 percent short of its forecast of $2.66 billion.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had expected EMC to post a profit of 13 cents a share, on average, and revenue of $2.67 billion.The latest result matches the 12-cents-a-share profit that EMC posted in last year’s second quarter. But the most recent quarter includes an expense of 2 cents a share to account for employee stock option expenses, which EMC began to count against its earnings this year to comply with a new accounting rule. The most recent quarter also includes a charge of 2 cents a share for amortization expenses, and a penny-a-share tax benefit.EMC said it was hurt by a shortage of inventory to meet greater-than-expected demand late in the quarter for its newest storage system, the Symmetrix DMX-3. Orders for an earlier version, the DMX-2, were consequently fewer than expected.EMC said bookings for its products were up 14 percent for the quarter, however.Shares of EMC, which plans to announce second-quarter earnings on Friday, fell 77 cents, or 6.9 percent, to close at $10.41.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','BALLWIN, Mo., July 10 — Five children drowned on a church outing Sunday after one became caught in a river’s undertow and the others jumped in to help, the authorities said.The five children were among a group of about 50 youngsters with the St. Louis Dream Center, an interdenominational church that was celebrating a volunteer appreciation day with a barbecue and swimming at Castlewood State Park here outside St. Louis.Tracy Panus, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis County police, said witnesses had reported that six children had been swept away after stopping to play in the Meramec River. The authorities worked through the night to find them, but four boys and one girl did not survive. The sixth child, a boy, was rescued and hospitalized.Terry Ledbetter, chief investigator for the county medical examiner’s office, identified the dead as Ryan Mason, 14; Damon Johnson, 17; Bryant Barnes, 10; and Deandra Sherman, 16, all boys; and Dana Johnson, a 13-year-old girl. All except Deandra had the same mother, Edris Moore, and all were from St. Louis.Ms. Panus said rescue workers had been hampered by inconsistent reports about how many children were attending the event and how many were missing. She quoted parents as saying those swept away could swim.Gary Barra, a lieutenant with the county police, said the bodies had been found in water 8 to 12 feet deep, though parts of the river are shallow enough to walk in. The bodies were about 200 yards downstream from a sandy beach where the group probably entered the water, said Vincent T. Loyal, chief of the Metro West Fire Department.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','Alcoa, the world’s largest aluminum producer, said yesterday that second-quarter profit soared on higher metal prices and strong aerospace demand, although revenue fell below Wall Street expectations and shares fell.Net earnings were $744 million, or 85 cents a share, in contrast to $460 million, or 52 cents a share in the same quarter last year, the company, based in Pittsburgh, said.Earnings from continuing operations were 86 cents a share, just what analysts had been expecting, according to Reuters Estimates.The results included a charge of about 4 cents a share for costs associated with a new four-year labor agreement with workers belonging to the United Steelworkers union.In its earnings release, Alcoa said revenue in the quarter rose to $7.96 billion, from $6.70 billion a year earlier. That was lower than analyst expectations of $8.14 billion.The company said results were driven by higher prices on the London Metals Exchange and market demand in aerospace, building and construction, as well as in commercial vehicles and can sheet markets.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','Administration officials are frustrated that Mr. Bush’s popular support has plunged, mainly because of the war in Iraq, even as the economy has grown briskly and unemployment has remained comparatively low at 4.6 percent.On Tuesday, the administration plans to announce that this year’s budget deficit will be lower than projected because tax revenues are climbing faster than expected.Last Friday, Mr. Bush visited a microelectronics factory near Chicago to highlight the nation’s high-technology strength and the newest employment statistics.But Mr. Paulson will be taking over at a time when the economy appears to be slowing, inflation is rising and gasoline prices have climbed to nearly $3.20 a gallon in many regions.The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates 17 times in two years and is expected to increase them at least once more. The once-sizzling housing market has slowed noticeably, with prices edging down in some cities and homes remaining on the market much longer than in the recent past.Although Mr. Bush’s economic policy, with its emphasis on tax cuts, deregulation and trade, has a distinct ideological cast, Mr. Paulson will be leading a new economic team that has an early reputation as more pragmatic than ideological.Mr. Bush’s chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, is a former Goldman executive who is trying to improve ties between the White House and Congress. Rob Portman, who recently took over as director of the Office of Management and Budget, served as Mr. Bush’s chief trade negotiator and, before that, was a Republican representative from Ohio known for his expertise on pension and saving issues.White House officials are hoping that Mr. Paulson can develop the kind of stature that was accorded to James A. Baker III under President Ronald Reagan, and Robert E. Rubin, another former chairman of Goldman Sachs, under President Bill Clinton.To help guide him through an administration thick with existing relationships and rivalries, Mr. Paulson recruited James R. Wilkinson, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, as his chief of staff. Mr. Wilkinson has a reputation as a shrewd political adviser and one with a background in foreign policy as well.Before working under Ms. Rice, Mr. Wilkinson was a communications strategist at the National Security Council and, before that, communications director for the United States Central Command during the first year of the war in Iraq.Mr. Paulson suggested that his top priorities would be international issues; he said little about major domestic initiatives. His most forceful remarks were about the need to promote a greater engagement in the world economy.“We must always remember that the strength of the U.S. economy is linked to the strength of the global economy,’’ he said after being sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts. “If we retreat from the global stage, the void is likely to be filled by those who do not share our commitment to economic reform.’’Mr. Paulson could have his hands full on the international front. With the trade deficit approaching $800 billion this year, the United States needs to attract more than $8 billion a day from foreign investors to pay for its current level of consumption.A loss of confidence in the dollar could aggravate inflation pressures by pushing up import prices. It could also push up long-term interest rates, which remain surprisingly low even though the Fed has pushed up overnight rates.Mr. Paulson’s other challenge will be budget issues. Though tax revenues have increased sharply this year, spending continues to climb rapidly as a result of the war in Iraq, hurricane relief and the new Medicare prescription-drug program.Despite more than four years of economic growth, tax revenues have barely recovered to their level in 2000 and the deficit is still likely to be about $300 billion this year.Mr. Bush made it clear that he expected Mr. Paulson to help make his tax cuts permanent, which would cost more than $1 trillion over the next decade.“Our first challenge is to keep taxes low,’’ Mr. Bush said. “Hank understands that cutting taxes has helped launch the strong economic expansion that is lifting the lives of millions of Americans.’’“We need to pursue economic and regulatory policies that are responsive to today’s world,’’ he said. He did not mention tax cuts, one way or the other.'"

"'06-07-11,'1','The Neyveli sale of a 10 percent stake, for example, would have raised about $500 million. During 14 years of economic change, the process of privatization has raised nearly $12 billion for the government, according to figures from Morgan Stanley.But investors fear that this stoppage may signal a larger setback, one that impedes not only the privatization of hundreds of state-owned companies, but also the entire process of economic restructuring. Those sales also have helped the government trim its budget deficits.Foreign institutional investors have been bullish about the Indian economy and its soaring 8 percent growth rates, pouring more than $10 billion into Indian equities in 2005 and $8.4 billion in 2004.But in the last two months, the mood has soured as the stock market tumbled, with the benchmark Sensex index falling more than 15 percent from its high on May 10. Now, analysts say that the move to stop sales of stakes in state-owned companies could further discourage investors.Privatization had come virtually to a standstill, as opposition rose from regional allies and workers’ unions.The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party, an important regional ally in the 19-party coalition led by Mr. Singh’s Congress Party, threatened to pull out of the coalition government if it proceeded to sell the 10 percent stake in Neyveli Lignite.The party governs Tamil Nadu, the southern state where Neyveli is based. Thousands of its workers, who had been striking against the stake sale and possible job losses, resumed work after the government said it would call off the sale.“It is not a complete disaster that the privatizations have been shelved,” said Shankar Narayanan, a managing director who leads capital investment growth in India for the Carlyle Group, the American-based private investment firm. “But after frenetic sell-offs, this is a retrograde step.” Mr. Narayanan manages part of Carlyle’s $668 million Asia fund.In the 1950’s, under a socialist-based plan seeking self-sufficiency for the newly independent India, the Congress Party government of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru set out to establish a variety of companies. Over the decades, the government became pervasive in the Indian economy, managing companies that made cars, baked bread, wrote software, ran hotels, prospected for gold and even manufactured condoms.But the Congress Party’s hold on political power loosened over the years, and, under a program accelerated by the previous government, officials in New Delhi sold majority stakes in a variety of companies.The funds raised were expected to finance a social-equity agenda by helping build roads, power projects, schools and hospitals, and by providing jobs in poor rural regions.“The reforms process is much larger than just the sale of stake in a few companies,” said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive of the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy in Mumbai. “We are moving in the general direction of economic reforms.”But the larger process of economic reallocation has been mired in politics. For instance, the government has been unable to move forward on the politically sensitive revision of labor laws. Currently, hiring or firing employees by companies is still dictated by convoluted rules.Similarly, politically explosive proposals like selling stakes in Indian banks have been repeatedly discussed and shelved. And while global retailers like Wal-Mart or Tesco knock on India’s doors, the government has chosen not to allow direct foreign investment in retailing.Even in sectors where reform is relatively uncontroversial, like infrastructure and finance, the pace has been slow. About the only recent change of any significance has been the recent privatization of India’s busiest airports in Mumbai and New Delhi.Still, some investors say that the country’s fundamental growth factors are in place. “We remain positive and unambiguous about India,” Mr. Narayanan said.But underlying the current economic growth rates, Mr. Ahya, the economist, said, the slowing of change could lead investors, to “go through some pain.”'"
"'06-07-11,'1','The launchings have underscored how much the North Korea issue has transformed South Korea and Japan in recent years and set them heading in opposite directions, making it harder for Washington to achieve foreign policy goals like United Nations sanctions against the North. As South Korea has engaged North Korea and begun reconciliation, the process has reshaped its image of the North and complicated its relationship with the United States.Japan, which began shaking off its postwar pacifism after North Korea fired a long-range missile over its territory in 1998, has led the campaign to punish it for last week’s missile tests. In the last two days, Japanese officials have openly begun talking about whether Japan should acquire the military capacity to make pre-emptive strikes.“South Korea is minimizing the threat, to manage the hawkish reaction from the United States and Japan,” said Lee Geun, a professor of international relations at Seoul National University who is a visiting professor at Kyushu University in Japan. “Japan is exaggerating the threat in order to pursue the goals of strengthening its self-defense forces and the U.S.-Japan alliance.”To a great extent, though, the South’s insouciance about the North’s threat is the product of years of peaceful relations. As in 1994, when North Korea threatened to turn Seoul into a “sea of fire,” trouble with their northern cousins used to send South Koreans scurrying to buy up bottled water and instant noodles.But since last Wednesday retailers have reported no hoarding, no spike in sales of instant noodles.Consider the two young South Koreans who were sitting outside on a bench here. Asked about their reaction four days after the launchings, Chun Kwon Mi, 27, and Kim Chung Nam, 30, responded with blank stares. “They fired?” said Ms. Chun, who works in online shopping and does not follow the news.Mr. Kim, a construction worker, had not heard about the missiles either. “We never talked about it at work,” he said.Reconciliation with the North began in earnest in 2000 after Kim Dae Jung, then South Korea’s president, and Kim Jong Il, the North’s leader, held a historic meeting in Pyongyang, North Korea’s capital.Since then, under its current president, Roh Moo Hyun, South Korea has pursued a policy of engaging — or coddling, critics say — the North. The South is now the North’s second-biggest trading partner and aid donor, behind China, and thousands of South Koreans travel to the North each month for tourism, business and a multitude of exchanges.North Koreans are now regarded by Southerners as long-lost brethren, objects of pity or targets of ridicule — but rarely enemies. “They weren’t firing at us,” said Nam Chul, 44, a welder. “They were firing at the United States and Japan. For North Korea this is almost like their own home, so why should they fire at us?”Older South Koreans tend to be more distrustful of the North, but their fear, too, has decreased.“In general we’ve become too relaxed toward North Korea,” said Kang Min Chung, who was waiting for a bus. Nevertheless, Ms. Kang supports engaging the North. “But because my generation went through the Korean War, I’d still like to stay close to the United States,” she said.South Korea’s policy has created friction with the Bush administration, which prefers to try to isolate the North and force its government to collapse. Experts say North Korea is likely to become a long-term strain in the Washington-Seoul alliance, because a consensus has formed here that conflict should be avoided at all costs and that the only sure disaster would be the North’s collapse.Park Jin, a lawmaker in the opposition Grand National Party, said his party favored a “more balanced” version of the engagement policy, which he termed “necessary not only for cooperation with North Korea, but also to try to make it reform.”Washington’s opposition to engagement has stirred anti-American feelings here and a belief among some that the United States is standing in the way of reconciliation and eventual reunification.“North Korea is an independent country, so why shouldn’t they be able to fire missiles?” said Kim Yung Reoul, 36, a pastor. “It’s remarkable — they’ve confronted the United States. I felt quite satisfied. I felt as if I’d finally digested something that I had trouble digesting.”Mr. Hill, the American diplomat, said he understood why South Korea’s reaction to the missile tests had been muted. “The Chinese talk about their century of shame,” he said in an interview here. “In the case of South Korea you have this brutal division.”South Korea’s “whole North policy is predicated on some sort of long-term notion that somewhere through these sets of evolutionary policies that this will eventually get better,” Mr. Hill said. “Then this period of great tragedy can be put behind them. So when you have these moments that argue for the opposite, it’s just upsetting for people. And we just need to be aware of that.”'"

"'06-07-11,'1','BORDEAUX, France, July 10 — The riders in the Tour de France enjoyed the first of two Mondays off, most of them using the time to rest in preparation for the terrain ahead in the Pyrenees.The route for Stage 9 on Tuesday covers 105.3 miles of mainly flat territory from Bordeaux to Dax, and should give the sprinters another chance to shine before the true contenders establish themselves in the Pyrenees in southwest France. The race should be decided, as it almost always is, in that mountain range. The race enters the Pyrenees on Wednesday for two daily stages, then moves into the Alps next week.The strongest or most consistent climber does not always win the Tour, but having a combination of power and consistency is vital. A rider who gains four minutes one day in the mountains, then loses four minutes the next, can be shattered psychologically because of the lack of progress.Some riders have positioned themselves nicely to make a move in the Pyrenees. After winning the individual time trial Saturday, Serhiy Honchar of Ukraine, a rider on the T-Mobile team, is the overall leader. Floyd Landis of the United States, who rides for Phonak, is a minute behind and certainly within striking distance.The other riders from the United States are in less-promising positions. George Hincapie, on the Discovery Channel team, struggled in the time trial and is 17th over all, 2:30 behind Honchar.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','The release of the White House midsession budget review is an annual event normally marked by a few wonkish observations and the routine updating of various spreadsheets, not by a full-dress presidential dog-and-pony show. But President Bush plans to preside today, with members of Congress and invited guests in attendance. By all indications, including his own in his weekly radio address last Saturday, he plans to turn this into a celebration — just in time for the fall campaign.This is proof, if anyone still needs it, that this administration is desperate for something to boast about. On Mr. Bush’s watch, triple-digit budget surpluses have turned into annual triple-digit budget deficits. There’s no information in the midsession report to alter that utterly dispiriting fact. Yes, the report is expected to project that this year’s deficit will be somewhat less gargantuan than last year’s — probably somewhere between $280 billion and $300 billion, versus a $318 billion shortfall in 2005. That’s not much to crow about.But Mr. Bush is likely to gloat, anyway. Earlier this year, the administration conveniently projected a highly inflated deficit of $423 billion. With that as a starting point, the actual results can be spun to look as if they’re worth cheering.The razzle-dazzle won’t end there. As he did in his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Bush is sure to use today’s event to credit tax cuts for a projected “surge” in tax revenue. The Treasury is expected to take in about $250 billion more in 2006 than in 2005, for a total take of $2.4 trillion. Devoid of context, the number looks impressive.In fact, it is $100 billion less than the $2.5 trillion revenue estimate the administration touted when it set out in 2001 to sell its policy of never-ending tax cuts. Even with this year’s bigger haul, real revenue growth during the Bush years will be abysmal, averaging about 0.3 percent per capita, versus an average of nearly 10 percent in all previous post-World War II business cycles. That might be excusable if the recent revenue improvements could reasonably be expected to continue. They cannot. Much of the increase in tax receipts is from corporate profits, high-income investors and super high-earning executives, sources that are just as unpredictable as the financial markets to which they’re inevitably linked.So, the revenue surge is neither a sign that the tax cuts are working nor of sustainable economic growth. A growing number of economists, most prominently from the Congressional Budget Office, point out that upsurges in revenue are also the result of growing income inequality in the United States, an observation that is consistent with mounting evidence of a rapidly widening gap between the rich and everyone else. As corporations and high- income Americans claim ever more of the economic pie, revenues rise, even if there’s no increase in overall economic growth.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','TOKYO, July 10 — Japan ratcheted up the oratory on Monday against North Korea over last week’s missile tests when a top government spokesman said Japan should consider whether its Constitution would allow pre-emptive military strikes.A United States envoy called for countries involved to speak with “one voice” in condemning the tests.Japan has reacted more strongly than other countries to North Korea’s missile tests, which fanned already simmering outrage here over the North’s past abductions of Japanese citizens and a test eight years ago that sent a missile sailing over Japan.On Monday, Japanese officials made some of their most forceful comments yet, when Shinzo Abe, the chief cabinet secretary and a leading candidate to succeed Junichiro Koizumi as prime minister in the fall, said Japan needed to consider whether its pacifist Constitution would allow pre-emptive attacks on North Korean missile sites in self-defense.“If we accept that there is no other option to prevent a missile attack,” he told reporters, “there is an argument that attacking the missile bases would be within the legal right of self-defense.”'"
"'06-07-11,'1','“A worst-case scenario could be devastating — that is, after all, why it’s called a worst-case scenario,” Dr. Frieden said. “But it’s also an unlikely one.”The plan emphasizes the importance of early detection to help contain the spread of the illness. Officials said that they had strengthened communications with doctors across the city, who often see the first signs of infection. In addition, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has developed a monitoring system that can keep track of 60,000 pieces of information each day, Mr. Bloomberg said, including ambulance runs, emergency room visits and pharmacy sales.In the event of an outbreak, though, officials said that they would turn to traditional methods of containing the spread by encouraging certain behavior among those infected.“It’s low technology, but it works: covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze; not going out if you have fever and cough,” Dr. Frieden said. “These are very important things people can do to reduce the spread of infection, and if there were a pandemic, they would be our first line of defense.”Although Dr. Frieden said that he did not anticipate the need to quarantine vast numbers of flu victims, the plan does outline situations under which voluntary or mandatory isolation measures would be encouraged or imposed to contain the disease.Officials said that they had expanded the capacity of laboratories to test for the flu virus, and had developed plans with hospitals and clinics to handle the expected surge in patients. They have also taken steps to ensure that medical services unrelated to the flu could continue.In an outbreak, the health department, which would act as the lead agency coordinating the city’s response, would also decide whether to recommend measures like closing schools, discouraging people from taking mass transit or canceling large public events.In developing the plan, officials have had to grapple with establishing how medications would be distributed because there would probably not be enough available to treat every patient. They predict that stockpiles of antiviral drugs are likely to be used for treatment, rather than prevention, and probably only within the first 48 hours of infection, when they are most likely to be effective.Likewise, any vaccines, once available, would be distributed along federal guidelines, officials said, first going to health and emergency workers and other priority groups.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','WASHINGTON, July 10 — Twenty retired military officers say they have “deep concern” about the fitness of the Defense Department’s general counsel to be a federal judge because he approved coercive techniques to interrogate terror suspects.In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the officers urged a thorough examination of the role of the counsel, William J. Haynes II, in adopting policies “that compromised military values, ignored federal and international law and damaged America’s reputation and world leadership.”The letter cited Mr. Haynes’s recommendation that dogs be used “to exploit phobias” of terror suspects.Mr. Haynes was originally nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va., in 2003. President Bush resubmitted his name last year.The signers of the letter include a retired Marine Corps general, Joseph P. Hoar, a former commander of United States forces in the Middle East; and Lawrence B. Wilkerson, a retired Army colonel who was chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.'"
"'06-07-11,'1','Mr. Meshal was also critical of the United States and other Western countries for placing so much emphasis on one Israeli soldier when Israel was holding nearly 9,000 Palestinian prisoners.“The aggression did not start with the imprisonment of the soldier,” Mr. Meshal said. Speaking of Israel’s current operations in Gaza, where it has been carrying out the first incursions since withdrawing almost a year ago, he said, “Israel is practicing state terrorism and is in violation of international law.”He said that Corporal Shalit had been seized in a “clean military operation” and that Hamas considered him a prisoner of war.In Gaza, the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had offered to mediate and had sought to see the corporal but had not received a response from the Palestinians.Israeli airstrikes killed seven Palestinians in four separate attacks on Monday, said Palestinian security officials, medical workers and journalists. Four of the dead were militants, the Palestinians said. Several people were wounded, including an 8-year-old girl, medical workers said.In one of the attacks, on Monday evening, an Israeli missile killed three unarmed teenagers who were near a site where militants were firing rockets from Beit Hanun in northeast Gaza, Palestinian journalists said. The Israeli military said that it had fired at militants who were launching two rockets there, and that it was checking the Palestinian report on the casualties.Since Israel began its offensive nearly two weeks ago, about 50 Palestinians have been killed, most of them militants, but also several civilians. One Israeli soldier was killed, but the military concluded that he had been hit by Israeli gunfire.While there are no signs of a breakthrough, some Israeli officials have suggested that Israel could release some Palestinian prisoners if several things happened first: the release of the Israeli soldier, a halt in the rocket fire from Gaza aimed at Israeli towns, and a renewed and more formal cease-fire.The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya of Hamas, called Saturday for a mutual cease-fire, which Israel rejected as long as its soldier was held.Mr. Olmert told his cabinet on Sunday that before Corporal Shalit had been seized, Israel had been prepared to hand over some prisoners to the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, who opposes attacks on Israel and seeks a resumption of negotiations.The soldier’s father, Noam Shalit, has spoken out in favor of a deal to resolve the crisis, and opinion polls indicate that a solid majority of Israelis support his position. “I say again, I think it is clear to everyone that we won’t get something for nothing in the Middle East,” Mr. Shalit told Israel radio.Israeli leaders say they believe that a tough military response will discourage the Palestinians from seizing soldiers, firing rockets and carrying out other attacks.Some European countries have criticized Israel’s military actions, describing them as disproportionate and imposing too many hardships on civilians. Mr. Olmert replied that the critics’ attention should be on the daily Palestinian rocket fire from northern Gaza into southern Israel.“When was the last time that the European Union condemned this shooting and suggested effective measures to stop it?” he said. “At some point Israel had no choice but to take some measures.”The European Union has regularly called on Palestinian militants not to fire rockets into Israel.Mr. Olmert said Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza last year had raised hopes that the strip and the surrounding region of southern Israel would be calm. He acknowledged that the recent Israeli military actions had made life difficult for impoverished Gazans, but blamed the armed Palestinian factions.“The people of Gaza deserve to have a different quality of life, and what we wanted was a quiet and peaceful border,” Mr. Olmert said. “But there hasn’t been a day of rest for the people inside Israel.”The Gaza crisis has put in abeyance Mr. Olmert’s main political initiative, his “realignment” plan, which calls for removing some Jewish settlements from the West Bank.“The concept of realignment is basically a concept of gradually separating the Israelis and the Palestinians,” he said. “We want to separate in a friendly manner and live alongside each other.”'"
"'06-07-11,'1','In the long term, the scientists hope, patients may no longer have to wait on the national transplant list “for someone to die so they can live,” as Dr. Atala puts it. Organs could be tailor-made for people.A more immediate goal is to improve upon a multitude of smaller therapies: transplantable valves for ailing hearts, cell-and-gel preparations for crushed nerves, injections of skeletal muscle cells for urinary continence or new salivary gland tissue to rescue radiation patients from dry mouth.“The reason this technology works: It’s not really surgery,” Dr. Atala said. “We’re just priming the pump” by putting the appropriate cells into the appropriate place and asking the body to do the rest.Dr. Atala is the urology department chairman at Wake Forest and the president of the North American Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society.His work in the field began nearly 20 years ago. Tissue engineers then were thwarted: it was nearly impossible to grow most types of cells outside the body. (By “grow,” researchers mean getting cells to divide and multiply into usable amounts.)This was because adult stem cells — although known to exist in skin, intestines and other tissues — remained elusive, as did the slightly more mature progenitor cells, which also generate the specialized cells that make organs function. Cell biologists, Dr. Atala recalled, were missing the boat.“The irony of the whole field was that people were looking for cells according to the properties of the tissues they resided in,” he said, “but they were overlooking the tissue’s regenerative cells, the cells that grew best, because they were immature and didn’t yet have those properties.”When Dr. Atala arrived on the scene in the late 1980’s, he was, he says, “the reluctant researcher.”Intent on becoming a physician, he had gone to the University of Louisville School of Medicine, and when his residency in urology was drawing to a close he applied for a one-year fellowship in urology at Harvard to hone his skills as a pediatric urologic surgeon.But the program’s director, Dr. Alan Retik, thought he was better suited for a new two-year version of the program, which included a year of research. “Alan called me in Louisville to say they had picked two candidates, and that I was one of them,” Dr. Atala recalled.But, he said, “I really only wanted to be a surgeon.” He declined the offer.Dr. Retik called the next day to see if Dr. Atala had changed his mind, and, hearing that he had not, asked to speak to his wife.“My wife finally convinced me that if we were going to Boston, we might as well stay for two years,” Dr. Atala said, with his light chortle.Before going, he had already improvised a therapy for a common ureter defect in children that involves the backward flow of urine from the bladder to the kidney, sometimes damaging the kidney. He came up with the idea of injecting a small balloon under the ureter to correct the problem. At Harvard, he substituted tissue for the balloon.Obtaining cells, or chondrocytes, from a patient’s ear cartilage and injecting them into the ureter’s weak juncture, he was able to form a small cellular ridge that stopped the urine’s reflux.“This is the type of innovative person he is,” said Dr. Retik, the chief of urology at Children’s Hospital Boston. “No one else was interested in trying to use urothelial tissue, and people thought that this attempt wouldn’t amount to much.” But it did, effectively damming urine reflux. Today, a number of different remedies are available.For Dr. Atala, it was strong proof of the benefits of treating patients with their own cells, allowing them to avoid the immune system rejection they risk when they receive cells from another person.Meanwhile, as a surgeon in training, Dr. Atala was troubled by an operation he was performing on young patients at Children’s Hospital. When a bladder was removed, whether because of cancer or another disorder, the standard procedure since the 1800’s was to cut out a section of bowel and implant it as a substitute bladder.This process, however, was plagued with problems. For one, intestinal tissue is designed to absorb, not excrete.“Doing bowel-for-bladder replacements in children really got to me,” Dr. Atala said. “It’s one thing to put them into an adult, but putting them in a child with a 70-plus life expectancy didn’t make sense when you knew there would be trouble down the line.” He began wondering, Would it be possible to grow a new bladder from healthy urothelial cells?“It was a naïve question,” he said.But no longer, as a study published in April in the medical journal Lancet made obvious. In it, Dr. Atala and Dr. Retik reported that they had achieved good results for up to six years in seven young people with bladders grown in the laboratory from the patients’ own cells. The researchers plan to perform the procedure with other patients soon.It was a success long in coming. For many months, Dr. Atala had tried to grow human bladder cells in a dish, with no luck. Seeking advice, he called a scientist who claimed to have grown urothelial cells from another animal. But that venture came to a disappointing dead end.“What do you mean you can’t get them growing?” the scientist asked. “I grow them all the time, and, like you, they last for a few weeks and then die. The cells have a natural senescence.”Dr. Atala, who served on the medical school faculty at Harvard from 1992 until his move to Wake Forest in 2004, did not give up. He zeroed in on the bladder’s basement layer of cells, just as one of biology’s foremost cultivators of cells, Dr. Howard Green, had done in the 1970’s with skin.Then, after nearly four years of trying, Dr. Atala had urothelial cells proliferating in a dish. From a square of tissue less than half an inch wide, he could, if he wanted, produce enough tissue to cover a football field. By 1996, he had fashioned bladder-shaped molds and, in accordance with a bladder’s composition, seeded the inside with urothelial cells and the outside with muscle cells, which were easy to grow.By 1999, he was ready to report that his bladders had functioned in dogs for a full year. That same year he inserted his bladder scaffolds into the first of seven children with spina bifida. The outcome was reported in Lancet.All seven continue to do well, Dr. Atala said. The oldest of the new bladders has functioned for more than six years.Working from the knowledge he had gained from bladder tissue, Dr. Atala continued to improve on a basic strategy: grow a tissue’s “committed” progenitor cells, attach the cells to a scaffold made of degradable polymers or natural substances, like collagen or keratin, and implant the structure. He first applied this strategy to the urinary and genital tracts, the territory he knows best.“Then, once we finally got it, we thought, boy, let’s try some other tissue,” Dr. Atala recalled.So far, his research team at Wake Forest can make only a few human parts, including bladders, urethras, patches of skeletal muscle, blood vessels and cartilage.But in other animals, Dr. Atala has reported successes that include vaginal tissue, penile implants, kidney tissue that processes urine, pancreatic insulin-producing tissue and heart patches.“The only changes each time are the type of cell and the biodegradable scaffolds,” he said.To make a windpipe, for instance, the engineers seed a rigid scaffold with cartilage cells outside and respiratory cells inside. For an esophagus, a softer scaffold substance is used, its exterior coated with muscle cells, its interior with gastrointestinal cells.The most complex organ that he has tackled, he says, is the uterus.Whatever the implant, a tough challenge is making sure it acquires a network of new blood vessels.“Once we transplant tissue, it will suffocate if it doesn’t have access to a blood supply and oxygen,” said Dr. Shay Soker, associate professor of surgery at Wake Forest, who is studying how growth factors added to scaffolds can promote vessel growth. Getting nerves to grow in the implant is also a hurdle.Dr. Atala leaves the job of getting the bladder replacements to the clinic to Tengion, a company established in 2003 that was his institute’s first corporate partner. Tengion says it hopes to receive Food and Drug Administration approval by the end of the year for a clinical trial.Using a patient’s own tissue in this fashion for self-repair is “inevitable,” said Dr. Retik, who is a scientific adviser for the company. “It has so many advantages over conventional surgical methods that ultimately it will be the preferred method.”Voltaire once mused that humans were certain to find a way of regenerating their heads — a coup that would benefit some people a great deal, he added.While tissue engineers aren’t likely to regenerate complex parts on a regular basis any time soon — least of all the human head — Dr. Atala, who is also director of the National Regenerative Medicine Foundation, recently received $1 million from the Department of Defense for research that will be undertaken by a coalition of research centers. A primary goal is to grow limbs for injured soldiers.“A salamander can grow back its leg,” Dr. Atala said. “Why can’t a human do the same?”'"
"'06-07-11,'1','A new study will find a warm welcome from any man who has ever had to have a urinary catheter.Doctors, the researchers say, should give serious consideration to using an external condom-style device instead of the traditional one that is inserted into the urethra.Writing in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the researchers said the external condoms appeared to cause fewer infections and were more comfortable for patients. The study was led by Dr. Sanjay Saint of the University of Michigan Medical School, who began the work at the University of Washington.Millions of Americans are given urinary catheters every year in hospitals, nursing homes and other medical settings, the study said. While the catheters are often medically necessary, they are a major cause of a “vast majority” of urinary tract infections that patients get while being treated, it said.Working with patients at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, the researchers sought volunteers who would agree to be randomly given either standard or condomlike catheters.The researchers monitored infection rates for more than three years and surveyed the patients about their comfort with the catheters.All of the patients were men 40 and older.While patients in both groups developed infections, those with the standard catheters were much more likely to do so, the study said.'"

"'06-07-12,'0','American culture — American cinema in particular — has long had a soft spot for the Mafia. The colorful idioms of wiseguys have helped many a big-city newspaper columnist through a slow day, and the characteristic Cosa Nostra mix of Old World ethnic sentimentality and cutthroat capitalism has proved irresistible to artists of the big and small screens. It may be that this indulgent, even romantic mythology is a sign that organized crime has never posed a serious threat to the American social order, providing instead a rich trove of tabloid headlines and hard-boiled metaphors.While not explicitly addressing Hollywood gangster folklore, “Excellent Cadavers,” a meticulous and angry new documentary, offers an implicit critique of the lovable-goombah view of organized crime. It does this by examining, in unflinching detail, the effects of Mafia power on Sicilian society and on Italian political life in the 1980’s and early 90’s.Directed in brisk, journalistic style by Marco Turco, “Excellent Cadavers” is based on, and to some extent updates, Alexander Stille’s 1995 book of the same title. Mr. Stille, one of the best English-language writers on 20th-century Italy, serves as narrator and tour guide, taking us to the scenes of crimes and explaining their causes and consequences. (He is frequently joined on camera by Letizia Battaglia, a photojournalist and anti-Mafia activist, who plays the role of survivor and passionate eyewitness.)“Excellent Cadavers” does not dwell on the Mafiosi themselves, refusing them the honor of being cast as larger-than-life movie protagonists once again. The leaders of the Sicilian Mafia and their henchmen tend to be shown either as corpses or prisoners, sprawled on blood-stained sidewalks or crowded into cages in a courtroom in Palermo, the Sicilian capital. The film’s designated heroes are the men who, at great risk and against long odds, put them in those cages: in particular, two brave Palermo prosecutors, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who were murdered in separate bombings in 1992. Before their deaths, Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino (whose names now grace the Palermo airport) helped to bring about the convictions of hundreds of Mafia soldiers and bosses in the unprecedented “maxi-trial” of the mid-1980’s.Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino, who are shown in old television interviews and news clips, stand out for their honesty, discipline and professionalism. They and some of their colleagues represent the possibility of a rational, modern approach to law and civic life, something that has not always flourished in Italy. Their attempts to fight the influence of the Mafia — and to curb violence that in the early 1980’s was claiming three lives a week in Palermo — were often obstructed by longstanding traditions of red tape and outright corruption. In the years after World War II the Sicilian crime syndicates were enlisted by the Christian Democratic party to suppress Communist influence on the island, and generations of Mafia leaders had grown accustomed to the influence and impunity that this cozy relationship with the country’s rulers afforded them.Mr. Turco and Mr. Stille do not dwell on the Mafia as a historical or sociological phenomenon, emphasizing its dysfunctional relationship with the postwar Italian state rather than its older roots in Sicilian culture. This may be part of their film’s corrective intention: their Mafia is not the colorful, violent flowering of ancient Mediterranean peasant customs, but rather a thoroughly vicious organization bent on the subversion of democratic norms and the brutal elimination of anyone who dares to oppose its ambitions.The argument is persuasive. Mr. Stille, more reporter than historian, does not stray too far beyond the immediate parameters of his main story, but the strongest criticism to be made of this film is also the highest praise: you wish there were more of it. This is not only because the details are fascinating in their own right, but also because this quintessentially Italian tale is, more broadly, a case study in the difficulties involved in maintaining an independent and secure legal system.The conclusions Mr. Stille reaches are mixed. The aftermath of Mr. Falcone’s and Mr. Borsellino’s deaths was a wave of popular revulsion against the Mafia, and a belated cleansing of the political system. But then the rise of Silvio Berlusconi, who became prime minister in 2001, led to the systematic disempowering of the judiciary system and the repeal of legal instruments (like the Italian witness protection program) that Mr. Falcone and Mr. Borsellino had fought for. The film, which was completed before Mr. Berlusconi’s recent defeat in a bid for re-election, ends on a pessimistic note, with a reminder that the romance between criminals and politicians may have cooled, but has not ended.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','Dessel is not likely to wear the yellow jersey beyond Stage 11 and its five huge climbs; the top contenders will probably not be as complacent as they were today. But Dessel delighted in wearing it today, despite being nipped by Mercado at the finish line.Cycling custom holds that, in a close finish, the rider who is going to secure the yellow jersey should concede the stage victory to his competitor. Mercado had no chance for the yellow jersey today, having started the stage in 90th place.Dessel, although he seemed to honor the code, said he had done less than his best in the sprint.“After all the work we did, he deserved something,” he said of Mercado, whose Agritubel team, which is not a member of the ProTour, received a wild-card entry into the Tour de France.AG2R lost its leader, Francisco Mancebo, before the start because of doping suspicions, but now it has Dessel in the yellow jersey, the first Frenchman to wear it since 2004.Two years ago, when Dessel rode for the Phonak team from Switzerland, he was confident that he had made its Tour squad, especially after he finished second in the French national championships. But he was passed over for a Swiss rider and angrily left Phonak at the end of the season to join AG2R. The divorce was especially bitter because Dessel is deaf in his left ear and Phonak hired him as an advertisement for the hearing aids it manufactures.The course today passed through few villages, so Dessel’s triumph was watched by meager crowds between the start and finish areas. The first major climb was up to the Soudet Pass, shrouded in low-lying clouds that limited visibility to just a few meters ahead, a dangerous situation on the long descent. So deserted was the site that cowbells could be clearly heard as a small herd of cattle grazed high on a mountain overlooking the course.The final climb, to the Marie Blanque Pass, was more populated. Dessel was first over the top, as he had been on the Soudet, and Mercado second, as a few survivors of the original breakaway gave chase.On the 15-mile descent to Pau, Dessel and Mercado engaged more than once in conversation although not about who would win the sprint, Dessel said.Such arrangements are technically illegal, if hallowed, so he pressed before yielding to Mercado.“Anyway, we had that long breakaway and I’ve got both jerseys,” Dessel said. “So everything is fine.”'"
"'06-07-12,'0','If the documents that Microsoft still must submit fail to satisfy the Commission, the daily fine will be raised to 3 million euros ($3.8 million).Today’s fine follows a much larger one of 497 milion euros ($745 million), which was levied against Microsoft in the original antitrust ruling in 2004. Microsoft has appealed that ruling at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg.Microsoft said today that it would appeal the new fine as well, arguing that the 2004 order to reveal technical details about Windows was not clear enough. The commission “has to be specific and concrete about what it wants someone to do,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief lawyer, in a conference call with journalists today. “The decision did not do that,” he said.“We will ask the European courts to determine whether our compliance efforts have been sufficient, and whether the Commission’s unprecedented fine is justified,” Mr. Smith added.Microsoft’s allies were quick to rally around the firm. “Microsoft has provided more than enough information and support to create interoperability,”’ said Jonathan Zuck, president of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group, referring to the commission’s requirement that competitors be allowed to design software that works with Windows as well as Microsoft’s own products do. “But the commission and Microsoft’s competitors really want the ability to clone Microsoft software,” Mr. Zuck said.Microsoft has said from the beginning that it would honor the commission’s ruling. But Ms. Kroes said that until last month, documents that the company submitted to the European competition regulator “fell significantly short of what was required.”The technical details about Windows that the commission seeks will, it says, help restore fair competition in the market for server operating systems. At present, servers using Microsoft’s system work better with personal computers running Windows than do servers made by companies like Sun Microsystems using rival systems.Under European antitrust law, withholding the technical details amounts to an abuse of a dominant position, given that over 95 percent of the world’s P.C.’s run on Windows.Ms. Kroes said that market share data in the so-called workgroup server market illustrated the problem. Between 2002 and 2005, Microsoft gained 12 percentage points in market share, while its rivals all lost ground, according to statistics compiled by the research company IDC.“Microsoft dominates this market — none of its rivals have more than 10 percent market share,” Ms. Kroes said.As long as the legal wrangling goes on, that situation continues, lawyers said. “Microsoft continues to profit from every new day of noncompliance,” said Thomas Vinje, a Brussels-based partner in the Clifford Chance law firm and the lead counsel for the European Committee for Interoperable Systems, a trade group. “The commission has now made clear that open-ended noncompliance with the order will not be tolerated.”At a hearing before the commission in March, Mr. Smith said that he finally understood what documentation the commission was seeking. Since then, Microsoft has been working closely with the commission and with Neil Barrett, the trustee responsible for monitoring Microsoft’s compliance with the antitrust order.The company has now filed several batches of documents which, at first glance, appear to be in order, Ms. Kroes said.A turning point came on June 20, when Mr. Barrett gave preliminary approval to the information the company submitted in April and May, covering half the technical issues that the commission was seeking information about, Ms. Kroes said.“Now we must check if the specifications are correct,” Ms. Kroes said of the documents. “We’ll know in a couple of months.” The company said it would submit the rest of the requested information on July 18. If it all checks out, Ms. Kroes said, “we’ll be back to normal.”'"
"'06-07-12,'0','Mr. Bush’s order of Feb. 7, 2002, issued shortly after American-led forces toppled the Taliban government in Afghanistan, specifically said that critical aspects of the Geneva Conventions do “not apply to either Al Qaeda or Taliban detainees.”In response to a question, the White House issued a statement late Tuesday, saying: “As a result of the Supreme Court decision, that portion of the order no longer applies. The Supreme Court has clarified what the law is, and the executive branch will comply.”The Pentagon memorandum, dated July 7, offered an unexpectedly conciliatory interpretation of the justices’ ruling 12 days ago that struck down White House rules for military tribunals that would have granted detainees the barest of rights. Until late Tuesday, the White House and the C.I.A. had been silent on whether detainees in the custody of intelligence agencies must also be granted those rights.The memorandum, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon R. England, summarized the Supreme Court findings and reminded officials to “ensure that all D.o.D. personnel adhere to these standards.”The Pentagon currently holds approximately 1,000 Qaeda and Taliban detainees at the military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and at bases in Afghanistan. An estimated three dozen additional terror suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is considered the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, are believed to be held by the C.I.A. at secret sites around the world.Jennifer Millerwise Dyck, a C.I.A. spokeswoman, declined to comment on questions posed before the White House issued its statement.Despite the new statements by the White House and the Pentagon, administration lawyers appearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday urged Congress to approve military commissions similar to those that the court said the president did not have authority to set up on his own. The lawyers played down the Pentagon announcement as representing not a policy shift but simply an announcement of the Supreme Court decision.“We would ask this body to render its approval for the system as currently configured,” said Daniel J. Dell’Orto, the Pentagon’s principal deputy general counsel. “It would be a very expeditious way to move these trials forward.”But the tribunal approach ran up against fierce resistance among Republicans as well as Democrats. Some lawmakers argued that the best way to set up a system to bring detainees to trial would be to start with the existing code of military justice, which grants wider rights to detainees, and adjust it to reflect the demands of prosecuting terrorists.“If you fight that approach, it’s going to be long hot summer,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a former military lawyer who is expected to play a leading role in the debate over bringing detainees to trial.The new Bush administration statement addresses questions surrounding a key provision of the 1949 Geneva Conventions known as Common Article 3, which prohibits cruel and inhumane treatment of prisoners and requires that detainees receive “all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.” Mr. Bush’s 2002 order came after a fierce debate about the rules for what the administration was calling a “different kind of war.”In the new memorandum, Mr. England asserted that “the Supreme Court has determined that Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 applies as a matter of law to the conflict with Al Qaeda.”The memorandum by Mr. England was first reported in Tuesday’s online editions of The Financial Times.Pentagon officials have long said that detainees in military custody are treated in accordance with Common Article 3, yet Mr. England’s memorandum went further in acknowledging that the court’s decision made mandatory what the Pentagon had said it was doing voluntarily.The memorandum also appears to settle continuing battles within the administration over a long-awaited Pentagon directive on the treatment of detainees.The directive, called “D.o.D. Program for Enemy Prisoners of War and Other Detainees,” has been held up for months because of wrangling over the types of treatment that ought to be prohibited.In the past, Vice President Dick Cheney’s chief of staff, David S. Addington, pressed Pentagon officials to eliminate specific language from the document that cited the Geneva Conventions in prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment.Since becoming the Pentagon’s No. 2 official in 2005, Mr. England has repeatedly expressed concerns about the detention of enemy combatants and has told colleagues that he advocates closing the military prison at Guantánamo Bay because of the negative impact it has on the United States’ reputation.In a sign of the seriousness with which Mr. England took these issues, his memorandum reprinted the entire text of Common Article 3 and required military commanders to review all the directives and policies under their purview and report back to him within three weeks.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Dell’Orto played down the England memorandum, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee that it was merely intended to “get the word out” about the court decision.“It doesn’t indicate a shift in policy,” Mr. Dell’Orto said. “It just announces the decision of the court and with specificity as to the decision as it related to the commission process.”The hearing today, the first of three this week, formally opened the debate about how to bring Guantánamo detainees to trial, and it quickly showed the stark divide between the White House and Congress.The White House believes the court did not so much rule out the military commissions as indicate that Mr. Bush should seek approval of them from Congress, administration officials have said.Under such a system, the defendant could be excluded from the courtroom and could be denied the right to see some of the evidence against him. The military commission rules also allow evidence that is typically excluded from courts, including hearsay and statements obtained through coercion.Many in Congress, including some Republican leaders who are expected to guide the debate in the Senate, believe that the court will strike down any new arrangement approved by Congress if it does not allow detainees broader rights.But Mr. Dell’Orto said “it would be ludicrous” to go so far as allowing detainees protections like those granted in court-martial proceedings.But Senator Graham told the administration lawyers they would be “well served to forget about” the commissions the president wanted.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are clashing over a $3.5 billion pipeline project intended to deliver natural gas to the emirates from Qatar.The Saudis say that the undersea line crosses Saudi territory and “cannot be constructed without the agreement of the kingdom,” according to a Saturday memo faxed by the Saudi government to the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, which is involved in financing the development.The venture, which is controlled by the emirates, denied that the pipeline crosses Saudi territory. It said that the natural gas line was almost complete and ran exclusively through waters of Qatar and the emirates.The Saudi objection threatens to reduce the emirates’ ability to meet demand for natural gas and could curtail economic growth.The government of Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, owns 51 percent of the venture, known as the Dolphin project; the Occidental Petroleum Corporation of Los Angeles and Total of Paris each own 24.5 percent.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a committee member, expressed dismay that President Bush had resubmitted the Haynes nomination. “It is astounding that the administration would continue to press his nomination,” he said. “Mr. Haynes has displayed a shocking failure of legal and moral leadership.”The hearing came a day after 20 retired military officers sent the Judiciary Committee a letter saying that they had “deep concern” about Mr. Haynes’s fitness to be a federal judge because of his role in approving coercive techniques to interrogate terror suspects.Speaking to reporters, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, indicated that the letter had deeply influenced his thinking, declaring that the letter “says it all” about Mr. Haynes.Mr. Reid signaled that the nomination was in serious trouble, though he did not say Democrats would try a filibuster if it came before the full Senate for a vote. Sixty votes are needed to end a filibuster.“We are going to do what we need to do to protect our country,” Mr. Reid said. “We’ve approved a lot of judges that were very, very borderline. But unless there’s some drastic change, I’m not going to override the views of 20 of our finest.”The controversy over the nomination of Mr. Haynes stems from memorandums he wrote or supervised that secretly authorized harsh treatment, even torture, for detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and in Iraq.In the hearing, Mr. Haynes distanced himself from the so-called Bybee memorandum, which narrowly defined torture and asserted that a president could ignore prohibitions against it in the name of national security.The memorandum, which has been disavowed by the Bush administration, was written in 2002 by Jay S. Bybee, a Justice Department official who has since become a federal appeals court judge. It had not been publicly disclosed when Mr. Haynes was first questioned by the Judiciary Committee in 2003.Asked by Mr. Kennedy whether he, too, disavowed the memorandum, Mr. Haynes said: “It was withdrawn by the attorney general. I accept that. It was the right thing to do.”“I’m glad it is no longer on the books,” he added.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','BRUSSELS, July 11 — As it has threatened to do, the European Commission is expected to fine Microsoft hundreds of millions of euros on Wednesday for failing to provide information to its competitors.And if Microsoft continues to withhold the information, even higher fines will be imposed, a person close to the commission’s antitrust division said Tuesday.The commission is expected to fine Microsoft up to 2 million euros ($2.56 million) a day, covering the period from Dec. 15, 2005, through Wednesday. That fine could total about 400 million euros ($511 million), almost as much as the 497 million euros Microsoft was fined in 2004 for violating European antitrust law.If Microsoft fails to provide the information, the commission is likely to increase the daily fine after Wednesday to 3 million euros, the person close to the commission said, speaking on condition of anonymity because a decision had not yet been made.The 2004 antitrust ruling ordered Microsoft to reveal technical information about its PC operating system, Windows, to rival software makers. Withholding the information was an abuse of the dominance of Windows, the commission ruled.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','The commission gave little firm indication of what a new rule would say, but in numerous sections it indicated impatience and concern that the process had proved so costly and expensive. It noted that some companies had complained of excessive documentation being required by auditors and added, “We have anecdotally heard that this documentation, in many cases, substantially exceeded that normally produced by financial institutions,” even though the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the 1991 law were similarly worded.The commission indicated that it suspected that audit firms had done too much work, saying it was “skeptical of the large number of internal controls that some companies have identified, documented and tested.” It said it thought one cause of problems might have been an “overly conservative” interpretation of the rules by auditors.The commission pointed to a document issued yesterday by a group of accounting organizations, known as the Council of Sponsoring Organizations, aimed at providing a simplified framework for smaller companies to assess their financial controls.“What we are saying is no company is exempted from good internal controls,’’ said David Richards, the president of the Institute of Internal Auditors, one organization in the group. “It does not matter what your size is.”He said the document was aimed in part at helping companies identify a relatively small number of controls that needed to be carefully checked because of their importance to accurate financial reporting.Despite widespread complaints about cost, Section 404 does appear to have had some benefits. In the first year, about one of six companies reported material weaknesses in their controls, while that figure was down to about one in 15 during the second year.A report by Grant Thornton, an accounting firm, noted that about 10 percent of banks had such problems, even though they had been complying with the 1991 law, which did not require external auditors to monitor the assessment. It said that indicated that auditor review was critical to assuring adequate controls.The S.E.C. said earlier this year that it was beginning to consider how to modify the carrying out of Section 404. Yesterday’s announcement may have been most significant in that it indicated that the commission thought a new rule, rather than increased guidance, would probably be necessary.Also significant, however, was the renewed endorsement of Section 404 itself.“Quality financial reporting is a critical cornerstone to our capital markets, and investors are entitled to rely upon it,’’ said John W. White, director of the commission’s Division of Corporation Finance, in announcing the new action. “Section 404 has a key role to play in enhancing the reliability of public companies’ financial statements.”'"
"'06-07-12,'0','An hour and a sniper attack later, an Army explosive-ordnance team drove up in a huge armored truck and directed a small robot to place plastic explosives, called C-4, on the pile. The soldiers plugged their ears as the blast thundered through the city streets and a fountain of flame shot into the sky.Observing the 30-foot ball of fire, Sergeant Faust reported on the radio that his platoon had found an I.E.D., probably one in which explosives had been packed in an acetylene tank to magnify the power of the blast. It was the 71st bomb or mine the platoon had uncovered since it arrived in Hit in February.Hidden bombs have become the insurgents’ primary weapon, and the number of explosives they plant is an important measure of their activity and determination to fight. The number is on the rise nationwide.In June, there were 1,481 I.E.D. attacks throughout Iraq, and 903 instances in which the bombs were found and neutralized, according to figures compiled by the American military in Baghdad. That is a sharp increase since January, when there were 834 such attacks and 620 cases in which the bombs were found before they exploded.Many soldiers rate an explosion from one of the bombs as the war’s most frightening experience.“It jerks you around,” said Pfc. Daniel Rullo, 21, a medic from Binghamton, N.Y., with Company A. “You squeeze your hands to make sure you are still alive. Lots of times the vehicles fill up with smoke. It is the worst feeling out here, worse than getting shot.”The battle between the insurgents and the American forces is a grim contest of measure and countermeasure. Armored Humvees and other defensive measures have considerably improved the Americans’ ability to survive the bomb attacks.In addition to Kevlar helmets and body armor, each soldier is equipped with special gear to protect against bomb explosions: glasses that deflect flying debris, called ballistic glasses; fire-resistant gloves; and combat earplugs.In a kind of arms race, the insurgents have responded to the American protective measures by stepping up the frequency and power of the bombings.The bunk next to Private Rullo’s lies empty. It was occupied by another medic, Pfc. Nolan Howell, who was returning in an armored Humvee from a Demon Platoon mission when he was wounded by shrapnel from a planted bomb. Three artillery shells had been stacked in a mound so that the blast would be channeled to the side of the vehicle.Iraq had a vast arsenal of weapons before the war, few of which were adequately guarded in the chaos that followed the fall of Baghdad. The insurgents have a seemingly inexhaustible supply of artillery shells, mortars and other explosives for making the bombs.In April, one of the task force soldiers made a wrong turn while on patrol and spied a half-buried artillery round. By the end of the day, American troops had yanked 2,000 artillery rounds out of the ground. It was a field of potential bombs.“I told the soldiers that finding a cache in and of itself is not going to solve the I.E.D. problems,” said Lt. Col. Thomas C. Graves, the commander of the task force. “Why caches are good is they may lead us to intel that may get to the guy that is laying the I.E.D.’s.”Reflecting the insurgents’ inventiveness, the bombs in Hit come in a wide variety. Some are “command detonated,” connected by wires to a detonator or triggered by electronic signals. There are bombs and mines that are set to explode when a vehicle drives over them.The task force is trying to pinpoint the insurgents who are planting the bombs, and has conducted raids to find them. But as soon as one insurgent cell is broken up, another seems to move in. The level of bomb attacks has been generally constant in the Hit area since February. But there appear to be more strikes in the city and fewer on some of the major routes leading in and out.Either way, what the troops call route clearing is as busy a mission as ever. Sergeant Faust, 35, who was born in Georgia and calls Frederick, Md., home, was trained as a tank platoon sergeant and considers “tankers” a special breed of soldiers.“We can do anybody’s job, but nobody can do ours,” he said.Demon Platoon notes proudly that it finds about 80 percent of the concealed bombs on its routes.The other week, Sergeant Faust was knocked flat on his back when an I.E.D. exploded just moments after he had tossed a few glow lights on the ground to identify the location for the explosive-ordnance team.It is a team effort, however, with plenty of risk to go around. Specialist Travis Tiffany, 21, has endured two explosions in less than a month but never hesitates, Sergeant Faust says, “to go outside the wire” of his Army base.Early Saturday morning, before finding the bomb, Sergeant Faust and a team of soldiers in four Humvees left Company A’s base, a dilapidated train station on the outskirts of Hit. The platoon, preparing for a mission to clear a route, halted in front of a blue mosque.Someone had spied a filled-in crater, either an I.E.D. or a resident’s attempt to fix the road, and Sergeant Faust could not take any chances. Snipers fired three rounds as the soldiers waited for an Army explosive-ordnance team to arrive and blow up the crater. As the platoon drove on, it approached the street where several mines had been detected the night before.The soldiers got out to talk to local residents, while a nearby Iraqi maintenance crew worked unperturbed on a broken water main. Its truck displayed a white flag.That’s when Sergeant Martin noticed the unfamiliar stack of debris, and the explosives team returned with its robot to blow up the pile. The large blast and wall of fire that followed provided confirmation that the platoon had found what it was looking for.“Now that, gentlemen, was an I.E.D.,” Sergeant Faust said, with obvious satisfaction.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','Eight men and six companies were charged yesterday with defrauding drivers and gas stations in New York by selling hundreds of thousands of gallons of low-grade gasoline as premium grade, and state prosecutors are seeking to recover $3 million from the operation, court records show.In a 202-count indictment filed in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the companies and four of the men were charged, under organized-crime statutes, with running a corrupt enterprise. The other four men were charged with tax felonies and conspiracy in a separate 49-count indictment.Prosecutors say the companies, which distributed the fuel after filling their tanker trucks at fuel depots, shortchanged the gas stations on the grade and quantity they had ordered. The stations were unable to test the grade of fuel delivered, and their underground storage tanks typically lacked gauges, a disadvantage the suspects exploited, the indictments said. The suspects are also accused of creating false documents to cover the crimes.Prosecutors named the operation the Gladyshev Criminal Enterprise after its leader, Eduard Gladyshev, 29, a Russian citizen who lives in Gravesend and who also has identification documents under the name Oleg Mechnevski.From March to December 2005, investigators used wiretaps to document deliveries of 28 truckloads of 10,000 gallons each that generated $2,500 to $3,000 in illicit profits per load, or a total of $70,000 to $84,000, said Robert P. Biancavilla, an assistant deputy state attorney general assigned to organized-crime cases.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','SEOUL, South Korea, Wednesday, July 12 — South Korea angrily accused Japan of arrogant and reckless remarks on Tuesday, a day after Japanese leaders raised what South Koreans consider a chilling possibility: a pre-emptive strike on North Korea that would violate Japan’s Constitution.As discord between Washington’s major allies in the region worsened, Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, returned to China. After landing in Beijing, he urged North Korea to return to six-party talks and stood by a draft United Nations resolution to impose sanctions on North Korea for launching seven missiles in tests last week, according to Reuters.“We continue to be guided by the need to make a strong united statement to the North Koreans,” Reuters quoted Mr. Hill as telling reporters at his Beijing hotel before heading to a meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing.Attention focused on whether Beijing, North Korea’s main ally, could persuade the North to return to the table. But China said it did not expect a quick resolution, nor did it support the push by Japan and the United States for sanctions. It said such a resolution would be an “overreaction.”“If approved, it will aggravate contradictions and increase tension,” China’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Jiang Yu, said at a news conference. “It will harm peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asian region, and hurt efforts to resume six-party talks, as well as lead to the U.N.

"'06-07-12,'0','HOUSTON, July 11 — Astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery continued to move supplies into the International Space Station on Tuesday while fielding a phone call from President Bush and preparing for their third and final spacewalk.Crews of the shuttle and the space station received a late morning private call from Mr. Bush, who said he had seen part of a Monday spacewalk in which the astronauts repaired a remote-controlled sled that crosses rails atop the station, and wanted to thank them for their service to the country. He also invited the Discovery crew and their families to visit the White House after the mission, a White House spokesman said.NASA officials and astronauts also said that they were feeling good about the success of the Discovery’s mission so far, and believed that the shuttle program was ready to resume the task of completing the space station.The shuttle appears to have come through launching with little or no damage, evidence that the time and expense of many modifications had worked, Anthony J. Ceccacci, the mission’s lead flight director, said at a news conference here at the Johnson Space Center. In addition, two successful spacewalks by the Discovery astronauts put the station in shape for continued expansion on future missions, he said.“It gives everybody a really good feeling that we’re getting there,” Mr. Ceccacci said. “It’s time to get going and start building the station.”'"

"'06-07-12,'0','Most of the migrating companies are setting up only small corporate and business offices in the United States, while leaving their scientists back in their home countries. Cyclacel’s 65 researchers, for example, remain in Dundee, Scotland, and Cambridge, England, where they have strong ties to local academic communities. Salaries for scientists are not lower in Britain, Mr. Rombotis said, but the company’s research is subsidized by the Scottish government.The United States has long been the biotechnology world’s leader and remains so. But when it comes to spinning science into start-ups, other countries have caught up. Europe now has 1,613 biotech companies, more than the 1,415 in the United States, according to Ernst & Young. A decade ago, Europe had only 584 such companies, compared with 1,308 in the United States.The European companies, though, are typically smaller than their American counterparts — 45 employees on average, compared with 96 here, according to Critical I, a British consulting firm. More crucially, they often lack the capital to get beyond the early stages of research and development. Last year, biotechnology companies raised only $3.3 billion in Europe, compared with $16 billion in the United States, according to BioCentury, an industry newsletter.American companies on average also spend 3 times as much on R.& D. and have access to 10 times as much debt financing as their European counterparts, according to a Critical I report released in May by EuropaBio, a trade group based in Brussels. Compared with Europe, it is also much easier for public companies in the United States to raise additional money, through secondary stock offerings or private placements.Thus the wave of immigrant companies, like the BioVex Group, which was founded near Oxford, England, but moved its headquarters to Cambridge, Mass., last year because it had begun clinical trials of its cancer treatment in the United States and also wanted better access to capital. Although its scientists remain in Britain, BioVex recently used its American base to file for an initial public stock offering on Nasdaq.Some of the foreign companies intent on a Nasdaq listing have sidestepped an I.P.O. by doing a reverse merger with an American company that has already gone public — in some cases a biotechnology company that has foundered.That is what Cyclacel did. It agreed last December to be nominally acquired by Xcyte Therapies of Seattle, although Cyclacel is now the name of the company and the entity in charge. Cyclacel then took advantage of its adopted Nasdaq listing by raising an additional $45 million in April through a private placement of stock and warrants.Similarly IDM, a French drug developer, completed a reverse merger last August to acquire the Nasdaq listing of Epimmune. IDM is now based in Irvine, Calif., although its research operation and most of its employees remain in France.Likewise the German company Micromet now has a Nasdaq listing and a base of operations in Carlsbad, Calif., after reverse-merging in May with CancerVax. Most of its operations are still back in the home country.In May, a company started by venture capitalists in Denmark to develop a drug for osteoporosis went public through a reverse merger with an American shell company, Castle & Morgan Holdings. It then raised $10 million in a private placement, mainly from American investors. Originally called Nordic Bone, the drug company is now based in San Francisco and has a more cosmopolitan name, Osteologix.There may be limits, though, to the immigration trend.Industry executives say it has become more difficult than in the past for very young companies to go public on the Nasdaq. A company now usually needs to have drugs at least close to reaching the market before it can be listed. And some small companies say it can be too costly to comply with the financial controls that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in 2002, has imposed on public companies.Last year for the first time, the number of biotechnology companies going public in Europe — 23 — surpassed the number in the United States, 13, according to Ernst & Young. This year, two American companies have even gone public on the Alternative Investment Market in London instead of in the United States, although neither has moved its headquarters to London.One of them, Entelos, a Foster City, Calif., developer of computer simulations of diseases, raised about $20 million in the London market. The other Aqua Bounty, a Waltham, Mass., company trying to win approval in the United States for a genetically engineered salmon, raised about $35 million in London.“I have trouble raising money in the States, and yet you can raise money on a transgenic fish in a place where they’d never allow it,” said Elliot Entis, the chief executive of Aqua Bounty, referring to opposition to genetically modified foods in Europe.Asterand, a supplier of tissue samples for pharmaceutical research, did a reverse merger with a publicly traded British company in December to gain a listing in London, even though most of Asterand’s operations remain in Detroit.“The cost of being a U.K. public company is significantly lower” than in the United States, said Randal Charlton, the chief executive.Another limiting factor to the immigration trend is that big American investors are increasingly placing some of their financial bets abroad.“Today you do not need to be listed on Nasdaq,” said Wolfgang Söhngen, chief executive of Paion, a German company traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. “Sophisticated investors invest globally.”Paion, which is developing a stroke drug derived from vampire bat saliva, recently raised 9.44 million Euros in a private stock offering. Among the investors were J. P. Morgan Proprietary Equities of New York and Xmark Opportunity Fund of Stamford, Conn.There are also logistical challenges in coming to America. Oxxon Therapeutics, a British company, moved its headquarters to Boston two years ago but has since moved back. “It’s extremely difficult to manage small operations on both sides of the Atlantic,” said Craig R. Smith, Oxxon’s chairman.Yet, for many overseas biotech companies, an American address still seems the best bet for raising money. That is especially so for companies from Australia and New Zealand, which suffer not only from small capital markets in their home countries but isolation from the pharmaceutical mainstream.When Dianna L. DeVore was chief operating officer of the Australian Stem Cell Center, a government-backed organization, she trumpeted Australia as a leader in the development of regenerative medicine. But now that Ms. DeVore is starting a company, Jiva Biosciences, to commercialize technology developed by research institutes in Melbourne, she is exploring locations in California for her headquarters.Jiva will do its research in Australia, working on drugs to stimulate tissue repair. But Ms. DeVore, an American, says a California headquarters will give the company access to people experienced in bringing drugs to market, a bigger pool of investors and potential access to the state’s planned $3 billion in public spending on stem cell research.Protemix, a privately held New Zealand company, is setting up its headquarters in San Diego with an eye toward eventually going public. But research will stay in New Zealand, said Larry K. Ellingson, the chief executive. With the New Zealand government subsidizing the research “we just can’t afford to move it,” he said.When foreign companies do establish an American beachhead, reaction back home can vary. Some biotechnology boosters in Europe have used the moves to argue that additional tax incentives or other support is needed for European companies.Some companies, like the British transplant Domantis, argue that having financial and commercial operations in the United States actually benefits the home country by funneling money back to the local economy.“I think there are a lot of people in the U.K. who think this is an ideal way to exploit the innovation from the U.K.,” said Bob Connelly, the chief executive of Domantis, which is based in Waltham, Mass. Although started by scientists in Cambridge, England, in 2000, the company planned from the outset to base its chief executive and a few other officers in the United States.In Scotland, meanwhile, Cyclacel’s expatriation did raise eyebrows. But Scottish Enterprise, the government-backed economic development agency that gave Cyclacel the $9 million, put the best face on the situation. It noted that the company’s research was staying in Scotland, as it must do until 2010 under the terms of the agreement for the cash infusion.“We are delighted to see a Scottish company like Cyclacel internationalize in this way,” Kate Friel, a spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise, said in a statement sent by e-mail. “We believe that this move has also enhanced Scotland’s global reputation for scientific discovery and exploitation.”'"
"'06-07-12,'0','When the F.B.I. searched the offices of William Jefferson, the scandal-plagued Democratic congressman from Louisiana, it produced a rare moment of bipartisanship. Leaders of both parties insisted that the search infringed on the rights of Congress. This week, Thomas Hogan, a federal district court judge in Washington, gave Congress a much-needed reminder that no one is above the law.The search arose from an investigation of charges that Representative Jefferson helped a private company and thereby enriched himself. The agents had a valid warrant, and used procedures that minimized the chance of taking unrelated legislative materials. Mr. Jefferson objected and demanded that the seized material be returned. House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a rare joint statement supporting him.Mr. Jefferson maintained that members of Congress should be told in advance about searches and allowed to remove material they considered privileged. A search is, of course, considerably less effective if the target is allowed to remove what he likes before the police arrive.Judge Hogan rightly ruled that the search did not violate the “speech or debate” clause of the Constitution, which protects members of Congress when they are engaged in core legislative functions, like speaking on the floor or traveling to a Congressional session. That provision does not provide immunity for the sort of activities at issue in this investigation.The court also rebuffed Mr. Jefferson’s claim that the search violated separation of powers principles. The founders wanted the three co-equal branches to have a sphere of autonomy, but they also wanted each to serve as a check on the other two. When executive branch investigators carried out a search with a judicially approved warrant, checks and balances were working just right.The power to investigate Congress could be abused. In that case, Congress would have stronger legal claims, and it could use its own authority, including the power of impeachment, to protect itself. But the investigation of Representative Jefferson is not a power grab. It is a run-of-the-mill criminal case, and as the Supreme Court has said, members of Congress are not “super-citizens, immune from criminal responsibility.”'"

"'06-07-12,'0','The conference mixed prominent figures from Soviet times, including two veteran human rights campaigners, Lyudmila M. Alekseyeva and Sergei A. Kovalyov, with a younger generation of advocates, including a former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, and Garry Kasparov, the chess master and opposition political figure. All of them have become harsh critics of Mr. Putin and his rule.Their list of grievances was a familiar but timely reflection of the broader debate about how to influence the Kremlin, and about whether, issue by issue, Mr. Putin and his circle are best confronted or engaged.They spoke of Russia’s police abuses, manifest corruption, arbitrariness of law, restrictions on the news media, crackdown on private organizations and centralization of wealth and power around the Kremlin and its loyal elite. They decried the chilling brutality that has accompanied the wars in Chechnya.“We are gathering together to fight for the triumph of rule of law in our country,” their public statement read. But even as they released it and speakers were taking turns on the stage, the tensions between Russia’s beleaguered public opposition and the government were evident on the margins.Participants said more than 40 of their members had been arrested throughout Russia while traveling to the conference here or to St. Petersburg for the Group of 8 meeting. Security officers snatched the four opposition members from the entrance of the Renaissance Moscow Hotel. Mr. Kasparov said the four — three men and a woman who are members of the National Bolshevik Party — had been kidnapped.The protests and the police actions were ignored by Russian news programs, which are securely under the Kremlin’s sway.Other subplots played out as well. Senior Russian officials, irritated that Western diplomats had been invited, had obliquely warned the embassies here not to take part.Igor I. Shuvalov, the Kremlin’s senior liaison to the Group of 8, said last month that if foreign governments were represented by senior officials, it would be seen as “an unfriendly gesture.” A Kremlin spokesman made a similar remark.But when the conference began, senior officials from Western governments were present. One, the British ambassador, Anthony Brenton, even took the stage. He said that “criticism is as important as a competitive economy” to a functioning society, and noted that Britain remained involved in the development of Russian civil society and private nongovernmental organizations, or N.G.O.’sThe United States was represented by two senior diplomats: Daniel Fried, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, and Barry Lowenkron, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor.Neither addressed the conference. They said they had come to Russia with a larger portfolio of issues and had meetings on other subjects planned with the Russian government.Their remarks, in an interview with five Western journalists, mixed concerns about elements of the Kremlin’s rule with reminders that the United States and Russia had a range of shared interests and areas of productive cooperation.“This isn’t a totalitarian country,” Mr. Fried said, adding that 20 years ago, during Soviet times, an opposition event like The Other Russia would have been held in secret. “Or in Helsinki,” Mr. Lowenkron added.But their presence carried an implicit message of support for a wider civil dialogue and a freer society than the Kremlin accepts, and they dismissed Russian warnings about Western attendance.Mr. Fried noted, for instance, that if Russian diplomats in the United States wanted to attend a conference organized by the Democratic Party, “we wouldn’t regard it as anything other than just doing their job.”The Kremlin was publicly silent on the matter. But Mikhail V. Margelov, head of the international affairs committee of the upper house of Parliament, lashed out and suggested that the diplomats had made the opposition look like foreign stooges.“What made them addicted to the mirage of The Other Russia on the eve of the Group of 8 summit?” the Interfax news service quoted him as saying. “Do experienced diplomats lack understanding that their mere presence at the meeting is the demolition of a structure created by Kasparov and Kasyanov in the eyes of Russians who are tired of following and listening to ideas from abroad?”High jinks and stunts were evident as well. As if no Russian opposition meeting of any size could occur without a hidden provocateur, while Mr. Brenton gave his public address a man leaped up in the audience, threw leaflets and shouted, “All hail the empire!”He was promptly dragged from the hall, shouting mostly incoherently about Russia’s glories, by a group of men, who gave him a liberal beating much of the way.He was released at the curb.By nightfall, the spokeswoman for The Other Russia said the four arrested participants had been located at a police station, where they were being interrogated.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','One rider not in that line was Levi Leipheimer, the American leader of Gerolsteiner and an early contender for overall victory until he lost more than six minutes in a long time trial Saturday. He lost 26 more seconds in this stage because a crash in front of him slowed him, and he now sits in 72nd place, 6:43 behind the leader, Serhiy Honchar, a Ukrainian with T-Mobile.Honchar retained the yellow jersey by one minute over Floyd Landis, the American leader of Phonak, with Michael Rogers, an Australian with T-Mobile, third, 1:08 behind.True, the roads were flat, the weather was bearably hot and the pack was chasing an early three-man breakaway that was caught two and a half miles before the finish.Still, the day off must have invigorated the riders, who had complained of fatigue during the weekend.“I really needed the break,” Chris Horner, an American teammate of McEwen’s, said Tuesday morning. Referring to his left pinky, which he injured in a crash, he added: “I have a dislocated finger, and I’ve been beat up a lot, and I’ve got a lot of road rash everywhere.“To me, it was a big thing to have a rest day — fantastic. I feel totally rested.”Before the stage, Horner said it was custom-made for sprinters and explained that his Davitamon team would limit its work.“If there’s a breakaway, we won’t try to control the chase because we have three victories already,” he said. “The other sprinter teams will have to pull it back or justify it to their sponsors.”He added: “Sometimes you have to give up a stage like this before the other sprinter teams realize we won’t do any work. We can justify it to our boss: we’ve got three wins, we’re golden.”The chase after the three-man breakaway was led by Crédit Agricole, Lampre and Quick Step, none of which could place a sprinter higher than fourth at the line.The 34-year-old Horner is in his first season with Davitamon, joining the Belgian team after a year with Saunier Duval in Spain as he succeeded in reviving his career in Europe after a half-dozen years of dominating races in the United States.His ambitions in this Tour are limited to protecting Cadel Evans, his Australian leader and an overall contender, in the high mountains, where Horner can be strong.“The main objective is to have me next to Cadel in the mountain stages,” Horner said. “That’s what I was brought on the team for.”Although the race enters the Pyrenees on Wednesday, the stage ends in a long descent to Pau, where time lost on two climbs can be made up.The stage is not expected to be as important as the one Thursday over five huge peaks.“Tomorrow looks like a nice stage for guys like me to get away,” Horner said, referring to his standing (121st place), more than 12 minutes behind the leader. “If I happen to be covering a move that puts me in a break, then of course I’ll stay there. But my real job is to make sure Cadel is taken care of when we get to the high mountains.’’Referring to Evans’s standing — seventh place, 1:52 behind — Horner said: “Cadel is riding exactly where we wanted him to ride, and riding just how we wanted him to ride. Everything right now is going straight to plan.“The only problem I’m having is the crashes and whether they’re going to have an effect on my climbing form.”'"

"'06-07-12,'0','But in statements, Phelps Dodge and Inco maintained that their plan offered shareholders more. When the three-way merger is completed, the companies said, their offer would yield just over $61 a share for Falconbridge stockholders, based on Phelps Dodge’s midday share price Tuesday.Inco’s chairman and chief executive, Scott Hand, said, “Only Inco’s offer gives both current Inco and Falconbridge shareholders the opportunity to participate in the great earnings, cash flow and growth potential of Phelps Dodge Inco.”David Davidson, an analyst with Paradigm Capital in Toronto, said that the bids were more or less equal at this point. “Now the question is, Do you value cash the same way you value cash and paper?”Assessing shareholder sentiment on that question is difficult.Xstrata’s cash offer could mean high tax bills for longtime Falconbridge shareholders who live in Canada. But hedge funds and other short-term investors can be assumed to be more interested in cash.Mr. Davidson said Canadian institutional investors, who are bound by rules that require them to invest part of their holdings in Canada, might also favor a bid like Inco’s that includes equity. “The major institutional investors will have to invest the cash somewhere,” he said. “If you lose Falconbridge, your options become more limited.Both Mr. Davidson and Orest Wowkodaw, an analyst at Canaccord Capital in Toronto, expect Inco to increase its bid, if only by a little. “Xstrata did not put out any kind of knockout punch here,” Mr. Wowkodaw said.Several factors limit how much further either company will go.Mr. Wowkodaw estimated that Falconbridge’s stock price in relation to its cash flow was already twice that of comparable mining companies.While Mr. Davis of Xstrata said his new offer for Falconbridge still offered good value to his shareholders, many analysts maintain that the point at which that is no longer the case might be fast approaching despite now-buoyant nickel prices.Inco, which is eager to combine its nickel operations at Sudbury, Ontario, with those held by Falconbridge, has limited financial maneuvering room. It was able to increase its bid in June because of financing that will be provided by Phelps Dodge. But many debt and equity analysts are already concerned about the $20 billion in debt that Phelps Dodge will hold at the end of the three-way merger deal. Any setback in metals prices would only heighten such concerns, as would an increase in the debt created by the merger.The United Steelworkers, which represents workers at Inco and Falconbridge, opposes a takeover by either Phelps Dodge or Xstrata.It has asked Ottawa to disallow the Xstrata proposal partly because 14.34 percent of the company is owned by Glencore International, a commodities trader founded by Marc Rich, a financier pardoned by President Bill Clinton in January 2001.'"

"'06-07-12,'0','What better time than the dog days of summer to watch a dog-torture advocate get hounded?As three female protesters in Abu Ghraib-style orange jumpsuits and black headscarves stood vigil in the back of the Senate Judiciary hearing room, like the supernatural chorus in “Macbeth,” William Haynes was grilled about his worthiness to ascend to the federal bench when his main claim to the promotion is complicity in letting Dick Cheney dance a jig on the Geneva Conventions.“The State Department characterizes the use of dogs as an interrogation aid as torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment,’’ Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said to the Pentagon general counsel. “We publicly condemned the countries of Libya and Burma for using dogs in interrogation. In November of 2002, you recommended that Secretary Rumsfeld approve the use of dogs to intimidate detainees at Guantánamo.“The Department of Defense’s own investigation concluded that this technique migrated from Guantánamo to Iraq and Abu Ghraib. At least two members of the armed forces have now been convicted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for using dogs to frighten detainees. It is striking that as these soldiers were prosecuted, you were being promoted. What message are we sending our troops? And what message are we sending the world, in light of your role in promulgating abusive interrogation techniques, like the use of dogs, stress positions and forced nudity. What message are we sending if we promote you to the second highest court in the land?”The senator added that the message would be terribly unfair: “Well, we’re going to dispatch a few privates, a few corporals, a sergeant, maybe it will get to a lieutenant, but it’ll never get upstairs. ... Apparently, upstairs there’s a promotion party. Downstairs people are being sent to prison.’’Mr. Haynes, 48, lamely resorted to the argument that Abu Ghraib was simply a few bad apples, “the work of the night shift, without any authority whatsoever.”Even as the Bush administration was forced to concede, after being slapped back by the Supreme Court, that terrorism suspects must be accorded the rights enshrined in the Geneva Conventions, W. was trying to reward those who helped shred them. He nominated Mr. Haynes to sit on the Fourth Circuit court, the conservative Virginia go-to court for contentious cases on civil liberties and detention of foreign prisoners.'"
"'06-07-12,'0','But I wanted muddy palms, scratched calves and an unironic farmer’s tan, the merit badges of the simple life. And when I arrived at Kemal’s farm, after a last-minute flight on Olympic Airways that included a 10-hour layover in Athens and cost me an insane 304 euros, and several long but cheap bus rides from Istanbul, I got all that and more.Every morning, Kemal and I (his only assistant) would march from his tidy stone house, where he lives alone with his cat, Simi, to the five-acre orchard on which he grows seven varieties of apples. His orchard was not like the one I used to visit during my Western Massachusetts childhood, Atkins Farms, whose shady, knotty trees I would climb to pick bushels every fall. Kemal’s trees topped out at seven feet, their thin branches arcing under the weight of Topaz or Gold Star apples. No climbing necessary; no picking either: the four-ton harvest wasn’t until September.Instead, we had to tie down branches according to a logic I could never fully see. Mostly, I followed Kemal’s lead, selecting a branch and waiting for his silent approval before fumbling through another slipknot. We would work this wordless way for hours in the summer heat, pausing from time to time to savor the clean air, gaze at the green hills or chuckle at the elaborate, Pavarotti-like call of the muezzin from the Beypinar mosque just down the hill.At noon we would break for lunch, usually a hearty vegetable stew, crusty bread and a bowl of tart yogurt. Then it was siesta time, and we would doze, read (I finished three novels in four days) or drive around the countryside, swimming in the Sea of Marmara and stopping in cafes to chat with Kemal’s friends over small glasses of tea.The late afternoon would see us returning to the fields, and in the evening we’d cook another big vegetarian dinner, then play backgammon and listen to Keith Jarrett or Maria Callas on his CD player. Before the sun went down, Kemal would chop firewood so we could each have a hot shower. The simple life? More like the good life.But I was torn. On the one hand, I loved this uncomplicated routine. I was happy even doing household chores I’d once scorned, like emptying the dishwasher. On the other, I was desperate to know more about my host, whose patience and generosity were matched only by his childlike enthusiasm for his apples.For Kemal clearly was not your average Turkish apple farmer. His house was no centuries-old homestead but rather a roomy modern building with high ceilings and neat bedrooms. His clothes were nicer, his teeth in better shape than those of his farmer friends. He read Deepak Chopra, did yoga before breakfast and was a master trainer in Neuro-Linguistic Programming.On the third night, my curiosity finally overcame my reticence. I whipped out my notebook and my Lonely Planet Turkish phrase book (bought at Istanbul’s great Robinson Crusoe bookstore, at 389 Istiklal Caddesi, 90-212-293-6968), and sat Kemal down to get his story.Through a mixture of basic vocabulary, hand gestures, exaggerated facial expressions and frantic diagrams and doodles, Kemal told me of his life. He’d grown up near Konya, the hometown of the poet and founder of the Sufi sect, Rumi, and had spent his adulthood working as an engineer for various Istanbul companies. Finally, he’d gotten sick of the grind and was casting about for something new and more fulfilling to do when he had his Isaac Newton moment: apples!In 2002, he bought the land at Beypinar, built his house and planted 2,500 apple trees. His plan was to get the orchards certified organic according to both Turkish and European standards, with the ultimate goal of selling his crops to Milupa, the big baby food company. So far, he’s accomplished the former, but not the latter.That will come in time, I thought; after all, the farm is less than five years old. My more immediate concern was Kemal himself. The night before, he’d grown dizzy during backgammon and had to lie down and check his blood pressure; he was out here in the countryside alone, his two grown daughters unwilling to follow their father’s dream. Their mother ... I couldn’t figure out how to ask about her.“Are you sure you’re O.K. living by yourself?” I asked him in primitive, ungrammatical Turkish. “Don’t you get lonely?”Kemal tapped his heart, smiled and said, “Apples.” Translation: Don’t worry — I’m finally doing what makes me happy.The next morning was Sunday, a day of rest only because we both woke up too late to get any work done; our intense discussion the night before must have worn us out. Instead, we drove out to the Greco-Roman ruins of Priapos, a few imposing brick pillars at the base of a long peninsula, and to Basak restaurant (90-286-354-1295) to indulge in a nonvegetarian feast of karagoz (Grilled Fish Index: a crazy low of $20 a kilogram), assorted meze and a bottle of raki, the cloudy anise-flavored liquor that is Turkey’s top tipple.In fact, blame the raki for my hazy memory of that last afternoon. What did we talk about? The exact words don’t matter. All I remember is us joking around, speaking as freely and as fluently as any two guys who’d grown up together in the same farm town or on the same city block. As dusk approached, we climbed into Kemal’s Opel and drove slowly, carefully, silently back to Beypinar.Then, as we neared the farm, the sun setting over the fields of wheat and sunflowers, Kemal spoke two words in Turkish that sent me flipping through my phrase book for a translation.“Kemal Gorgun, Matt Gross,” he’d said. “Friends — brothers.” All I could think was: Wow.'"

"'06-07-13,'0','WASHINGTON, July 13 — The House voted overwhelmingly this afternoon to renew the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 after a long and emotional debate over how much the South had changed in four decades.The 390-to-33 vote to renew the act for 25 years followed the defeat of several amendments that Democrats said would have drastically weakened the bill, which has been widely credited with ending flagrant discrimination at the polls and helping to elect black officeholders in the old Confederacy.The resistance came mostly from Southern Republican conservatives who complained that passing the act without changes meant that “states with voting problems 40 years ago can simply never be forgiven,” as Representative Lynn Westmoreland, Republican of Georgia, put it.But Representative John Lewis, a Democrat also from Georgia, disagreed as he recalled how he was clubbed by Alabama state troopers in 1965 during a civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery. “I almost died,” Mr. Lewis said. “I gave blood; some of my colleagues gave their very lives.”The 33 lawmakers who voted against renewal are all Republicans, the majority from Southern or border states.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','Oil prices rose sharply to new record highs today as Israel pressed its military attacks in Lebanon and militants assaulted oil pipelines in Nigeria.Light low-sulfur crude oil for August delivery rose $1.40 a barrel to trade at $76.35 today on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The previous record for the benchmark contract was $75.19 a barrel, set last week.The anxiety in global commodities markets swept through equity markets as well, with stock prices in the United States and Europe posting broad declines. According to preliminary figures, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 16.31 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 1,242.29. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 166.89 points, or 1.5 percent, to 10,846.29, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 36.13 points, or 1.7 percent, to 2,054.11. Meanwhile, major stock indexes in Britain, France and Germany fell more than 1.5 percent for the day.Technology stocks were among the most severely rattled today both in the United States and in Europe. After SAP, the giant business software company, reported that it lost market share in the second quarter and that its sales fell short of forecasts, its stock slid by more than 6 percent. Shares of other major software makers like Oracle and Microsoft also fell.Disappointing corporate earnings reports are adding to an already tense selling climate in equity markets, analysts said.“We have had a few straws in the earnings-season wind which have made people wary, particularly on tech,” said Chris Tinker of ICAP in London.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','Police officers combed the city overnight, searching homes and detaining up to 500 people, in the estimation of the city’s commissioner of police, A. N. Roy. Mr. Roy would not say how many people remained in detention, how many were released, or whether interrogations had yielded any leads.The police said they had not yet made formal arrests in the case. The Associated Press reported that the police had released photographs of two suspects who are wanted in connection with the bombings, and gave their names as Sayyad Zabiuddin and Zulfeqar Fayyaz. No details about their nationalities or affiliations were released.The authorities have been reluctant to speculate on which group or groups were involved in the bombing, except to hold out the possibility that a Pakistan-based militant group called Lashkar-e-Taiba may have been involved, with help from a group called the Students Islamic Movement of India. Both have issued statements denying any involvement.Mr. Zabiuddin, one of the suspects, is thought by police to be the unapprehended leader of a group of 16 militants arrested in May with a large cache of explosives and AK-47 assault rifles. Some of the 16 were connected to the student group.Mention of Lashkar-e-Taiba, which has been banned in pakistan but continues to operate through several front names and groups, touched off a diplomatic fracas. Foreign Minister Kurshid Mehmood Kasuri of Pakistan expressed anger at Indian suggestions of Pakistani responsibility for the bombings.“There should not be a knee-jerk reaction that everything happening in India starts in Pakistan,” Mr. Kasuri said in an interview with CNN.Earlier on Wednesday, the spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry, Navtej Sarna, had pointedly called on Pakistan to rein in terrorist organizations operating on Pakistani soil. His comments followed a suggestion by Mr. Kasuri, barely a day after the Mumbai bombings, that India had not done enough to resolve the Kashmir dispute. Mr. Sarna called Mr. Kasuri’s comments appalling.The angry exchanges threaten the slow but sustained three-year peace process between India and Pakistan, which ended the 2002 military standoff between the nuclear neighbors. Talks so far have yielded renewed bus and train links between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled sections of ashmir, but they have made little headway on fundamental questions about the province’s status and future.“Every act of violence, and especially the kind of violence that we witnessed in Mumbai, makes it more and more difficult for the Prime Minister domestically to sustain the peace initiative with Pakistan,” said Amitabh Mattoo, a university professor and member of a government advisory board on foreign policy. “Domestically, it’s difficult to justify taking initiatives to Pakistan when Islamabad is perceived as having engineered these incidents.”Officials count 182 dead and about 700 injured in the Mumbai railway attacks, which involved a series of bombs placed on the luggage racks of first-class men’s compartments on the Western Railway line. The bombs exploded within minutes of each other at around 6:30 p.m., during the evening rush hour.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','Still, he said, he is not interested in arrangements that merely link the companies in specific ventures aimed at short-term or medium-term gain. He wants to explore long-term arrangements that would take advantage of the strengths of the European, Japanese and American companies to the benefit of all three.“I would not be here today if I did not think it was big. Big!” Mr. Ghosn said.He said he was not entering the discussions with the aim of running the alliance himself, although he did not rule that out. Nor did he say whether he expected to receive a seat on the General Motors board, as some reports have speculated.Mr. Wagoner, speaking to reporters in Washington today after testifying before a Senate committee about retiree health care issues, said G.M. would “move expeditiously” to respond to Renault and Nissan’s proposals.“Everyone would want to move to a yes or no decision promptly on something like this,” Mr. Wagoner was quoted by Reuters as saying. Though he did not think G.M. needed an alliance with the two companies to prosper, he said, “we’re willing to sit down and talk about the full range of options.”Earlier in the week, he told a television interviewer that the proposed alliance was “an interesting idea” that he would consider with an open mind.Many analysts have suggested that Mr. Kerkorian, whose associates have voiced impatience with the pace of G.M.’s turnaround efforts, was bent on ousting Mr. Wagoner and replacing him with Mr. Ghosn.“I am not expecting anything for the moment,” Mr. Ghosn said about leadership changes. Rather, he said, “I am focused on ‘What is the size of the prize.’ ”Before G.M.’s board met last Friday, news reports suggested that G.M. management would argue that there was no need for the company to talk with Renault and Nissan. But on Friday, the company issued a statement saying the board had authorized management to consider proposals for an alliance.The possibility of a link among the three companies was first raised last month, when Mr. Ghosn had dinner in London with Jerome B. York, who has served as a financial advisor to Mr. Kerkorian for more than a decade.Mr. York, who joined the G.M. board in January, praised Mr. Ghosn’s swift turnaround at Nissan, Japan’s third-biggest carmaker after Toyota and Honda, and called it an example of the clarity and speed that G.M. could embrace.That meeting led to a dinner in Nashville on June 15 between Mr. Ghosn and Mr. Kerkorian, who made a rare trip from his home in California. Mr. Kerkorian’s involvement has been seen as an effort to raise the price of G.M. stock, which has barely moved since he bought the first of his 56 million shares last year.Mr. Ghosn said he did not see anything wrong with that. “He’s a big investor,” he said. “You cannot blame shareholders to ask that ‘my shares go up.’ “'"
"'06-07-13,'0','A federal judge sentenced a former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation to three years probation yesterday for obstruction of justice related to the insider-trading prosecution of a stock picker.The former agent, Lynn Wingate, was also sentenced to 550 hours of community service and fined $2,500 in Brooklyn federal court, said Bob Nardoza, a spokesman for Roslynn R. Mauskopf, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Prosecutors had asked Judge Raymond J. Dearie of the United States District Court to impose a 10- to 16-month prison term on Ms. Wingate, who pleaded guilty to making unauthorized computer searches on behalf of the stock picker, Anthony Elgindy, and an accomplice, court papers said.On June 13, Judge Dearie sentenced Mr. Elgindy to 11 years and three months in prison for using inside information to make short sales and extort money from companies he criticized in an online newsletter. He was convicted last year of racketeering conspiracy, securities fraud, wire fraud and extortion.Mr. Elgindy used information supplied by Jeffrey A. Royer, then an F.B.I. agent, to spread negative publicity about companies through his Web site. When Mr. Royer left the bureau in 2002 to work with Mr. Elgindy, he instructed Ms. Wingate, whom he had been dating, to run his and Mr. Elgindy’s names in an F.B.I. database, according to court papers.Michael Schneider, a federal public defender in New York who represents Ms. Wingate, did not return a call made to his office after business hours yesterday.Short-sellers seek to profit by correctly predicting a decline in a stock’s price. They sell borrowed shares, planning to buy them later at a lower price and return them to holders. Mr. Elgindy’s gains from trading shares of 32 companies using illegally leaked information totaled $3.02 million, and he made another $1.61 million in Web site fees, the government said.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','The Boeing Company, the world’s second-largest commercial jet maker after Airbus, raised its 20-year industry forecast for world jetliner deliveries by 5.8 percent yesterday because of increasing demand in Asia and the need for airlines to upgrade their fleets.Boeing now expects that plane makers will deliver about 27,200 aircraft in the period, compared with the 25,700 it predicted last year. That represents sales of $2.6 trillion, up from the $2.1 trillion forecast last year, Boeing said in a statement.“We’re forecasting a continued strong long-term demand for new airplanes,” Randy Baseler, Boeing’s chief of marketing, said at a news conference in London yesterday. The increased forecast stems from predicted “accelerated retirement” of less fuel-efficient planes amid high oil prices, he said.Asian carriers in countries including China and India, where governments are deregulating airlines and growing affluence is increasing demand for air travel, will generate 36 percent of industry sales, Boeing said. Airlines are also looking to save money with new fuel-efficient planes like Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and the planned A350 from Airbus.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','SUN VALLEY, Idaho, July 12 — Grupo Televisa, the Mexican broadcaster that recently lost an auction to buy Univision, met here Wednesday with the consortium that won the bidding and discussed the prospect of continuing its investment in Univision, people involved in the discussions said Wednesday night.The meeting, the first between the groups, was held somewhat openly in a dining room at the Sun Valley resort where Allen & Company, the investment bank, has an annual conference for media moguls.The meeting comes after Televisa, a client of Allen & Company, said two weeks ago that it intended to sell its 11.4 percent stake in Univision “as soon as possible” and suggested that it might start a rival online programming outlet in the United States.Televisa provides much of Univision’s most profitable programming through a deal that continues through 2017; it is unclear whether the contract allows for Televisa to provide programming online.Representatives for Televisa at the meeting included Emilio Azcárraga, Televisa’s chairman and president, and Alfonso de Angoitia and Bernardo Gómez, both executive vice presidents of Televisa.The winning consortium was represented by Jonathan M.

"'06-07-13,'0','Administration lawyers have argued that the “most desirable” solution would be for Congress to pass a law approving the tribunals that the court said the president could not establish on his own, proceedings that would grant minimum rights to detainees.But some leading senators said they believed that the White House stance might still be evolving, despite the public pronouncements by the lawyers who appeared before Congress. In particular, they thought the White House might be open to a solution that would abandon the tribunal approach in favor of one that would modify court-martial procedures to reflect the realities of putting terror suspects on trial.“I wouldn’t say that that testimony would set the final parameters of where the administration will go on this,” said Senator John Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee.As President Bush headed to Europe on Wednesday, his spokesman, Tony Snow, said, “The White House is now working with Congress to try to come up with a means of providing justice for detainees at Guantánamo in a manner that’s consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling’’ in the case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.In addition to guaranteeing legal rights, Common Article Three prohibits “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment.” In testimony, administration lawyers said that the article was too vague, and that because failure to comply with Common Article Three was a violation of the War Crimes Act, applying the article to detainees could lead to American troops being charged with felony crimes for interrogation tactics that might be argued to be too harsh.“Congress needs to do something to bring clarity and certainty to Common Article Three,” Steven G. Bradbury, an acting assistant attorney general, told the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.Administration lawyers argued that the White House’s statement Tuesday night was not a shift, but an announcement and an interpretation of the court’s decision. In an interview, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he agreed.“I think what they’re saying is, Until we get further direction we’re going to do the following,” Mr. Graham said. “That doesn’t preclude them or us from giving definition.”The outcome of the debate could affect detainees around the world. The Pentagon holds about 1,000 Qaeda and Taliban detainees at Guantánamo and at bases in Afghanistan. An estimated three dozen terror suspects are believed to be held by the C.I.A. at secret sites abroad.In a week of hearings on Capitol Hill, administration lawyers have argued that the best way to bring detainees to trial after the court’s ruling would be for Congress to ratify the military commissions the court struck down, with what Daniel J. Dell’Orto, a Pentagon deputy general counsel, described as “minor tweaking.”But several scholars and military lawyers have said that the best way to meet the court’s requirements on providing legal and human rights to detainees would be to start with the court-martial procedure set up in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and modify that.Several lawmakers have said that only a solution that extended Geneva protections to detainees would survive another court challenge.“It’s got to be dealt with so that we do not face a future court challenge, and also so that the international community recognizes our credibility in dealing with these things,” said Senator Warner, whose Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the issue on Thursday.Military lawyers, human rights groups and some lawmakers have warned that an effort by Congress to limit the rights granted to terror suspects under the Geneva Conventions would blacken the United States’ reputation internationally, by effectively announcing to the world that it was reneging on a fundamental and commonly held notion of human rights.“We should embrace Common Article Three and sing its praises from the rooftops,” Rear Adm. John D. Hutson, a former judge advocate general of the Navy who is retired, told the Armed Services Committee. “To avoid it or try to draft our way out of it is unbecoming the United States.”But administration lawyers argue that the vagueness of the language in the provision — including the right to “judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples’’ — opened the way to problems.“We just think as you approach these issues, you should give definition and certainty to these issues,” Mr. Bradbury told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.Even some Republicans who are fighting the administration’s approach on establishing trials for the terror suspects agree on the need to limit the application of Article Three.Senator Graham, who pointedly warned administration lawyers that the president would not win by fighting for his approach on trials, said in interviews that Common Article Three must be “reined in.” He said it would make death penalty crimes of current interrogation techniques, including keeping detainees awake and forcing them to sit in extremely hot or cold cells — methods he referred to as “things that are not torture but are aggressive.”“What we need to do is take the ruling of Hamdan and define it so that people will not be unfairly prosecuted because they didn’t know what was in bounds or not,” Mr. Graham said.Mr. Graham said defining Article Three would be “the hardest part” of the debate on how to bring detainees to trial. He suggested that Congress could limit it in a way that resembled the language of the measure setting standards for the treatment of detainees that was written by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and signed into law last year.“It says that every detainee will be treated humanely and that cruel, inhumane treatment will not be allowed against detainees,” Mr. Graham said. “Common Article Three with its language goes well beyond the McCain standard.”Mr. Bradbury and Mr. Dell’Orto, too, expressed a preference for Mr. McCain’s language.Legal experts agree that the White House’s announcement that it would give Article Three rights to detainees puts future cases of detainee abuse, like those at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq in 2004, into the category of war crimes. It raises the stakes, they said, for how American troops treat detainees in military custody.“This isn’t a ‘trust me’ kind of undertaking anymore,” said Diane Orentlicher, a professor of law at American University in Washington. “It’s now a legal obligation.”'"

"'06-07-13,'0','In the months after the Fulton Fish Market’s move from Lower Manhattan to the South Bronx, at least one thing has stayed the same: the smell. It sticks to a fishmonger the way the stench of a burning building clings to a firefighter. It is the pungent scent of the catch, and the fish sellers wear it with pride, as their fathers and grandfathers did, the olfactory legacy of life in the country’s largest seafood distribution center.But just about everything else has changed.The market’s former home on South Street was a monument to old New York, an unvarnished bazaar of cobblestone streets and nearly two centuries of city history. Its new site, in an industrial corner of the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, is an $86 million symbol of the new New York: clean, modern, smooth-running and, even the gruffest fishmongers admit, hopelessly unromantic.The forklifts that carry pallets of catfish, grouper, striped bass and other varieties of fresh fish and seafood used to run on gas. Now they run on batteries. The old market was outdoors, two blocks south of the Brooklyn Bridge. The new one is indoors and resembles not a market but an immense refrigerated warehouse, where the workers dress for winter year round, the décor is a brightly lit white-on-white and one of the closest landmarks is the Hunts Point Water Pollution Control Plant.Yet these days, the mood in the New Fulton Fish Market is upbeat, as the three dozen wholesale seafood companies that moved into the 400,000-square-foot building last November adjust to life after South Street.There is talk among the fish sellers of increased sales, smoother deliveries, fresher fish in the permanent 40-degree chill and happier customers. There is a marketing slogan (Fulton Fresh!) and a Web site (newfultonfishmarket.com), signs that fishmongering, an old-fashioned business that still operates on the faith of a handshake and the swing of a fish hook, has entered the 21st century. And, still, there are tales about the way it used to be, in the old market 13 miles away, the ramshackle home they traded for a windowless icebox that has proved to be good not for the soul, but good for the fish.'"

"'06-07-13,'0','Microsoft now anticipates regulatory reviews as just another step in its development of Windows, the dominant PC operating system. In the United States, Mr. Smith noted, Microsoft has heard repeatedly from the independent technical committee set up to monitor the company, as part of the settlement of the long-running federal antitrust suit against Microsoft.Mr. Smith said the company had made design changes in response to the expert advice, like changing settings to make it easier for consumers and PC manufacturers to substitute competitors’ software for Microsoft features in Vista.The American regulatory review, Mr. Smith said, is nearly over. “In Europe, we don’t have guidance that is anywhere near as concrete as in the United States,” Mr. Smith said. “My worry is that we won’t have clarity from the European regulators until it is too late, until just before Vista is scheduled to ship and we won’t be able to make changes.“And then we’ll be right back to debating the past, as we are now, instead of addressing these issues before the product is shipped.”Microsoft has said it plans to make Vista available to business customers in November and to consumers in January.The information-sharing order in the European antitrust ruling was meant to ensure fair competition in the market for data-serving software that powers Internet applications and corporate data centers, where Microsoft’s server software competes with offerings from I.B.M., Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Red Hat and other companies.Microsoft has repeatedly said it made good-faith efforts to comply with the order, which was a brief, general admonition, included in a 300-page ruling, to supply “complete and accurate technical specifications.” The company said it has had several hundred people working full time to produce thousands of pages of technical documentation.But in March, the commission’s independent monitor called Microsoft’s work “incomplete, inaccurate and unusable.” Since then, Microsoft has worked more closely with the commission and the outside consultant, Neil Barrett, and received more detailed instruction on what was required.“They are making constructive efforts now,” Ms. Kroes said. “It’s a shame they didn’t do so two years ago.”Microsoft said it planned to hand over the last of the requested documents and specifications on July 18. If the commission decides Microsoft has obeyed the order, there will be no further fines. If not, it could double the current daily fine of 1.5 million euros ($1.91 million). The fine announced on Wednesday was the daily total from Dec. 16 last year to June 30.Microsoft is appealing the fine. It is also appealing the 2004 antitrust ruling in Europe, and the much larger fine of more than $600 million that was part of that ruling.Microsoft’s rivals in the market for server software have said the company has played a stalling game by design, gaining market share all the while by unfairly leveraging its dominance of PC desktops. They have noted that for a company sitting on $35 billion in cash, the fines are little more than a nuisance.“The lack of technical disclosure perpetuates a Microsoft lock-in that steers people who use Windows on the desktop to Microsoft server software,” said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a group that supported the European action. “And the European Commission is determined to break that anticompetitive lock-in.”Microsoft’s share of the market for commercial packages of server software has increased by nearly 10 percentage points in the last two years, to 71 percent in 2005, according to IDC, a market research firm. Rivals have said that Microsoft’s anticompetitive practices have contributed to the gains, while Microsoft has countered that it offers superior products.Because the company is so wealthy, analysts said, the financial impact of the fine is slight. But Charles di Bona, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, noted that the fine “looks like a pretty hostile act, especially if you think that Microsoft is complying now, as the comments of the European competition commissioner suggest.” He added: “You have to expect that Europe will be aggressive on Vista.”The issues surrounding Vista concern the part of the 2004 European ruling that seeks to curb Microsoft’s ability to bundle new software products into the Windows operating system. The European Commission took a much stronger stand on bundling than authorities in the United States, where the 2001 settlement left Microsoft free to design Windows as it wished.One design choice being reviewed by the commission is Microsoft’s decision to include a new document format in Vista that will compete with Adobe’s widely used portable document format, or P.D.F. In a letter to Ms. Kroes on April 11, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, proposed four possible solutions to the European concern that Vista would harm competition for document formats and document-reading software.The options included adding P.D.F.-reading software in Vista, letting PC makers hide Microsoft’s document format and related software, letting PC makers in Europe remove the document software and offering a higher-priced version of Vista in Europe that includes the software.Microsoft is uneasy about what it sees as the growing interest of European governments, in particular, to delve into the design of technology products. “If regulators are going to dive deeply into the design of costly, research-based products, we need a constructive dialogue early in the process,” Mr. Smith said. “What we really need is guidance in advance, not criticism after the fact.”Mr. Smith gave no hint that the European review would further delay Vista, whose shipment schedule has slipped repeatedly.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said BP had a “streak of bad luck” but the company still enjoyed a solid reputation around the world. In the United States, though, “BP has this black cat that just keeps crossing its path — back and forth.”To be sure, BP is logging record profits these days, posting net income last year of $22.34 billion, up 31 percent from 2004. It returned more than half — $12 billion — to shareholders in the first half of 2006 in dividends and stock buybacks. Shares of BP rose 10 percent in 2005, and are up another 10 percent this year.Mr. Malone, a 54-year-old self-described extrovert, needs to bring a great deal of tact and urgency to his new job. The company’s slip in the United States is a setback for his boss, Lord Browne, BP’s chief executive, who once managed the business in America.If not dealt with, the missteps threaten to undermine Lord Browne’s long efforts to give BP an environmentally friendly face and to deflect from BP some of the public’s hostile attitude toward the oil industry. Analysts say the recent events have chipped away at this carefully crafted image, at least in the United States.“I am concerned that there are people questioning in various areas those values,” Mr. Malone said in a phone interview yesterday. “Part of what I want to do is address these issues. They are real and they are serious to BP America.”Earlier this month, the company said that its second-quarter production had fallen 2.5 percent from the period last year, to four million barrels a day of oil equivalent, its fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Also, BP said it would take a further $500 million charge for compensation claims for the Texas City blast, in addition to the $700 million it set aside last year.The United States accounts for nearly half the company’s global sales, half the company’s total assets and, with 40,000 workers, about half its employees. In turn, BP is a big player in America, accounting for 10 percent of this country’s oil output; its operations in the United States are bigger than those of Exxon Mobil, which is still much larger worldwide.In many ways, BP’s changing of the guard in the United States is a public admission of its problems here. Mr. Malone’s predecessor in the United States, Ross Pillari, a 55-year-old executive for both North and South America, retired on July 1 after 34 years at BP.“The United States has been BP’s weak spot, both in terms of its safety record and on poor maintenance issues,” said Lanny Pendill, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. “There’s also been a lack of oversight.”The company, however, denied that Mr. Pillari’s retirement was related to the recent misfortunes. Mr. Malone’s strong safety record may have played a role in his appointment. In London, he oversaw BP’s oil and natural gas tanker shipments, a high-risk business that cannot afford accidents. During his tenure, BP shifted away from relying on chartered vessels and bought 48 double-hulled tankers. After the near collapse of the Thunder Horse offshore platform, he took over responsibility for all of BP’s floating structures in the Gulf of Mexico.Before that, Mr. Malone was BP’s man running the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline. Mr. Malone brings “a proven record of success in the companies he has led,” Lord Browne said in a statement issued by the company.Mr. Malone, who says “my priority is around safety,” will visit BP’s five refineries, starting with Texas City, in the next few weeks. He plans to return to the site of the oil spill in Alaska in two weeks and expects to drop in on all the company’s major plants within three months.“I like to get out with employees,” he said. “I need to see things for myself.”In his new job, Mr. Malone will have to manage the company’s latest stumble — federal authorities charged late last month that BP manipulated the price of propane two years ago by cornering the market through its dominant position.The scam was short-lived, and the traders lost $10 million. But the allegations hit at the heart of the company’s sizable and very lucrative trading business. BP disputes the charges.In Texas City, BP faces criminal charges after an explosion in March 2005 at its refinery, the third-biggest in the United States, killed 15 workers and injured 180. A preliminary investigation found “systemic lapses in safety culture” at the refinery, which had a long history of accidents and management slip-ups.BP swiftly accepted responsibility for the accident. Lord Browne visited the site the morning after the blast, replaced the plant’s manager and approved about $1 billion in new investments in repairs and safety improvements. BP said it also quickly settled with the families of the dead and injured workers. Still, the company was fined $21.3 million.A federal agency investigating the blast has not ruled out interviewing Lord Browne before releasing a final report by the end of the year. Earlier this year, the company was fined $2.4 million for “unsafe operations” at another refinery in Toledo, Ohio. BP is contesting that fine.“It is difficult to say if this is a BP-wide issue,” said Craig Pennington, the director of the global energy group at Schroders in London. “But they appear to cut corners for the sake of short-term profit maximization. If you are a serial underspender in a refinery, it will come back to haunt you.”Just three months after the refinery accident, after Hurricane Dennis swept through the Gulf of Mexico, Thunder Horse — a huge new offshore platform that was about to start production — began tilting into the waters, listing at a 20-degree angle. The company blames a failure in the platform’s hydraulic system.One year later, Thunder Horse remains hobbled with problems. The company, which spent $250 million in repairs, expects production to restart by the end of the year. But analysts suspect that a recent admission that two subsea manifolds were found to be leaking might further delay the start of production.Mr. Malone also must contend with criminal charges against BP in connection with the large oil slick that spread across the Alaskan tundra in March, after a corroded pipeline operated by BP broke and spilled about 4,800 barrels, or about 200,000 gallons, of crude oil. Its local subsidiary, BP Exploration Alaska, had been fined several times in earlier cases, most recently $1.2 million in 2004. Now, the federal Department of Transportation, responsible for pipeline safety, is looking into the company’s maintenance practices.The company strongly denies it has skimped on maintenance and said it increased the number of inspections in recent years.Yet the pipeline problem in Alaska echoes a chorus of complaints lodged against BP in recent years over the construction of a major pipeline linking the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey.BP is being investigated by the Environmental Protection Agency for violations of air pollution rules, by the Labor Department for unsafe work practices, and by the federal Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board for its industrial safety practices. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department are looking into the trading allegations.While BP is cooperating with all these investigations, it strongly rejects any suggestion that it has a companywide problem. “These are unrelated incidents,” said Ronnie Chappell, a BP spokesman.BP has had a large presence in North America since the 1970’s. But the company’s big push came with Lord Browne’s purchase of Amoco in 1998 for $52 billion, at the time the largest-ever merger in the oil industry. In 2000, BP bought another American company, Atlantic Richfield, for $26.8 billion.But along with the assets, BP also inherited the problems. “There is a lot on their plate that they need to sort out,” Mr. Pennington said. Meanwhile, he added, “it’s all incredibly embarrassing for them.”'"
"'06-07-13,'0','“They actually wanted upper-class people to suffer this time,” Ronak Gandhi, 21, observed. His brother, Chintan, 25, lay inside Lilavati Hospital in the wealthy northern suburb of Bandra, suffering from a broken arm and internal bleeding.On Tuesday, like most days, Chintan Gandhi stood in the crowded middle of the first-class men’s compartment on his way home from a software engineering course. He planned to finish the course by next June, his brother said; he was eager to start full-time work for the first time.The Indian home secretary, V. K. Duggal, said a preliminary investigation indicated that the bombers had probably used RDX, a plastic explosive used by the military. He took pains not to point a finger at any particular organization but said the pattern of the attacks resembled the handiwork of known groups.“From the way it has been conducted, we have our suspicions,” he said in a telephone interview from New Delhi. “It’s a bit early to name the outfit. Very soon Mumbai police will make an announcement. These are not new organizations.”P. S. Pasricha, the director general of police in Maharashtra State, which includes Mumbai, said it was impossible to rule out a banned Pakistan-based militant organization, Lashkar-e-Taiba, even as he cautioned that it would be “premature and misleading” to blame any particular group. No evidence has yet been presented linking the blasts to any individuals or organizations.As forensic teams scoured the wreckage, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh vowed in a televised speech on Wednesday evening to be undeterred by violence. “No one can make India kneel,” he said. “No one can come in the path of our progress. The wheels of our economy will move on.”The bombs exploited the frenetic rhythm of daily life in Mumbai, also known as Bombay, India’s financial and film capital. In seven first-class men’s compartments on separate trains, the bombs went off within minutes of one another along the Western Railway line connecting the commercial districts of south and central Mumbai to the spreading suburbs to the north. An eighth bomb exploded at a station on the line.In the cramped quarters of Mumbai’s commuter trains, which carry more than six million passengers a day, it is customary for men and women to travel in separate cars. (“For ladies only, all the 24 hours,” a sign announces at the entrance to the women’s compartments.) No women’s cars were bombed Tuesday, and for the most part, women were able to get out of the trains relatively unscathed.The carnage could have been worse if the bombers had chosen to hit the second-class cars, which are normally even more crowded, bursting with passengers.By midmorning on Wednesday, with the wreckage mostly cleared off the tracks, train service on the line gradually resumed. The platforms were nowhere as congested as usual, but those who ventured out said fear would have to be conquered.“If you have so much fear, you can’t stay in Bombay,” said P. Ratnakar, 36, a migrant worker from southern Karnataka State who comes to Mumbai every monsoon season to work in the city’s hotel industry. “Small things, small things are always happening.”Neither state nor federal officials had much to say Wednesday afternoon about exactly how the attacks had been carried out. A. P. Sinha, the assistant chief minister in charge of home affairs in Maharashtra State, said only that it was plausible that explosives had been left in plastic bags in the train compartments.Ajai Sahni, a Delhi-based intelligence analyst who tracks terrorist groups in South Asia, said suspicion fell on Lashkar-e-Taiba less on the basis of specific evidence than on the record of past attacks in which it has been implicated — 11 in all since 1997 in Mumbai alone.The explosions fueled a war of words between Indian and Pakistani officials, with the Pakistani foreign minister, Khurshid Kasuri, calling attention to sagging attempts to negotiate peace, and the spokesman for the Indian Foreign Ministry lashing out in return.“We would urge Pakistan to take urgent steps to dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism on the territory under its control and act resolutely against individuals and groups who are responsible for terrorists’ violence,” said the Indian spokesman, Navtej Sarna.Pakistan has long maintained that it offers no more than moral and political support to groups fighting Indian rule in Kashmir.Mr. Sinha, the state official, said that while federal intelligence sources had been alerted generally to potential terror attacks on houses of worship and prominent financial institutions, there had been no specific indication that the city’s transit system would be hit.The police have been combing the city for clues, he added, but have not made any arrests or detained anyone for questioning. “We are not in a position to say anything,” Mr. Sinha said. “We do not have any idea of who was involved.”There was little mystery about who was hurt. A list of dead and injured posted near the entrance of Bhabha Hospital offered a snapshot of Mumbai’s demographic mix: Gujaratis, Marathis, North Indian Brahmins, Keralites from the southwest. Of the 73 injured taken there, all but 4 were men, ranging in age from 19 to 76. All of the 22 dead in its morgue were men.Among them was Krishna Kumar, a bank worker in his early 30’s known for his knack for fixing colleagues’ computer troubles. Mr. Kumar left the office of the Indian Overseas Bank about 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, saying he planned to go shopping one evening this week to buy a birthday present for his son, who turns 7 on Saturday.Mr. Kumar, a native of Bihar, in the east, was much like his co-workers, posted to Mumbai for a few years at a time from far and wide across India. No one knew how long they would stay here. Maybe another posting would come. Maybe they would one day return home.“Some lucky fellows, they’ll be staying in Bombay,” said Ganapati Bhatt, a colleague and a native of Karnataka in the southwest. “Some unlucky fellows, they will be going where?” He looked upward and raised an open hand to the sky.By nightfall on Tuesday, when they had not heard from the Mr. Kumar, teams of his co-workers began fanning out across the city. On Wednesday afternoon they found his body among the 22 at the Bhabha Hospital morgue. Mr. Bhatt said he could recognize his friend by the clothes he had worn to work that day.'"

"'06-07-13,'0','The Metropolitan Museum of Art is raising its recommended admission price for adults to $20 from $15, making it one of the most expensive museums to visit in the world.Harold Holzer, a museum spokesman, said the increase, which is to take effect on Aug. 1, was intended to remedy an annual operating deficit that had averaged $3 million in recent years.He emphasized that the fee was suggested, not obligatory. He declined to specify what percentage of the Met’s 4.2 million annual visitors paid the recommended charge.The Museum of Modern Art drew broad attention in 2004 when its admission fee, which is compulsory, soared to $20 from $12, as it opened its newly expanded home in Midtown Manhattan.Critics accused the museum of effectively closing its doors to a broad swath of the museumgoing public. MoMA countered that admission was free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m., and that visitors 16 and under could always enter at no charge.Officials at the Met said they had little choice but to raise the price.“The Met has worked long and hard to find ways to address a longstanding operating budget deficit,” Mr. Holzer said. “This is an effort to remain as accessible as possible, without resorting to mandatory options like charging extra for special exhibitions.”Among other New York institutions, the Solomon R. Guggenheim charges $18; the Whitney Museum of American Art, $15; and the Brooklyn Museum, $8. The Art Institute of Chicago’s admission fee is $12; the Smithsonian Institution’s museums in Washington and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles are free.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','To Mr. Jordan, 39, what is at stake is not only the future of his practice, but whether Santa Fe will devolve into what he calls a cartoon version of itself. Mr. Jordan contrasts the city with another desert town, Palm Springs, Calif., where architectural innovation has flourished.Mr. Mills agreed that architectural rigidity is a bad sign for a city. “What concerns me,” he said, “is there seems to be less discussion here about how to integrate architecture of the moment into the past than there is in scores of cities around the world, many of them as old as, or older than, Santa Fe.”But, Ms. Farrar said, Santa Fe’s architecture evolved from an American Indian tradition. “It’s from the earth, it’s rounded, it’s organic,” she added. Because of that, she said, the city’s historic district may not be the place for experimentation. “Contemporary architecture represents a different sensibility,” she said. Quality is not the issue. Mr. Jordan, she said, “is good at what he does, and there are many places for it, even in Santa Fe. But not in the historic district.”As for the heightened scrutiny the board has been giving proposed buildings since Mr. Mills and Ms. Reid’s house was finished, she said: “Drawings can be deceiving. You may not know that a particular line represents a crisp edge. So we have to be very careful.”Todd Granzow, an artist and furniture designer who moved to Santa Fe in 1979, said it is important to preserve the dominant look. “No apologies for that,” he said. “Ever been in a Tuscan hill town? The houses are all the same style. Santa Fe was intended to be all of a piece. The decision was made decades ago, and most residents want to uphold it.”Not long ago, Santa Fe architecture encompassed a variety of styles: there were the famous Pueblo-style buildings, along with Craftsman and Victorian cottages and shedlike structures made of cinderblock. But by the 1950’s the adobe look took hold, just as tourism was becoming big business.It was in the 1950’s that John Gaw Meem, the most prominent exponent of what is now called Santa Fe style, helped draft the ordinances for what could be built in the historic district. The ordinances require that outside walls be earth tones.But even so, Mr. Mills and Ms. Reid’s house seems an unlikely candidate for controversy. “You’d think when people talk about the color that it was flaming red,” Mr. Mills said. In fact, it is a shade of cottonwood or sage, which they believe blends with the landscape. The house is about a mile from Santa Fe’s tourist-filled central plaza. Mr. Mills’s neighbors are mostly members of one old Santa Fe family, the Armijos, who have built their houses in a variety of sizes, styles and colors.“If you look on our street, there are pink adobe, orange adobe, yellow adobe,” Ms. Reid said. “Our house is really nothing special.” (And their immediate neighbors, they said, were very supportive. Ms. Reid said, “They told us, ‘This is your property, and you should do what you want.’ ”)If anything, the couple thought their house would be a good thing for the city. For years they lived outside of town, on several acres. But, as environmentalists, they disapprove of sprawl. By living closer to the center, they reasoned, they would be less dependent on their car, and they would be building on land near developed property rather than on virgin territory. Eventually, they found a lot they liked. It had been on the market for more than a year, Mr. Mills said, in part because it was narrow, treeless and on a major thoroughfare, and people thought a house there would lack privacy. But the couple had seen some work by Mr. Jordan, “which we loved,” Mr. Mills said, and they entrusted him to make the best use of the site.Mr. Jordan came up with a plan to split the building in two, making it inward-looking. At its heart is a garden, created entirely by Ms. Reid, centered on native grasses like blue grama and flowering shrubs like mountain mahogany and Forestiera neomexicana.Mr. Mills works at home, editing a magazine for the Natural Resources Defense Council and consulting on its efforts to broaden its membership base. Ms. Reid teaches yoga in a room on the other side of the garden. Their son, Sky, 14, does his homework at the kitchen counter, builds models at the table and reads in a window seat designed by Mr. Jordan.Mr. Jordan is now hoping to build his own house on an empty lot about two miles from the center of town. When he presented the plan for the 1,500-square-foot building to the board in January, it asked him to change seven of its features, including the direction of its window mullions (he wanted horizontal; they wanted vertical) and the roundness of its corners. He made some of the changes, but not others, and justified his refusal by pointing to historical precedents for his design in the historic district.When the board again refused to approve the house, Mr. Jordan appealed to the City Council, which was expected to hear his case last night.The question, Mr. Jordan said, is whether the town will follow its own laws. More broadly, he said, the issue is whether Santa Fe will be stuck “not in the past, but in a fake past.” But Ms. Farrar said the rounded Pueblo style is an architectural tradition she has known her entire life. “It’s not some Disneyland thing,” she said.To Mr. Mills the paradox is that his house, he believes, is highly contextual. With its stucco walls that emulate adobe, its palette of earth tones, its exposed timbers and its courtyard plan, he said, “it couldn’t be in any other city in the world but Santa Fe.”'"
"'06-07-13,'0','Last month, in a kind of sequel to Rasul, the Supreme Court said the administration’s plans for trying Guantánamo prisoners using secret evidence offended both military justice and international law. The administration and Congress are at work recasting those plans, and the Pentagon announced this week that it will comply with an important provision of the Geneva Conventions, the one prohibiting “outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.”Mr. Habib was lucky in his lawyer, as Mr. Margulies is a resourceful advocate, a serious and sober legal analyst and a fine, sometimes luminous writer. In his new book Mr. Margulies weaves together a history of wartime interrogation, a consideration of the legal standards that apply to it and an assessment of the toll that Guantánamo has taken on the men and boys held there, and on the nation’s reputation and values.The book’s title, with its dry allusion to the separation of powers, does not do it justice. “Guantánamo and the Abuse of Presidential Power” represents the best account yet of what Mr. Margulies calls “a human rights debacle that will eventually take its place alongside other wartime misadventures, including the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the prosecutions under the Espionage and Sedition Acts during World War I, and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus during the Civil War.”The first problem in considering Guantánamo is one of metaphor. It is a prison, certainly, but not one meant to mete out punishment for past crimes. It is a kind of prisoner-of-war camp too, a way to incapacitate supposed combatants for the duration of hostilities so that they cannot return to the field of battle. But here the hostilities — the so-called war on terror — may last forever. And the battlefield is the globe.Most crucially, Guantánamo is an interrogation chamber. To be effective, administration strategists said, it should operate outside the American legal system, “without the risk,” Mr. Margulies writes, “of interference by courts and counsel into the delicate ‘relationship’ between interrogators and prisoners.” And to be more effective yet, they went on, the prisoners had to be denied the protections of the Geneva Conventions.Until Guantánamo, the United States had an excellent reputation for the humane treatment of captured combatants. During World War II, for instance, Mr. Margulies writes, when more than 400,000 German, Italian and Japanese prisoners of war were held in the United States, their captors followed the Geneva Conventions “with an almost compulsive regard.” Because the conventions require that prisoners be afforded the same living conditions as their guards, for instance, American camp commanders ordered their own soldiers to sleep in tents until barracks for the prisoners were completed.The Guantánamo prisoners, by contrast, were made to endure stress positions, extreme temperatures, sleep deprivation, blaring music, strobe lights, religious insults and sexual humiliation. Three prisoners there recently committed suicide.In “Oath Betrayed” Dr. Steven H. Miles, an expert on medical ethics, collects evidence that “armed forces physicians, nurses and medics had been passive and active partners in the systemic neglect and abuse of prisoners” at Guantánamo, in Iraq and in Afghanistan.In his short, passionate and disjointed book, made up mostly of information from raw documents, reports and news accounts, Dr. Miles allows outrage to substitute for analysis. Still, he collects countless examples of medical complicity in abuse that is all the more disturbing for the lack of any notable protest. Doctors have, Dr. Miles writes, certified prisoners as healthy enough to withstand harsh treatment, monitored them during interrogations and concealed evidence of their mistreatment.“Enough practitioners complied when they should have resisted, or kept quiet when they should have spoken out,” Dr. Miles writes, “to allow abusive interrogational practices and a neglectful prison environment to operate largely without medical opposition or disclosure.”Lawyers were also slow to rise to the challenge of Guantánamo. In the early days the establishment bar and even some of the major civil rights groups held their fire, leaving it to Mr. Margulies and a handful of other lawyers — notably those of the Center for Constitutional Rights in New York, Thomas B. Wilner of Shearman & Sterling in Washington and Clive Stafford Smith in New Orleans — to file the most important American lawsuits since the Sept. 11 attacks. In an aside on page 158 of his book, Mr. Margulies notes that he was not paid for his work on the Rasul case.Inside the government, though, the situation was more complicated. Lawyers in the military and the State Department fought an honorable if largely losing battle to try to preserve the Geneva Conventions.In 2002 Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld described those held at Guantánamo as “among the most dangerous, best trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.” But a recent study prepared at the Seton Hall University School of Law shows that just 8 percent of the detainees were even said by the government to be Qaeda fighters.More than 300 Guantánamo detainees have been released or transferred, Mr. Habib among them. The United States government never charged him with a crime, and he is back in Australia, a free man.'"
"'06-07-13,'0','The fact that there are two candidates speaks to the legacy of Mr. Herman, who adopted the role when American fashion was the equivalent of the Wild West and fashion shows were chaotic. No other designer would play the part of sheriff.“It’s like putting socks on a rooster to get everyone to go in one direction,” said Dana Buchman, the sportswear designer. “Stan has an ineffable quality that makes him able to smooth over the rough edges and help make a cohesive group of 200-and-some hotheads.”Over the years Mr. Herman has asked others, like Calvin Klein and Donna Karan, if they would become the council president, but none had the time.“It’s not like I need something to do,” Ms. Von Furstenberg said. “But there is no question, if they elect me I will put my heart and soul into it.”Mr. Abboud characterized the race as free of personal politics. “I admire anybody who is willing to step up and make a commitment,” he said. “I don’t see this as a popularity contest. I see it as rolling up your sleeves and going to work.”Nevertheless, the council has a political hierarchy, and Mr. Abboud has never quite been satisfied with his ranking. In his 2004 book, “Threads,” he wrote of being offended when seated in the third row of a press conference announcing the council’s response to 9/11, behind Ralph, Donna, Diane, Tommy, Calvin, Oscar. “Was it the wrong time to be upset? Yes, but there you are,” Mr. Abboud wrote. “I like being perceived as a regular guy, but I’m a regular guy with an ego.”And how that ego must have been bruised when the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, whose fashion edicts are undisputed, tacitly endorsed Ms. Von Furstenberg in the magazine’s July issue. An article that did not mention Mr. Abboud lyrically described Ms. Von Furstenberg as “perfectly poised for her potential new position,” which it said was “an ideal spot from which to power-share.”Mr. Abboud said he had not read the article, though it set off a frantic round of phone calls from both candidates about how it would be perceived.“That was wrong,” Mr. Herman said of the article. “This decision will be made by the board.”Patrick O’Connell, a spokesman for Vogue, said Ms. Wintour is actively involved with the council and therefore has an interest in who becomes president. “Anna feels that Diane is uniquely qualified and would do a great job,” he said.The 26-member board includes the designers Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, Michael Kors, Tommy Hilfiger and Carolina Herrera, in addition to both candidates and Mr. Herman. There is also a contingent of less celebrated designers, some of whom said privately that they would support Mr. Abboud because he is the underdog. Ms. Wintour’s endorsement of Ms. Von Furstenberg may also have agitated designers who feel ignored by the magazine. It is as if the unpopular kids are seeking their revenge.“This election has become something beyond all expectations,” said the designer Mary Ann Restivo, who would not disclose her preference. “It’s anybody’s ballgame at this point.”Several members said they had been approached by each designer.“Any candidate worth his salt is going to lobby a bit,” Ms. Buchman said, adding that she has been entertained by phone calls and letters from Ms. Von Furstenberg and Mr. Abboud, asking for her vote. “It’s healthy campaigning.”Of course, there is a little intrigue. Nicole Miller, another board member, said that when Mr. Abboud first proposed himself, Ms. Von Furstenberg suggested he would make a good president.“I was under the impression she was behind Joseph,” Ms. Miller said. “I was surprised when she wrote everybody a letter saying she wanted the job.”Ms. Von Furstenberg said the council needed a more exciting candidate. She added that her example as president could inspire other marquee designers to run in the future.Ms. Von Furstenberg, 59, began designing print wrap dresses in her 20’s, shortly after her fairy-tale marriage to Prince Egon von Furstenberg. Her appeal as both a successful businesswoman and a glamorous socialite became the subject of magazine cover stories. In the late 90’s she reinvented herself as a designer for contemporary young women, and in 2001 she married Barry Diller, the chief executive of IAC/InterActiveCorp, cementing their position as one of the city’s power couples.“I have become something of a senior person,” she said. “I have a lot of assets, and I understand the designers. I know the Italians and the French, and I can deal with them. My interests will be to represent the American designers.”Since Mr. Abboud, 56, began his men’s collection in 1987, he has encountered many of the business issues endemic to fashion; he clashed with two successive management teams at his company, and last year he resigned. He said his experiences would suit him well in relating to the problems of other designers, “especially for so many new designers who don’t know the pitfalls that are out there.”But on the issues, Mr. Abboud and Ms. Von Furstenberg have similar responses. Both support a Vogue-financed mentoring program that has spotlighted labels like Proenza Schouler, Doo.Ri and Trovata. And they are behind a measure introduced in Congress this year that would extend intellectual property rights to fashion designers, to prevent copying.When Mr. Herman, who is 75, joined the council in 1967, it was a tight-knit group of about 40 high-end designers — much like a fraternity, he said. With the presidency held by a succession of designers like Mr. de la Renta, Perry Ellis and Carolyne Roehm, the council expanded from an arts group with an annual society benefit to one that introduced fund-raising initiatives like 7th on Sale, to combat AIDS. Soon after Mr. Herman became president, the council chose a centralized site in Bryant Park for runway shows, a move that has made New York Fashion Week an international media event.Perhaps the most critical issue before the council results from its decision in 2001 to sell the rights to the Bryant Park shows to IMG, the marketing company. Over five years IMG made payments to the council that accounted for 15 to 20 percent of its $5 million annual budget. The final payment, of $540,000, is due this year. The next president must now build an endowment to finance the group.Mr. Herman described the council as an organization that appears larger than it really is because of “marvelous smoke and mirrors.”“Either candidate will be good,” Mr. Herman said. “But I won’t tell you who I’m voting for.”'"
"'06-07-13,'0','But a quick search online convinced me that things in the outdoor rug department have improved greatly since then. At sites like Rugsusa.com, Backyardcity.com and Grandinroad.com, I saw colorful, intricately patterned outdoor rugs that would have looked equally at home indoors, at prices that hovered well below $200. At Kokotrends.com, I even saw a reversible Persian-style outdoor floor mat in 10 bright color combinations ($36 for a six-by-four-foot size).What revolutionized the world of outdoor rugs? I called the Carpet and Rug Institute, a trade organization that represents American carpet manufacturers, to find out.The answer, I learned from Werner Braun, the institute’s president, boiled down to two words: polypropylene thread. Rug manufacturers, who have long relied on the durable thermoplastic substance to make most all-weather rugs, have in recent years begun to use polypropylene thread on their looms, weaving the same kinds of elaborate designs that used to be reserved for indoor rugs.“This whole trend has accelerated in the past three or four years, with the consumer demanding more style, color and design options,” Mr. Braun said. “Mills have modernized their equipment, and as a result you see significant innovations.”For me, that meant an overwhelming number of rugs to look at online. I spent hours glued to the computer screen, gazing at tiny thumbnail images. I was particularly partial to a trellis-patterned rug described as the Terrace Wrought Iron, which I saw at Rugsdirect.com for $99 for a 4’9” by 7’4” size.The rug was nearly identical to Smithandhawken.com’s Patio Rug, which cost $149 for a size that was a few inches larger, with one key difference. While the Smith & Hawken rug was available in two dirt-resistant colors — described as oatmeal and rust — the rug I wanted had a pale straw-colored background and a moss-colored trellis pattern.Would buying it be impractical?I looked down at Otto, who looked so harmlessly clean and glossy, snoring at my feet. As he twitched and sighed, I surreptitiously eyed the large, dusty oven mitts he calls paws.Maybe I would be better off with the French leopard rug at Ballarddesigns.com ($29 to $299, depending on size) because the mottled brown and black leopard-skin spots on it would provide camouflage for muddy dog prints?I watched Otto’s claws go scritch-scritch as he chased a rabbit in his sleep.I wavered. And then, I decided to be brave. What did I have to lose by testing the Rugsdirect.com rug? The company offered free shipping and a money-back guarantee. If I chickened out after the rug arrived, I could return it for any reason within two weeks for a full refund.The rug arrived two weeks later, compactly rolled up inside a clear plastic bag that UPS conveniently left on the porch.I unrolled the rug. The colors perfectly complemented the striped cushions on the all-weather porch furniture I recently had bought from Target.com.Then I watched him mosey off toward the backyard to dig up a bone from a wet spot in the garden.I looked down at the pale, straw-colored background on the rug — and rushed inside in a panic to phone Rugsdirect.com for advice.“I have this dog,” I told Rex Creekmur, the company’s director of marketing.Mr. Creekmur did not flinch. His company, which has two brick-and-mortar stores in Virginia, sells 60,000 rugs online and has a home page logo that proclaims it “The Nation’s Leading Source for Area Rugs,” didn’t earn this motto by panicking.“Your dog can’t hurt it by walking on it,” he said.“There are other things a dog can do that you need to be careful of, of course,” he said.“Otto would never do that on a rug,” I said.“Yes, it’s water-resistant, that’s one of the keys, but it’s a very tight weave, so you should be able to vacuum it to prevent dirt from getting ground in,” he said.“While I have you on the phone,” I said, “what about other issues? Seedpods, for instance.”“Sometimes sticky ones blow onto the porch,” I said.“If anything leaves a mark, and you’ve just got to use a carpet cleaner, scrub it with a soft brush,” he said.By the time I returned to the porch, Otto had struck. But I felt resolute as I surveyed the muddy prints he’d left behind.Within a couple of hours, the problem spot dried. I vacuumed. The prints disappeared.The next day, I found my husband reading the newspaper on the porch, Otto at his feet chewing something.I heard an ominous squeak. The duck toy was pretty muddy, but nothing compared with what the children used to bring home.'"

"'06-07-14,'0','Angela Henson sees things. Not exactly like Allison DuBois on NBC’s “Medium,” who has dreams, most often about murders. Maybe it’s more accurate to say that Angela knows things. Like Adrian Monk of USA’s “Monk,” the Holmesian detective who sees clues where mere mortals draw a blank. Angela is never wrong. Like Dr. Gregory House of Fox’s “House.” If he makes a diagnostic error, that means the whole episode is a dream.Angela (the gorgeous Abigail Spencer) is the F.B.I. agent heroine of Lifetime’s new drama series “Angela’s Eyes,” which has its premiere on Sunday night. And Lifetime would love nothing more than for her to take her place alongside those infallible television favorites.She proves herself in the first episode by becoming fed up with an uneventful three-day stakeout, barging into a diner and confronting the man who she knows is harboring a terrorist. She can even tell where the terrorist is by the movement of the man’s eyes when he lies about it. And when he puts a gun to her poreless forehead, she is so sure of his intentions that she is able to say, coolly: “Wow. Scary.”It would be nice if Angela’s persona were truly distinctive, but, played by Ms. Spencer, she may turn out to be just another very pretty face.In the first hour, she looks lovely, working with her partner, Leo (Lyriq Bent), figuring out whether a millionaire really killed his missing wife. The investigation touches on escort services, a secret lesbian affair and organized crime in the construction business. There’s a big finale in Chinatown, and you know how dark that sort of thing can get.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','With a 71-30-29 record, Arena, 54, a New York native, is the most successful national team manager in United States soccer history. He has held the position since Oct. 26, 1998, after having led D.C. United of Major League Soccer to two league titles and previously taking the University of Virginia to five N.C.A.A. Division I championships.“I am proud of how far the organization has come over the last eight years and I am extremely optimistic about the future of the sport in our country,” Arena said in a statement released by the federation today. “As for me, I am planning to take some time off to weigh my future opportunities.”According to published reports, most recently earlier this week in The Washington Post, Arena has discussed a position with the New York Red Bulls of M.L.S. The club recently fired Mo Johnston as its coach and is also seeking a director of soccer operations. It might be viewed as a step down for Arena to return to the sideline in M.L.S., but perhaps he might find a management position more appealing. It is also possible he could combine both positions and take over one of the least-successful teams in the 11-year history of M.L.S.Arena, who often was bluntly outspoken about his team and the state of the game in the United States, was able to forge a special bond with his players as he assumed the mantle as the de facto spokesman for American soccer. As an accomplished American coach, he seemed to have been the right man at the right time.That equation appears to have changed amid rising expectations and an American sporting mentality that assumed there would be a natural progression from quarterfinalist four years ago.“Bruce is outspoken, clearly, and that’s part of what makes him a great coach,” Gulati said. “I don’t agree with all that he’s said, more often it’s with the way he says something.”Gulati said the search for Arena’s successor will not be restricted to someone who “holds a U.S. passport or resides in the U.S.” but added that the next coach would need “some knowledge of American soccer, experience, leadership a track record of success.” It was an obvious reference to Jürgen Klinsmann. Klinsmann, who lives in Southern California with his family near the United States training base at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif. Klinsmann took his native Germany to a third-place finish at the World Cup and has been linked with the American job the past several weeks.“I’ve outlined one criteria, which is someone with experience and a track record, someone’s whose a good coach,” Gulati said. “Someone to qualify the team and provide leadership. Does Klinsmann fit? He probably does. He’s got a much better handle on the American soccer scene than some others and he’s a very inquisitive guy. He’s an intelligent, multilingual guy with a lot of very positive qualities.”Having said that, Gulati added that he has not discussed the position with Klinsmann and certainly has not offered him the job. In addition to Klinsmann, other possible candidates include Peter Nowak, the Polish coach of D.C. United; Bob Bradley, a former assistant to Arena at D.C. United who is now the coach of Chivas USA; and Sigi Schmid, the coach of the Columbus Crew. Hiring a coach from overseas is more problematic, Gulati said.“We don’t have the same soccer environment as other countries,” Gulati said. “But it’s a different environment here than four years ago, and it’s getting better. There are a lot of plusses and if someone wants a challenge they can help us continue our growth. I have a pretty healthy Rolodex.”Gulati said the federation planned a number of national team games between now and the end of the year and that Arena would be welcome to stay on the sideline with the national team as long as he did not accept a new job.“Now it is a matter of trying to build on what Bruce has done and add something different,” Gulati said. “Maybe a face from M.L.S.”'"
"'06-07-14,'0','While $80-a-barrel oil seemed like a skeptic’s worst-case scenario a few months ago, oil traders are increasingly saying that it is now just a matter of time before prices cross that threshold. Oil futures contracts for delivery beyond this summer passed $80 a barrel for the first time on Thursday.“The feeling is that we’re in a fairly bullish market right now,” said Antoine Halff, head of research at Fimat. “Gas demand over the last few weeks has been very robust. Perhaps the bigger issue on top of that is geopolitics. And clearly the market is very jittery about what’s going on in Israel.”Oil markets are typically sensitive to any political instability in the Middle East. Recently, they have been unsettled by Israeli military incursions into Gaza and then, this week, Lebanon. But in this case, a market already worried about the potential for conflict with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs is growing even more anxious.William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics, said, “People are scared, that’s the bottom line.”Analysts said that in such a tense environment, events that typically would be overlooked are scrutinized, resulting in the type of market reaction seen after reports today indicated surprisingly weak retail sales and lowered consumer confidence.The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in June, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the first drop since February. Taken with a University of Michigan survey that showed falling consumer confidence, the reports were seen as signs that consumers are growing weary.“In another week, those reports would not have been as destructive to the market,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.How resilient consumer spending proves to be is something that will continue to factor heavily into stock performance. Most economists believe that consumers will curb their spending somewhat as the year goes on, and economic growth is expected to slow. But there is disagreement over how much spending will slow.“The persistence of high gasoline prices, coupled with lower equity prices and lower consumer sentiment, will restrain the growth of real consumer spending in the second half of 2006,” Brian Bethune, an analyst with Global Insight, wrote today in a report about the retail sales numbers.But many analysts noted that the month’s decline in retail sales was exaggerated by poor auto sales, and said consumers are likely to keep shopping for other goods.“We do not think that consumer spending growth is going to fall off of a cliff, as there ought to be support derived by gains in wages and salaries owing to job growth.” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR Inc.Two indicators of market volatility — bond prices and gold prices — pointed today toward renewed nervousness. Gold, a safe-haven investment, gained. Bond prices also went up.Even though the market swooned this week, analysts said that there are no signs yet that the drop was part of a larger unraveling of the economy.“The fundamentals of this market are still O.K.,” Mr. Paulsen said. “The decline is not universal. It’s not like stock prices are falling, bond yields are collapsing, commodities prices are collapsing. The stock market looks recessionary, but the commodities market looks like it’s expanding.”Mr. Rhodes said that with so much bad news clouding the market, “It’s very, very difficult to find out what the real underlying trend is.” He went on, “And the longer this goes on, the more difficult it is to find out what’s real happening underneath.”'"
"'06-07-14,'0','Along with this victory over terrorism comes the defeat of inflation. Prices have stopped rising, says Gazeta, and inflation has frozen at about 7 to 8 percent. There is no need to spoil this victory, the newspaper says, by noting that the decline was coincidental.Gazeta also points out that the Russian gas giant, Gazprom, a major figure in the upcoming summit, has already achieved all that it wanted and more. Russia is now left to press its main task of becoming a leader in world energy supply and production, while the west is looking to avoid dependence on Gazprom and Rosneft.Russia can count as a further victory, Izvestia says, the fact that the summit is being held at all. It says that up to the last minute, opponents of Russia’s G8 chairmanship have been attempting to sabotage this weekend’s summit. A wave of criticism disparaging Russia as unworthy increased ten-fold in the run-up to the event. The one thing these challengers of a strong Russia have achieved is the strengthening of Kremlin arguments for the assertion of its righteousness internal and external politics, the paper says. In the words of one high placed Moscow official, the Kremlin and its critics “are completely different. We are better and we now know that.”Izvestia continues, saying that one of Russia’s main tasks at the summit is to show that Russia is open to the world. This is why, the newspaper contends, Moscow has seen a proliferation of mini-summits: meetings with religious leaders and workers union representatives, ministers of foreign affairs, prosecutors and nongovernmental organizations. In each of these meetings, Mr. Putin took recommendations and listened to criticism, which he has used in the preparations for the summit, the paper said.THERE IS NO ‘OTHER RUSSIA’ ON STATE TV: None of the major, state-run television networks broadcasted coverage of the “Other Russia” conference held in Moscow this week. “We have very strong competition between broadcast materials,” explained Channel One Deputy General Director, Kirill Kleimenov. “We have more topical, rich and interesting subjects than the “Other Russia” forum. Journalists from NTV said that the station’s general director ordered a boycott of the conference. The editor of the news channel Vesti 24, Dmitri Mednikov, was quoted as saying “we don’t think the forum...is an important enough political event to justify in depth coverage.”CIVILIAN DOCTOR GIVES THE ARMY HIS DIAGNOSIS: Renat Talipov, a surgeon at the Chelyabinsk city hospital, gave testimony at the trial of Sgt. Aleksandr Sibyakov, accused of harassing Pvt. Andre Sychev, who had his legs and genitals amputated as a result of hazing in his army unit. Mr. Talipov testified that Private Sychev’s condition was diagnosed as a dry gangrene infection resulting from “positioned compression.” This is contrary to the military doctor’s diagnosis of a blood vessel irritation. The military doctor likewise failed to notice the three to four millimeter fractures in the Private’s femur bone, Mr. Talipov said. Mr. Talipov’s testimony is a victory for the prosecution after having to dismiss nine witnesses from Private Sychev’s unit in Chelyabinsk. The nine soldiers refused to testify against the defendant because they claim the military pressured them not to. According to Kommersant, the Ministry of Defense claims there were no beatings and the amputations were a result of a previous illness. Private Sychev’s mother claims she was offered money to withhold evidence that her son was beaten.TRANSNISTRIA’S FUTURE IN QUESTION: Transnistria, a separatist region of Moldova, will hold a referendum on Sept. 17 to decide on possible unification with the Russian Federation. The leader of the region, Igor Smirnov, informed deputies in the supreme council that the authorities have held “initial discussions on the question of a plebiscite with officials from Moscow.’’ Experts argue, however, that Transnistria’s future depends more on the situation in Ukraine than on a referendum. A member of the Ukrainian parliament, Taras Chernovil, said that as soon as his Party of Regions normalizes the political situation in Ukraine, it will push for a repeal of the Ukrainian blockade of Transnistria.INDUSTRIALIST URGES ENERGY COOPERATION: In an article published today, Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire industrialist and president of Renova, speaks out about Russia’s role in energy security ahead of the Group of 8 Summit. Russia’s “leading role” in supplying energy resources to the global market is undeniable, he writes. Russia and Europe are “natural partners” and issues arising from agreements with China should not worry European leaders. He encourages agreements not just between corporations, but also between governments on issues of energy security. Increasing state control over its energy resources is a “natural process,” one that needs to avoid creating “monopolistic positions” in the market. He concludes by calling for cooperation of “participants on all levels” both in individual projects and international agreements.“Russia will not allow harm to come not only to its peacekeepers located in South Ossetia, but also to the local population,” the Minister of Defense, Sergei B. Ivanov, told reporters Thursday. During a visit to the 20th infantry division based in Volgograd, he reminded reporters that 90 percent of South Ossetians are citizens of Russia. These remarks come during a period of tension over Russian peacekeepers in the separatist region of Georgia and allegations by the Georgian government of Russian interventionism in what they consider an internal affair. Mr. Ivanov’s assertions are of interest in light of today’s bomb attack in Tskhinvali, capital of the breakaway province of South Ossetia, and renewed calls by Georgia for Russia to remove their peacekeepers from South Ossetia and Abkhazia.'"

California’s 1967 privacy statute requires callers in another state to obtain permission to tape calls with residents, even when the other state allows callers to record the conversation secretly, the court said.

"'06-07-14,'0','In Beirut’s Shiite-dominated southern suburbs, where residents handed out sweets to celebrate the seizures of the Israeli soldiers on Wednesday, residents supported Hezbollah, a Shiite group with close ties to Iran, and insisted that they were ready to sacrifice for the cause. Many pledged their allegiance to Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader. “If things did not escalate to this, nothing would ever be solved,” said Rania al-Faris as she waited for a bus.But in many other parts of the city, many expressed indignation at having to pay for what they saw as a ruinous escapade. “I’m not anxious because I guess I am just used to war,” admitted Sirine Ahmad, 47, as she stocked up on supplies in the religiously mixed Hamra section. “But this time I feel bitterness, anger and rage because Hezbollah does not have the right to decide to take us back into war.”The crisis has underscored the weakness of the government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, who for the past year has struggled to build legitimacy and focus the country inward, hoping to settle growing sectarian squabbles and improve the Lebanese economy.Israel has long demanded that the Lebanese government disarm Hezbollah, in keeping with a United Nations resolution. But Hezbollah is a powerful force in Lebanon. Two members are part of the Lebanese cabinet, and Hezbollah effectively controls parts of southern Lebanon. Instead of outright confrontation with Hezbollah, Mr. Siniora has tried to goad the group into aligning its agenda with the government’s. For the past several months, he has held what he called a national dialogue to try to find a way to come to a settlement on Hezbollah’s weapons.But Hezbollah’s attack, and Israel’s response, underline the tensions tearing at Lebanon — a consuming hatred of Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon for 18 years, gratitude to Hezbollah, which drove Israel out, and fear of being plunged into chaos again.“You can bet that non-Shiites probably hate Hezbollah now,” said Amal Saad Ghorayeb, professor of political science at Lebanese American University and an expert on Hezbollah. “But those same people have also been reminded that Israel is the enemy.”Timur Goksel, a lecturer at Lebanese American University and a former senior United Nations official in southern Lebanon, said: “The cost of this is high and will continue to get higher. But the highest cost in the end will be in explaining to the Lebanese why this incident occurred.”Lebanese are also bracing for the economic toll of the fighting. The civil war ravaged Beirut and other parts of the country, but Lebanon invested tens of billions of dollars in a new downtown. Arab tourists, feeling unwelcome in Europe and the United States after the 9/11 attacks, have flocked to Beirut in recent years. Now they are fleeing.Joseph Khouri, a cabdriver, stood before a scrum of Saudi tourists boarding buses bound for Damascus.He was proud of Hezbollah’s strike against Israel, he said. But he also realized there would be a price. Tourism contributes up to $4 billion of Lebanon’s $23 billion gross domestic product, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. “Do all these people deserve this?” Mr. Khouri said as he helped load his clients’ bags on the bus. “If they wanted to get the kidnappers, why didn’t they just focus on the kidnappers, not the innocent people?”The land border with Syria, the sole exit from the country, was backed up for miles by midday. Many Westerners, for whom Syrian visas have become much more difficult to get, were stranded in hotels.“This is terrifying,” said Abdullah al-Sudairi, a Saudi tourist who cut short his vacation and boarded a bus to Damascus. “I mean it’s a resort, not a war zone.” Perhaps, he said, he would come back, but not for a while.After the lessons of Lebanon’s past, this siege was an especially unnecessary one, some said. “I have never been as scared in my whole life as I am now,” Mona Karaoui, 24, said. “No one wants to resist against anyone. We just want to live a normal life after all these years of wars and death and misery.”By nightfall, Beirut had grown quiet as the panic buying ended. Residents stayed home, bracing for worse news to come.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','The New York City Housing Authority, which has 140,000 families on its waiting list, allowed more than 2,100 apartments to sit empty for an average of more than three years while it planned and carried out major renovations, according to an audit released yesterday by the city comptroller.The audit, which looked at vacancies due to recent large-scale renovations in six of the authority’s 344 developments, found that more than a quarter of the vacancies necessitated by the renovations were off the rent rolls for more than five years. The authority, which is trying to close an operating deficit of $168 million, could have collected an additional $4 million in rent if it had cut the average time the apartments remained empty by just 20 percent, the audit said.“Keeping apartments vacant longer than absolutely necessary deprives New Yorkers of desperately needed housing and deprives the city of rental revenue,” William C. Thompson Jr., the comptroller, said in a statement. His office recommended that the housing authority establish “time budgets” for its major renovation projects and better coordinate building renovations with tenant relocation.Authority officials attributed the long vacancies to the extensiveness of the renovations needed in the buildings, many of them 40 to 60 years old; the lengthy process of designing renovation work, taking bids for it and completing the job, while meeting government procurement requirements; and the authority’s efforts to respect tenants’ wishes to be relocated within their own complexes, where only a few dozen apartments may become vacant in a year.The officials said the number of vacant apartments dropped by 30 percent over the past two years because of efforts to make renovations more efficient and more careful selection of apartments to be vacated.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','“Another day, another record,” said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst with BNP Paribas in New York.While many energy analysts have floated the idea of $80 a barrel for crude oil for some time, yesterday’s rally reinforced expectations that oil prices would continue to climb.“You see a market that can move $2 in a day, why couldn’t we go well above $80 a barrel?” Mr. Bentz said.Even before American markets opened yesterday, the major stock indexes in Europe and Asia had fallen, reacting to news that clashes between Israel and Hezbollah guerrilla fighters in Lebanon had escalated.Oil prices spiked in Europe as stocks fell — a pattern that repeated itself in the United States once trading began.In the American stock market, some of the sharpest losses over the last two days have been concentrated among technology stocks. Dell, where revenue from personal computers has dropped considerably, closed yesterday at the lowest level since October 2001. Its shares lost 3 percent, to $21.70.Shares of the German software giant SAP lost nearly 7 percent, to close at $46.83, after it reported a loss of market share in the second quarter. In the Nasdaq 100, a closely watched index containing the stocks of many of the largest technology companies, only eight stocks are up over the last two days.Analysts said disappointing second-quarter earnings — particularly among technology companies — were adding to investor dismay.“We have had a few straws in the earnings-season wind which have made people weary,” said Chris Tinker, European equity strategist at ICAP in London. “And with TV pictures every five seconds with exploding buildings in the Middle East, instability in Iran and the level of oil prices, everybody is going to be erring on the side of staying away from tech.”Since the beginning of May, technology stocks in the S.& P. 500 have lost about 13 percent of their value.Still, the sell-off yesterday went beyond technology. The S.& P. 500 index fell 16.31 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,242.29. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 166.89, or 1.5 percent, to 10,846.29. Only 3 of its 30 components — Exxon Mobil, Merck and Home Depot — gained. And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite fell to its lowest point since October, sliding 1.7 percent, to 2,054.11.In Europe, the major indexes in Britain, France and Germany all lost more than 1.5 percent. The Nikkei index in Tokyo fell 1.8 percent.Rapidly rising oil prices — and the geopolitical instability that is feeding their volatility — are making investors all the more sensitive to corporate earnings even if the earnings are not all that disappointing.Alcoa, for example, said late Monday that its second-quarter sales grew 62 percent. But earnings per share missed Wall Street’s consensus estimate by a penny and Alcoa’s stock has fallen about 5 percent.In another sign of the increasing wariness among investors, gold prices rose today as they typically do in periods of market volatility when investors are looking for more stable investments. Bond prices also rose.“People are more willing to take risk if they feel there’s a clear direction,” Mr. Tinker said. “And we need to see confirmation from the earnings season giving us that direction before we see money being committed.”Here are the results of yesterday’s auction of 10-year inflation notes:'"
"'06-07-14,'0','TEHRAN, July 13 — Human rights advocates in Iran and abroad are increasing their pressure on the Iranian government over a crackdown in recent months on human rights advocates and other protesters.The advocates held a news conference in Tehran on Tuesday to condemn large numbers of detentions in the past year. Separately, students in Iran and groups of Iranians abroad have announced a three-day hunger strike, to begin on Friday, to draw attention to what they said was President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s policies “that are reminiscent of some of the darkest days of the Islamic Republic.”The call for a hunger strike was initiated by Akbar Ganji, a rights advocate who was released in March after being imprisoned for five years and who is in the United States. The group’s statement, on free-political-prisoners.net, said students in New York and Toronto would participate.The group also criticized the government for using the police to break up protests by such diverse groups as bus drivers seeking a raise, advocates of women’s rights and Sufis protesting government order in February to evacuate their place of worship on a legal technicality that they said was a pretext to keep them from practicing their kind of Islam.“In such an atmosphere, Iran’s democracy movement calls for the unity and support of people of conscience from around the world,” said the statement of the people in New York and Toronto calling for a hunger strike.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','That perception was reinforced, Mr. Scruggs said in an interview, by agents who suggested to customers like Dr. Hinman that they did not need to buy the separate coverage for flood damage that is provided by the federal government and sold through agents.“They thought they had all they needed,’’ Mr. Scruggs said.Representing Nationwide, Daniel F. Attridge, a lawyer for the Chicago firm of Kirkland & Ellis, argued in court that the company’s home insurance policy was unambiguous in its exclusion of flood damage.For wind damage alone from Hurricane Katrina, the insurers are paying more than $30 billion and the federal government expects to pay another $25 billion to those homeowners in the region who bought separate flood insurance policies.Katrina is already the most costly hurricane ever. But tens of thousands of residents who lost their homes have been left without money to rebuild because the insurers say most of the storm damage came from flooding rather than high winds. Many homeowners are applying for federal grants.The lawsuit against Nationwide is unfolding before Federal Judge L. T. Senter Jr. of the Southern District of Mississippi in a city still crippled from the storm. Its downtown is filled with patched-up buildings, many of them empty. Many streetlights and phones are still not working. Piles of rubble rise two stories high along some side streets.The new concrete and glass federal courthouse was also damaged by the hurricane and has yet to reopen fully.Many homeowners have complained that they received less than they expected for wind damage because they were told by their insurers that they were entitled to receive payments only for damage to roofs and other parts of their house above the highest water stains on their walls.Mr. Scruggs addressed that issue on Wednesday by leading a private meteorologist, Rocco Calaci, through a detailed accounting of the movement of wind and waves along the Mississippi on Aug. 29, 2005, as Hurricane Katrina struck.According to Mr. Calaci’s testimony, hurricane-force winds battered the coast for hours before water rushed over the land, knocking down houses and trees. High winds, he said, continued for several more hours after the water had receded.Several people who rode out the storm in their homes testified earlier that, in their neighborhoods near the Alabama border, the water rose slowly and gradually to more than five feet in their homes.That was in contrast to the sudden surge of water, three stories high, that smashed across the beach around Bay St. Louis and Waveland to the west, at the Louisiana border.But all along the Mississippi coast, residents say, their homes suffered heavy wind damage long before the water began to rise.Testimony in the trial began Monday and may continue into next week. By agreement of both parties, Judge Senter is serving as judge and jury.The lawsuit pits Nationwide against a couple from Pascagoula, Paul Leonard, a police lieutenant, and his wife, Julie, who runs a child care business. They estimated their modest two-story house suffered $130,000 in damage that Nationwide says was mostly from floodwater.The Leonards’ lawyers estimate that $72,000 of the damage came from wind. But they say the insurance company is obliged to pay the whole $130,000. The Leonards’ lost another $28,000 in furnishings and clothing, they said. The insurance company has so far paid them $1,600 to account for the loss of a few roof shingles and at least one broken window.The Leonards’ lawsuit is the first to go trial in a dispute that may eventually involve thousands of plaintiffs and dozens of lawyers.Mr. Scruggs — who is arguing the case with his son Zach; a colleague from northern Mississippi, Don Barrett; and John Jones from Jackson, Miss. — said he had already filed suit on behalf of about 2,000 clients seeking redress from their insurers, including Senator Trent Lott, who is both a neighbor of Mr. Scruggs in Pascagoula and his brother-in-law; and Representative Gene Taylor of Bay St. Louis.Many of those attending the trial are lawyers for other clients and they are taking detailed notes.Mr. Scruggs, whose waterfront home was heavily damaged by Katrina, said he chose to pursue the claims individually or, perhaps eventually in groups, rather than as a class action mainly because it could take years to receive court certification for a class action. “Time is of essence,’’ Mr. Scruggs said in the interview. “These people need the insurance money to rebuild.’’Dr. Hinman, who lives near Mr. Leonard, testified that he received nearly $137,000 from Nationwide shortly before the trial.Joe Case, a spokesman for Nationwide, said the company decided to resolve Dr. Hinman’s complaint that he had been misled by adjusting his claim as if he had bought flood insurance. But Mr. Case said the company continued to dispute that others had been treated unfairly.Testifying as the first witness on Monday, Mr. Leonard said he asked his Nationwide agent, Jay Fletcher, whether he needed flood insurance shortly after Hurricane Georges in 1998.“He told me I didn’t need it,’’ Mr. Leonard told the court. The two men did not discuss the issue again, and part of Nationwide’s defense in the lawsuit is that the statute of limitations has run out for Mr. Leonard.In an interview, Mr. Scruggs said that advice provided by the insurance agent, who is not a defendant in the lawsuit, amounted to an expansion of the home insurance contract, and signaled to Mr. Leonard and other customers that nothing more than the homeowners’ policy was needed for hurricane protection.Mr. Attridge, the lawyer representing Nationwide, said Mr. Fletcher was not authorized to expand the coverage, and Mr. Fletcher never explicitly told clients that their policies would protect them from hurricane flooding.Lawyers for Nationwide also acknowledged that Mr. Fletcher himself had not bought flood insurance. By the time of Katrina, the lawyers said, Mr. Fletcher had sold flood insurance to 180 of his 1,200 Nationwide home insurance customers. Along the Mississippi coast, fewer than 20 percent of all homeowners bought flood insurance and many now say they thought their home insurance policies would cover any kind of hurricane damage.Mr. Case, the spokesman for Nationwide, said the lawyers for hurricane victims were “trying to muddy the waters with a great deal of information.’’He added, “We hope the court will find Nationwide acted appropriately.’’'"
"'06-07-14,'0','“Foreigners looking at it from the outside say that López Obrador is making a lot of noise but why should I worry?” said Jonathan Heath, chief economist for HSBC Mexico. “The part that is consolidated is macroeconomic stability. That’s helping us not to feel the contagion effect from the politics.”Still, while Mexico may have solid economic numbers, several analysts are warning that the country can no longer afford the legislative gridlock that has bedeviled President Vicente Fox.The short-term outlook “really pales in comparison to the challenges facing Mexico in the medium term,” said Gray Newman, Latin America economist for Morgan Stanley.High oil prices and a strong American economy whose consumers buy Mexican imports now work in Mexico’s favor. And yet the economy is likely to grow just 4 or 4.5 percent this year — far too slow for a developing country where almost half the population lives in poverty.“They should be growing at a much faster rate,” said Joydeep Mukherji, a sovereign-debt analyst at Standard & Poor’s in New York.Without stronger growth to create new jobs and raise wages, Mexicans will continue to migrate to the United States in search of work.So, the next president will need considerable political skill to overhaul Mexico’s tax, energy and labor laws, measures that economists say Mexico needs to bolster its competitiveness and assure growth in less favorable conditions.Mr. Calderón has said that he believes that he will be able to form alliances in Mexico’s Congress and is talking about including opposition party members in his cabinet. But because he won barely 36 percent of the vote, it is not clear how much he will be able to do.Mr. Newman argued that Mexico’s political class suffers from a complacency caused by what he calls the “curse of abundance,” which takes the pressure off passing hard reforms.“The stronger the inflows, the less progress we have on reforms,” he said. “The market was concerned for a while that Mexico would face some kind of crisis and asked would it withstand a negative shock.“It has learned how to withstand negative shocks,” Mr. Newman added. “But how do you withstand the positive shocks of workers’ remittances, strong direct foreign investment, strong tourism and strong oil?”Ricardo Amorim, the head of Latin America strategy for WestLB, a German bank, said he believed that Mr. Calderón would be able to sell some kind of tax overhaul. But he was more skeptical that Congress would do much about energy legislation, which he sees as an even more urgent task.“With the lack of structural reforms, Mexico has lost its competitiveness,” Mr. Amorim said. “Given that, I don’t think there will be much advance in terms of structural reforms. I don’t think much is going to change.”Mr. Mukherji argued that many investors had missed the fact that “Mexico’s biggest political party is a conservative party.”Still, he, too, was unwilling to predict much progress. “We should be very open-minded about what happens in 2007 onward.”'"
"'06-07-14,'0','DETROIT, July 13 — Ford Motor said Thursday that it would cut its dividend in half amid growing concern that its North American overhaul plan is not moving swiftly enough.Robert Schultz, an analyst with Standard & Poor’s in New York, called the actions “indicative of the massive challenges facing Ford.”General Motors, which lost $10.6 billion last year, halved its dividend in February, under pressure from its biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian. But Ford, which was profitable last year despite a loss on its North American operations, has not faced the same kind of pressure. A dividend cut was not part of Ford’s overhaul plan when it was introduced in January.But lately, analysts have questioned Ford’s progress. Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered Ford’s debt rating deeper into junk status last month, the third such action in a little over a year.Cutting its quarterly dividend to 5 cents a share from 10 cents is expected to save Ford $376 million a year. Ford last cut its dividend in January 2002, when it announced its first overhaul plan.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','Mr. Lockyer, who is taking a lead role in the multistate lawsuit, said the end users — the consumers — might have overpaid for the memory chips by hundreds of millions of dollars because of the price fixing. The case involves dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, which are commonly used in personal computers, printers and electronics devices like cellphones and digital cameras.The chip companies expected to be named in the multistate suit include Infineon Technologies, Hynix Semiconductor, Micron Technology, Mosel Vitelic, Nanya Technology, Elpida Memory and NEC Electronics America.Samsung, the world’s largest maker of memory chips, was excluded from the suit to “foster a potential settlement,” Mr. Lockyer said.Illinois is acting as a co-leader in the suit, which involves 34 states, including Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Mr. Schwartz said New York filed a separate suit in large part because the state and city governments were direct buyers of memory chips. He said it was possible the suits would be combined.The computer makers that bought the chips include Apple Computer, Dell, Gateway, I.B.M., Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computer, which merged with Hewlett-Packard in 2002.The civil lawsuit grew out of criminal case brought by the Justice Department in 2002 charging Hynix, Samsung, Infineon and Elpida of conspiring to fix prices of DRAM chips. In that case, Micron agreed to cooperate with investigators in exchange for amnesty from criminal charges, while Samsung, Hynix, Infineon, Elpida and 12 chip company executives pleaded guilty to price fixing. Collectively, the companies and individuals paid more than $730 million in fines and several executives received prison sentences.In November 2005, Samsung agreed to a $300 million fine and three executives pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison.Dan Francisco, a spokesman for Micron in Boise, Idaho, said that while the company had not yet received a copy of the lawsuit, it had been cooperating with investigators for the states for some time.A spokesman for Infineon said the company could not comment because executives had not seen the lawsuit.A statement released Thursday by Mr. Lockyer’s office said the complaint detailed specific meetings between rival executives in which they had agreed to reduce chip supplies to artificially raise prices.“The manufacturers did not limit this pricing coordination to isolated or occasional conversations,” a statement from Mr. Lockyer’s office says. “On the contrary, during a roughly four-year period, there were frequent pricing communications among the conspiring manufacturers,” many of them intensifying in the days just before the companies submitted bids to their customers, the PC makers.“I’ve never seen a case where there was so widespread and so regular price fixing among competitors,” said Richard Schwartz, assistant attorney general for antitrust issues in the New York attorney general’s office.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','In a victory for Merck, a jury in New Jersey ruled yesterday that the painkiller Vioxx was not a cause of a 68-year-old woman’s heart attack.The jurors, in Superior Court in Atlantic City, found that Vioxx did not contribute to the heart attack that the woman, Elaine Doherty, suffered in 2004. They also ruled that Merck had warned Ms. Doherty’s doctor of the drug’s risk and did not defraud consumers. The company lost one part of the ruling when jurors held that Merck did not warn Ms. Doherty herself about the drug.Merck has won two earlier trials, with a split verdict in a third. It has lost three Vioxx cases, with verdicts totaling $298 million — damages that will be reduced to $48 million because of limits on state punitive awards. The company potentially faces more than 10,000 lawsuits related to Vioxx. It has allocated almost $1 billion to defend itself, pledging to fight each case.“This really reinforces our strategy of trying every case,” said James C. Fitzpatrick of the law firm of Hughes Hubbard & Reed, who represented Merck. “We made the appropriate safety disclosures to doctors, and we demonstrated that Vioxx did not cause Mrs. Doherty’s heart attack.”Some analysts said that Merck would eventually have to reach a global settlement. The verdict yesterday will help any such effort, said Stephen G. Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities. “The thing shareholders fear the most is there is no settlement that is financially suitable for Merck,” he said. “Every time they are able to win in court, that settlement price goes down.”Merck withdrew Vioxx in September 2004 after a study showed it doubled the risk of heart attacks in people taking it for 18 months. The company attributed Ms. Doherty’s heart attack to her age, weight, diabetes, cholesterol, blood pressure and clogged arteries. Ms. Doherty, who is 5 feet 3 inches, once weighed 265 pounds and has long been a diabetic.A juror, Joseph Calabrese, told reporters, “We simply believed that the risk factors were too insurmountable.” The jury decided the case in its second day of deliberations.'"

"'06-07-14,'0','ROBERT PATCHELL and the Town of Riverhead agree that the 2.6 undeveloped acres that Mr. Patchell owns on the Peconic Bay in South Jamesport are valuable. What they cannot agree on is how valuable.The town would like to buy the land, one of the last remaining parcels of undeveloped waterfront property on the bay in this hamlet. Mr. Patchell, who owns the Motel on the Bay and the Bayview Inn and Restaurant next to the site, says he is willing to sell it. But he has rejected an offer from the town of a little more than $1 million, saying the land is worth closer to $2.8 million.The town’s offer came with perks; Mr. Patchell would have had free use of a parking lot the town plans for beachgoers, a considerable value because some residents have complained about Mr. Patchell’s patrons parking on nearby streets.But Mr. Patchell said, “They’re trying to steal it, not buy it from me.”Mr. Patchell said he spent about $400,000 on the property when he bought it in 1996, and he has proposed several plans, including a condominium development and a restaurant. All have been turned down either for zoning reasons by the town, which rezoned the area east of Route 105 for only single-family development on two-acre lots soon after Mr. Patchell’s purchase, or by the Board of Health because of insufficient sewage facilities.If he and the town are not able to agree on a purchase price, Mr. Patchell said he would seek a private buyer or he might build a house on the land and try to sell it.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','One such case now pending concerns an audit where auditors were almost the only protection available — hedge funds. It stems from the discovery in 2002 that the Lipper Convertibles hedge fund had for years overstated the value of its portfolios — an overstatement that was admitted by the portfolio manager as he pleaded guilty to fraud charges in federal court in 2004.All those values were duly certified for years by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is being sued by the liquidating trustee of the fund. The trustee’s accountants concluded that by the 2000 audit — the last one done — the value of the fund’s securities was overstated by 45 percent, allowing what were really large losses to appear to be profits.The overstatements began in 1995 and then grew. But a lower court ruled that the auditing firm could not be sued for the years before 2000 because the audits were more than three years old when the suit was filed.An appeals court, in a 3-to-2 decision, has now overturned that, saying that the plaintiffs could seek to prove a continuing relationship between the auditor and the fund, not just a series of one-year audit contracts. The dissenting judges argue that the decision flies in the face of precedent, but for now it is the law in Manhattan, the financial capital of the country.PricewaterhouseCoopers maintains that its audits were proper and says it expects to prevail in court. But if it eventually loses the case, the ruling would appear to open it to greater damages. Perhaps of more importance, the appellate court ruling provides another incentive for auditing firms to be vigilant even when the amounts involved are small.It is fitting that the decision came in a hedge fund case, because hedge fund investors have few other protections if the audit fails. Such funds are designed to escape regulation, and they often dominate unregulated and illiquid markets in derivative securities whose values can be elusive.A federal appeals court has ruled that the S.E.C. cannot force hedge funds to register and submit to federal inspections of their books, making this issue more urgent than ever. It is not, however, a new issue. It was 13 years ago that Stanley Sporkin, then a federal judge and previously a director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission, warned that the pricing of derivatives “is going to blow up in somebody’s face one of these days.”It is at least conceivable that his warning played a role in the new ruling. Mr. Sporkin was speaking at Baruch College in New York, delivering the Emanuel Saxe Distinguished Lecture in Accounting, named for a former Baruch dean. In the speech, he paid tribute to Abraham Briloff, a Baruch professor and critic of accounting firms, who calls the late dean “my beloved mentor.”Saxe was more than a mentor to the judge who wrote the appeals court decision. That judge, David A. Saxe, is his son.'"
"'06-07-14,'0','For now, it is Ms. Colon who is doing the suing.She is one of eight parents — along with a citywide parent association — who filed a lawsuit yesterday against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein and the city’s Department of Education, seeking to overturn the city’s rule banning students from carrying cellphones in schools.The parents argue, in papers filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that the ban is so broad and blunt that it violates their constitutional right as parents to keep their children safe and to raise them in the way they see fit.The ban violates their due process right to personal liberty under both the state and federal constitutions, they said, because it interferes with the relationship between parents and their children, without a compelling education reason for doing so.The constitutional claim echoes arguments raised more than a decade ago by parents who sought to overturn a policy by Chancellor Joseph Fernandez of providing condoms to public school students. In 1993, a state appellate court upheld the parents’ right to decide whether their children should receive condoms.Chancellor Klein and Mayor Bloomberg declined to comment on the suit yesterday. But a spokesman for Mr. Klein, Keith Kalb, sent an e-mail message saying that the chancellor stood by the cellphone policy.“It is our experience that when cellphones are brought into schools, they are used and disrupt the school’s learning environment,” Mr. Kalb wrote. “There is no constitutional right to disrupt a student’s education.”From the end of April to the end of school in June, police confiscated more than 3,000 cellphones in random searches at schoolhouse doors, and principals confiscated many more on their own.Norman Siegel, a civil liberties lawyer who has taken on the lawsuit free of charge along with David Leichtman, a partner in the law firm of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said yesterday that he was not arguing that children should be able to use their phones during school hours, only before and after.At a news conference announcing the suit in Lower Manhattan yesterday, the parents came to the microphone one after the other to tell his or her own cellphone horror story, sounding like Soviet dissidents resisting an oppressive regime.Maybe it is true, as education officials contend, that students have used cellphones to take pictures in locker rooms and cheat on exams, Ms. Colon said yesterday.“How far would this city go if we punished the majority for the crimes of a few?” said Ms. Colon, who is also the president of the Association of New York City Education Councils.Isaac Carmignani, who works nights as an electronic technician for the Postal Service, said his only child, Raven, was stranded outside her locked school alone last fall when he was late to pick her up.Raven, 9, who just finished fourth grade at P.S. 122 in Astoria, Queens, had a cellphone and was able to call her father on his cellphone. Since then, he will not let her leave home without putting the phone in her backpack. “I tell her not to take it out during school, not to show it to anyone,” he said yesterday.Carmella Price, a single mother in the Bronx, said her youngest daughter, Lashea, 12, had been threatened by a group of boys on the way home from school and was able to call her sister, Charlene, 14, for help.“This is a safety issue,” Ms. Price said. “It’s not during school. It’s for before and after school.”'"

"'06-07-15,'0','The doctor said he was solely responsible for counting out dosage amounts of the three drugs administered in sequence, knew of no written protocol by the state for carrying out executions and was at times “improvising.”He also said he is dyslexic, sometimes mixing up phone numbers or cable bill account numbers. “So it’s not unusual for me to make mistakes,” the doctor, identified in court records as John Doe I, said.He indicated in his testimony, however, that he had made no mistakes in his death chamber work and that the mistakes elsewhere were “not medically crucial.”Judge Gaitan said he was “gravely concerned” about the doctor’s dyslexia and criticized the lack of “checks and balances,” ruling on June 26 that the state was subjecting the condemned to “an unnecessary risk that they will be subject to unconstitutional pain and suffering when the lethal injection drugs are administered.”The judge ordered Missouri to hire a board-certified anesthesiologist (John Doe I is a surgeon), and gave the state until today to submit a formal, written set of procedures, including increased monitoring of inmates and an assurance of sufficient anesthetic drugs.But in the state’s filing last night, officials said they had sent letters to 298 certified anesthesiologists who reside anywhere near the state’s death chamber in Bonne Terre, and were turned down by all of them.“A requirement of using a board-certified anesthesiologist is a requirement that cannot presently be met,” Attorney General Jeremiah W. Nixon wrote. “To enforce it may effectively bar implementation of the death penalty in Missouri. Surely that is not what the court intended.”It was uncertain whether the judge, who could not be reached late last night, would accept the state’s alternative: Missouri officials said they would instead use “medical personnel in roles appropriate,” like a physician, nurse or pharmacist preparing the drugs.It was unclear from the filing whether the state intended to retain John Doe I. The American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American Medical Association say physicians should not take part in executions, and Orin F. Guidry, the president of the A.S.A., recently issued a letter to members reiterating that position in light of the Missouri ruling.Missouri has executed 66 people by lethal injection since 1989. The doctor said in the deposition that he had assisted for about a decade.Around the nation, lawyers and advocates on all sides of the debate said they were closely watching developments in Missouri. Judge Gaitan’s ruling was the most specific and sweeping regarding procedures in any state, they said.In April, a federal judge permitted an execution in North Carolina without an anesthesiologist, saying the state could use a brain wave monitor to ensure that the prisoner would be unconscious and unable to feel pain.“This issue is being challenged in all states, but it’s reaching a boiling point in some states and Missouri may be on the cutting edge,” said Richard C. Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a research group that opposes capital punishment.In Arkansas, a federal judge delayed an execution that had been set for July 5 to allow time to review that state’s lethal injection procedures and chemical combinations.In Ohio, corrections officials presented Gov. Bob Taft with changes to the state’s procedures, after Joseph L. Clark’s execution this year, when workers struggled for 90 minutes to find a suitable vein for the lethal drugs, and in preparation for another execution, the first in the country since the Supreme Court ruling. The new procedures were used Wednesday for the first time on another man, Rocky Barton, and corrections officials there said the execution took place “without complications.”In January, on the eve of the scheduled execution of Michael A. Taylor, a Missouri man who pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder and rape of a 15-year-old girl in 1989, Judge Gaitan had ruled that the state’s method of execution did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment. That execution was later halted by an appeals court, which remanded it to Judge Gaitan for further hearings.Like most states that use lethal injection, Missouri requires three drugs in a row: Sodium pentothal, the anesthetic, is administered, followed by pancuronium bromide, which, as a paralytic, prevents movements of the body, and then potassium chloride, which stops the heart.If a person has not received sufficient amounts of the anesthetic, the final drug is likely to be deeply painful, medical experts say, but the paralytic agent may prevent the person from revealing that pain.Initially, Missouri Department of Corrections officials testified that the condemned consistently receive five grams of the anesthetic. But state logs of the most recent six executions revealed that only 2.5 grams had been prepared and used in at least one recent execution.In his deposition, the doctor, John Doe I, defended the use of less than five grams, emphasizing that nearly all people would be fully anesthetized at a far smaller dose and that most other states use only two grams. In addition, the doctor said, he was able to determine whether the anesthesia had taken effect by looking at the inmate’s facial expression.But Judge Gaitan, who viewed a videotape of the execution chamber, questioned whether the doctor could see the inmate’s face at all. On the gurney, the inmate faces away from the darkened room where the doctor is observing through a partly closed window, the judge wrote.In its new policy, submitted last night, Missouri officials said that it would always, in the future, use at least five grams of anesthetic, and have on hand an additional five grams. They also said that a medical worker — a physician, a nurse or a pharmacist, for example — would be positioned to see (either directly or with a mirror) the inmate to be sure he or she was unconscious. And they said that all those involved in an execution would sign an official chemical log to track exactly what happened in each death.In recent weeks, Department of Corrections officials defended the state’s record of executions and said that John Doe I, whose name they would not reveal citing concerns for his security, had received high marks for his work.“The process worked, we think, very professionally and humanely,” said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the department.In his deposition, John Doe I also defended his actions, suggesting he was able to perform his job properly.“But I am dyslexic, and that is the reason why there are inconsistencies in my testimony,” he said. “That’s why there are inconsistencies in what I call drugs. I can make these mistakes, but it’s not medically crucial in the type of work I do as a surgeon.”Still, Mr. Hauswirth said that corrections officials had been unaware that John Doe I was dyslexic or that he had changed dosage amounts for the condemned.Though Mr. Taylor’s scheduled execution was delayed because of legal challenges, the drugs had already been mixed for him. State logs showed they included only 2.5 grams of the anesthetic drug — half of what Missouri officials had said was their policy and now say they will always use.Linda Taylor, the inmate’s mother, who sat at the execution facility all of that day, said she was sickened when she learned that.“We don’t want to lose our son, period,” Ms. Taylor said. “But the fact that the drugs may not be mixed right or that he might be in a lot of pain is too much. I keep wondering about all the guys who have been executed who might have been laying there in pain and couldn’t tell anybody.”Robert Blecker, a professor at New York Law School who supports the death penalty in certain instances, said the constitutional questions being raised about lethal injection were an effort by those opposed to capital punishment to “prevent it, delay it, diminish it.”For those whose cases warrant the death penalty, he said, the notion that no pain should be involved in an execution makes no sense.“We’re giving them a death that we could only wish for,” Professor Blecker said. “I don’t get it.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','The Apostleship of the Sea in the United States, a Catholic port ministry established in 1920, has long ministered to fishermen, dock workers and those on oil rigs, but several years ago it began maintaining a database of suitable priests and making recommendations to cruise lines.Though clerics are usually not paid for their work on board, they are often given free rooms and food. Because of this, said Doreen Babeaux, a spokeswoman for the Apostleship of the Sea in Port Arthur, Tex., people posing as priests are a problem. She said the list of ordained priests, which has run from 600 to 700 depending on the time of year, culls out priests with drinking problems, lest they be tempted in an environment where alcohol tends to flow.“We really want to put our best foot forward,” Mrs. Babeaux said, adding that most of the priests were retired or on sabbatical. One sails on cruises full time, and others take working vacations.The Apostleship does not require priests to wear clerical garb at all times on board, but they do ask them to wear ID badges so passengers have no doubt that they are there in an official capacity.Catholic priests are the most common cleric on board for a number of reasons. They are required for Catholic Mass, but can also conduct interfaith services. In addition, many crew members, some of whom can be on ship for months, are Catholic.Carol Cartmell was a Salvation Army soldier and travel agent with a large Christian clientele when she realized that there was a large unmet demand for cruise clerics. With the Salvation Army’s help, Mrs. Cartmell started a program called Pastors @ Sea that provides ministers for several cruise lines. Like the Apostleship, she charges neither the clerics nor the cruise lines. But booking agents are also getting involved. Dr. Bradford schedules his cruises through Pastors @ Sea and through a booking agent.Helen Kelly owns Lectures International, a booking agent in Coronado, Calif., that sends bridge directors, lecturers and about 30 Protestant ministers on cruises each month. She charges the ministers $25 to $50 dollars a day, a fee that can include a spouse.Bramson Entertainment Bureau in Manhattan books entertainment talent and rabbis for cruise lines. “We look for cruising experience so they are not completely shocked when they get on board,” said Valerie Moreland, who helps coordinate the ship clergy program for Bramson.When a cruise becomes available, the agency sends an e-mail message to several hundred registered rabbis, and then it is first come, first served. There is a $25-a-day fee. Many of the cruise lines book rabbis for major Jewish holidays.Rabbi Charles Mintz of San Mateo, Calif., does four-month world cruises for Holland America and will sail from Rome through the Mediterranean and on to New York during this year’s High Holy Days.“It’s very difficult work,” Rabbi Mintz said, laughing, “but some poor sop has to do it.”Rabbi Mintz, 76, said the cruises made for a “marvelous” retirement, allowing him to see the world with his wife, Adele, while staying active in rabbinical work. He said that with an older client base, cruises have a need for clerics to deal with issues like illness and death, which sometimes arise on board.Rabbi Mintz, an opera buff, also lectures about opera on cruises. He said the work can offer surprises. One passenger needed kosher food off the coast of South Africa. When the ship docked, Rabbi Mintz and the Holland America chef roamed local shops. They came back with a week’s worth of kosher food.Lyan Sierra-Caro, a spokeswoman for Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises, said that Seders tended to attract 50 to 75 passengers. Mr. Vazquez said rabbis were on board for Hanukkah, and for Christmas when the two holidays did not coincide. That way, during Christmas Mass, the rabbi can lead an informal Champagne toast and social mixer so no one feels out of place.Dr. Bradford said he never felt out of place on board. He said that his ministry at sea was sometimes limited by time and space, but that there were always people in need. He has dealt with three deaths on board, spending the journey to port with the surviving spouses, no matter their religion.He wrote of his cruise ship ministry in the publication Ministry. “There were a lot of responses,” Dr. Bradford said. “Now every minister in the nation wants to get on a cruise.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','BOSTON, July 14 — Gov. Mitt Romney said Friday that inspectors continued to find trouble spots in a Big Dig tunnel where a woman was killed Monday by a three-ton concrete ceiling slab, and that the tunnel would be reopened in phases.But Mr. Romney would not speculate as to when that might happen.“We’re not going to be open until I don’t have to cross my fingers, and at this stage they could fall down,’’ he said. “The people in these tunnels are wearing hard hats for a reason.”Mr. Romney, who sought and was given control of the accident investigation Thursday night by the legislature, said 120 more potential flaws like loose nuts and bolts had been found Friday, bringing the number of trouble spots to more than 360.Michael Lewis, the Big Dig project director, said engineers were analyzing each of the items found throughout the tunnel’s ceiling.“Some could be potentially serious, some otherwise not,” Mr. Lewis said. “There are some locations where in an initial visual inspection you could expect to find a hanger, and a hanger isn’t there. It may be that through an engineering analysis it was designed out. Those are areas we have to review.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','While $80-a-barrel oil seemed like a skeptic’s worst-case outlook a few months ago, oil traders are increasingly saying that it is now just a matter of time before prices cross that threshold. Oil futures contracts for delivery beyond this summer passed $80 a barrel for the first time on Thursday.“The feeling is that we’re in a fairly bullish market right now,” said Antoine Halff, head of research at Fimat. “Gas demand over the last few weeks has been very robust. Perhaps the bigger issue on top of that is geopolitics. And clearly the market is very jittery about what’s going on in Israel.”Oil markets are typically sensitive to any political instability in the Middle East. Recently, they have been unsettled by Israeli military incursions into Gaza and then, this week, Lebanon. So, a market already worried about the potential for conflict with Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs is growing even more anxious.William Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics, said, “People are scared, that’s the bottom line.”Analysts said that in such a tense environment, events that typically would be overlooked are scrutinized, resulting in the type of market reaction seen after reports yesterday came out indicating surprisingly weak retail sales and lower consumer confidence.The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell by 0.1 percent in June, seasonally adjusted, the first drop since February. Taken with a University of Michigan survey that showed falling consumer confidence, the reports were seen as signs that consumers were growing weary.“In another week, those reports would not have been as destructive to the market,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management.How resilient consumer spending proves to be is something that will continue to factor heavily into stock performance. Most economists believe that consumers will curb their spending somewhat as the year goes on, and economic growth is expected to slow. But there is disagreement over how much spending will slow.“The persistence of high gasoline prices, coupled with lower equity prices and lower consumer sentiment, will restrain the growth of real consumer spending in the second half of 2006,” Brian Bethune, an analyst with Global Insight, wrote yesterday in a report about the retail sales numbers.But many analysts noted that the month’s decline in retail sales was exaggerated by poor auto sales, and said that consumers were likely to keep shopping for other goods.“We do not think that consumer spending growth is going to fall off of a cliff, as there ought to be support derived by gains in wages and salaries owing to job growth,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR Inc.Two indicators of market volatility — bond prices and gold prices — pointed yesterday toward renewed nervousness. Gold gained. Bond prices also went up.Even though the market swooned this week, analysts said that there were no signs yet that the drop was part of a larger unraveling of the economy.“The fundamentals of this market are still O.K.,” Mr. Paulsen said. “The decline is not universal. It’s not like stock prices are falling, bond yields are collapsing, commodities prices are collapsing. The stock market looks recessionary, but the commodities market looks like it’s expanding.”Mr. Rhodes said that with so much bad news clouding the market, “It’s very, very difficult to find out what the real underlying trend is.” He went on, “And the longer this goes on, the more difficult it is to find out what’s real happening underneath.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','“No doubt it’s been a tough week,” said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. “But each one of these decisions stands on its own. This isn’t some tidal wave against us.”The Nebraska case could be particularly significant because advocates of same-sex marriage could decide to appeal to the United States Supreme Court. The amendment, passed by 70 percent of voters, was more far-reaching than most other marriage bans because it denied same-sex couples who were state employees domestic-partner benefits, visitation rights and other benefits. In May 2005, Judge Joseph F. Bataillon of Federal District Court ruled that the amendment went “far beyond merely defining marriage as between a man and a woman.”Judge Bataillon said it “imposes significant burdens on both the expressive and intimate associational rights” of gay men and lesbians “and creates a significant barrier to the plaintiffs’ right to petition or to participate in the political process.”And Judge Bataillon added that the evidence suggested that the adoption of the amendment “was motivated, to some extent, by either irrational fear of or animus toward gays and lesbians.”The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit disagreed, ruling unanimously that “laws limiting the state-recognized institution of marriage to heterosexual couples are rationally related to legitimate state interests and therefore do not violate the Constitution of the United States.”David Buckel, senior counsel at the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, which helped challenge the amendment, said no decision had been made on an appeal.“It will take a while to understand exactly what the court did here,” Mr. Buckel said. “What struck me more than anything else was I couldn’t find our case in the decision. The decision seems to be about marriage, but our case wasn’t about marriage.”Mr. Buckel said the plaintiffs’ case had focused on asking the court to set aside the amendment to give their clients time to press for legislation to allow domestic-partner benefits for same-sex couples.Jon Bruning, the Nebraska attorney general, said, ““Today the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Nebraskans’ right to modify their Constitution as they see fit.”“We are pleased that this latest attempt by the homosexual agenda to radically redefine our culture has been stopped dead in its tracks,” Mathew D. Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, said in a statement. “For the past two weeks, the same-sex marriage movement has been rocked backward by stunning court decisions in favor of traditional marriage.”James Esseks, a litigation director for the A.C.L.U.., acknowledged that the Nebraska decision might embolden other states to pass more restrictive laws.“What’s at stake here is the ability to participate in the political process equally and seek protections we think we ought to be able to have,” Mr. Esseks said. “We were seeking some protection for families that may be short of nothing. Nebraska says you get nothing. That’s astonishing.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','Dressed in a blue business suit, the former trooper, who is 40, stood handcuffed to four other inmates as he addressed the court before his sentencing. He said the pressures of his job, coupled with a strenuous schedule and personal weakness, contributed to his downfall.“I did not value life, but I did not have the opportunity to seek help,” he said, choking back tears. “I am truly 100 percent remorseful. I dishonored my badge.”He closed his statement by saying that “in my heart I will always be a state trooper.”In September 2005, Mr. Hernandez, of Union, N.J., and 20 other people were charged for their roles in the ring that smuggled cocaine from Colombia and distributed it throughout the metropolitan area and Pittsburgh.The ring, headed by Alejandro Cleves — who fled New Jersey and is believed by authorities to be hiding in Colombia — was bringing up to six kilograms of cocaine and heroin into the United States every day. Each kilo is worth anywhere from $750,000 to $1 million on the street, the authorities said.Mr. Romankow, the prosecutor, said an investigation had revealed that Mr. Hernandez gave the suspects confidential information about specific undercover vehicles being used in surveillance operations.Assistant Prosecutor Julie Peterman said that Mr. Hernandez helped the drug gang distribute 10 kilos of cocaine — about 100,000 vials — to dealers in Union County.In court, Mr. Hernandez’s lawyer, Raymond M. Brown of Woodbridge, N.J., sought to have the sentence reduced, and called the former officer “one of the most extraordinary and complex human beings I have ever met.”But Judge Joseph P. Donohue said that Mr. Hernandez had risked police officers’ lives and darkened their public image.“You thought you were a prince of the city, that you could do what you wish and that you were above the law,” Judge Donohue said before sentencing Mr. Hernandez. In addition to prison, Mr. Hernandez must pay $580 in fines and surrender his car and $58,000 in savings.His wife and other family members were in court but declined to comment after the sentencing.Mr. Hernandez’s former wife, Sonia Choto, with whom he has a son, said she was pleased with the sentence. “He never spent time with his son,” she said. “I guess he was too busy dealing drugs, doing illegal activities.”'"

That same day, China reported that its global trade surplus in June reached $14.5 billion, a record.Mr. Paulson, who made frequent trips to China for Goldman Sachs, is expected to use his influence to try to persuade Chinese officials to close the trade gap with the United States.China has allowed its currency to appreciate modestly against the dollar. Economists say the United States and Europe will pressure China to allow it to appreciate more against the dollar and other currencies.UP FROM ZERO In a unanimous decision, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate a quarter-point, up from zero. The central bank also slightly raised the rates that banks charge each other.Recent data showed that consumer and wholesale prices were starting to climb after years of falling. In a statement, the bank said the shift would “contribute to ensuring price stability and achieving sustainable growth in the medium to long term.”The bank promised to move slowly so as not to send a shock wave through its $4.6 trillion economy or stall its recovery.ANTITRUST FINE Europe found Microsoft to be in violation of a 2004 antitrust order and fined the company $357 million. Microsoft has three months to pay. The company plans to appeal to the Court of First Instance, the European Union’s second-highest court.Fines could double starting July 31, the European Union said, if Microsoft failed to share “complete and accurate” technical information on its Windows operating system with competitors.European authorities are raising questions about Microsoft’s next operating system, Vista, which the company hopes to begin selling to consumers in January.MERGER DERAILED? The Court of First Instance, in Luxembourg, overturned the approval of the two-year-old merger of Sony Music and BMG, now Sony BMG Music Entertainment.The parent companies, Sony and Bertelsmann, insisted that the ruling did not invalidate their merger. European Commission antitrust regulators, whom the court criticized for their initial review, must now re-examine the combination.The commission has several choices: it could approve the deal, order the companies to make divestitures, or dissolve the venture. Lawyers in Brussels suggested that the commission would probably not block the deal.DEFICIT DECLINE The White House predicted that the budget deficit would decline for a second year, thanks to a 11 percent spike in tax receipts from corporate profits and individual investment income.The deficit for fiscal 2006, ending Sept. 30, is expected to be $296 billion, down from $318 billion in 2005.The surprising surge in tax revenue — up nearly 26 percent in the nine months that ended in June over the year-earlier period — could evaporate quickly.

"'06-07-15,'0','ATLANTA, July 14 — A Mississippi judge refused today to let Edgar Ray Killen out of prison while he appealed his conviction in the killing of three civil rights workers by the Ku Klux Klan in 1964.Mr. Killen’s manslaughter conviction in June 2005 was hailed as a long-awaited victory for the civil rights movement and a redemption for the small town of Philadelphia, Miss., outside of which the killings occurred. Mr. Killen was sentenced to 60 years in prison for organizing the death of James Earl Chaney, Michael H. Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, who had been organizing a black voter registration drive.It was the second time that Mr. Killen, 81, had asked to be freed on bond because of poor health. Last August, Judge Marcus D. Gordon of Circuit Court allowed him to go free, but then a month later reversed his decision when sheriff’s deputies testified that they had seen Mr. Killen driving in Neshoba County and pumping gas.Mr. Killen had claimed that as a result of a logging accident before his trial, he had to use a wheelchair and could not use his right hand.“A fraud has been perpetrated on this court,” Judge Gordon said at the time.Since then, Mr. Killen has moved to Parchman Farm, a state penitentiary, for physical therapy, and last month he was hospitalized. He is now bedridden and did not appear at the hearing Friday.'"
"'06-07-15,'0','Few would have predicted his run of success when he was thrust on the national stage two years ago, after his father, President Akhmad Kadyrov, was killed by a bomb.Hours after the blast, the president’s son, then the 27-year-old commander of the Presidential Guards, a murky unit of former rebels often accused of brutality, torture and kidnappings, was received at the Kremlin. He appeared wearing a track suit. Mr. Kadyrov was swiftly labeled an ill-prepared thug, the unfortunate outcome of a decade of war and an indicator of just how few choices Mr. Putin had as he sought allies among a people that Russia has struggled to control since czarist times.“He was simply a disgrace to all of Chechnya, that was the perception,” said Tanya Lokshina, chairwoman of Center Demos, a research group based in Moscow, who travels frequently to Chechnya.Reinforcing that perception, Mr. Basayev’s guerrillas followed the assassination of Mr. Kadyrov’s father with a busy summer campaign. And as the rebels bounded from event to event, reports of grisly abuses by fighters loyal to Mr. Kadyrov began to accumulate. Mr. Kadyrov, at the time too young to run for the Chechen presidency, was reduced to what seemed to be half-hearted cheerleading during the rigged election that installed his father’s replacement, Alu Alkhanov, and to proclaiming that “Chechnya is the safest place in the world.”NO one outside the Kremlin and Mr. Kadyrov’s clan, it seemed, was ready to take him seriously. A group of rebels, in interviews last December, described him as a traitor to Chechen nationalism and as a man who had been so insignificant during the first years of fighting that he had to borrow gas money for his car. One man was so disgusted he refused to utter Mr. Kadyrov’s name.But since Mr. Kadyrov’s first appearance, the politics and the insurgency in Chechnya have changed. Prominent rebels have been killed. Others have accepted amnesty offers and joined Mr. Kadyrov’s ranks. Rebel combat activity, still lethal, has palpably slowed.Mr. Kadyrov is now a potent political force. In March he was appointed prime minister, and he embarked upon a Chechen reconstruction program, restoring sections of ruined neighborhoods and infrastructure in Grozny, Argun and Gudermes. No one else had been able to do anything similar, and the rebels as yet have barely been able to break a window on the buildings he has fixed.Chechnya is still beset by the insurgency, infighting, near total unemployment, sinister brutality, poverty, corruption and rackets, which are widely believed to be run by the prime minister’s circle. But his popularity has grown. “He has real appeal among certain sectors of the population,” Ms. Lokshina, of the research group, said after returning from Chechnya this week. He is seen as a man who is getting things done, she said, which has led many to look away from his reputation for brutality and crime.Today, Mr. Kadyrov is in a state of makeover, refining his Russian, improving his public-speaking skills and often appearing in sport jackets and slacks. Sweeping aside detailed allegations from human rights groups and torture victims, he insists he has no role in kidnappings or brutality, and he professes loyalty to Moscow and Mr. Putin, making statements rarely heard from anyone else in Chechnya, which has largely been destroyed by the Russian military. “President Putin is a great man,” he said. “He saved us from the bandits who tried to pull us away from Russia.”This year he has also been speaking openly of Chechnya’s indigenous Sufi Islam, and the need for it to have a central place in public life, and of restoring and preserving Chechen culture — messages with resonance in a place that has suffered Slavic invasions and pogroms.There is a widespread expectation that this fall, when he turns 30, the age at which he can become president, he will manipulate his way into Chechnya’s top office. He himself brushes past such talk. “It embarrasses me,” he said.BUT his new stature has raised questions. Ms. Lokshina and the rebels alike doubt the strength of his bond to Mr. Putin. With so many rebels now in his ranks, his ability to control them in the future is not clear.One fighter, Sadik, a 37-year-old Chechen guerrilla interviewed outside of Russia, where he was recovering from shrapnel wounds, said the politics could change in ways disastrous for the Kremlin. “He is not loyal,” he said of Mr. Kadyrov. “He does not work for us, but he is not completely loyal to Putin. He is the type of person who sells himself very easily.”Andrew McGregor, director of Aberfoyle International Security Analysis in Toronto, said Russia, sensing either Mr. Kadyrov’s limits or the risks he poses, might also remove him. “I think he is a temporary solution until Russia finds someone better,” he said. “And then there will be no more Ramzan.”Death is a frequent visitor in the top circles of Chechnya’s post-Soviet politics. Five of the seven men to hold the Chechen presidency in the last 12 years, on either the rebel or the Kremlin side, have been killed.Mr. Kadyrov, the undeclared presidential contender, said he had no fear. He has taken to driving Chechnya’s roads without an armored car.“What am I to be afraid of?” he said. “I believe in Allah. I will live as long as I am destined to live. If Allah closed down the lid and says, ‘You have lived your mission, come home,’ then that is it.”'"
"'06-07-15,'0','“What if I only have 50 cents?” he was asked.“Uh-huh,” he answered, staring momentarily at the two coins plunked into his palm before ringing up $15 on the cash register, punching in a 50-cent subtraction and sliding over a green metal admission button with the detachment of a Vegas dealer parting with a dollar chip. If he had been trained in a psy-ops camp in the most effective ways of wounding a conscience, he could have done no better.When the Met decided to raise the admission price, effective Aug. 1, it did not announce it the way it often does such changes, by issuing a news release. Instead, it sort of slipped the news under the door, sending an e-mail message at 3 p.m. on Wednesday to editors who supervise arts listings at news organizations.The Met argued that the change wasn’t really big news — it is just a suggested price, after all, intended to help the museum make up for an annual operating deficit that has averaged $3 million in recent years. And it pointed out that many other big museums in the country not only charge mandatory admission but also charge extra for special exhibitions.If, for example, you want to see the “Americans in Paris” show now at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, you will have to buy a $23 adult ticket on top of the museum’s $15 adult admission fee. (The show comes to the Met in October; it will not cost extra there.)The Met also points out, on flat-screen televisions helpfully placed right at the cashiers’ desks, that by paying the full admission, patrons are helping to support special exhibitions and public school programs.But the museum does not make it easy to figure out that there is a choice. A lighted sign next to the suggested admission price announces: “Free Admission if You Become a Member Today!” (An annual membership, which starts at $50, confers benefits like a 10 percent discount at the museum’s gift shop.)On Thursday there was also a Met employee patrolling the admissions lines with a portable credit card machine, asking if any patrons were paying by card. If asked, he explained that the full admission price was not obligatory. If not, he would simply say, “Adult?” and ring up $15. He was friendly and helpful, switching effortlessly to French to direct a couple to the “deuxième étage” (second floor).Yet if you were the patron who happened to be paying with a couple of quarters, the reception was somehow never quite as mellifluous.“What if I just give you 50 cents now and an I.O.U. to pay more next time?” the reporter asked a kind-faced white-haired cashier, sought out as a last resort for some badly needed empathy.The kind face disappeared. Empathy must cost more than four bits.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Still, officials worry that the buildup of so many rockets could tempt Hezbollah to expand its operations. Adding to this worry is the fear that Iran or Syria might encourage Hezbollah to stir up tensions along Israel's northern frontier to divert attention from Iraq and complicate the Bush administration's plans to topple Saddam Hussein.According to some analysts, neither Iran nor Syria wants to see an American occupation of Iraq because they fear that it could be a platform for Washington to project more power throughout the region.""We may have to face this problem on the eve of going into Iraq,"" said Dennis Ross, the Clinton administration's special envoy to the Middle East. ""I think there is a strong impulse on the part of the Iranians and to a lesser extent the Syrians to head us off in Iraq because they fear they could be next. If suddenly there is a war raging between Israel and its neighbors, that creates pressure to deal with that issue first and shifts attention away from Iraq. The Europeans and the Arabs will be saying first things first.""There is no consensus, however, as to Iran's and Syria's intentions.Some Israeli officials and analysts said that an American confrontation with Iraq and the deployment of thousands more American troops in the region could make Iran and Syria more cautious and reduce the chances of an escalation of tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border.""Iran will be worried that it is next in line and will avoid any provocations,"" said Shai Feldman, the head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. ""Syria's incentive will be to avoid steps that would make it a charter member of the `axis of evil.' ""In recent months, Syria has cooperated with the United States in sharing intelligence on Al Qaeda. However, the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has continued to support Hezbollah, and Syria imports oil illegally from Iraq, Western intelligence officials have said.According to Israeli and Western officials, Hezbollah has accumulated 8,000 to 9,000 Katyusha rockets, with a range of about 12 miles. But in the past year, Israeli officials have begun to warn that Iran is also providing longer-range systems, including the 240-millimeter Fajr-3 missile, with a range of about 25 miles and the 333-millimeter Fajr-5 missile, with a range of about 45 miles, meaning it could strike the northern Israeli city of Haifa, and areas to the south, from southern Lebanon. Israeli officials say that Hezbollah has several hundred Fajr rockets. American officials have acknowledged that Hezbollah has the Fajr systems, but have been cautious in specifying how many the group controls.Syria has also begun to provide 222-millimeter rockets, which have a range of 12 to 18 miles, according to an Israeli security official, who said it was a new development.""What happens up north could very easily spiral into a much wider confrontation,"" said a Western official. ""It is of great concern.""At the Israeli army post here on the border with Lebanon, a wire fence has been erected to protect the soldiers from rocket-propelled grenades. The Israeli military uses cameras, reconnaissance drones and balloons, as well as patrols, to secure the wire fence that divides Israel from southern Lebanon, which the Israeli Army left in May 2000 after a 22-year occupation.Directly opposite the post, a Hezbollah sentry has set up camp in the shadow of a United Nations watchtower. He notes the comings and goings of Israeli soldiers and visitors and, when asked questions through the wire fence, does not answer them. The yellow Hezbollah standard has been raised and a Hezbollah poster shows the severed head of an Israeli soldier killed during Israel's Lebanon deployment.Last spring, Hezbollah began to lob mortars and rockets at Israeli military positions, apparently in support of the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza. The attacks took place in the foothills of Mount Hermon, an area in the Golan Heights that is occupied by Israel but which Hezbollah calls Shebaa Farms and claims as part of Lebanon.In March, several militants used a ladder to sneak over the border fence and killed six civilians near Kibbutz Matsuva in western Galilee. Hezbollah did not claim credit for the attack, but Israeli officials believe it was carried out by Palestinians with Hezbollah's support.When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell traveled to Israel in April, Hezbollah began a mortar attack while he was being briefed at a command center. An Israeli reconnaissance drone broadcast live pictures of the attack to the command center, and Secretary Powell later flew to Damascus to urge the Syrians to put an end to the Hezbollah attacks.Western officials say, however, that the United States may need to caution Syria again before taking on Iraq.Last month, Hezbollah militants fired anti-tank missiles and mortars at Israeli outposts in the Shebaa Farms area, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding two. Hezbollah also fires anti-aircraft guns, sending shrapnel into Israeli territory; Israel dismisses Hezbollah claims that it is firing at Israeli warplanes.Israeli and Western officials said that the rocket buildup reflects different agendas. For Iran, the officials said, the rockets give it a stopgap ability to threaten Israel through Hezbollah proxies while completing the development of its Shahab-3 missile, which, with a range of 780 miles, could strike Israel from Iranian territory.In Syria, Mr. Assad has forged a close relationship with Hezbollah's leader, Sayyid Hasan Nasrallah, according to Western and Israeli officials. A Western official said that Mr. Assad appears to have interpreted Secretary Powell's appeal for restraint as a sign of Israeli weakness.Israeli officials say they hope to avoid opening a second front, but insist that Israel will hold Syria responsible in the event of major attacks by Hezbollah.""The Syrians are the more serious threat,"" said an Israeli military official. ""They have got brigades of Scuds, a full Air Force and chemical weapons. But this is a state and I can identify the rationality. Hezbollah is not a state. It is a terrorist organization. Therefore, it makes me more worried. Syria should ask itself: can it count on its ability to control Hezbollah in a time of crisis?""General Gantz added: ""One day the price we have to pay may be too high, and that means we will have to act. And then we have a few addresses, so everybody should be warned.""'"
"'06-07-16,'0','But those projections do not even include a possible increase from diabetes.“Alzheimer’s is going to swamp the health-care system,” said Dr. John C. Morris, a neurology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, and an advisor to the Alzheimer’s Association.In the past decade, several large studies found that, compared to healthy people of the same age and sex, those with Type 2 diabetes were twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s. The reason is not known, but researchers initially suspected that cardiovascular problems caused by diabetes might contribute to dementia by blocking blood flow to the brain or causing strokes.More recently, though, scientists have begun to think that the diseases are connected in other ways as well. In both, destructive deposits of amyloid, a type of protein, build up: in the brain in Alzheimer’s, in the pancreas in Type 2 diabetes.People with Type 2 often have a condition called insulin resistance, in which their cells cannot properly use insulin, the hormone needed to help glucose leave the blood and enter cells that need it. To compensate, the pancreas makes extra insulin, which can reach high levels in the blood. Too much insulin may lead to inflammation, which can contribute to damage in the brain. In addition, abnormalities in glucose metabolism and insulin levels in the brain itself may be harmful. Some research has found that too much insulin in the brain can contribute to amyloid buildup.Some researchers have even suggested that Alzheimer’s disease may actually be “Type 3 diabetes,” a form of the disease affecting the nervous system.About 20 million people in the United States have Type 2 diabetes. The number has doubled in the past two decades. Another 41 million are “pre-diabetic,” with blood sugar rising toward the diabetic level. Diabetes rates are expected to increase because rates of obesity are rising, and epidemiologists predict that one in three American children born in 2000 will eventually develop Type 2.Worldwide, diabetes is also on the rise, increasing to 230 million cases from 30 million in the past 20 years.One of the new studies found that even people who had borderline diabetes were 70 percent more likely than those with normal blood sugar to develop Alzheimer’s. The study, by researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Stockholm Gerontology Research Center, included 1173 people 75 and older. The risk of dementia was highest in borderline diabetics who also had high blood pressure. But the risk occurred only in those who did not carry a gene called apo E4, which raises the Alzheimer’s risk.The director of the study, Dr. Weili Xu, said that since increased exercise and changes in diet can improve borderline diabetes, they may also help ward off dementia.Another study found that in people with diabetes, the higher their blood sugar, the greater the risk of dementia. Higher levels of blood sugar mean the disease is severe or is being poorly treated, or bothThe study, led by Rachel A. Whitmer of Kaiser Permanente’s Division of Research in Oakland, was based on the records of 22,852 patients with Type 2 diabetes who were followed for eight years. Initially, none had dementia. The researchers looked at glycosylated hemoglobin, a blood test that reflects blood sugar levels for the previous two months. Normal is 7 or lower. Here, the risk of dementia rose when the level reached 10. Those with readings from 10 to 11.9 had 13 percent more risk than people with levels under 10. From 12 to 14.9, the risk was 24 percent higher. Over 15, it jumped to 83 percent higher.In an interview, Dr. Whitmer said that one implication of the study is that tight control of blood sugar is important in elderly patients, even though some doctors tend to relax the rules for them.“Tight control is important for the whole life span,” she said. “The older you are, the more likely you are to get dementia.”She added: “With the whole diabetes epidemic we’re seeing much more Type 2, so are we going to see even more Alzheimer’s than we thought we would see? If we continue in this direction, it’s a little bit frightening.”Another study suggested that a certain class of diabetes drug, commonly called “glitazones,” may lower the risk of Alzheimer’s in people with diabetes. Pilot studies in small groups of patients had hinted that the drugs might be of some help, and the National Institute of Aging is sponsoring research this area.In the new study, researchers used the records of 142,328 patients in the Veterans Affairs system, who did not have dementia but were just starting to take a glitazone or insulin. They tracked the patients for six years. Compared to those using insulin, the patients who took either pioglitazone (Actos) or rosiglitazone (Avandia) had nearly 20 percent fewer cases of Alzheimer’s. The glitazones had a similar advantage over another diabetes drug, metformin.Glitazones lower blood sugar by helping the body to use insulin more efficiently, so that less insulin is needed. The drugs may also lower inflammation.Though the results sound like good news for patients, the director of the study, Donald R. Miller, an epidemiologist at Boston University and the department of veterans affairs, cautioned that the findings were not conclusive and did not mean that people should start taking the drugs to ward of Alzheimer’s.“This is preliminary, the first study of its kind,” Dr. Miller said, emphasizing that more studies are needed to verify his results.GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of rosiglitazone, sponsored the study but did not control the way it was done or interpreted, Dr. Miller said.Another study, a small one with only 25 patients, tested pioglitazone for 18 months in nondiabetic people with Alzheimer’s to see if it was safe and showed signs of slowing the disease.The drug did seem safe, causing only some foot and ankle swelling. But compared to people taking placebos, patients taking the drug showed no statistically significant differences in memory, thinking, daily function or abnormal behavior. But there were hints that some measures worsened less in the patients on the drug, and the researchers, led by Dr. David S. Geldmacher, of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, said it deserved further study in Alzheimer’s. The was sponsored by the drug’s maker, Takeda.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Mr. Pak then rose from the horseshoe-shaped panel and left the chamber, prompting Mr. Bolton to say: “This has been a historic day. Not only have we unanimously adopted resolution 1695, but North Korea has set a world record in rejecting it 45 minutes after its adoption.”China and Russia wanted no mention of Chapter VII for fear that it could be used to justify military strikes on North Korea. Opposition by both countries to the Chapter VII rubric has grown since the war in Iraq and what Beijing and Moscow see as the Bush administration’s resort to military means to remove governments it opposes. Wang Guangya, the Chinese ambassador, had repeatedly said he would cast his country’s veto if that reference remained.Mr. Bolton had insisted throughout the week that the resolution had to be adopted under Chapter VII to be binding, but on Friday night he shifted ground and said that it was mandatory that all Security Council resolutions be followed, regardless of whether the Chapter VII language were included.After the vote, he said, “We look forward to North Korea’s full, unconditional and immediate compliance with this Security Council resolution.”But he added that the Council had to be prepared that North Korea “might choose a different path” and in that event, he said, “the United States and other member states have the opportunity at any point to return to the Council for further action.”Mr. Pak left little doubt that North Korea had no intention of complying, saying that it would continue with its missile program, which it considered essential to its self-defense.The Council members had struggled for days over how to produce a firm response to the seven missile firings that North Korea conducted on July 5 despite warnings from all the world powers, including its principal ally, China.Japan proposed the resolution on July 7, but agreed in the following days to put off a vote while China pursued a diplomatic solution through a high-level mission to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.After the mission appeared to return empty-handed early this week, negotiations intensified, running day and night and involving Japan and the five permanent members of the Security Council — Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States.On July 11, China and Russia stymied pressure to move to a vote by introducing a rival draft that did not invoke Chapter VII nor include the kind of sanctions against North Korea that were in the original Japanese text.The action represented a compromise by the two countries, which earlier had insisted that a resolution was an overreaction and would destabilize the region further, and that a simple non-binding presidential statement would suffice.The Japanese, backed by the United States, insisted on a vote by Saturday to coincide with the opening of the summit meeting in St. Petersburg of the Group of 8 leaders. That meeting is expected to produce another statement on the North Korean test firings.All the versions of the resolution under discussion at the United Nations focused on the same objectives, but the debate centered on wording changes that are central to the drafting of United Nations resolutions.In exchange for dropping the critical reference to Chapter VII, for instance, the drafters gained a tougher text on the targeted sanctions sections. That was accomplished by simple word replacements, saying that the Council “demands” and “requires,” rather than “decides,” the stipulations for North Korea. By contrast, the softest of the texts, the one proposed by China and Russia, used “calls upon” and “urges.”The earlier draft had called for the cessation of North Korea’s development, testing, deployment and proliferation of ballistic missiles. But the final version dropped the specifics and substituted the words “all activities’ related to its missile program.Mr. Wang said that if the original resolution had gone through, it would have “created enormous obstacles to the six-party talks and other diplomatic endeavors.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','A half-dozen Syrians interviewed at random in Damascus cafes all said that they admired Hezbollah’s leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, for using military action to back his anti-Israeli remarks.“Nasrallah has caused a great deal of embarrassment among the Arab leaders,” Dr. Kabalan continued. “He is seen as the only Arab leader who can stand by his words and resist Israel.”Imad Fauzi Shueibi, a political analyst who often works as a consultant to the Syrian government, laughed as he said that he believed that Israel was being drawn into a trap if it thought it could successfully fight on two, or even three, fronts.Israel and the United States have said that they attribute a supporting role in Hezbollah’s attacks on Israel to Syria, and many Syrians are now talking about the possibility of a battle with Israel in the Golan region.“I am laughing because I am so happy to see that in Israel there are these very stupid leaders,” Dr. Fauzi Shueibi said. “Israel has nothing to gain by changing the balance of power in the region. To fight on two fronts at the same time is stupid; if they try to open three fronts, that will be madness.”“No one can believe that this will stop without a huge victory for Hezbollah and for Syria,” he added. “I haven’t felt so optimistic since 1973. I think we are closing the noose on Israel. This may be the last battle, and we may be able to redraw the map of the Middle East, but not on the schedule of America’s plan for the greater Middle East.”As Israel continued its airstrikes on Lebanon, many Lebanese began flooding into Syria over the past several days, leading some Syrians to worry about a possible refugee crisis.Syria already serves as a temporary home for hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees, and according to Syrian government figures, more than 17,000 Lebanese refugees crossed into Syria on Friday alone.At Jdayat-Yabbus, a Syria border town, Lebanese refugees said Friday that the price of a taxi from Beirut to Damascus, normally about $50, had been driven up to $500 or more for what is usually a two-hour ride but could now stretch to five hours or more.Those who could not afford taxis crammed into flatbed trucks; others took the bus to Chtaura, a Lebanese border town, and then crossed on foot, walking several miles in the brutal sun and carrying their luggage on their heads.Many were from the southern suburbs of Beirut, which have come under heavy attack by Israeli warplanes because of Hezbollah’s strong presence there.Hassan, an automobile mechanic from southern Beirut who declined to give his last name, was traveling Friday in a flatbed truck brimming with 15 young children, all looking tired and miserable in the midday sun.He said he was bringing the children — two his own and the rest nieces and nephews — to stay with distant relatives in Syria.“We haven’t slept in three days,” he said. “The Israelis are bombing shopping malls and television stations. The children are very frightened, and so we are bringing them to Syria for their safety.”Syrian analysts noted with some pride that Syria will have a central role in any peace agreement, and that the United States may now be forced to make a deal with Syria because of Hezbollah’s actions.“Syria has demonstrated once again that it can’t be marginalized,” said Dr. Kabalan, the political science professor. “It has succeeded in turning the tables on the Americans. Syria has demonstrated successfully that it is still here and still in control.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','He is in his 18th year in the Senate, where he has prided himself as being moderate, collegial and willing to work with Republicans. He has built the kind of seniority that often leads lawmakers to consider themselves invulnerable.Yet he suddenly finds himself in a nasty tangle, not with the Republicans who held little back in their effort to thwart his run for vice president, but with a wing of his own party that has adopted a bloody-knuckle approach to politics and wants to finish him off in Connecticut’s primary on Aug. 8.Mr. Lieberman’s physical posture is more hunched than usual these days, his normally deep and lulling cadences more clipped. “I should probably cut off this line of question-ing,” he said in a discussion relating to his recent announcement that he would run as an independent if he did not get the Democratic nomination. “I’m focused on the primary.”Mr. Lamont and Mr. Lieberman’s critics on the left say he is out of touch with his party, especially but not solely on Iraq, and cannot be trusted to advance what they say are core progressive values.“Many Democratic activists and bloggers have concluded that some of the party’s most visible scars are self-inflicted,” said Ari Melber, a former staff member for Senator John Kerry’s presidential campaign who writes regularly for The Huffington Post, a Web site with political commentary. “When prominent Democrats regularly capitulate to Republicans, they undermine the rationale for an opposition party. Lieberman is seen as the serial offender.”The Lieberman campaign contends that Mr. Lamont has systematically distorted its record and that in fact, Mr. Lieberman has voted with Senate Democrats and against President Bush on the vast majority of issues since he became took office in 2001. The campaign also charges that during Mr. Lamont’s days as an elected official in his hometown, Greenwich, he usually voted in accordance with local Republicans.Mr. Lieberman, who seemed slow to recognize the seriousness of Mr. Lamont’s challenge, also appears taken aback by the ferocity of the onslaught, particularly from liberal blogs. To Mr. Lieberman’s camp, the bloggers embody what his longtime friend Lanny Davis calls “the demonizing, hating, virulent, character-assassinating left of the Democratic Party.”Mr. Lieberman began, “Some of the vituperations, some of the extremity of the language and anger,” before his voice trailed off. He paused for a second and started again: “They’re describing a person who is not me.” Colleagues have approached him on the Senate floor to console him, asking how he is holding up, as if he is sick or experiencing some trauma.Mr. Lieberman’s allies discuss him these days with a tinge of sadness, as if mourning a kindly gentleman who has wandered into a bad neighborhood. “He’s being subjected to the hate machine like Bill Clinton and George Bush have,” said Mr. Davis, a former special counsel to Mr. Clinton. “Joe Lieberman has never been subjected to this before.”Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and one of Mr. Lieberman’s closest friends in the Senate, called him “one of the most decent men I have ever known” and simply shook his head when asked about his friend’s situation. “I hesitate to say anything nice about him, for fear that it would be used against him,” Mr. McCain said. “And that’s a terrible commentary on the state of politics and the political climate today.”In his Senate career, Mr. Lieberman has been a creature of the political center, ill suited to the partisan passions that have come to pervade primary campaigns. He was far more effective as a general election candidate for vice president in 2000 than he was in the campaign he waged for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, in which he did not come close to winning any primaries.“The antis tend to come out more in the primaries,” Mr. Lieberman said. “There’s a culture of partisan poison in both parties. It hurts. And it’s part of what’s being reflected in this primary.”Mr. Lieberman said he was not surprised that he had a primary challenge, given his support for the war in Iraq and the fervor against it among Democrats. He said he did not mind being booed, as he was at a Fourth of July parade in Willimantic, Conn., where Lamont supporters built a float with a papier-mâché rendering of Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Bush’s kiss.But the senator said he was upset by the fever pitch of invective that he said the campaign against him had featured. In that same parade, Mr. Lieberman was heckled as a “warmonger,” a “Bush lover” and a “turncoat,” among other things.Mr. Lieberman also worries about how seemingly effective the assaults have been. His once-comfortable lead over Mr. Lamont has shrunk considerably, to a point where he has felt it necessary to hedge his bets with his fallback independent candidacy.Like the candidate himself, Mr. Lieberman’s campaign in Connecticut gives the impression of being caught off-guard, a bit shell-shocked and on uncertain footing. Someone on his campaign staff decided that he should campaign at the Tigin Irish Pub in Stamford on Monday morning — not exactly prime flesh-pressing hours (except on St. Patrick’s Day, which Monday was not). He was joined by a few supporters, a throng of news media people and virtually no bar patrons.Mr. Lieberman was scheduled to attend a Puerto Rican festival in Bridgeport last Sunday, but his campaign canceled his appearance upon hearing a report of a stabbing there that afternoon. The festival went on, drawing over a thousand people (including a Lamont supporter holding a “Kiss this, Senator Lieberman” sign). It was Mr. Lieberman’s only scheduled campaign appearance on one of the few Sundays left before the primary. Mr. Lieberman said he made an impromptu trip to an Italian neighborhood in Bridgeport instead, after Italy’s soccer team won the World Cup.“Don’t make too much of it,” Mr. Lieberman said of the decision to skip the Puerto Rican festival, which he said he regretted in retrospect. “Or blame it on my staff.”Staff work is vital in a primary, particularly one to be held in August, when many voters will be away and turnout is expected to be low. Mr. Lamont’s supporters are passionate and motivated to begin with — and perhaps less likely to need a get-out-the-vote operation to spur them to the polls. Mr. Lieberman engenders more admiration than fervor among his supporters.He has also encountered a peculiar brand of stigma from his Democratic colleagues in the Senate.Several of them say they will support their “good friend” in the primary. But only a smattering say they will support Mr. Lieberman no matter what happens Aug. 8. The rest have either avoided the question (“You never saw senators run for the elevators so fast,” David Lightman of The Hartford Courant said on “Reliable Sources” on CNN) or vowed to support the primary winner, even if it is Mr. Lamont, whom most of them have never met.“I’m going to wait and see what happens in the primary so hopefully I won’t have to make this decision,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, voicing a typical response.Former Vice President Al Gore has remained neutral in the primary — not surprising, given his fierce opposition to the Iraq war, his surprise endorsement of Howard Dean for the Democratic nomination in 2004 and the general public chill that has surrounded the former running mates since their buddy days in 2000.Mr. Gore declined to comment for this article. Privately, other leading Democrats have been quick to catalog what they consider to be Mr. Lieberman’s slights to the party over the years — including his mild-mannered performance in his vice-presidential debate against Dick Cheney in 2000; his rejection of a filibuster that would have opposed the nomination of Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court; and his on-air chumminess with Sean Hannity, the conservative co-host of “Hannity & Colmes” on Fox News. His willingness to run for re-election as an independent is merely the latest offense.Indeed, there is an unmistakable sense of satisfaction, if not glee, over Mr. Lieberman’s difficulties in the primary, even among people who consider themselves friends.“This is just another of a long list of things I’ve seen that show you have very few friends” in Washington, Mr. McCain said. “So long as you understand that, you can exist happily here. But you shouldn’t delude yourself into thinking people are going to stand by you instead of acting in their self-interests.”People close to Mr. Lieberman say he has been wounded by the conditional devotion he has received from most of his Democratic colleagues in the Senate. Mr. Lieberman says this is not true, that he is not bothered. “Probably some of my fellow senators are more uncomfortable about this than I am,” he said. “Because truly, I haven’t asked a single one of them for a commitment beyond the primary.”Even so, Senate Democrats have not exactly closed ranks around their colleague, either. It was impossible to watch Mr. Lieberman campaign at the Stamford pub on Monday and not consider his circumstances. A Democratic Senate colleague, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, was supposed to join him but did not make his train up from Delaware, so Mr. Lieberman was left to stump for himself.“Irish-Americans have been great supporters of mine,” Mr. Lieberman said in remarks to the small crowd, between prelunch sips of Guinness. He seemed, at the moment, every bit in his ethnic political element — a backslapping, blog-free retail setting characteristic of the Democratic Party he grew up in.“The Irish tend not to be fair-weather friends,” Mr. Lieberman said. “They’re with you all the way.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Those funds will be exhausted by August, and the government must then either secure more money for the imports or begin limiting consumption. Without imports, drivers would have to consume 42 percent less gasoline.Parliament and the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are still discussing options, including rationing domestically produced gasoline and selling imported gasoline at its regional price.The minister of economy, Davoud Danesh-Jafari, said Monday that rationing would have to wait until at least December, the ISNA student news agency reported, so that the government could issue smart cards to track sales to replace its gasoline coupons, which are easily sold on the black market.And while the government has publicly said it definitely intended to ration supplies, doing so would risk serious political and social consequences. Even the previous president, Mohammad Khatami, who encouraged liberalizing the economy, was afraid to raise gas prices or ration supplies, fearing inflation and social discontent.In 1995, riots broke out in the working-class towns of Akbarabad and Islamshahr, near Tehran, after bus fares were raised. One person was killed and dozens were injured. But the possibility that the United Nations Security Council will impose economic sanctions on Iran over its refusal to freeze its nuclear activities has added a new pressure on the government to stop imports and raise prices.“The government has no choice now to stop the import both because of the uncontrollable domestic consumption and because of security issues,” said Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst in Tehran. “The government wants to voluntarily bring the consumption under control in case economic sanctions are imposed.”Some fear that the mere idea of rationing gasoline will lead to higher transportation fares. Some worry that if, as has been suggested, cabdrivers get relatively large rations, they might sell the gas illegally, creating a black market and causing rapid inflation.Taqi Rashidi, 62, a cabdriver in Tehran, said the government risked protests. “Passengers are already complaining about high prices,” he said. “They won’t remain quiet if taxi fares increase too.”The signs of cheap gasoline are everywhere in Iran. The cheapest, most common Iranian vehicle, the domestically produced Peykan, gets just 12 miles a gallon. The Peykan was discontinued only last year because of its pathetic mileage and pollutant-laden exhaust.As in other countries dependent on automobiles, traffic and pollution are major problems, and public transport is slow and insufficient. The government’s efforts to bar private cars from driving into downtown Tehran has done little to ease traffic or clean the air.“Car factories are manufacturing 1.3 million cars every year, and they are all coming on to the streets,” said Mohammad Sadeq Jannan Sefat, a journalist in Tehran. “Cheap fuel has increased the appetite for these cars, and the government can no longer continue paying for it,” he added.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','The conflict over the use of metal versus wood began almost from the inception of the use of aluminum bats in the early 1970’s to cut the cost of replacing broken wood bats. The controversy took an odd turn last month: The Mavericks forfeited four games as part of a home-and-away series with the Bozeman Bucks of their Eastern Montana Class AA American Legion conference because Bozeman refused to play with wood.“Ever since Brandon’s death, we only play games with wood bats, because it’s safer — I feel there’s no question about that — and out of respect for Brandon and his parents,” said Matt Phillips, the Mavericks’ coach.He was speaking in the clubhouse at Denton Field, the Mavericks’ home ballpark. The clubhouse, named Patch’s Corner, was built with donations from the community and from supporters around the country. A memorial stone and a photo of the left-handed Patch following through on a pitch are at the entrance.The other five teams in the conference, as well as all other American Legion teams in the state, play with aluminum bats when Miles City is not involved. They have respected the Miles City position in games against the Mavericks. In the past two years, in the eight games Bozeman and Miles City played, Bozeman used wood bats. Bozeman is again at the top end of the league standings, Miles City at the lower rung.“At the conference meeting in December, all the teams, including Bozeman, agreed again to play us only with wood bats,” Phillips said. “Then on Friday, three days before we were supposed to play them, Mitch Messer, their coach, calls and says they have decided to play with aluminum bats. I said we aren’t going to play with aluminum bats and that we’d have to forfeit the games. He said: ‘We’re a metal-bat team, and we don’t want to do anything to jeopardize our season. I mean no disrespect to your team or to Brandon Patch’s family, but that’s our decision.’ ”Deb Patch said: “It really is a slap in our face. It totally is.”Her husband, Duane, growing emotional, said, “The reason we are trying to get metal bats out of baseball is that we don’t want any parent to go through what my wife and I went through on that July 25.”Messer did not return several telephone calls seeking comment.“Mitch is a first-year coach with us, and it was generally decided to go this route,” said Ron Edwards, a spokesman for the Bozeman Bucks’ board of directors. “Every one of the other 5,500 Legion teams in the country play with metal bats. We decided to go with the majority.”But a handful of Legion teams around the country play with only wood bats, and the Bozeman decision drew heated responses.Andrew Hinkelman, a sports columnist for The Bozeman Daily Chronicle, wrote, “After almost three years of every Miles City opponent abiding by the Mavericks’ request to not use aluminum bats, the Bucks became the first team to dishonor themselves by insisting that metal is better.” He added that the Bucks’ decision was “a disheartening display of classless, unsportsmanlike behavior that is in violation of the spirit of athletics.”Josh Samuelson, the sports editor of The Miles City Star, wrote a column with similar sentiments regarding Bozeman and its coach. He received an e-mail message from Kay Bugger, the mother of a current Bucks player and of another player who was on the team in 2003. She gave permission by telephone for her message to be published again: “Your article is right on the money, and most of the parents in Bozeman agree with you!”She added, “Messer is showing complete disrespect for the situation.”A year ago, the Patches were among those who petitioned the Montana Legislature to ban aluminum bats. The ban was rejected in a close decision, but Gov. Brian Schweitzer issued a statement urging teams to take up wood bats. “We have a responsibility to protect our young people in their sports endeavors,” he said.Some campaigns have succeeded. Next year, all North Dakota high school games will be played with wood bats. A number of other high school, amateur and college conferences, including the New York Collegiate Baseball League and the Great Lakes Valley Conference, have gone back to wood. The Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association briefly banned metal bats for high school playoff games, but the rule was later abandoned. The professional minor and major leagues use wood bats.Manufacturers take the position that, given the some 20 million baseball players in the United States, metal bats do not cause any more injuries than wood bats. Others, like Jim Quinlan, the national program coordinator for American Legion Baseball, say that wood bats can also be dangerous. One example he used was of a teenager in Utah who was killed by a ball off a wood bat in batting practice.Last month, Erik Davis, a Stanford junior, was pitching in the high-end amateur Cape Cod League, which uses wood bats. Davis was hit in the face with a batted ball. He had reconstructive surgery to repair damage to his right eye.Between 1991 and 2001, 17 players were killed by batted balls, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Eight involved metal bats and two involved wood bats. In seven instances, the kind of bat was not documented.Steve Keener, the president and chief executive of Little League International, which uses metal bats, said that injuries from batted balls had decreased over the years. He said the ratio of weight to length in youth bats had been adjusted so that the velocity of a ball from the bat was about equivalent to that of a wood bat. Similar bats are used in some other amateur settings.In 2001, a proposal before the New York City Council to ban metal bats in youth leagues failed to pass. That was after testimony in the Youth Services Committee by Jack MacKay Jr., a former metal bat engineer for Hillerich & Bradsby, which makes Louisville Slugger bats. He told the committee that metal bats posed “unnecessary danger.”Freddy Ricci, a Staten Island resident whose 14-year-old son Anthony’s teeth were knocked out by a line drive in 2001, told the committee that nothing could compare to “sitting in an emergency room, with your son, with teeth getting knocked out, blood drenched to his underwear.” He added, “So all of the statistics that you have, they don’t mean a thing to me.”With other testimony from bat companies, the committee decided that metal bats did not pose any greater danger than wood bats.Aluminum bats are lighter to swing than wood ones, and the ball flies off faster. The so-called sweet spot, in the meat of the barrel, is greater because the bat is more hollow. The bat manufacturer Easton advertises its new Stealth bat with technology that encourages “the most efficient energy transfer from handle to barrel for maximum ‘whip’ for a quicker bat and more power through the hitting zone,” according to the company’s Web site. The bat sells for $299. Wood bats sell for around $50.Young players generally seem to prefer hitting with metal bats. “There’s so much more pop to them,” said Pat Regan, shortstop for the Mavericks and the only current player who had been a teammate of Brandon Patch. “You hit longer balls. If you hit the ball on the handle with a wood bat, it’s a groundout to short. If you hit it on the handle with a metal, it can be a double. But metal bats should be outlawed. It puts lives in danger.”Scott Kvernum of Williston, N.D., was in the stands at Denton Field as his son’s team played recently against Miles City.“We’re a home-run-hitting team with metal bats, but with the wood bats we don’t have nearly the same pop,” he said. “It takes a big, strong man to poke one out with a wood bat. That’s why I’d like to see us playing here with metal bats.”His son, Devin, is a catcher. How would he feel if his son were a pitcher? “With metal bats?” he said. “Oh God, I’d be leery.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','The International Finance Facility for Immunizations, a proposal championed by the British, would call for wealthy nations to float bonds to raise revenue to pay for the vaccines needed in the developing world.A third concept, proposed by France, would use proceeds from a new airline ticket surcharge to buy drugs for poor countries. The French and British have supported each other’s proposals and have begun to enact them at a national level, without the imprimatur of the Group of 8. But the first proposal, which many experts hoped would be finalized at this meeting, is now in limbo.Before the meeting, international officials connected to the Advance Market Commitment plan accused the French of horse-trading, refusing to discuss it unless the Group of 8 leaders, and the United States in particular, agreed to consider the airline ticket tax on an equal basis. The French have denied the charge. “In principle, we are open to the proposal,” said Jerome Bonnafont, spokesman for President Jacques Chirac, although he said France still had “technical” concerns.Critics of the proposal, in Germany and France, have worried that if the amount of money guaranteed to drug companies is too high, the plan could become a gift for Western manufacturers, particularly those in the United States.As for the airline initiative, Mr. Bonnafont said, “We would like as many countries as possible to join our initiative.” But he said France was not creating a link between the proposals.The United States has not participated in the British proposal and has completely rejected the French idea.“Anything that smacks of a transnational tax is anathema to the U.S.,” said one official who was involved in the discussions.An airline tax would strain American airlines struggling with higher fuel costs and a downturn in business since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist hijackings. In contrast, the market plan might produce some business or benefits for American drug makers.Aid programs have recently focused on vaccines because preventing disease is cheaper than treating it. But most recently released vaccines, against viral diarrhea, for example, are too expensive for the poor countries where they would help most.“The market doesn’t work to get vaccines where they are needed,” said Amie Batson, a health specialist at the World Bank. “For manufacturers, the big risk is that these developing countries can’t pay high enough prices to cover their investments.”The Advanced Market Commitment seeks to address this flaw more directly, Ms. Batson said, by guaranteeing specific financial rewards to manufacturers that develop vaccines for diseases that primarily afflict the developing world, like malaria. The Group of 8 would essentially promise to pay manufacturers in advance for purchases by poor nations that wanted to use a new vaccine.In April, Group of 8 finance ministers endorsed that idea, selecting for a pilot project a new broad-spectrum vaccine, in the final stages of development, that would treat the pneumococcus bacteria, a cause of deadly infections in poor nations. They had expected to start the project this year.“It would be good if the G-8 could address these ideas together to create framework, rather than losing them all,” Dr. Von Schoen-Angerer said.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Stocks tumbled and oil prices soared as conflict in the Middle East shook up the markets, wiping out nearly all of the meager gains recorded by the major stock indexes for the year.Oil closed on Friday at $77.03 a barrel in New York, a record, and it traded above $78 during the day.The week’s market declines left the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index in negative territory for the year. Only the Dow Jones industrial average clung to an actual gain — and it was a scant 0.20 percentage point.The price of oil rippled through the market. Shares of Exxon Mobil, the oil giant, gained 3.31 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials. Alcoa, the aluminum company, which must make copious use of energy in its refining operations, declined by 8.2 percent, the worst performance in the Dow.For the week, the Dow shed 351.32 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 10,739.35. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index dropped 29.28 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,236.20. The Nasdaq composite index fell 92.71 points, or 4.4 percent, to close at 2,037.35.

"'06-07-16,'0','“We used to come here every year to sniff each other,” said the chief executive of another media company, who also did not want his name used. “Now, all these finance people are sniffing us.” With media stocks down virtually across the board, some may smell opportunity.James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, who has financed many of the largest corporate takeovers, seemed to be paying more attention than usual to the leveraged-buyout set this year.Among the private equity players invited this year were Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (who did not attend); John A. Canning Jr., chairman and chief executive of Madison Dearborn Partners; Stephen Pagliuca of Bain Capital; Jonathan M. Nelson of Providence Equity Partners; Timothy C. Collins, chief executive of Ripplewood Holdings; and William E. Ford, president of General Atlantic. Invitees from the hedge fund industry included Wesley R. Edens of the Fortress Investment Group; Sanford J. Colen of Apex Capital; John Griffin of Blue Ridge Capital; and Daniel Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management.And then there were the famed money managers like Mario J. Gabelli of Gamco Investors and Bill Miller of Legg Mason. In an age of increasing shareholder activism, such prominent institutional investors have greater influence as well. In case you were wondering, Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire financier who jousted with Time Warner earlier this year, didn’t get an invitation.Many of these investors have been to Sun Valley before, but they are grabbing more attention as their stature has grown. Even Larry Page, the Google co-founder who enjoyed rock-star treatment at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, seemed to have reverted to regular-guy status in Sun Valley — as regular as you can be with billions of dollars of Google stock.Mr. Nelson of Providence, at the conference for his second year, seemed to be buttonholed by nearly every media mogul for a walk around the grounds or a chat by the duck pond. His firm, which focuses on the media sector, is an investor with several other private equity firms in businesses like Warner Music and MGM. Most recently, it was part of the winning consortium in the auction for the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision.The Univision consortium also includes the media magnate — and Sun Valley attendee — Haim Saban, who made his fortune selling Fox Family to Disney after brokering the deal at an earlier Allen conference. At this year’s event, the winning consortium spent much of the week in meetings with representatives of Grupo Televisa, the losing bidder for Univision, to discuss Televisa’s plans for its stake in Univision.Other investors, like Mr. Och, Mr. Miller or Mr. Nevo — whose firm is the largest investor in Time Warner — were spotted throughout the conference hobnobbing with the likes of Robert S. Wiesenthal, the chief financial officer of the Sony Corporation of America, and Harvey Weinstein of the Weinstein Company.What are all these money men looking for? “Any opportunity to put our money to work — financing movies, new technologies, special projects and buyouts,” said one hedge fund/quasi-private equity fund manager.After leaving Miramax, Mr. Weinstein turned to hedge funds for much of the financing for his new company. Last week, Mr. Weinstein and Robert L. Johnson, founder of Black Entertainment Television, announced here that they were forming a joint venture to produce films for urban audiences. That means they are likely to be in the market for more financing.THIS year’s gathering continued to feed speculation about media deals, this time with private equity (that is, when attendees weren’t talking about Mr. Murdoch’s hair, newly dyed a youthful brown).Leslie Moonves of CBS is expected to sell his company’s Simon & Schuster book division — or possibly even its Infinity radio division. Both have the hallmarks of a tempting buyout target: steady cash flow that can be easily leveraged. There was renewed chatter about Time Warner’s AOL unit, a cash cow that is quickly deteriorating, after news that the company is (again) considering a range of possible strategies.Other properties that inspired crystal-ball-gazing were some of Viacom’s cable assets, since the business has not been performing as well as expected since its split with CBS. Also floating through the mountain air was the perpetual rumor about a buyout of EchoStar, the satellite television company owned by Charles W.

"'06-07-16,'0','Mr. Chasen was determined to build a company that would endure, which is why, despite Blackboard’s huge ambitions, he and his colleagues have relied on a conservative strategy and style. They may be disruptors, but they conduct themselves like diplomats.“How long have people been predicting that higher education was going to experience fundamental change or fall apart?” Mr. Chasen asked during an interview at his company’s headquarters in Washington. “But we are teaching and learning in much the same way we have for centuries. We don’t aim to ‘replace’ the classroom. We’re not looking to ‘revolutionize’ education. We help schools deliver more effectively what they are good at already.”There is no question that business has been good for Blackboard. The company, which introduced its first product in 1998, is on track to generate sales of more than $170 million in 2006, up from $93 million in 2003. Blackboard went public at $14 a share in June 2004 and its stock price has doubled, giving it a market value of $800 million.What’s striking about these results is that they have emerged from such a button-downed strategy.At the height of the first Internet boom, Mr. Chasen recalls, he and his co-founder, Matthew Serbin Pittinsky, Blackboard’s chairman, were under pressure to stop charging for their software — a formula for rapid (if money-losing) growth. They resisted, unlike many of their free-spirited rivals, most of whom were wiped out in the dot-com crash.“We thought we had created something of value, and we wanted to charge for it,” Mr. Chasen said. “Besides, we couldn’t figure out how to make money with ‘free.’ No matter how many zeroes we put into the spreadsheet, it all added up to zero.”Even the company’s name sends a reassuring message. Most of its current rivals — companies like eCollege.com, Desire2Learn, and Jenzabar — have identities that underscore their roots in the Internet era. Not so Mr. Chasen’s outfit. “A blackboard is one of the oldest platforms for teaching and learning,” he said. “We never presented ourselves as a ‘disruptive’ technology. Of course, if you look back on our impact, there’s no question that Blackboard has been a disruptive force.”Michael McCue, a co-founder and the C.E.O. of Tellme Networks, has also come to appreciate that the most effective way to champion a disruptive technology is to recognize the virtues of diplomacy. His company, based in Mountain View, Calif., is a classic Silicon Valley story.Neither he nor the other co-founder, Angus Davis, graduated from college. Yet they raised $250 million in venture capital to pursue a business plan named DialTone 2.0 — marrying telephones and the Internet to reshape how companies communicate with their customers and how individuals get information. (For example, E*Trade Financial uses Tellme to automate telephone requests for stock quotations, while Cingular Wireless uses Tellme for much of its “411” directory-assistance service.)The company, with annual revenue of more than $100 million, already handles two billion calls a year, up from roughly 800 million in 2004. “We have a technology that is as disruptive as anything could be to the telecommunications industry,” Mr. McCue said. “We’re trying to open up what has always been a closed network. We have a lot of ambition.”But its ambition does not inspire brash rhetoric or reckless business plans. “Being a disruptor is like running with nitroglycerin,” he said. “Sometimes you can go fast, but you’d better know when to slow down.”He speaks from experience. Back in the 90’s, Mr. McCue was vice president for technology at Netscape Communications, the ultimate symbol of disruptive competition. He watched as Netscape grew dramatically, brazenly challenged Microsoft’s hold on the computer business and experienced a devastating counterattack.“At Netscape, the competition with Microsoft was so severe, we’d wake up thinking about how we were going to deal with them, instead of how we would build something great for customers,” Mr. McCue said. “Basically, we mooned Microsoft. And man, did we pay. I vowed I would never let that happen again.”Early on at Tellme, according to Mr. McCue, his company faced a defining strategic choice: “Do we say, ‘To heck with the old guard; we’re going for the gusto’? Or do we work with the old guard and bring them along?” He decided on the second course, even if it meant passing on some early opportunities for growth. “If you try to make too much happen too quickly, you get arrogant,” he said. “That’s why I’m not going for market share at all costs. Being a disruptor means being patient.”Stephen J. Sills, president and chief executive of Darwin Professional Underwriters, has been a disruptive force for two decades in an industry infamous for its patience. His new company, which went public in May, specializes in insurance for some decidedly high-profile risks: medical malpractice, directors-and-officers liability, errors-and-omissions policies for negligence claims against lawyers, managed-care organizations and police departments.It has also started an Internet service, i-bind, to automate the underwriting process for agents who do business with small and midsize organizations in these product lines.As he squares off against the industry giants, Mr. Sills advances a break-the-mold agenda. He says his business strategy is to identify “loose bricks” — gaps in coverage, price and customer service that the establishment ignores. He has not been afraid to hire insurance outsiders — rare in this insular field — on the theory that fresh eyes uncover new opportunities.His company’s headquarters, in Farmington, Conn., feels like that of a high-tech start-up, with bright colors, a business-casual atmosphere and a bell that rings when the company lands a new account. “You can’t grow big with a me-too strategy,” Mr. Sills said. “If our competitors were doing their job, we wouldn’t need to exist.”STILL, despite Darwin’s challenges to the status quo, the talk at the company is of evolution, not entrepreneurial revolution — hence the name. Mr. Sills has the benefit of patient capital. He started the business in partnership with the Alleghany Corporation, a low-profile, 77-year-old holding company that has owned everything from railroads to real estate. And he has been careful not to project a brand identity based on a harsh critique of prevailing industry practices. In most businesses, and certainly in the insurance business, customers look for reassurance as well as reform.“There’s plenty of room for change in this business,” Mr. Sills said. “But people don’t want to feel foolish for buying what they’ve been buying. If you execute properly in the gaps where the big guys aren’t doing it, there’s a world of opportunity.”It’s a new twist on an old idea: Talk softly, even when you carry big ambitions for your company.'"

"'06-07-16,'0','In another high-profile accident, the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger suffered a broken jaw and other injuries in a collision with a car in Pittsburgh on June 12. He had no helmet or motorcycle license.Last month, the California Highway Patrol began a campaign to alert car drivers to watch out for motorcycles, noting that the number of motorcycle crashes rose 31 percent in the state while those of other motor vehicles went down. Motorcycle deaths in Los Angeles, mirroring a nationwide increase in fatalities, almost doubled from 1999 to 2003, to 73.Experts say it is unclear exactly why motorcycle riding in general has become so deadly, and a four-year national study is set to start this summer at Oklahoma State University to look into the causes. But health and highway-patrol officials in California, as well as riders themselves, say that the contributing factors are higher numbers of inexperienced riders and more traffic coupled with multitasking car drivers trying to talk on the phone, check their BlackBerries and steer at the same time. Health officials in Los Angeles also single out S.U.V.’s, because motorcycles are less visible to drivers sitting high in their vehicles.Dr. Cesar A. Aristeiguieta, director of the California Emergency Medical Services Authority and a rider himself, said the advent of “very fast, very maneuverable” high performance motorcycles has also led to more accidents, because many bikes now out-skill their owners, particularly on challenging mountain roadways.What this means for many motorcyclists, from the ones having a midlife crisis to the brash 25-year-olds who believe they were born to ride, is that their safety checklist is growing longer: padded pants and jackets, to minimize injury in a crash; louder tailpipes and more lights, to be better heard and seen; and a buddy or two, for safety in numbers.Dan Thomas, 24, who commutes on a motorcycle 64 miles to work and back, is decked out like a souped-up astronaut on most days. He wears black protective boots, black padded leathers — pants, jacket and gloves — and a multicolored helmet that completely shields his boyish face. Three of his friends had accidents over a three-month period this year, he explained, and “I’m the only one left to go down.”One of the friends was Jules Neale, 23, who broke an ankle in April while racing on a track in the rain but is now back in the saddle. To appease his worried wife, Mr. Neale said, he bought disability insurance and agreed not to ride in the rain anymore.Longtime riders remember when motorcycling was more relaxing — fewer cars, not as many brand-new riders getting into trouble and no helmet laws. (In California, helmets are required.) More than one million Californians are now licensed to drive motorcycles in the state, compared with about 865,000 in 2001.Mr. Bennett, the Harley Riders club member, who has ridden for much of his 59 years, noted that some of his peers have found a new group to snub: “They don’t wave to new Harley riders now.”Mr. Bennett tarnished his own record a couple of years ago when a car crashed into him as it was pulling out of a driveway. (He broke his clavicle.) Shortly before that, he had a minor scrape with a novice Harley rider who ran into him as he waited at a red light during one of the club rides. (Mr. Bennett’s Hog needed $700 in repairs.)Mr. Bennett has taken a defensive approach to the new reality by customizing his Harley-Davidson like a Christmas tree, with no fewer than eight lights in front and nine in back, some of them blinking. “Visibility is key to avoid being hit,” he said.Many riders still see car drivers as Enemy No. 1. “I grew up with video games, and when I get on my motorcycle, I look at every car as my competition, trying to take me out,” said George Olivos, 37, a business owner who took up riding six months ago. “What is this guy going to do? What is this other guy going to do?”Car drivers, in turn, say bikers are the dangerous ones. Officer Ricardo Quintero, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol, said motorists commonly complain that motorcyclists ride too fast and too erratically. “They say they’re trying to make a lane change and these guys are coming by at 50 miles per hour,” he said.Some motorcyclists say they feel safer riding in groups because they are more visible. One recent Sunday, six members of Women on Wheels, a social club for motorcyclists, prepared to ride together along the “twisties” of the Angeles Crest Highway, which winds through the San Gabriel Mountains. The women usually make sure to avoid riding too early in the day to keep clear of “squids,” reckless riders known for speeding, tailgating and passing at turns.The group of women, in their 30’s, 40’s and 50’s, included a scientist, an engineer and a school counselor, though any evidence of age or personal style soon disappeared underneath helmets and behind mounds of padded gear. For them, the outings are an escape from job stress and as one put it, “from the normal.”“It’s like skiing,” said Nancy Novak, 54. “It takes you out in the environment and it’s a mental vacation.”For some club members, riding also makes good sense. Dominique Fourguette, who does aerospace research, some days commutes 25 miles to her office by motorcycle because she gets 30 miles to the gallon, compared with 25 in her car. She also shaves a third to a half of the time from her trip. As a bonus, she has perks denied to car drivers: in California, motorcyclists can split lanes to ride between cars when traffic is backed up, and they can use the car pool lane even while riding solo.“I can’t stand being stuck,” she said.Because no one likes to be stuck, some motorcyclists say they notice more hostility coming from car drivers, like when they drift to the edge of a lane to block off a motorcycle. Even when drivers are not gunning for motorcycles, they sometimes seem to be blind to them, some riders said. “You make eye contact and they still continue to pull in front of you,” said the Rev. Richard E. Fish, a lifelong rider who ministers to fellow motorcyclists at the Live Ride Christian Church in Simi Valley.Despite the tougher environment and their own misgivings — some motorcycle riders bleakly refer to themselves as organ donors and their bikes as murdercycles — the one thing many bikers won’t do is quit.Mr. Thomas, who broke his collarbone in an accident soon after he got his first motorcycle at 16, says he comes from a long line of riders and is not about to give up that tradition. Riders like Mr. Bennett argue that there is such a thing as safe motorcycling, as long as riders adhere to principles like always yielding the right of way to cars.But riders like Mr. Fish, 42, who broke his back, a leg and several ribs in a 1997 accident with a driver making an illegal turn, say there is no denying that motorcycling is an increasingly dangerous way to get around. “My wife is pretty resigned to the idea that I’ll probably die on my motorcycle,” he said.And him? “I’d rather die doing that than in a convalescent home wearing diapers.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Re Laura Schenone’s article about her son’s school difficulties (“An ‘A’ That’s Not a Scarlet Letter,” Generations, July 9): I have learned during many years of clinical practice that most so-called learning disabilities are in reality hard-wiring differences in acquisition and processing of information, nothing more.They become “more” when kids whose wiring is atypical receive negative attention for something that is in no way their fault and that they’re powerless to do anything about without the help of properly educated professionals.

McKenzi, Hempstead, N.Y.A “It is very important to review a co-op’s most recent financial statements, as well as the building’s offering plan and its rules and regulations before signing a contract to buy,” said Elliott Meisel, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer. “Contracts usually contain a representation that the buyer has reviewed all relevant information before signing the contract so as to insulate the seller from any claims that the buyer didn’t know what he or she was getting into.”Typically, Mr. Meisel said, such a review can be conducted based upon documents that the seller should have available. If not, the prospective buyer should be able to get them from the managing agent, who may charge a fee for photocopying them.“The financials will reveal whether the building is meeting its annual expenses and will indicate whether it will have to increase its maintenance charges in the future to do so,” Mr. Meisel said.“They will also show whether the building has adequate reserves to meet anticipated or unforeseen repairs, improvements and other extraordinary expenses, or whether it will have to impose assessments or increase borrowing to meet those expenses.”Q I was the treasurer of our co-op until recently when I was re-elected to the board and accepted the office of secretary.

"'06-07-16,'0','Salt marsh cordgrass is an intertidal plant (it grows at elevations between low tide and high tide). While this species receives a daily bath of seawater, it prefers the upper half of the intertidal zone, and it does not tolerate constant inundation.Along the coasts of Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, the rate of relative sea level rise is about two to four millimeters per year. Over a period of 50 years these rates yield water level increases of approximately four to eight inches.The vertical growth of the marsh surface may not be able to keep pace with higher water levels if sediment input is insufficient. The result is drowned and dying cordgrass.As the rate of sea level rise accelerates because of global warming, the inundation and conversion of coastal marshes to open water will far exceed the current dieback-related losses along the East Coast. The disappearance of thousands of acres of wetlands will be a grim reminder that we are changing the planet.How Much Risk Is Too Little?In your article about children, sports and parents’ reactions to injuries (“Balancing Play and Safety,” July 9), Dr. Barry Goldberg, a member of Little League’s national board of directors and the director of sports medicine at Yale Health Services, said, “We’ve eliminated metal spikes, the on-deck circle, the headfirst slide,” and, “We’ve required emergency plans and recommended different balls, face masks, breakaway bases.”Why not also outlaw bats, balls, hats and gloves and send the children home to play virtual baseball on their computers, where they will be safe from, gasp, getting a scratch on their precious bodies or even, horror of horrors, sustaining a broken arm or leg?Dr. Goldberg’s words are a sad commentary on what we are doing to our children in the current overprotective, litigious environment in which we live.'"

"'06-07-16,'0','that moment, was a front-page headline in that morning’s New York Post, which blared: “KING OF BLING BUSTED — JACOB THE JEWELER IN COKE-CASH RAP.”Paraphrasing the story for a visitor, Mr. Wolf described how Jacob Arabo, an immigrant from Uzbekistan whose creations had draped Madonna, Diddy and other performers, was being accused of laundering money for a drug network in Detroit. “That,” he said with assurance, “will be a ‘Law & Order’ next year.”While Mr. Wolf was signaling that he will continue, as he has from the inception of “Law & Order,” to rely on real-life headlines to seed the plots for the coming season, many other elements of the shows will be unfamiliar to regular viewers. During this summer’s hiatus, “the brand,” as he is fond of calling the original and its spinoffs, is undergoing its most sweeping makeover since “Law & Order” first appeared on NBC in September 1990. Among television dramas, its uninterrupted run is second only to that of “Gunsmoke,” which ran from 1955 to 1975 on CBS. Little wonder that it is now seeking an infusion of energy sufficient to lure back old viewers and win new ones.“It did start to show some age last year,” Kevin Reilly, the president of NBC Entertainment, said in an interview, referring specifically to the ratings for the original “Law & Order,” though he could well have been talking about the brand as a whole. “I just think next year it could use a little bit of an ‘x’ factor to make it pop.”Thus when the mother ship, as the original “Law & Order” is known backstage, sets sail on NBC again this fall, two stars, Dennis Farina and Annie Parisse, will be gone. They are being replaced by two actresses cast by Mr. Wolf: Milena Govich (late of “Conviction”) and Alana De La Garza (whose character on “CSI: Miami” was killed off last season).The show will also move from Wednesdays at 10 to Fridays at 10, where it will no longer have to go up against “CSI: NY,” which, with an audience of about 14 million, outdrew “Law & Order” by about three million viewers a week last season.On “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” which is more centered on the psychology of crime than the original, Vincent D’Onofrio and Chris Noth will again alternate episodes playing lead detectives. But Mr. Noth’s character will have a new partner (Julianne Nicholson of “Conviction,” who replaces Annabella Sciorra). And both characters will report to a new commanding officer (Jamey Sheridan is leaving but has not yet been replaced) and will deal with a new assistant district attorney (Nona Gaye, who replaces Courtney B. Vance).Even “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” the most popular show in the franchise with a viewership just shy of “CSI: NY,” will undergo a short-term casting change. Mariska Hargitay, who has received Emmy nominations over the last three seasons for her portrayal of a sex-crimes detective, will miss six of the first nine episodes. She recently gave birth to her first child, and her character will be replaced temporarily by a warrants detective played by Connie Nielsen.“I see all of this as an opportunity,” Mr. Wolf said before being consumed by a wheezy, self-deprecating laugh. “It’s an opportunity, unless you choose badly.”While the scale of those casting changes may be unusually high, Mr. Wolf has long been regarded as among the most skillful producers at helping acclimate audiences to new characters — whether it was Paul Sorvino replacing George Dzundza in the role of detective after Season One of the original series (followed by Jerry Orbach the following year), or Sam Waterston’s Jack McCoy breaking in no fewer than four assistant district attorneys over the last decade. “If the past is any example,” said Mr. Waterston, who joined the cast in 1994, “it’s always been fresh wind coming out of these changes, though it’s been crummy to say goodbye.”Mr. Wolf seemed less sentimental. When Ms. Parisse, whose character served as Mr. Waterston’s most recent sidekick, approached the producers last season to say she wanted to leave to pursue a movie career, Mr. Wolf said, his reaction was blunt. “It was: ‘Oh, thank you for coming in early. You don’t mind if we kill you, do you?’ ” he recalled. In the season finale, viewers saw Ms. Parisse’s character end up dead in the trunk of a car, a casualty of a drug-and-murder investigation left unresolved in anticipation of next season.One element of “Law & Order” that sets it apart from many of its competitors is Mr. Wolf’s insistence that the show limit references to the main characters’ back stories, to keep the focus on the crime du jour. Thus over the course of 12 seasons viewers have learned little about Mr. Waterston’s McCoy beyond passing references to his love of the Chicago Bulls, his divorce and his daughter. Mr. Wolf noted that on “NYPD Blue,” by contrast, Dennis Franz’s Andy Sipowicz, an alcoholic, lost a wife and son to violence.“Those shows had to keep raising the bar,” he said. “When you flirt with getting into much more character-driven stuff, you end up having to go higher and higher to get the same effect. It’s like drugs.”And yet with two new characters appearing this fall on the mother ship, Mr. Wolf said he had little choice but to devote some time to telling audiences who they are. Early on, viewers will learn that the detective played by Ms. Govich had a father and two brothers on the police force and that she herself got her gold shield with lightning speed. “Saturday morning at 9 o’clock, she’s getting her hair done,” Mr. Wolf said, setting the scene staccato-style. “A guy comes in to rob the salon. Starts pistol-whipping the girl at the front desk. She pulls her gun. He turns on her. And she drops him.”In addition to the relative inexperience of Ms. Govich’s detective, Mr. Wolf said the writers would mine the racial tension between her character, who is white, and her partner and boss, who are black. Similarly, the writers will emphasize that the assistant district attorney played by Ms. De La Garza is Hispanic.“Now, for better or worse, half the cast is female, and half the cast are diversified, to use the NBC word,” Mr. Wolf said.In creating the “Law & Order” brand, Mr. Wolf drew heavily on his experience in his 20’s as an advertising executive in New York City, where, he says, he was responsible for such slogans as “You can’t beat Crest for fighting cavities.”He later moved to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter, a period in which he satisfied his curiosity about true-crime stories by following a homicide detective around. “I wanted to see one of every different kind of murder,” he said, adding that his research took him to 15 crime scenes. That fascination eventually led to jobs as a writer on “Hill Street Blues” and as the show runner — a show’s day-to-day manager — on “Miami Vice.”A native of Manhattan, Mr. Wolf now splits his time between an apartment in New York, where “Law & Order” is produced, and a home in Santa Barbara, Calif., near where it is written and edited. Mr. Wolf, whose two previous marriages ended in divorce, was married last month to Noelle Lippman, a fashion publicist.That Mr. Wolf remains a hands-on executive producer, even after nearly two decades, was made clear to Ms. Govich during the casting for “Conviction” last year, when he ordered her to report at 6:30 one morning for a screen test on the “Law & Order” set in New York.“He came in, took a look at the monitor as we were shooting and gave me some adjustments — more this way, more that way,” she said. “It was very helpful to know the man in charge is telling you what he wanted.”Mr. Wolf’s high level of engagement may give the shows a unified voice, but it can also be wearing on those network executives responsible for putting them on the air, and occasionally taking them off.“Dick is passionate, particular, demanding — very demanding, extremely demanding,” said Mr. Reilly of NBC Entertainment, who first worked with Mr. Wolf as a network development executive during the series’s first season. “He also probably has the best understanding of the broadcast business of any show runner I’ve ever come across. Which sometimes makes it difficult to debate with him or to maneuver over him with network hocus-pocus.”Both men acknowledge that when Mr. Reilly telephoned Mr. Wolf last year to tell him that the network was canceling “Law & Order: Trial by Jury” after only half a season, the conversation was volatile. “I wouldn’t say it was a high-water mark for the relationship,” Mr. Reilly said. “I don’t want to spend a lot of time talking about it.” Mr. Wolf said only that he was disappointed that NBC did not market the show as aggressively as he would have liked.This past season, Mr. Reilly agreed to support “Conviction” with far more promotion than had been the case with “Trial by Jury.” But Mr. Wolf said the series was ultimately doomed by its time slot, on Friday nights, when few of the young viewers the network was trying to attract, à la “Grey’s Anatomy,” were home to watch.Still, said Mr. Wolf, “It would be unseemly to complain when you’ve got three other shows on the network.” He might have added that reruns of “Law & Order” and its offshoots, all owned by NBC Universal, have at times fed three of NBC’s cable channels — USA, Bravo and even Sci Fi — as well as TNT, all of which have combined to make Mr. Wolf very wealthy.And yet, in an interview last month, he could not resist nipping at the hand that rewards him so handsomely. “Did you see the N.H.L. numbers?” he asked in reference to the ratings for the National Hockey League finals on NBC on a recent night. “Do you know what NBC did at 8 o’clock?” he asked. “A one” — meaning one ratings point, or about 1.3 million viewers between 18 and 49.Similarly, he said the losses experienced by the original “Law & Order” and “Criminal Intent” were at least partly attributable to the weak lead-ins they received from NBC’s anemic prime-time schedule, which finished the season ranked fourth among the four major broadcast networks for the second year in a row, after a decade at No. 1. (And “Criminal Intent” had to compete not only with “Desperate Housewives” but also with “The Sopranos” for part of the year.)For all the tinkering he has been doing this summer, Mr. Wolf knows that the fate of his franchise may ultimately be out of his hands, determined instead by the performance of the network’s new slate of fall shows, including a comedy from Tina Fey called “30 Rock” and a drama from Aaron Sorkin called “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip.”“As soon as they get a couple of hits, there will be more promo time,” he said, meaning that spots on the new shows could be used to help boost the old. “I hope it works.”“You have to understand,” he added, “I am the biggest rooter for anything that ends up working on the network.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','That theory will be tested on July 26 when they make their feature film debut with “Little Miss Sunshine,” a gently madcap dysfunctional-family road-trip comedy. Last winter the remarkably unembellished indie — with an ensemble cast including Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Greg Kinnear and Alan Arkin — was a big crowd-pleaser at the Sundance Film Festival, where it sparked a four-studio bidding war.When the smoke had cleared, Fox Searchlight had put up $10.5 million for the worldwide distribution rights, reportedly the richest one-picture deal in Sundance history. “It blew our minds,” said Ms. Faris, who is 48 and from Los Angeles.“It still blows our minds,” said Mr. Dayton, who is 49 and from Oakland.In conversation, Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton sometimes finish each other’s sentences and answer questions simultaneously, the words of one coming a beat late, sounding like stereo speakers slightly out of sync.“The remarkable thing about Val and Jonathan is how they interact so completely as two bodies, one brain,” said Peter Saraf, a producer of “Little Miss Sunshine.” “The fact is they have two quite different brains. They don’t always agree, but they always find common ground.”Ms. Faris is direct and earthy, Mr. Dayton cool and flinty. They have been married for 18 years, an eternity by movie industry standards. And teamwork is not a term usually associated with movie directing. “You’re called on to make so many decisions, all of which will come back to haunt you,” Mr. Saraf said. “What Jonathan and Val have achieved is a partnership that takes the loneliness out of it.”In their case, Mr. Saraf said, sleeping with the director really does help. “Having someone around to second-guess your decisions and affirm things that go right makes the job easier and more pleasurable, and ultimately helps the picture. That can only come from a shared vision and years of working together.”Mr. Arkin, in a recent telephone interview, said the couple’s working relationship fit his definition of a good marriage: “After all the rules are laid down and you realize you trust each other, you can start giving up the rules.”Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton gave up the rules not long after they met at U.C.L.A. in 1980. He was in film school; she was a dance major with a Hollywood pedigree. Her grandfather had been an electrician on “The Wizard of Oz,” “Gone With the Wind” and “Rebecca”; her father, a sound editor on Tom and Jerry cartoons. She remembers him sitting at the kitchen table, mulling over the sound Tom should make falling off a cliff and splatting on an asphalt highway.She and Mr. Dayton met semi-cute. Pebbles Wadsworth, then executive director of the U.C.L.A. Center for the Performing Arts, suggested they join forces on a promotional film highlighting the season’s best live shows. They collaborated on a 10-minute film and went on to make documentaries — about a dancer in Martha Graham’s company, an eccentric lawyer building a five-story castle for himself in the Hollywood Hills and a perpetual college student, Frank H. Sprague, who had briefly been Mr. Dayton’s college roommate.When he moved in with Mr. Dayton, he was 40 and his extended academic career had spanned 22 years. “He was one of those people who really did what you’re supposed to do in life but never reaped any of the benefits,” Mr. Dayton said. “There was a whole universe hidden in this invisible character.”Alas, the roommate’s never-ending student life ended a few years back in a derelict Hollywood studio apartment. “He died in his underwear clutching a Hershey bar,” reported Mr. Dayton, whom the police asked to identify the body.Ms. Faris was dancing in a Los Angeles troupe and Mr. Dayton was selling used clothes in Santa Monica when they got their big break. The fledgling network MTV hired them to help create a series of cinéma vérité rockumentaries. Though the couple subsequently produced a “Spinal Tap”-like exploration of the Los Angeles heavy-metal scene, Mr. Dayton insists that “we had no desire to make music videos.”They did, nonetheless. The most inspired were a black-and-white sendup of “Attack of the 50-Foot Woman” (for Neil Finn’s “She Will Have Her Way”) and a Grammy-winning homage to the 1902 Georges Méliès short “A Trip to the Moon” (for the Smashing Pumpkins’ “Tonight, Tonight”) For verisimilitude, they used a Mitchell hand-cranked camera from that era.In the winter of 2002 Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton were among 15 directors considered for “Sunshine.” They had both fallen in love with Michael Arndt’s screenplay, in which quarrelsome relatives (chirpy child, annoying dad, suicidal gay uncle, heroin-addled grandpa, etc.) in a Volkswagen camper band together on their bumpy way from Albuquerque to San Diego for a prepubescent beauty pageant.Ms. Faris: “The script made me laugh a lot, and by the end, I got choked up.”Mr. Dayton: “It was the first time I read something I felt was for us.”Marc Turtletaub and David T. Friendly, two of the producers, evidently felt the same way. Ms. Faris and Ms. Dayton were signed and developed “Sunshine” over the next two and a half years with Focus Features. Perhaps “developed” is the wrong word. The two camps clashed over everything from casting to locations — Focus wanted the movie to be filmed in Canada, where it had made “Brokeback Mountain,” to save money. Over the directors’ objections, the studio brought in another screenwriter to rework the story.In the fall of 2004, with no bankable stars attached and studio executives worried about the film’s overseas potential, Focus dropped out. “The project went into turnaround,” Mr. Dayton said.Ms. Faris recalled, “We spent many months being very depressed that this thing would never get made.”Fortunately, Mr. Turtletaub intervened. Early last year he bought “Sunshine” back from Focus and announced that he would cover the $8 million budget himself. He also brought back Ms. Faris, Mr. Dayton and Mr. Arndt. “This little film dodged every bullet,” Mr. Arndt said. “There were about a hundred of them.”Even when the project was given the go-ahead, veterans on the set were skeptical. “I’ve had my share of first-timers,” Mr. Arkin said. “I wondered if Val and Jonathan would be prepared to take on the responsibility of running a small country.”As it turned out, they were. They had broken down scenes together in the garage of their Pacific Palisades home, between the Ping-Pong table and the bikes of their three children.“Val and Jonathan knew what they wanted,” Mr. Kinnear said. And they knew what they didn’t want: technical dazzle. “Nothing on screen moves your eye away from the performances or the story,” he said.Their professionalism impressed the jaded Mr. Arkin. “Everything about the production felt good and comfortable, and Val and Jonathan were enormously amiable,” he said. “At the cast party, people cried. In a half-century of making movies, I’ve hardly ever seen that.”Whether audiences will be similarly moved is not yet known. But if “Sunshine” fades fast at the box office, Ms. Faris and Mr. Dayton can always fall back on videos and commercials. “This may be a one-shot deal,” Mr. Dayton conceded.“With us,” Ms. Faris said with a small shrug, “it’s not about a meteoric rise.”Mr. Dayton nodded. “We like being under the radar.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','This summer, the role of art in explaining the animal world seems to be a tantalizing subject for museums, explored in “Fierce Friends: Artists and Animals, 1750-1900,” at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, and to a narrower extent in “Best in Show,” an exhibition of dog art at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn.That role evolved over generations, as artists’ ways of seeing changed and scientists’ ways of thinking grew. Art affected science, and science affected art. As with all good evolution, sometimes it’s difficult to separate out all the influences, to tell which was affecting which.Even the distinction between artist and scientist was blurred, said Louise Lippincott, curator of fine arts at the Carnegie Museum and co-curator of the exhibition. Painters like George Stubbs and Charles Willson Peale were self-taught botanists and zoologists. “There were quite a lot of artists that could be considered scientists,” she said. “And a great number of scientists who were also extremely skilled artists.”One of the goals of the exhibition, Ms. Lippincott said, was to show just how crucial artists were in helping scientists classify the natural world.In his earliest volumes, Linnaeus, the botanist who developed the classification system that is still used, rejected the use of illustration.“He opposed it, thinking words were a more accurate form of description,” Ms. Lippincott said.It took artists like Georges Cuvier, who were fascinated by comparative anatomy (a Cuvier study of crocodile skulls is included in the exhibition), to show just how useful art could be to scientists. But as the giraffe painting illustrates, art could also be useful to the public at large. The Carnegie exhibition, especially, includes many other examples of art’s role in basic science education: paintings that portray an antelope in all its grace, a hyena in its bare-toothed ferocity, a rhinoceros in its antediluvian weirdness.In a sense, though, the beauty of those portraits was only skin deep. Both scientists and artists were slowly learning that most animals were — like the highest species, humans — complex creatures with a lot going on inside.Perhaps animals can’t express emotion (although if you’ve ever heard a dog whimper or been disrespected by a cat, it’s difficult to believe they can’t). But at the very least, animals can mirror human emotion. And animal art went beyond straight portraiture to show this.Jean-Baptiste Oudry’s “Bitch Hound Nursing Her Puppies,” painted in 1752, is an early example — an intimate portrait of a protective mother. Today its emotional content seems quite ordinary. But we live in a pet-centric society and have imbued our dogs, in particular, with all sorts of emotions. In 18th-century Paris, the public still thought of animals as, essentially, mindless creatures. The painting caused a sensation.The intimacy of a mother with her pups is easy to see. But other animals, in other situations, can be difficult to read. A good artist can help. Delacroix could wring the sadness from a couple of dead horses on the battlefield, as in “Evening After the Battle,” from around 1825. Théodore Géricault’s portrait “A Horse Frightened by Lightning,” circa 1814, depicts the horse’s response to a thunderstorm with the barest of touches: a downward cast of the eyes, a trace of froth at the mouth.It still doesn’t matter whether we think that animal is expressing some kind of emotion or just having a visceral reaction — a panic attack brought on by a thunderclap, with neurons firing, hormones released, the heart going into overdrive. Géricault is deftly allowing us to see our emotions in the horse. The horse is frightened, we think; therefore it is.That idea of mirroring reached its high point — some might say its nadir — with portraits of primates. That’s to be expected, perhaps, because humans are primates, too. So if we want to see emotions that resemble ours most closely, we should look at apes and monkeys.“The Jury of Apes,” Gabriel Max’s 1889 portrait of different species of apes gathered on a crate, conveys a range of emotions through the faces — disgust and disdain among them.Of course, as the painting’s title implies, Max was using the animals to convey his own disgust and disdain with a juried art exhibition in Munich that year. That’s the thing about paintings of primates: monkeys and apes are enough like humans that artists were unable to resist using them as proxies, often to withering effect.So in the 1837 painting “The Experts,” Alexandre-Gabriel Descamps painted a group of apes dressed in human clothing dissecting an artist’s work.In “The Monkey as Painter” from around 1740, Jean-Siméon Chardin went a step further. The animal is shown, brush in hand, working on a canvas in the studio, a look of extreme insecurity on its face. That might have been the 18th-century equivalent of a cheap shot. But one can hardly blame the artist for taking it: insecurity is a relatively easy thing to mirror. As are fear, protectiveness and sadness.What we are learning about animals these days is much more difficult to represent in image. Perhaps that’s the main reason animal art is so different now. Conveying basic feelings is old hat. But how do artists portray an elephant’s ability to learn and mimic sounds so it can recognize a family member even after years apart? How do they represent a swift’s innate ability to know when it can safely leave the nest? Or express a dung beetle’s ability to use the moon to find its way home?It’s hard to fault artists if they don’t even want to try.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Though it’s fairly obvious which category “Pants-Off Dance-Off” falls into, Tad Low, the show’s creator and executive producer, said that there was more to its success than the potential for exposed flesh. “It’s about the lack of slickness in the production values and in the dancing that makes it so charming,” said Mr. Low, who also created VH1’s “Pop-Up Video,” which superimposed trivia bubbles on popular music videos. “Instead of having quick cuts, let the camera stay in one place and let the dancer do all the work.”And in contrast to the unattainable standards of perfection promoted by celebrity television, “Pants-Off Dance-Off” is meant to be an inclusive experience, one that has already welcomed competitors as diverse as a 58-year-old retired schoolteacher and a woman in a unicorn mask. “If you show up, you get to dance,” Mr. Campbell said. “I’m not saying we’ll use everyone, but we’ll keep the doors open.”In search of contestants, the producers handed out fliers at rock concerts and plumbed the depths of Internet message boards on Craigslist, Yahoo and MSN. Lea Schroeder, a genetics lab manager who moonlights as a burlesque artist under the pseudonym Pinkie Special (and who appeared on the show under the spelling Pinky), was recruited by a fellow performer. “I was, like, ‘You want me to strip and you’re going to give me two hundred dollars? That sounds excellent,’ ” said Ms. Schroeder, who appeared on the program twirling a hoop to the Chemical Brothers’ “Galvanize.” “I don’t get two hundred bucks just doing a regular show.”Mr. Wong found “Pants-Off Dance-Off” in a more roundabout manner: after dropping out of medical school in Northern California, he took up a few unusual pursuits before returning to New York, working briefly as a cameraman for pornographic films and attending a nude retreat in the Caribbean. After the vacation he joined a naturist e-mail list, through which he eventually discovered an open casting call for the show.“I had done the naturist thing,” Mr. Wong recalled, “and I’d been working out, so I was feeling pretty confident about myself by now.”The “Pants-Off Dance-Off” producers were also confident that they would find a ready and willing pool of exhibitionists. “My whole thing about casting these shows is if you build it, they will come,” said Emanuel Bosgang, a supervising producer who has also worked on reality programming for Bravo, Oxygen and Animal Planet. “It doesn’t really matter what the show is. You’ll find the people; they’re out there.” Though some hesitant candidates dropped out during the interview process, Mr. Bosgang said, “Everybody who made it to the studio was, like: ‘Where’s the camera? I’m ready for my close-up.’ ”But some performers say they were not fully prepared for what followed. Ms. Schroeder said that she was asked to tape both completely nude and nonnude versions of her dance routine, a request that surprised her but did not stop her. “It was a little weird, but it was just too exciting,” she said. “This is going to be on TV, so who cares? They’re going to blur it out.” (A publicist for Fuse said that the pilot episode of “Pants-Off Dance-Off” used blurred nudity but that no completely nude dances were taped for its regular episodes.)Dawn, a contestant from Jackson, N.J. (who asked that her last name not be given), said that she kept her underwear on during her taping but that the video of her performance that appeared on Fuse’s Web site had been pixelated, suggesting that she had gone bottomless. “I thought I’d be on the Web site fully dressed,” she said, “and it looks as if I’m taking off my underwear. So I’m not happy about that.” (The blurred-out version of Dawn’s routine has since been removed from the site.)Even if it does not quite deliver the skin implied by its title, “Pants-Off Dance-Off” has clearly taken off: since its debut on April 18, it has boosted Fuse’s ratings by as much as 91 percent in some time slots, and it generated more than 1.1 million video downloads from its Web site in May alone. And as Fuse executives prepare for a second season of the show (scheduled for the fall), they are experimenting with ways to make it more interactive, from expanded back-story segments about the contestants to college and citywide dance tournaments. “We want to give viewers more ways to root for people,” said Catherine Mullen, the station’s general manager.That seems to be Fuse’s strategy for recruiting guest hosts as well: a series of best-of episodes, beginning July 18, will have as host Jodie Sweetin, the former “Full House” star who made news earlier this year when she admitted she had been addicted to methamphetamines. Ms. Sweetin said her appearance on the program was “tweaking the ‘Full House’ persona,” but she added: “It’s a fun dance contest, and I hope people won’t think that I’m trying to make some statement with it. I’m just trying to have fun.”Mr. Wong, the “Pants-Off Dance-Off” champion, said that he too had appeared on the show for fun, and that after career detours in pornography, nudism and yoga, he realized that was the only sensible motivation. “I think I told my dad I was doing the show, but my parents don’t really watch cable or anything. I don’t think I can shock them anymore. I try to get their attention, and I think they’re just bored at this point.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','In collaboration with the gifted journalist Azadeh Moaveni, Ebadi, who in 2003 became the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, has written a memoir that is both a deft history of postrevolutionary Iran and a genuinely intimate recollection. It is fast-paced, suspenseful and spare, its details memorable and well chosen. And it is a story that encapsulates the harsh choices that face those who live and fight for change within the Islamic Republic of Iran.One thing Ebadi did not expect from the new Islamic penal code was that it would cast a pall over her marriage. ""The day Javad and I married each other, we joined our lives together as two equal individuals,"" she writes. ""But under these laws, he stayed a person and I became chattel. They permitted him to divorce me at whim, take custody of our future children, acquire three wives and stick them in the house with me.""She knew her husband had no intention of doing any of these things, but the imbalance of power between them drove her to distraction. At length, she came up with a solution: she took him to a notary's office, where he signed away the new rights the Islamic Republic had given him.""Why are you doing this?"" the astonished notary asked.""My decision is irrevocable,"" Ebadi's husband replied. ""I want to save my life.""The decade after the revolution was a crucible of war and repression. For Ebadi, it was marked above all by the political imprisonment and murder of a family member. She recounts that episode with the mixture of outrage and empathy that would fuel her return to legal practice in the 1990's, by which time Iran's leaders had realized they needed their female lawyers and law professors.Ebadi shouldered the country's most intractable human rights cases pro bono. She pored over religious texts to argue against particular interpretations of Koranic injunctions by insisting that within Islam, other more just or less discriminatory interpretations were possible. She did this not because she had warmed to the Islamic penal code or to the idea of religious interpretation as a foundation for the law, but because her cases were pressing and her intellectual vanity was not.Ebadi represents the family of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian journalist who was killed in police custody in 2003. She herself was imprisoned in the course of her work on the case of a student who was beaten to death by paramilitaries during a 1999 protest. When a number of dissident intellectuals were murdered under mysterious circumstances in the late 1990's, Ebadi took on one of the most significant of those cases, representing the children of Dariush and Parvaneh Forouhar, a couple slain in their home. While digging through government documents in the course of preparing for that trial, Ebadi encountered the official authorization for her own assassination.Ebadi is a towering figure, but she writes of her life choices as though they were natural and obvious. Not that the others in her orbit all chose to risk their lives and freedom. Many of her friends, she recalls with wistfulness and no small amount of anger, emigrated during the Iran-Iraq war. Others collaborated with the regime or went into legal fields that allowed them some distance from politics. For Ebadi, the only patriotic choice was to stay and the only moral choice was to fight injustice within a system that enshrined it as law.These labors have often been frustrating. Many of Ebadi's cases remain unresolved, and many of the laws she has sought to change persist today. Still, through her work she has spotlighted some of the Islamic Republic's most egregious practices. In doing so she offers no small measure of hope to those who have run afoul of a judicial system that prefers to operate in the shadows.One wishes there were more about the cases themselves, the strategies she has used to represent her clients and the intricacies of the trials. In many instances we are not even told how the legal proceedings ended, if they ended at all. Ebadi writes that she reserves these details for a future book, but their absence here is conspicuous.What we do get is a complex and moving portrait of a life lived in truth, as Vaclav Havel would put it, within the stultifying confines of a political system intended to compel passivity. Ebadi is well aware of the compromises forced on her as she works to curb the Islamic legal system's worst excesses. It is worth quoting her at length on this point, because she articulates the dignity of a reform movement inside Iran that has been derided by Islamists and Westerners alike as too appeasing of the other side. At a time when Washington speaks naïvely and grandiosely of regime change in Iran, Ebadi's story offers an eloquent reminder that working for justice within an unjust system does not always permit a simple and satisfying moral posture. She writes:""It so happened that I believed in the secular separation of religion and government because, fundamentally, Islam, like any religion, is subject to interpretation. It can be interpreted to oppress women or interpreted to liberate them. . . . I am a lawyer by training, and know only too well the permanent limitations of trying to enshrine inalienable rights in sources that lack fixed terms and definitions. But I am also a citizen of the Islamic Republic, and I know the futility of approaching the question any other way. My objective is not to vent my own political sensibilities but to push for a law that would save a family like Leila's"" — a child who was raped and murdered — ""from becoming homeless in their quest to finance the executions of their daughter's convicted murderers. If I'm forced to ferret through musty books of Islamic jurisprudence and rely on sources that stress the egalitarian ethics of Islam, then so be it. Is it harder this way? Of course it is. But is there an alternative battlefield? Desperate wishing aside, I cannot see one.""'"
"'06-07-16,'0','WITH his first novel, Lawrence Douglas takes to heart the adage that you should write what you know. Douglas, chairman of the department of law, jurisprudence and social thought at Amherst College and a Holocaust expert, makes his hero a Holocaust expert at a leafy New England college. There the similarities between Douglas and his neurotic protagonist, Daniel Ben Wellington, presumably end. ""It's not about them. Really,"" Douglas says in his acknowledgments, about his real-life wife and kids. Still, the roman à clef angle is tantalizing.What is a professor to do once he chooses a wife and sees tenure on the horizon? Why, have a baby, of course, and get cracking on the serial adultery. When he learns that his wife is pregnant, Daniel, an art historian specializing in war memorials, goes into a full-throttle meltdown. He flirts with colleagues and students, then embarks on a consuming e-mail romance with a single mother he meets on a business trip. ""I had entered a zone,"" he declares, ""ungoverned by conventional rules"" — except, perhaps, the rules of the academic novel, which demand a period of unadulterated bad-boyism, followed by hang-dog repentance.When Daniel finds himself almost ensnared in a harassment lawsuit for e-mailing a former student suggesting a sex act involving a salami sandwich, the dean observes, ""you're not the first person to have a midlife crisis, though you are on the young side."" But while Daniel has his moments of likable dry wit (he suggests Abemilech as a good ""biblical"" baby name and contemplates checking into a fancy mental institution: ""Maybe some facilities offered special summer rates, August discounts for when the shrinks were on the Vineyard""), all the female characters, including the one whose native language is German, sound pretty much alike, and it's hard to imagine what they see in this nail-biting narcissist. For an academic novel to work — as Richard Russo's ""Straight Man"" does, or Francine Prose's ""Blue Angel"" — the characters need to be more fully developed.Daniel's most intriguing issues concern his Holocaust research, not his love life. As the author of a respected book, ""Art and Atrocity,"" about the philosophy of war monuments, he finds himself invited to Berlin to address a forum on Holocaust memorials. He lies to reporters, claiming to be the child of death-camp survivors, and as his international reputation grows his lie threatens to topple him. Douglas, himself the author of an academic book called ""The Memory of Judgment: Making Law and History in the Trials of the Holocaust,"" knows this terrain well and can be refreshingly unsanctimonious about the politics of war memorials. He's equally savage about scholarship itself, which is like ""tossing rose petals into the Grand Canyon.""But this material is never really integrated with the more predictable domestic story. Instead, it generally appears as anecdote, like this tidbit from the Holocaust Memorial director in Berlin: ""Did you know that in Germany today there is a broad sociological pathology of persons who falsely claim to be Jewish? These people are called möchtegern Juden, maybe you know the term. Yet in my view, more interesting are the Germans who falsely claim to be the children of perpetrators.""With material that fresh, why saddle yourself with a mopey protagonist in his underwear in a seedy apartment, eating Fruit Loops all alone?'"
"'06-07-16,'0','It’s difficult to know what the motivations of the different openings were in the early days. Some things we can know or piece together; others are pretty much guesses. Frank Marshall consciously set out to play a wild attacking game when he surprised José Raul Capablanca with his Marshall Gambit in New York in 1918. His intention was clear: He had not defended against a Ruy Lopez for eight years before that, to keep his new idea concealed from Capablanca. The genius beat him anyway.The Paulsen Variation of the Sicilian Defense was probably devised to avoid the Sicilian in favor of the French. But when this opening reemerged in the 1940’s, it came out as the most careful of the Sicilian Defenses. The last laugh was that players too young to have knowledge of the 1940’s version sometimes tried it as a gambit and became disoriented.Perhaps in a recent game between Bartlomiej Heberla and Vadim Milov at the Second San Marino International Chess Open, Heberla thought to make only an adjustment, but he belatedly discovered that he had overturned his apple cart. In return for a small sacrifice of material, he not only got nowhere, but quickly lost to Milov’s whirlwind attack. Now will someone try to prove that Heberla was merely overenthusiastic?Milov, a Swiss grandmaster, tied for first place in the competition with an American, Varuzhan Akobian. Milov won on a tiebreak.In the early days of chess, 2 ... e6 was played as a way of reaching a French Defense — that is, until it was realized that 3 d4 d5 was favorable for White.Little harm was done once it was seen that 3 ... cd was quite a reasonable Sicilian Defense. And that is how it stands now, as one of the soundest variations of the Sicilian.'"
"'06-07-16,'0','IN 2004, when regulators were considering requiring corporations to treat stock options as expenses, many executives complained bitterly. They argued that such a change would severely reduce their ability to use options to attract and retain top talent. Yet a new study suggests that these companies were doing little more than crying wolf.Before the accounting change, which was adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in December 2004 and took effect in 2005, a company’s earnings statements did not have to reflect the cost of an option until it was cashed in — typically several years after it was granted. After the change, companies were required to begin deducting the cost of options in the year of the grant.The new study, conducted by H. Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, finds no evidence that the accounting change has had a dampening effect on the number or value of options that the average publicly traded company grants to its executives. On the contrary, depending on how the dollar value is calculated, options grants in 2005 were at their highest level since the peak of the Internet boom in early 2000.Professor Seyhun based his study, which is unpublished, on data collected by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because companies must immediately inform the S.E.C. when they grant options to their executives, and because most of the options that companies grant to their employees go to executives, Professor Seyhun says he is confident that the database paints a comprehensive picture of companies’ practices.The professor found that, at least so far, the new rule has led to no meaningful decline in the proportion of publicly traded companies that grant options to executives. That’s revealing enough. Even more telling is that among companies that grant them, the average number of issued options grew 24 percent in 2005, the year the rule took effect.'"

"'06-07-16,'0','So he and his wife, Lori Greene, actually had to start holding repeat performances and now they hold these shows up to seven times a year. The show garnered even wider attention when National Public Radio called it “one of the hottest tickets in New York City.”With his tousled hair and his lanky frame, Mr. Guttman stands in the back of the crowd and leads his visitors across the globe via hundreds of slides at a blistering pace. As the slides change, he takes palpable pleasure in the gasps and laughs that his photographs and his enthusiasm elicit. But over the years he has found that there is one drawback to being host of these shows.“People naturally feel that since they sat through an hour and a half of my slide show that they have a license to show me their snapshots,” he said with a sheepish grin in an interview at his apartment. “Charitably speaking, 90 percent of the time they are really poor photographs.”Mr. Guttman, who has had numerous photos published — including in The New York Times — and has taught classes in travel photography at the International Center of Photography in Manhattan, knows what makes for a great photograph and is all too familiar with the errors that many amateurs struggle with. “The main mistake that people make is that they don’t get close enough to the action,” Mr. Guttman said. “You have to decide whether you want to be a tourist or a traveler.”The time-honored tradition of taking pictures of loved ones in front of monuments and landmarks does not make for interesting photographs. When Mr. Guttman travels he researches a destination in order to better figure out what makes it unique.“You have to decide whether you want to be a tourist or a traveler,” said Mr. Guttman. “A tourist basically stands to the side and takes timid candids of things that they see from a distance as a shy spectator.”“A traveler,” Mr. Guttman said, makes an effort to enter an experience, “and tries to feel all the essence and the joy and the drama of what a place has to offer.”As important as getting closer to what you are photographing is knowing when to photograph and how to use natural light to your advantage.“The most effective time to photograph is at the margins of the day,” Mr. Guttman said. “Early morning, dusk and most particularly during blue light, which is after the sun sets but before the sky turns totally dark. It gives photographs a cobalt blue essence that’s almost out of a fairy tale and contrasts with the sparkling golds of man-made light.”Although many of Mr. Guttman’s most arresting images are of local tribesmen in Papua New Guinea or glaciers in Norway, his photographs of the Northeastern United States get just as big a reaction as those of exotic locations at his slide shows. His photograph of Stark, N.H., during the Christmas season uses the post-sunset blue light to contrast with the yellow lights decorating a covered bridge to create the quintessential image of New England in the winter. A photograph of the cranberry harvest in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey thrusts the viewer waist deep in a sea of red berries right alongside a worker whose partly submerged hands are in the foreground.BY getting closer to his subject and by using light to its fullest, Mr. Guttman creates a stunning image regardless of how far he travels. A wider selection of his photographs can be found at his Web site, peterguttman.com.Mr. Guttman also stresses that travelers need not have top-of-the-line cameras or expensive lenses to take great photographs.“The type of equipment you use is so not the point,” he said. “It’s all about your attitude and your confidence.”A key element of photography that Mr. Guttman sees amateurs struggling with is composition. The standard practice of putting the focus of the photograph at the center of the image often results in a static frame. By placing subjects well off-center you can give yourself a more interesting image and create what Mr. Guttman calls a “frame within a frame.”Another important aspect of composition is the background of the image, particularly when photographing people.“The backdrop is the stage set that you are putting your main characters on,” Mr. Guttman said. “I’m first looking at backdrops before I try to find the perfect face.”Mr. Guttman’s final suggestion involves paying attention to scale. Particularly when photographing wildlife and scenery, the majesty and the proportions of mountains or a forest can often be lost when there are no people in the photograph.“Putting people in the frame makes the landscape more meaningful and decipherable,” he said.Of course there will be people who say that a destination viewed through a camera lens inhibits their ability to enjoy their vacation. “I laugh when people say, ‘Are you really experiencing a trip when your face is behind a viewfinder?’ ” he said, leaning forward. “I don’t know where to begin to tell them how much richer it is. Travel becomes a very cinematic experience. I am so much more finely tuned to the mystique of the environment around me and the drama of a place when I have my camera.”'"
"'06-07-16,'0','Iran has conducted a semi-hostile takeover of what used to be known as the Arab-Israeli dispute. Iran has deepened and widened its support for its terrorist partners. Iran and the Islamists are fueled by the sense that the winds of history are blowing at their back. They pushed the Soviets out of Afghanistan, the U.S. out of Lebanon, Israel out of Lebanon and Gaza and they seem on the verge of pushing the U.S. out of Iraq. After centuries of Muslim humiliation, these people know how to win.So Hamas and Hezbollah audaciously set the pace of confrontation. Maybe the moderates will eventually crack down on the radicals (there’s a first time for everything), but in the meantime there will be no peace process. There will be no shuttle diplomacy. Instead, the main mode of communication will be death: the minuet of missile launches and retaliations, escalations and de-escalations that irreconcilable enemies use to talk with one another.You can also kiss goodbye to the land-for-peace mentality. In all other crises there was the hope that if Israel ceded land and gave the Palestinians a chance to lead normal lives, then tensions would ease. But this crisis follows withdrawals in Lebanon and Gaza, and interrupts the withdrawals from the West Bank that were at the core of Ehud Olmert’s victory platform.Israel’s main enemies in this crisis are not normal parties and governments that act on behalf of their people. They are jihadist organizations that happen to have gained control of territory for bases of operations. Hamas and Hezbollah knew their kidnappings and missile launches would set off retaliation that would hurt Gazans and Lebanese, but they attacked anyway — for the sake of jihad. They answer to a higher authority and dream of genocide in his name.What’s happened over the past few years, in short, is that public opinion in Israel has moved to the center at the same time that decision-making power on the other side has moved to the extreme.Now there is a debate over how Israel should respond to this situation. Some say Israel should temper its response so Arab moderates can corral the extremists, which would be great advice if the moderates had any record of ever doing that or any capacity to do so in the near future. Others say Israel simply must degrade the capabilities of its fanatical opponents.But this is a secondary issue. The core issue is that just as Israel has been trying to pull back to more sensible borders, its enemies have gone completely berserk. Through some combination of fecklessness and passivity, the Arab world has ceded control of this vital flashpoint to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Bashar al-Assad. It has ceded its own destiny to people who do not believe in freedom, democracy, tolerance or any of the values civilized people hold dear.And what’s the world’s response? Israel is overreacting.'"

"'06-07-17,'1','Dezire Deffo, the vice president of the African Union, said Ms. Blair told the members of the groups that she had not yet read the law but planned to do so and was ready to assist the groups with legal advice. “She said, I am prepared to help you if you need it,” Ms. Deffo said.Earlier this year. Mr. Putin signed a law requiring private groups, commonly referred to as nongovernmental organizations, or N.G.O.’s, to reregister and forbidding their use of foreign money for political activities.Mr. Putin has said the groups sometimes serve as a cover for foreign intelligence activities and should not be allowed to influence Russia’s politics.The organizations say that the accusation is groundless and that the law, which has created onerous new filing responsibilities, appears to be in place to provide a pretext for shutting down groups that the Kremlin deems critical or a political threat.Several Western nations and organizations have expressed concern that the law reflects a step back from Russia’s public commitments to become more democratic.The law is just beginning to be put into effect, and the organizations are waiting to see how it will be enforced and also deliberating about whether they should mount legal challenges against it either in Russia or in Europe.Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for Democracy, an American-financed private group that provides grants to promote and strengthen democratic institutions in other nations, said in interview last week that for the moment the groups the endowment supports are watching for the Kremlin’s next step.“We are very worried,” he said. “If indeed they are going to move aggressively on this law, and they try to shut down these N.G.O.’s, then they will have crossed the line.”President Bush also met with civil society leaders when he arrived here last Friday, and told them he would bring up their problems during his private meetings with Mr. Putin.Mr. Gundert said the public support by Western political figures is an encouraging sign. “It is very important to show that the situation is being observed by the international community,” he said. “The law has been passed, and now people are interested in seeing what it will look like in reality.”Mr. Putin, in his own meetings with civil society leaders, said he too will review the law.'"
"'06-07-17,'1','Rossiiskaya Gazeta gives a rundown of the results from the scheduled negotiations. On energy security, G8 leaders signed an agreement preserving barriers to investment and trade in the energy sector. Participants recognized that Russia is not in a position to set up an energy export monopoly. According to the Russian Minister of Industry and Energy, Viktor Khristenko, Russia and Europe are again on the same page regarding energy. The goal is to openly present, discuss and coordinate substantial energy strategies, Mr. Khristenko said.On infectious diseases, leaders committed to strengthening a global network for the surveillance and monitoring of avian flu, AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Countries also pledged funds for the fight against global epidemics. The United States, according to Rossiiskaya Gazeta, pledged $15 billion over five years to AIDS-related research. According to Russian Surgeon General Gennady Onishchenko, the document on infectious diseases recognizes Russian primacy on issues relating to avian flu.The newspaper notes that the document on education does not establish a plan for developing unified education systems. It does call for finding a way to raise the quality of education, to expand educational opportunities, and to encourage politicians to invest in this sphere.Rossiiskaya Gazeta also notes that leaders held discussions on all three topics with delegates from the youth Group of Eight.Gazeta points out that the cost of this summit is set to break previous records. The $400 million already spent on the event is twice as much as was spent on last year’s summit in Gleneagles, Scotland. This does not include business losses and a halt to tourism due to the virtual lock-down of St. Petersburg during the summit. According to Vladimir Kozhin, head of financial affairs for the summit, the event will pay for itself. He notes that much of the money (90 percent of which came from the federal budget) has gone into renovation and restoration projects in St. Petersburg. In addition, Mr. Kozhin said that he plans to give 300 computers to local schools after the summit concludes.Izvestia notes, that while St. Petersburg residents did not get to see the G8 presidents, they did witness another summit: the congregation of anti-globalists of the so-called Anti-summit. The newspaper reports that Russian law enforcement officials, in cooperation with colleagues from G8 countries, easily managed the situation. In comparison with other summits, Izvestia says, St. Petersburg was quiet. On Sunday the militia arrested 37 anti-globalists who had escaped from their holding pen in Kirov Stadium.BATTLE WITH EXTREMISM ACCEPTED CONDITIONALLY: Russia’s upper house, the Federation Council, accepted conditional changes to the law on extremism Friday. The bill broadens the definition of extremism to such an extent that committees within the council openly expressed their worries on its potential implementation. The commission on information policy approved the bill, noting that the interpretation of slander, threat of violence, or threats endangering government officials’ lives, in the context of extremism, could threaten the “rights and freedoms of all citizens of Russia.” The bill proposes changes that include these as well as equally flexible offenses like “carrying out actions that violate human rights and freedoms.” The bill will be sent to Russia’s lower house, the Duma, when it comes back for the fall session in September, at which point many politicians expect further clarification of the more vague points regarding “extremist conduct.”NO END TO TAX BURDEN FOR BUSINESSES: Amendments to the tax code were accepted by the Russian Parliament just before they left for vacation last week. The changes failed to address major problems, the paper said, leaving many areas available for tax officials to abuse. Specifically, the changes failed to address the random nature of tax inspections, the main headache for Russian business. Tax officials remain unconstrained as to the type of documents they can use as foundation for a random inspection. There was also no tax burden relief for businesses whose taxes account for over 50 percent of state budget income. Vedomosti sees this as a sign of the government’s continued path to an oligarchic corporatist state system. Business’s share of the tax burden entitles it to a degree of influence within the state, and random tax inspections continue as the state’s way of controlling business. The losers in this scenario, the paper suggests, are the people, whose tax payments account for a mere 9.3 percent of state budget income in 2005. The people cannot exert influence over their government because they are not its major sponsor. The tax terror therefore, continues.HOW MUCH CAN A G8 LEADER EAT IN A DAY?: In what the article calls a “thought on the Russian scope of things,” it takes a look at the nearly one million dollars spent feeding the Group of 8 Summit leaders. According to the calculations, approximately $330,000 dollars a day was spent on food for the eight leaders and their spouses during the summit. That comes to $41,000 dollars a day per leader together with their spouse. The article likewise notes the fact that the leaders of Germany and Japan came alone. The leaders, even combined with their spouses, could not eat that much, and therefore much of the food must have gone to waste. Such is the scope of waste on a Russian scale, the article writes. Addressing the head of the organizational committee secretariat for the preparation for the summit, Sergei Y. Vyazalov, the article draws attention to worried citizens who think that perhaps maybe there was some sort of mistake in the official calculations. “Somehow an extra zero of some sort attached itself” they propose. The article insists they are simply worried there was some mistake, because after all, “you would give your last for your motherland’s image!”PUTIN SHOWS OFF HIS CAR: The G8 summit began on an upbeat note, with President Vladimir V. Putin’s first car, a Zaporozhits, in the background. The Zaparozhits is a small, Soviet economy car made, appropriately enough, in Zaparozhe, Ukraine. It seems that while riding around Mr. Bush’s ranch in Texas, Mr. Putin promised to show the American president his first car. Mr. Bush looked into the window of the car and “judging from the fear in his eyes, he expected to find a dinosaur skeleton inside.” When Mr. Putin offered Mr. Bush a ride, the latter “quickly disappeared into the house,” according to the article. When asked about his first car, Mr. Bush answered that he had a Triumph bike, which this article took as a bicycle rather than a motorcycle.'"
"'06-07-17,'1','The impact of the deaths and the use of the new missile were a qualitative and psychological escalation of the conflict, in its fifth day on Sunday, with the Israeli defense minister, Amir Peretz, saying, “For those who live in the Hezbollah neighborhood in Beirut and feel protected — the situation has changed.”The Israeli air attacks on Beirut’s southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has its headquarters, continued throughout the day and evening, after heavy raids on Saturday against Hezbollah offices and apartment houses and, the Israelis said, bunkers underneath them where Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah’s leader, has spent much of his time.Streets were deserted, littered by debris, broken glass and parts of shattered buildings. Heavy plumes of black smoke rose over the city in the late afternoon as Israeli jets circled over the shut Beirut airport, hitting fuel storage tanks and an oil refinery.“We are facing a real annihilation carried out by Israel,” Lebanon’s information minister, Ghazi Aridi, said after an emergency cabinet meeting. Beirut had an eerie, empty feel, with many residents having fled to the surrounding mountains.The Lebanese government estimated the damages at more than $500 million, not including loss of tourism and commerce.At an underground parking lot in Beirut, some 2,000 families, many of them from the south, were camped out Sunday night after abandoning their villages. Hani Mudaid, from Mashrafieh, said: “I saw all the bad things of the war. It’s very hard for me now to see my kids see them too.”Sheik Nasrallah promised Israel “new surprises” and said Hezbollah had “no choice” but to hit Haifa. “As long as the enemy acts without limitations or red lines, it’s our right to continue the confrontation without limits,” he said in a taped speech televised on Hezbollah’s Al Manar television. Sheik Nasrallah appeared from the waist up to be unhurt, despite unconfirmed reports that he had been wounded in an Israeli strike on his bunker in southern Beirut.In Iran, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called Hezbollah “a genuine Islamic movement whose progress should become an example for the Muslim world.”Israeli planes dropped leaflets over parts of southern Lebanon, urging civilians to leave. Israeli Army officials say that Hezbollah stores rockets and portable launchers among the civilian population, in apartments, garages and shops.Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel vowed that Israel would “continue doing whatever is necessary to achieve our goals,” to drive Hezbollah from the border with Lebanon and to secure the release of captured Israeli soldiers. “Nothing will deter us,” he said, “whatever far-reaching ramifications there may be regarding our relations on the northern border and in the region.”But Israel has no plans to attack Syria or Iran “on our own initiative,” Mr. Olmert told the Israeli cabinet. Isaac Herzog, a cabinet member, said: “We know their responsibility. But at this moment, we concentrate on Lebanon.”Meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, the leaders of the Group of 8 countries blamed “extremist forces” and “those who support them” for the surge of Middle East violence. They urged Israel to exercise “utmost restraint” and expressed their “deepening concern for rising civilian casualties on all sides and the damage to infrastructure.”The leaders did not call for an immediate cease-fire but urged Hezbollah to restore peace by releasing captured Israelis and ending attacks on Israel, followed by the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the release of detained Palestinian legislators belonging to Hamas.The Israelis say that their operation, which follows a Hezbollah raid into Israel, is intended to “dismantle the capabilities” of Hezbollah, ensure that it no longer faces Israelis “nose to nose” across the border and allow the government of Lebanon, with international help, to take control over its own borders.The Israelis want the United Nations Security Council to implement its Resolution 1559 of September 2004, which calls for the Lebanese Army to control the border, for foreigners to return home, and for Hezbollah’s extensive military operation to be dismantled.The Israeli military says that dozens of Iranian Revolutionary Guards are in southern Lebanon as trainers and advisers to Hezbollah, which Iran helped set up with Syrian help in 1982 to fight Israel in southern Lebanon. Iranians train special missile-launching units, but do not fire the missiles themselves, said a senior Israeli military official, who asked that his name not be used because he is not authorized to speak publicly.Sheik Nasrallah denies that any Iranian soldiers are in southern Lebanon.Hezbollah, according to the senior Israeli military official, has some 12,000 120-millimeter Katyusha rockets, with a range of 6 to 15 miles and a warhead of some 40 pounds. So far, they have launched fewer than 900 of them.Hezbollah also has “a few hundred” Fajr-3 and Fajr-5 missiles — the older Fajr-3, a 240- millimeter missile with a range of some 30 miles, and the Fajr-5, a 333-millimeter missile with a range of about 40 to 45 miles, the official said. Both carry larger warheads, the first with a payload of almost 200 pounds (of which roughly half is high explosive), and the second, of 400 pounds.Hezbollah also has a small number of missiles with a range longer than the Fajr-5, the official said, but he would not be more specific. Some analysts believe that Hezbollah has a few Iranian Zelzal missiles, with a range of 60 to 80 miles, which could reach the outskirts of Tel Aviv.Israel had deployed a battery of Patriot missiles near Haifa to try to protect the city. But the antimissile system is not designed for these missiles, it is designed to give a warning, the Israeli Army said. Rockets also hit Acre, Nahariya and other northern towns, and Israel declared a form of martial law, allowing the police and the army to order residents into shelters.The Israeli chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Halutz, said that Israel had intercepted a convoy of Syrian rockets heading into Lebanon, and that the air force had destroyed five portable missile launchers after they were brought out of hiding and used.The Israelis also said that one of their ships had been damaged not by a Hezbollah drone, but by a sophisticated Iranian C-802 missile, which is radar-guided and which the Israelis said they had not known that Hezbollah possessed. They said the missiles, one of which sank a civilian ship, were launched with the aid of Lebanese military radar along the shore. Israel then destroyed most of the radar installations.In Gaza, where an Israeli soldier was taken after being captured by Palestinian militants on June 25, Israeli tanks and troops re-entered northern Gaza under the cover of helicopter gunships. The soldiers took over open land near Beit Hanun, often used by militants to launch rockets into Israel. In firefights and missiles strikes, three Palestinian militants were killed.Early Monday, an Israeli airstrike flattened the eight-story Palestinian Foreign Ministry building in Gaza City, and a separate air strike gutted the offices of a Hamas-led security force in Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip, Reuters reported.In Tel Aviv, about 2,000 people, both Jewish and Arab, marched to demand an end to the Israeli offensive in Lebanon. The demonstrators, organized by Israeli peace groups, chanted “Yes to a prisoner exchange” and “Yes to peace.”'"
"'06-07-17,'1','The oddly familiar sounds and feelings were also nauseating, depressing, disheartening.Just days ago, Lebanon was wrapped up in the World Cup. The long civil war, which had divided the country and destroyed much of stately, graceful Beirut, was a dark memory. The billions of dollars spent to rebuild roads, bridges and buildings helped erase it.“The country was bubbling; we had so much plans; people were interested in us; we had a nice country; we had reached a good place; we beat any other place in the world,” said Maria Hibri, a Beirut resident and designer of vintage-style textiles. “And it’s all gone in four days?”This was supposed to be a record tourist season, with more than 1.5 million visitors expected in this tiny Mediterranean country of less than 4 million. Newsstands are still stocked with glossy magazines trumpeting Lebanon’s charms, its chic parties, its sleepless nights.But on Sunday, Beirut was under siege again. Bars, cafes, restaurants, nightclubs and movie theaters were all closed, and streets were empty. Open windows leaked the voices from television sets tuned to any of dozens of Lebanese and Arab stations, all continuously blaring the latest news, which was near, very near. The bombs fell and the smoke rose on the screens.Then the viewers heard the shattering sounds and felt the sickening concussion.Just over a year ago, hundreds of thousands of Lebanese demonstrated against Syria’s 29-year armed presence, and the Cedar Revolution, with support from abroad, finally drove those soldiers out. Now, residents here are angry and bitter at Western nations that have not stopped the airstrikes.There was irritation at Hezbollah for inviting them, and there was anger at Israel for punishing Lebanon collectively.There was also, sadly, resignation.“We don’t know what’s going on, and we can’t do anything about it,” said George Salame, 31, a Beirut resident who graduated from Cornell University and makes a business selling scrap metals abroad. “This is Lebanon, after all.” JAD MOUAWADThe train platform was slick with blood and littered with chunks of fallen roof. Twisted metal dangled from above, and train cars were charred, their windows blown out.On Sunday, Hezbollah fired 10 powerful rockets — a kind it has never unleashed before — and they soared more than 20 miles over Israel’s thinly populated north before slamming down in Haifa, a vibrant port city generally known for its good relations between Jews and Arabs. It was a confirmation of something Israeli security chiefs have warned about for years: that Hezbollah has large, powerful rockets able to reach major Israeli cities.Only one of the 10 made a direct hit, striking a maintenance hangar as the train company employees were arriving at the start of their work week. Eight people were killed, and more than 20 injured.Sliman Halaby, an Israeli Arab railway worker, saw the rocket strike and raced to help. “I saw the people spread out all over” the platform, he said.“I talked to them so they would not panic or lose consciousness,” he told Israel radio. “Then I ran to the entrance because I saw the ambulances were having trouble reaching the gate.”Hezbollah has been shooting rockets at northern Israel on and off for some two decades, but it struck Haifa for the first time only on Thursday, and with two smaller Katyusha rockets that caused only nominal damage. The Sunday attack was its deadliest missile strike, the first with a rocket that could carry more than 100 pounds of explosives, the Israeli military said.Israel said it was a Fajr-3 rocket, with a range of up to 30 miles; Hezbollah said it had fired Raad-2 and Raad-3 rockets.At the emergency room of the city’s Rambam Medical Center, relatives of the dead and injured wailed with grief. Other Israelis there called on their government to respond even more harshly to Hezbollah’s attacks.“We should wipe Hezbollah off the map without pity and without listening to the criticism from the rest of the world,” said Sarah Benchetrit, 57.Mrs. Benchetrit, who moved to Israel 22 years ago from New Jersey, said she was more unnerved than she had been during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, when Iraq fired dozens of Scuds into Israel. Then, military radar detected them in enough time for warnings that gave Israelis a minute or more to take cover. There was no such warning on Sunday, though Israel has set up three Patriot antimissile batteries in Haifa.The Home Front Command called on the nearly quarter of a million residents of Haifa and those in nearby areas to stay in sheltered areas. All ships in port were instructed to go to sea, and Haifa University canceled all activities, Israel radio reported.The Israeli defense minister, Amir Peretz, was in Haifa after the attack. “Our homes and families are being attacked, and there is no way we will let this continue,” he said. Hezbollah is firing its rockets from civilian areas, he said, but Israel will not hesitate to strike at such sites.“Any source of fire that is identified will be dealt with,” Mr. Peretz said.New Dangers to Add to the Old OnesIsraeli troops moved back into Gaza on Saturday night, setting up tank positions on the outskirts of Beit Hanun, a crowded town of 35,000 people in the small territory’s northeastern corner. Children gathered on the street corners on Sunday, peering around corners for a glimpse of gun-toting militants who darted from building to building as Israeli snipers tried to pick them off.The rattle of automatic weapons fire echoed through the otherwise empty streets, sometimes sharp and close, sometimes muffled and far away. All over northern Gaza, there was the steady thump and thunder of artillery fire as Israel shelled the fields of Beit Hanun from the southeast, raising great clouds of dust. Ambulances patrolled slowly, picking up occasional casualties.At the town’s main hospital, doctors and orderlies waited outside in the shade for their work to arrive, while a boy played with bits of shrapnel he had found.Three men died in an Israeli attack before dawn when an Apache helicopter fired a rocket into the house from which they were shooting just 100 yards from the hospital. The doctors said 17 others were wounded, including a woman and her 9-month-old.In the early afternoon, the incessant buzz of aerial drones was broken by two rocket strikes, one against a car carrying militants toward the fighting and another against a group of fighters hiding in a group of trees.But just a few blocks from the fighting, the slow rhythm of life remained unbroken. Cars and donkey carts and children on horseback wove through the chaotic streets where mounds of garbage smoldered on corners. Burning is the only practical means of trash disposal amid a municipal strike over unpaid wages.Gaza has been under siege since a June 25 attack by Palestinian militants killed two Israeli soldiers and took one prisoner, setting off the current crisis here and in Lebanon. About 100 Palestinians, more than half of them militants, have died in the fighting.In Gaza City, a dozen black-masked fighters representing several Palestinian factions gathered in a narrow street before a group of Arab news crews to proclaim solidarity with Hezbollah and to vow coordinated action against the Israelis. Later, a handful of Hamas government ministers met at the prime minister’s office, but the gathering broke up after an Israeli F-16 roared overhead. Israel had targeted the building once before.Along the seashore, children swam and men tossed nets into the surf, pausing to watch an Israeli patrol boat fire warning shots toward the few fishing boats that had ventured out more than 100 yards. Many of Gaza’s seafood restaurants are closed because the fishing industry has been all but shut down by the fighting.But by nightfall, many of Gaza’s sparse upper middle class had gathered on the seaside terrace of the Deira Hotel to puff apple-scented tobacco and sip minted lemonade, trying to ignore the fighting.Few noticed a young man crouched momentarily in the doorway, gripping a pistol with both hands. Shots rang out on the street outside in a short-lived clash between rival families that injured no one but provided a grim reminder that even without the war, Gaza remained a dangerous place.About 1 a.m. on Monday an Israeli missile struck the Palestinian Foreign Ministry, the second time it has been hit in five days. The strike collapsed half of the nine-story building and temporarily knocked out power in much of Gaza City. CRAIG S. SMITHFor Tens of Thousands, a Refuge Yet AgainMore than 90,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria since the beginning of the Israeli bombardment, Syrian government officials said Sunday.Among them was the family of Hamzeh Diab. The family of five drove out of Beirut’s southern suburbs after the nearby airport was bombed Thursday evening, winding through the mountains on small secondary roads. On Sunday, Mr. Diab sat drinking strong Turkish coffee at a cafe with his Syrian second cousin, Ali Diab, a Shiite truck driver who has welcomed the family into his home in the Damascus suburb of Muhajreen.Hamzeh Diab said most of his neighbors had fled to Syria or to villages in the mountains. “I would like to stay and fight,” he said. “I have a son, 19 years old, and I would readily give him to Hezbollah as a martyr.“But I also have a little daughter, 6 years old, and she was crying and frightened because of the bombs. I decided to bring the family to Syria for her sake.”The Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, has pledged to put all Syria’s hospitals and other emergency facilities at the disposal of needy Lebanese, and citizens like Ali Diab were also doing their part.“We must stand with the Lebanese and help them, because we are one people,” he said. “This is not a political or theoretical bond. There are many family ties between Syria and Lebanon, many marriages.”Syria and Lebanon were carved out of the same chunk of the former Ottoman Empire in 1920. At times, some Lebanese even saw Syria’s occupation as the guiding hand of a big brother.During Lebanon’s civil war, civilians often fled to Syria. “The Syrian government welcomes them without documents,” said a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, who said she was not authorized to be quoted by name. “Usually they stay some time until it is safe to go home. We’ve seen this same situation many times.”But on the streets of Syria’s capital, some citizens fretted openly about the potential economic impact of the new arrivals; many poor and middle class Syrians feel the country is already overburdened by the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Iraqi refugees, whose presence drives up prices of real estate, fuel and food.There was also some fear. Damascus streets buzzed with a rumor that Syria’s Army had been put on high alert on Saturday night, ready for the possibility of a war with Israel, and young people sent one another text messages, relaying the news that a pro-Hezbollah demonstration was being organized for Monday morning.Syria’s information minister, Mohsen Bilal, issued a statement on Sunday saying that “Syria will reply directly to any Israeli attacks with all the means available to it.”Those means, according to most Syrian analysts, include Iran’s military as well.Sami Moubayed, a Syrian writer and political analyst, said he believed that the fighting in Lebanon would continue for some time. But he doubted it would come to Syria.“If Syria is attacked, then Iran will join the fight, and no one can fight a war on four fronts,” Mr. Moubayed said. “It’s simply too difficult to open a new front, and it’s not justified at this point.“Lebanon is a much easier target for the Israelis,” he said, “and the refugee crisis will get worse.” KATHERINE ZOEPFIt is not surprising that Iran’s newspapers have denounced Israel for its military actions against Hamas in Gaza and against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and praised the Iranian government’s support for those groups.State-run television and radio have dedicated major parts of their programs and news broadcasts to reports from Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. State television constantly shows images of injured civilians, including children, and the radio broadcasts interviews with Lebanese supporters of Hezbollah.Jalal Khoshchehreh, the foreign editor of the daily Kargozaran paper, sounded a note common in Tehran on Sunday. “The question is not whether Iran is giving weapons to Hezbollah or not,” he said. “The United States is giving weapons to Israel, and no one questions that. The issue is the humanitarian catastrophe in Palestine.”But many Iranians, already worried about international pressure to halt their country’s nuclear activities, are growing more concerned over accusations that Iran is behind Hezbollah’s recent attacks. Antigovernment television channels, broadcast mostly from the United States, have a large audience here. They are reporting extensively on Iran’s interests in the conflict.Iran admits giving moral support to Hezbollah, but whatever the country’s official position, its citizens — if offered anonymity — describe a more active role as fact.“It was a suicidal decision for the regime to get itself involved,” said a woman at a grocery store on Saturday, as the radio announced a new wave of Hezbollah attacks against Israel. “I am sorry for what is happening there, but why should we pay for it. Our share will now be at least a couple of bombs and missiles.”A man who said he was a film producer said, “It seems that the regime is certain that the United States wants nothing but regime change in Iran.” Iranian leaders, he said, want “to fight it all the way until they become martyrs rather than losers.” NAZILA FATHI'"

"'06-07-18,'1','Policymakers at the Fed have repeatedly said that fighting inflation is a top concern. Although some economists worry that continuing rate increases will stifle growth, the Fed has proven willing to keep on tightening to combat inflation.The Fed’s policymakers are scheduled to meet again on Aug. 8, and many on Wall Street are expecting the central bank to raise its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight bank loans to 5.5 percent, from 5.25 percent.There were conflicting signals in today’s Labor Department report, leaving analysts to differ over how severe the inflationary pressure now is. “Wholesale price inflation continues at a pace that makes the Federal Reserve uneasy, even as economic growth slows,” said Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Business. “Today’s producer-price data indicate that another interest rate hike is likely, even if it poses considerable risks to growth.”Noting that much of the increase in June related to higher food costs, Kenneth Beauchemin, an economist with Global Insight, said, “Given that these price movements are the consequence of bad luck on the supply side, and not fundamental inflationary pressures, the Fed will be satisfied with the downward move in the core rate.”Investors pushed stock prices slightly lower in early afternoon trading, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index all posting small declines.A jump in wholesale prices does not necessarily mean that prices at the retail level will rise, because corporations often absorb higher costs without passing them along to the consumer. So last month’s data may not foreshadow a rise in the government’s consumer price index, which is much more closely watched as a sign of inflation. Consumer price data for June is set to be released Wednesday.Some economists, however, said today’s report hinted at the beginning stages of higher consumer prices. Prices for intermediate goods excluding food and energy, which include materials used in the manufacturing process, have jumped 7.3 percent since last June. That suggests that in the coming months, manufacturers could be pressured to pass their higher production costs along to wholesalers, who in turn could pass it along to retailers.“Seven-point-three percent is arguably blistering,” said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research for Argus Research. “It could mean higher prices on the retail level. And the Fed doesn’t want to gamble with that.”'"

"'06-07-18,'1','N. Wayne Hale Jr., the shuttle program manager, said at a news conference at mission control in Houston, “The shuttle is back.”Still, questions remain about whether the program has solved the safety problems that have plagued it over the years — problems that NASA officials pledged to pursue.NASA managers said that the success of this mission reinforced their view that they could step up the tempo of launchings, with the shuttle Atlantis returning to space as early as Aug. 28 and the mission after that beginning in mid-December.Mr. Griffin cautioned at a news conference here at the Kennedy Space Center, “We’re not going to get overconfident.” Engineers and analysts will pore over the data from this flight in the coming weeks and months, he said, to better understand issues like foam debris from the shuttle’s external tank before launching the next mission.The amount of foam shed in the Discovery’s July 4 liftoff — the problem that doomed the Columbia and continued to plague last year’s return-to-flight mission — posed no threat to the shuttle, with the biggest piece weighing less than two ounces.But a member of the independent board that investigated the Columbia disaster said the risks of shuttle flight were still very real.“This shows that with appropriate care and vigilance, the odds of operating the shuttle with acceptable risk are good,” said the board member, John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. But he added: “It doesn’t mean the shuttle is safe. The shuttle will remain a very risky vehicle to be operated with extreme care.”The crew took thousands of pounds of supplies to the half-finished space station, performed three spacewalks in which they repaired broken equipment to allow the resumption of construction on future shuttle flights, and tested possible repair techniques.They also carried up a new crew member, Thomas Reiter, a German astronaut from the European Space Agency. Mr. Reiter remained behind aboard the space station, bringing its crew to three for the first time since the Columbia disaster.The crew was led by Colonel Lindsey, who was making his fourth trip to space and his second as a commander. The pilot, Cmdr. Mark E. Kelly of the Navy, was on his second shuttle mission. The two spacewalkers were Piers J. Sellers of England and Michael E. Fossum. The flight engineer, Cmdr. Lisa M. Nowak of the Navy, operated the robot arm during the spacewalks, along with Stephanie D. Wilson, who also supervised the transfer of tons of cargo between the two craft.Despite the astronauts’ grueling schedule, there was time to both laugh and marvel. At a news conference here on Monday, Colonel Lindsey recalled that Commander Nowak’s ponytail, which acquired a will of its own in zero gravity, had gotten stuck on a strip of Velcro in the mid-deck of the shuttle.Colonel Lindsey said he and the pilot, Commander Kelly, had had a view on the way home that was even more spectacular than usual.“It started out in darkness, and of course you see the orange glow as the plasma starts heating up,” he said, referring to the superheated gases of re-entry into the atmosphere. “And you can see what looks like explosions out the windows, plasma flashes and things like that.”As the shuttle banked left, “I could see the earth below as the sun was coming up,” he continued. “And Mark, through his window, through the plasma, could see the moon. It was just wild.” The shuttle did not break through the cloud layer until just 10,000 feet — less than a minute before landing. “I had never gone through weather like that before on a real shuttle landing,” he said.NASA managers and engineers who suffered through the Columbia disaster and last year’s troubled mission of the Discovery were visibly moved to see a shuttle finally land in Florida again. The Columbia was heading for the Kennedy landing strip when it broke up over Texas, and the Discovery was diverted to Edwards Air Force Base in California for its landing last year.“Columbia’s landing day was a horrible day,” said Michael D. Leinbach, the launching director. “Today was a great day.”In Washington, lawmakers welcomed the safe return of the shuttle and applauded the crew’s effort. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas and chairwoman of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on science and space, called the mission “an important milestone in our nation’s space exploration history.”Representative Sherwood Boehlert, Republican of New York and the chairman of the House Science Committee, who has been cautious about the shuttle program, commended the NASA scientists, engineers and technicians, who have “worked tirelessly over the past three years to mitigate the problems that tragically doomed the shuttle Columbia in 2003.”Mr. Boehlert added, “While NASA must continue to be vigilant, the shuttle is now poised to proceed” with planned missions. President Bush issued a statement from the Group of 8 summit meeting in Strelna, Russia, congratulating NASA’s workers for “putting our space program back on track” and calling the program “a source of great national pride.”Experts on space policy also expressed relief that the mission had gone so well. “They’ve got the right stuff back,” said John Pike, the director of GlobalSecurity.org.But he added that the success did not change the fact that the shuttle program itself was in its last phase.“Mr. Bush has decided that Mr. Nixon’s space shuttle and Mr. Reagan’s space station are not the way he wants to go,” Mr. Pike said. “He likes John Kennedy, going to the moon.”A critic of the space agency, Roger A. Pielke Jr., director of the Center for Science and Technology Policy Research at the University of Colorado, questioned in an e-mail interview whether the “acceptable risk” cited by Professor Logsdon was truly acceptable. “If the reliability of the shuttle is 99 percent, as NASA has suggested,” he said, “then there is a significant possibility that there will be another lost shuttle before NASA completes the program.” In the face of those odds, he went on, “there is no shame in declaring victory and moving on to the next challenge.”But Administrator Griffin, at his news conference, noted that it took a thousand years from the days the first ships ventured out to open water to the safe ocean voyagers of today. Space travel, by comparison, is in its infancy.“We’ve been doing this stuff for 50 years,” he said. “The enterprise is eminently worth doing. It’s part of what makes us human.”'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Within months of being elected speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn commissioned a citywide poll that sought public input on whether to extend term limits for council members, the speaker’s aides and political consultants confirmed yesterday.The telephone poll, taken in May, asked about 600 city residents for their opinions on term limits and other Council issues, said Mark Guma, a political adviser for Ms. Quinn. The poll was conducted by a Boston polling firm, Kiley & Company.Mr. Guma declined to discuss the results of the poll or the questions that were asked. He also said that he did not know how much the poll cost.The issue of term limits has long been a divisive one in New York City politics. A two-term limit was imposed on the mayor, other citywide elected officials and council members after a 1993 referendum, and reaffirmed by voters in 1996.But over the years, council members and other opponents of term limits have called for the issue to be revisited. Many of the 51 City Council members will be forced to leave office by 2009, and they have said that they support a change that would allow them to serve for another four years.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has opposed extending term limits, and has strongly criticized the Council for even considering going against the voters’ wishes. Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir who spent $4 million on the two earlier referendums, has also vowed to fight legislation that would allow a third term.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Industrial production rose at a higher-than-expected rate of 0.8 percent last month as hot weather increased the use of electricity, while factories turned out more communications equipment and semiconductors.The increase followed a 0.1 percent rise in May that was previously reported as a decline, the Federal Reserve said in its monthly report on output at the nation’s factories, mines and utilities.The proportion of industrial capacity in use rose to 82.4 percent, the highest in six years.Production increased in the second quarter at an annual rate of 6.6 percent, the fastest since the final three months of 1999 and a sign that corporate investment is sustaining economic growth as consumer spending slows. Higher energy costs and factories approaching limits on their ability to produce are inflation threats that Fed policy makers are watching as they decide whether to raise interest rates next month.“Anything related to capital spending is strong and expected to stay strong,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. The rise in capacity utilization “is one more indication that the Fed can’t take its eye off of inflation. The Fed probably isn’t finished raising rates.”Economists expected a 0.5 percent increase in June production. Capacity utilization, which rose from 81.8 percent a month earlier, was forecast to rise to 81.9 percent after a previously reported 81.7 percent.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','More than half a dozen private equity firms have begun forming consortiums to consider bidding for the yellow pages unit of Verizon Communications, people involved in the process said last night.The interest in the yellow pages unit, which analysts estimate could be worth as much as $14 billion, comes as Verizon said it planned to spin off the division before the end of the year as part of a corporate revamping that will allow it to focus on its wireless, broadband and television businesses.Three loose consortiums appear to be forming for the Verizon unit. One includes the Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners, these people said. Another group includes the Texas Pacific Group, Madison Dearborn Partners and possibly the Apollo Group. And a third group that may include Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Carlyle Group is being formed, these people said.It remains possible, they said, that members of certain groups may switch to other consortiums as the auction process develops. It also remains unclear whether Verizon will pursue its planned spinoff, a sale of the unit or a combination of both.Private equity firms have become enamored of the yellow pages unit because of its large and predictable cash flows. Carlyle and another equity firm, Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, made $2.6 billion on their investment in Qwest Communications International’s yellow pages business in 2002.Bain Capital bought Verizon’s Canadian directory unit in 2004 for $1.54 billion. With such interest in yellow pages units, many phone companies have sold them to pay down debt.Verizon said that its directories business, which includes Verizon SuperPages, had $3.4 billion in revenue last year — second after AT&T’s division — and that it controlled 21 percent of the directories market. Verizon Directories generated $1.03 billion in profit last year. If the spinoff is completed, the company will be based in Dallas and have about 7,100 workers.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','LOS ANGELES, July 17 — The law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad & Schulman and two of its partners pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges of making more than $11 million in secret payments to people who agreed to become plaintiffs in lucrative class-action securities lawsuits.Two other defendants — Seymour M. Lazar, who is accused of serving as a paid plaintiff, and Paul T. Selzer, a lawyer who is accused of helping launder the payments — also pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court.Milberg Weiss and the two partners, David J. Bershad and Steven G. Schulman, were indicted in May on charges that included mail fraud and conspiracy.The law firm said in a statement Monday: “The indictment is unprecedented and unfair, and the firm intends to vigorously defend itself against the charges. We are confident that we will be fully vindicated.”At a hearing later in the day, prosecutors told a federal judge there was a possibility that more indictments could be coming.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','The driver, Ms. Termo, said in a brief telephone interview last evening that she stopped her car, a 2005 Nissan Sentra, and tried to comfort Tiffany until help arrived.“I held her in my arms until the ambulance came, I was so distraught,” said Ms. Termo, who was crying as she spoke. “I wish it was me instead of that little girl.”The morning accident brought friends and relatives of the girl out into the streets. A stream of people went in and out of the Gunaratne home on Brentwood Avenue, a brick house with a big bay window on a lot bordered by a wooden fence. Tiffany’s parents, who are originally from Sri Lanka, were too distraught to speak to a reporter.The police said that about 8:10 a.m., one of the family’s dogs ran from under a gate at the house and got loose. The dog, named Sammy, was a stray that the Gunaratnes found about three months ago, neighbors and Mr. Alwis said.The police said Tiffany chased after Sammy, running northbound on Brentwood Avenue, a quiet, tree-lined street, and then into Henderson Avenue, a busier roadway. Ms. Termo was driving east on Henderson Avenue. She swerved, missing the dog but hitting Tiffany, she and the police said.“I am so distraught, I can’t really talk,” she said. “You have no idea how much pain I am in. I saw the dog, but I didn’t see the girl. I am so sorry, I really cannot talk.“I cannot even get the words out.”Beth Schmidt, 48, a neighbor, said the children on the block play in one another’s backyards. Standing with her son Luke, 9, and their dog, she said, “It’s just a tragedy.”Tiffany and her siblings have three dogs, including Sammy, who neighbors described as a small dog resembling a poodle mix. The other dogs, larger breeds, are named Scotty and Colin.Ms. Schmidt said Tiffany would often walk the dogs with her father, with Tiffany holding Sammy’s leash and her father handling the larger dogs. Of the three pets, Mr. Alwis said, “Sammy was her favorite.”At another point, Mr. Alwis began to cry in describing his niece’s personality. “She asked me to carry her, and I lifted her up,” he said. “She’s very bright.”Ms. Schmidt and other neighbors said there have been mounting concerns about cars speeding on Henderson Avenue, though police have said speeding was not a factor in this accident. “We have a lot of problems with this street, and it’s scary because it’s a cut-through for the ferry,” Ms. Schmidt said. “It’s a dangerous strip; people speed.”Just days ago, she said, a driver ran into a tree. “I was standing there with my kids and Tiffany’s mom and her girls,” she said.In 2005, the city’s Department of Transportation studied traffic volume and signals on Henderson Avenue at the request of the community, said Kay Sarlin, a spokeswoman for the department, but found there was not enough volume to add more signals.By this spring, after a study by the mayor’s Traffic and Transportation Task Force, two signs displaying cars’ speeds were installed to deter speeding, she said.The speed limit is 30 miles per hour.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Intel is set to introduce a long-delayed chip for high-end computers today, hoping to breathe life into a product line that has lagged expectations despite billions of dollars of investment.The chip, the latest addition to Intel’s Itanium processor family, has 1.7 billion transistors — triple that of its predecessor. It also has two processing cores to handle multiple tasks at the same time, and a vast amount of memory.“If nothing else, it’s a manufacturing feat,” said Jim McGregor, principal analyst with In-Stat, a market research firm. “It’s getting them back in the competitive offering.”Long-known by the code name Montecito, the chip is part of a development effort that originally included Hewlett-Packard and was intended to replace the aging Pentium family of processors.The chip is expected to be used mainly for high-end computing tasks such as modeling climate patterns.Shares of Intel were down four cents to $17.84 yesterday. The stock has fallen 38 percent from a 52-week high reached almost exactly a year ago as the company lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','A frequent guest on the “Late Show With David Letterman” — he appeared on it more than two dozen times — Mr. Haggerty also played bit parts in several movies, including “Married to the Mob” and “Honeymoon in Vegas.”In the early 1960’s, when Mr. Haggerty established his school, dog-training academies were almost unknown in the United States. His curriculum, too, went far beyond the usual sitting and fetching. He trained show dogs and sled dogs; stage dogs and screen dogs; bird dogs and rabbit dogs; herding dogs and tracking dogs; patrol dogs and messenger dogs; drug-sniffing, bomb-sniffing and mine-sniffing dogs; guide dogs and avalanche dogs; sentry dogs and attack dogs, among others.His clients included the New York Stock Exchange, where his dogs used to sniff for drugs before the opening bell; the Pinkerton detective agency; the Panamanian defense forces; and a roster of celebrities including Hugh Hefner, Flip Wilson, Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields, Leona Helmsley and Henry A. Kissinger.Mr. Haggerty’s big blunt exterior belied a soft center, associates said. But he had little patience for the New Age dog-training methods of recent years. These methods, in which trainers “sit down with the owners, hypothesize, talk philosophy and whisper in the dog’s ear kissy face nice-nice and click a clicker,” were almost always ineffectual, he told Dog World magazine in 2003.“Results matter, period,” Mr. Haggerty explained in the same interview. “Take the dog who barks and barks relentlessly. The desperate renter will have to get rid of the dog if the problem isn’t fixed. Here’s what I do. I wait with the owner in the hallway. Sure enough, the dog starts barking and I explode into the house and scare the living” daylights out of the dog. (Mr. Haggerty did not use the word “daylights.”) He added:“And after one session with me — if the owner follows up — the dog lives. Period. End of story.”Arthur Joseph Haggerty was born in Manhattan on Dec. 3, 1931, and grew up in the Bronx. He liked to say that he cut his teeth on a feed pan: his father and grandfather raised and showed Irish setters and Boston terriers. He began training his own dogs as a child.Mr. Haggerty spent nine years in the Army, which he joined in 1951. First came two tours in Korea, where he earned a Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Afterward, he trained military dogs, eventually becoming the commanding officer of the K-9 unit at Fort Benning, Ga.In 1961, Mr. Haggerty founded his academy, originally known as the Tri-State School for Dogs. For many years it was on East 76th Street in Manhattan; in 1991, Mr. Haggerty moved the school to Los Angeles. He retired to Florida in 2004.Mr. Haggerty’s marriage, to Betty-Ann LaMott, ended in divorce. Besides his daughter, who runs a dog-training business in Jupiter, he is survived by a brother, Gerard, of the Bronx; and two grandchildren.In the interview with Dog World in 2003, Mr. Haggerty was asked what he wanted his eulogy to say. He came up with this: “He was an annoying and grating individual. But he loved dogs. He saved lives. He got the job done. End of story.”'"
"'06-07-18,'1','But in two recent interviews, Dr. LaMattina said the pessimists, on and off Wall Street, were about to be proven wrong. “The science has exploded and all sorts of things are happening,” he said over tea last month at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, where Pfizer executives were meeting to discuss the company’s strategy for 2007.He insists that Pfizer — the entire industry, for that matter — is on the verge of a new age of drug discovery, one that will turn cancer, diabetes and other debilitating illnesses into manageable conditions. Decades of research into the mechanisms of disease have given drug makers hundreds of promising new cellular and genetic targets to study.As a result, Pfizer has more potential drug compounds in early-stage development than ever before, Dr. LaMattina said. And in the last seven months, the company has introduced four new drugs, two of which are expected to be blockbusters, with peak yearly revenues of $1 billion or more each.Of course, Dr. LaMattina, 56, has a financial and personal interest in offering a positive spin on Pfizer’s prospects. He was paid $5.1 million in salary and other compensation last year, and owns about $10 million in Pfizer shares, according to the company’s proxy.Analysts say it is too soon to gauge whether he is worth such compensation, because new drugs require years of human testing before they can be approved.“R.& D. productivity has to be measured over a very long, i.e. 10-year or greater, time period,” said Richard Evans, an industry analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. At that rate, Dr. LaMattina will be about ready for retirement before anyone outside Pfizer can judge his success.But Dr. LaMattina appears genuinely enthusiastic about the long-term prospects for Pfizer — and for patients desperate for new treatments.If he is right, Pfizer may one day be viewed with the same admiration that doctors formerly lavished on Merck, the drug maker once considered the gold standard of the pharmaceutical industry. If not, he will be just another research chief who promised more than he delivered.For now, Pfizer’s poor output has led analysts and industry critics to wonder whether its far-flung research operations, which encompass eight major campuses with 14,000 scientists on three continents, are simply too large to work efficiently.Mr. Evans said that Pfizer, after buying Warner-Lambert in 2000 and Pharmacia in 2003, seems to have become a swollen bureaucracy that does not give individual scientists autonomy.Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of health research for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, said that although the entire industry had suffered from a decline in productivity, Pfizer’s lack of breakthroughs was notable given its research budget. Pfizer hoped the mergers “would magically fill empty product lines,” Dr. Wolfe said. “It didn’t happen.”But some current and former Pfizer managers disagree, saying that Dr. LaMattina has fostered an environment where scientists can thrive.“It’s a real challenge to stay in touch with the science when you’re in charge of such a very large organization,” said Dr. Nancy J. Hutson, who was director of Pfizer’s 6,000-scientist lab complex in Groton and New London, Conn., until she retired March 1. “But I think he does a lot, works hard to stay in touch with the science.”Dr. LaMattina argues that Pfizer’s size is an advantage. The company’s huge research budget means that it gets first crack at the newest equipment, he said, and enables Pfizer to spread bets across many different potential therapies.“Size enables you to take lots of bets, lots of shots on goal,” he said.If Dr. LaMattina does succeed in spurring Pfizer’s labs to new discoveries, part of the reason may be his personality, his colleagues say. The drug industry is built on failure, with thousands of compounds never making it out of the laboratory for each new medicine that reaches the market, and top scientists are notoriously competitive and hard-driving.But in person, Dr. LaMattina appears relaxed and likeable. People who have worked with him say that he listens carefully and does not micromanage their efforts.“I don’t know anything that I haven’t been able to say to him, even when it’s quite difficult,” said Dr. Martin Mackay, the worldwide head of research and technology at Pfizer, who reports directly to Dr. LaMattina. “He’s very open.”Dr. LaMattina said that, given the complexity of the science underlying drug discovery, he tried not to become too optimistic or pessimistic about any new compound. “I have seen too many research heads be too absolute about, ‘This is a good program; kill this program,’ ” he said. “It’s very easy for someone to come in and say, ‘Kill it.’ ’’And yet Dr. LaMattina, who has worked at Pfizer for his entire professional career, starting in 1977, when he joined the company as a research scientist after a fellowship at the National Institutes of Health, is passionate about defending Pfizer from critics who say that it has repeatedly hidden the risks of its medicines, including Zoloft, an antidepressant that has been linked to suicidal thinking in teenagers.In May, Pfizer took another public relations hit with the disclosure of a Nigerian government report that said the company had acted improperly during a 1996 clinical trial of Trovan, an antibiotic, on children with meningitis. The report contended that Pfizer had broken international law, and it criticized Pfizer’s scientists for leaving Nigeria after testing the drug on about 100 children, even though the meningitis epidemic continued.“Medical testing was done on people without informed consent,” said Elaine Kusel, a lawyer who has sued Pfizer, so far unsuccessfully, over the Nigerian testing. The Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan in 1997 but restricted its use two years later, after it was linked to liver failure.Dr. LaMattina defended Pfizer’s actions. “Our scientists said, ‘There are people dying in Nigeria, Trovan works — why don’t we try it?’ ’’ he said, his words growing louder and faster as he spoke, a departure from his normal interview demeanor. “We were going in to save people from dying — and in fact did save people from dying — and now are accused of this. When people think badly of you, then everything will be put in a negative light.”Dr. LaMattina said Pfizer’s scientists had left Nigeria even though the epidemic was continuing because it would have been unethical to continue using Trovan until they had analyzed the trial and could be certain that the drug was safe and effective.The industry’s critics, he said, ignore the fact that over the last generation, Pfizer and other drug companies have saved millions of lives with new medicines for cancer, heart disease and H.I.V.Since December, Pfizer has won federal approval for Eraxis, a new antibiotic; Exubera, an inhaled form of insulin for diabetics; Sutent, a medicine for kidney cancer; and Chantix, a smoking cessation treatment. Sutent and Chantix are especially significant, because they came out of Pfizer’s labs and because clinical trials have shown them to be more effective than older medicines. The other medicines, Eraxis and Exubera, were initially developed by other companies, although Pfizer did much of the work in bringing them to market.Dr. LaMattina is excited about new drugs for cancer and heart disease, especially torcetrapib, a medicine from Pfizer that has shown the ability to raise HDL, also known as good cholesterol, which may protect people from heart attacks and strokes. Pfizer is now spending $800 million on clinical trials to research whether torcetrapib can help prevent heart disease. If the trials are successful, torcetrapib could be approved within the next two years.Even the torcetrapib program is controversial, though, because Pfizer has said that at least initially it plans to sell the drug only in combination with Lipitor, Pfizer’s medicine that lowers so-called bad cholesterol. Lipitor is the world’s best-selling drug, with sales of $11 billion last year.Such a combination would mean that people taking other cholesterol-lowering drugs would have to switch to Lipitor if they wanted torcetrapib’s benefits. In Pfizer’s defense, Dr. LaMattina argues that Lipitor is very safe and that testing torcetrapib alongside every cholesterol-lowering drug would be financially prohibitive.In any case, Dr. LaMattina said, the torcetrapib program is evidence of the enormous bets that drug companies must make. If clinical trials reveal unexpected side effects, Pfizer’s $800 million investment will be lost.Whatever happens with torcetrapib, though, Dr. LaMattina says he intends to remain as Pfizer’s research chief for several more years, perhaps until he reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65.“I’m going to stay for a while,” he said, “because I’ve been around for all the crummy stuff, and this is going to be good.”'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Cabrini has been doing just that, perhaps more than any other hospital in the city, by finding niches that neighboring hospitals generally have not filled.“If we just sat back and did nothing, we’d be closed in two years,” said Robert Chaloner, the president and chief executive officer. “And that would be a shame.”Experts say it is far too soon to judge the success of Cabrini’s transformation, but that if it works, it could be a model for other small, troubled hospitals to follow. The changes mirror the kinds of steps urged by the Berger Commission: find unmet needs and form partnerships with other hospitals, rather than going head-to-head in competition, and focus on areas where more service is needed, like long-term, psychiatric and outpatient care.“It’s significant that they are acknowledging that their current configuration is not viable, and thinking very seriously about what to do about it,” said James R. Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund, a research group. “A very key factor is the affiliation with a big academic medical center.”None of the hospital’s new projects involve the standard “medical-surgical” beds that so often lie empty in New York. In fact, Cabrini’s plan calls for reducing the number of all beds to 170 from 320. That has opened space within the hospital for services that used to be in satellite buildings, like a large H.I.V. program, allowing Cabrini to sell some valuable real estate.Just as important, the new functions, for the most part, call for minor renovations and do not require expensive new equipment.For years, hospitals in New York City waged a medical arms race, in part because they are packed so closely together; Cabrini is less than a mile from four much bigger, wealthier competitors. Hospital executives believed they needed to match each new, costly program or piece of machinery — a cardiac catheterization laboratory, a cancer center, the latest M.R.I. — acquired by their neighbors.Analysts say that made the industry’s finances worse — too many hospitals spent too much money chasing a limited number of cases.“When I first got to Cabrini five years ago, people were saying we needed a cath lab, but we’re surrounded by cath labs,” Mr. Chaloner said. “Not all health care is high-powered stuff like transplant surgery. People mostly go to the hospital for simpler things like appendectomies and hernias, which we do well, and more cost-effectively than the big places that have much higher built-in costs.”He emphasized those basics, and cut the hospital staff to the equivalent of about 1,200 full-time jobs from about 1,700, but it seemed that such measures still could not save Cabrini. The hospital lost $10 million last year, and has often been mentioned among the hospitals at high risk of having to close.Administrators raised the idea of closing down and selling the hospital, on 19th Street between Second and Third Avenues — a choice parcel that they estimated would bring $130 million.But the order that owns Cabrini, the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, rejected that option. Frances Xavier Cabrini, who founded the order and was later canonized, also founded the hospital, as Columbus Hospital, in 1892.“Mother Cabrini gave us a mission,” and the order was unwilling to abandon it, said Sister Catherine Garry, a hospital trustee.So last year, a new strategy took shape, one that will eventually rely heavily on long-term care.Cabrini plans to establish a 40-bed long-term acute care unit for patients who have been in intensive care and no longer need such expensive treatment, but still require more attention than they get in a standard hospital bed. Cabrini is also looking into creating a “transitional care” unit, something between a nursing home and a standard hospital ward.The payment systems used by Medicare and other insurers recognize both transitional care and long-term acute care as specific categories, and pay relatively well for them, but very few hospitals in New York provide them.Cabrini has won state approval for a 28-bed psychiatric unit for elderly people with dementia and other medical problems. Some of those would be long-term patients, as well. And other plans call for expansion of the geriatric and hospice units.Some changes, which are already under way, emphasize outpatient care and chronic conditions.This spring, Cabrini hired Dr. Peter Sheehan, a noted endocrinologist, to create a new diabetes center, complete with services like podiatry and nutrition counseling.Diabetes centers generally lose money, and many have closed in recent years. But Cabrini has gambled that a center focusing on treating diabetes complications of the feet and legs like those suffered by Mr. Squire, 67, a former bus driver, could prevent many amputations and pay for itself.“Eighty percent of the cost in diabetes is in 20 percent of the patients, and we’re focusing on that 20 percent,” Dr. Sheehan said.Last year, the hospital hired Dr. Poon, a cardiologist, away from Mount Sinai, and he and Cabrini made a deal with Siemens, a major equipment maker. With financial support from Siemens, the hospital acquired sophisticated new technology for making and manipulating images of the heart, and Dr. Poon and his colleagues teach cardiologists, surgeons and radiologists from around the country how to use it.Dr. Marsh’s home visit program, begun last year, has 85 regular patients, and she expects to reach 200 by next year. Most speak Spanish, and large numbers are elderly, live alone or have dementia.Cabrini will lose about $3.5 million this year, and ought to break even next year, Mr. Chaloner said.If it were just another hospital, “Cabrini could disappear tomorrow and the system would absorb it, no problem,” he said. “New York is great at the most sophisticated medicine to deal with the most acute problems. But outside that sphere, there’s a lot that’s lacking, and that’s what we’re aiming at.”'"
"'06-07-18,'1','“It was a symbolic gesture, and I think she really managed to get across that it was a matter of heart for her,” said Hanno Gundert, director of the German-Russian Exchange in St. Petersburg, which organizes exchange programs for young teachers, social workers, journalists and other professionals.Dezire Deffo, the vice president of the African Union, a local organization, said Ms. Blair told the groups that she had not yet read the law but that she planned to do so, saying she was ready to assist with legal advice. “She said, I am prepared to help you if you need it,” Ms. Deffo said.Mr. Putin has said the groups sometimes serve as a cover for foreign intelligence activities and should not be allowed to influence Russia’s politics.The organizations say that the accusation is groundless and that the law, which has created onerous new filing responsibilities, appears to provide a pretext for shutting down groups that the Kremlin deems a political threat.Several Western nations and organizations have expressed concern that the law reflects a step back from Russia’s public commitments to become more democratic.The law is just beginning to be put into effect, and the organizations are waiting to see how it will be enforced and deliberating about whether they should mount legal challenges against it either in Russia or in Europe.Carl Gershman, president of the National Endowment for Democracy, an American-financed private group that provides grants to promote and strengthen democratic institutions in other nations, said in an interview last week that for the moment the groups the endowment supports are watching for the Kremlin’s next step.“We are very worried,” he said. “If indeed they are going to move aggressively on this law, and they try to shut down these N.G.O.’s, then they will have crossed the line.”President Bush also met with civil society leaders when he arrived here last Friday, telling them he would bring up their problems during his private meetings with Mr. Putin.Mr. Gundert said the public support by Western political figures is an encouraging sign. “It is very important to show that the situation is being observed by the international community,” he said. “The law has been passed, and now people are interested in seeing what it will look like in reality.”Mr. Putin, in his own meetings with civil society leaders, said he, too, would review the law.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','The new plane will cost $10 billion to develop, roughly double the budget of the original A350. Airbus finances some of the cost of its new planes with loans backed by European governments — a practice that started a trade battle between the United States and the European Union.Mr. Streiff declined to specify how Airbus planned to pay for this one, saying he did not want to fan the flames of that dispute.Airbus is actually aiming at two Boeing jets with the A350: the 787 and the 777, which is larger and can fly very long routes — between Los Angeles and Singapore, for example. In the last year, the 777 crushed the long-range A340 in orders, giving Airbus little choice but to replace it.With a fuselage a foot wider than the old A350’s, Airbus said it would be able to offer passengers the same, or greater, levels of comfort as the 787. The plane will have the “widest windows in the industry,” said John Leahy, the chief commercial officer of Airbus.Humidity in the cabin will be adjusted to 20 percent, in contrast to 15 percent on the 787 and less than 10 percent on existing planes. The level of humidity, as well as the temperature, can be varied, depending on whether passengers are seated in economy, business or first class.“We’re taking the time to come up with an aircraft that is a step ahead of the 787,” Mr. Leahy said.Boeing seemed unruffled by the A350, noting it would not enter service until 2012, four years after the 787. While the plane will have a wider cabin than the 787, it will be narrower than the 777.By trying to straddle too much of the market with a single plane, Boeing said Airbus would wind up with a plane that is less economical for the airlines. “It’s a big chunk of territory to try to cover with one plane,” said Michael B. Bair, who heads the 787 program.Boeing also noted that the plane would have an aluminum fuselage, not one made of advanced composite materials, like the 787. “It sounds like it’s going to fall short of the available technology,” said Randy Baseler, vice president for marketing at Boeing’s commercial aircraft division.Finally, Airbus does not plan to build an A350 with fewer than 250 seats, ceding that market to the 787. Boeing says there are 1,500 planes of that size, which airlines will have to replace in coming years.For all the criticisms, the Airbus announcement puts the company back into the game against Boeing. Mr. Leahy can now begin selling the A350 to carriers, which have been withholding orders or switching to Boeing out of frustration with what some perceived as an inferior design.Mr. Streiff said he met Monday with one of the most outspoken critics, Steven F. Udvar-Hazy, the chairman of the International Lease Finance Corporation, a major aircraft leasing company and customer of Airbus. “We had a long, very positive, very tough conversation,” he said.Analysts had speculated that Airbus might rename the plane A370, to emphasize its new design. But people at the company said the second choice had been to call it A280 — a nod to its shared technology with the A380. In the end, though, Airbus merely added to its original name.Even the old A350 managed to lure 100 firm orders. Mr. Leahy said he expected only one or two airlines to cancel those orders. The rest will be switched over to the new plane. The plane comes in three sizes, with catalog prices of $186 million, $215 million and $242 million, he said.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','The International Keyboard Institute and Festival is the biggest of Mannes College’s back-to-back schedule of summer programs. It runs for two full weeks, with master classes, lectures, demonstrations and recitals open to the public every day from 9 a.m. to about 10 p.m.Audiences are usually packed more tightly into Mannes’s concert hall for the keyboard event than for the college’s other festivals (which examine Beethoven, contemporary music and the classical guitar). There is even an official T-shirt (for $20) in the lobby.Jerome Rose, the festival’s founder and director, gave the opening recital on Sunday evening in a program calibrated to his strengths, which include the sonic heft, broad gestures and grand scale of Romanticism.Even so, Mr. Rose began with two works from outside the Romantic repertory, which isn’t to say that he recognized such a distinction. He played Mozart’s Sonata in C minor (K. 457) as a full-fledged Romantic score with a big, strong tone that made its textures sound thicker than they are. With that tonal weight established, proportions of all kinds inevitably change. So while Mr. Rose’s dynamics were essentially those of the score, their effects was magnified to Lisztian proportions.Paul Schoenfield’s “Intermezzo” (2002) is a graceful, slowly building rumination in a language so conservative that it could almost pass as a lost Chopin work. That was how Mr. Rose played it, and it was an approach that worked once you accepted that Mr. Schoenfield, always an eclectic composer, was intent on pursuing an unequivocally nostalgic notion here.Mr. Rose closed the first half of the program with a thundering account of Schumann’s G minor Sonata (Op. 22) that put the music’s audacious outbursts into high relief, but didn’t skimp on its gentler qualities, like the singing melody line in the Adagio. Similar qualities — with a greater emphasis on poetry and lilting themes than on thunder, though there was some of that as well — enlivened the four Chopin Ballades, which Mr. Rose played after the intermission.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','The meerkats, however, interest television and science for the same reasons. They are highly social, with family issues that humans may recognize. They are complicated enough to have individual personalities and different roles within the group. (Youssarian, for instance, is anxious and put upon by his brother, the dominant male, who may steal food from him and not bother to eat it. Consequently, Youssarian engages in some very strange behavior, causing the death of one pup by trying to move the group to a new burrow when his brother is away.)The meerkats help one another in numerous ways. When Shakespeare is bitten by a puff adder, for example, his sisters stay with him as he struggles for survival, apparently offering comfort.As Dr. Thornton said in an interview, “It’s very easy to anthropomorphize the meerkats.”But, he added, “It is a bit dangerous.”The meerkats are so social, and share so many behaviors with us, that there is a temptation to attribute to them the emotions we experience.And some no doubt are the same. The animals certainly display anger, fear, confusion. They clearly suffer when they are excluded from the group.But it would be too much to suggest something like love, said Tim Clutton-Brock, who started the Kalahari meerkat project. The researchers do not have control over the show, but Dr. Clutton does look at scripts and tries to make sure the meerkats are not turned into furry humans with scent glands.Those glands do set meerkats apart from humans. In “Meerkat Manor” the animals are constantly rubbing their hind ends against other meerkats, bushes — just about anything — to declare ownership or dominance.Dr. Clutton said that if you spend much time with them, the meerkats will scent mark you. There you are, entering notes in your hand-held computer, and the meerkats are all around you, perhaps even sitting on your head, and then you feel something wet on your leg. The smell is musty, he said, but not offensive. Not human, though, definitely not human.It’s in between the human and the meerkat where things get interesting, as in the way meerkats teach young members of the group, the subject of the paper in Science by Dr. Thornton and Dr. McAuliffe.They write that they are presenting what they think is the first unequivocal evidence of a nonhuman mammal teaching its offspring in the wild. That in itself was a surprise. Dr. Thornton said other mammals, including perhaps killer whales, might teach their young, but definitive studies had not been done. In fact, he said, the first solid evidence of any animal teaching was produced only recently in a study of ants.Dr. Thornton and Dr. McAuliffe focused on one of the lessons young meerkats must learn: how to eat a scorpion. This is not merely table manners — it’s a case of learn or die. Older meerkats will give dead and disabled scorpions to the young. But for this to qualify as teaching, the adults had to modify their behavior to teach the young, at no immediate benefit to the adult, and the young had to learn more quickly than they would without teaching.This kind of teaching was thought to require a sophisticated understanding of others, a notion of the other’s mind. But that does not seem to be the case, Dr. Thornton said, with either ants or meerkats.The scientists played back the begging calls of young meerkats of different ages for foraging adults, who changed the way they prepared scorpions depending on who they thought was doing the begging. The calls change as the pups grow, and when meerkats are in a group digging for scorpions, millipedes and other prey, they all help the pups, responding to the calls they hear.The youngest meerkats get dead scorpions. As they grow, they get live scorpions with no stinger. Eventually, they get the whole, awful, tasty package. And they don’t learn as fast without training, which the researchers established by acting the role of helper in providing dead and live scorpions to young meerkats. The ones who got the live scorpions learned more quickly.Here is a case where animals seem like us, but they’re not. They are teaching the young, and at first it looks like what humans might do, but it’s very different. It doesn’t require thinking, the researchers say.The findings tell us something about what meerkats are like and what we are like. And that’s really my interest in “Meerkat Manor,” intellectual stimulation and learning. Except that I really, really don’t like Youssarian. I love Shakespeare. Flower scares me. And when the Whiskers fight the Lazuli, I get a little adrenaline surge. Intruders! Thugs! Toothy little demons with no concern for meerkat life!Why I’d like to ... wait, is that a meerkat feeling, or a human one?'"
"'06-07-18,'1','This was new evidence, the scientists concluded, that the tyrannosaurs as a group had life patterns closer to that of wild populations of long-lived birds and large mammals than their fellow reptiles. But the exceptionally low mortality of juveniles appeared to be unmatched by that of many modern vertebrates, humans excepted.“By age 2, most tyrannosaurs were as large or larger than all other predators in their realm,” Dr. Erickson said. The juveniles started at lengths of 6 feet and reached 20 feet by maturity.The research into the lives and deaths of four tyrannosaur species was reported in the current issue of the journal Science by two dinosaur paleontologists, Dr. Erickson and Philip J. Currie of the University of Alberta, and two population biologists at Florida State, Brian D. Inouye and Alice A. Winn.Richard Lane, director of earth science programs at the National Science Foundation, which supported the research, called the findings “a breakthrough in unraveling these dinosaurs’ life cycles.”Other paleontologists not involved in the work said the results laid the foundation for understanding the vicissitudes of dinosaurian life. The species studied lived 70 million years ago, in the closing era of dinosaur dominance on earth.In their investigation, the scientists examined 22 individual fossils of Albertosaurus from a site near the Red Deer River 120 miles northeast of Calgary. Nine of the skeletons were collected a century ago by the famous fossil hunter Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural History. Starting in 1997, Dr. Currie and teams from the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, in Alberta, re-excavated the site for the rest of the specimens.The researchers counted growth lines in the limb and foot bones to determine ages at death. Then they drew a “survivorship curve” based on the proportions of individuals that died during each life stage.“Ideally, you would like to have a larger sample,” Dr. Erickson said in a telephone interview. “But if you randomly selected 22 out of 10,000 animals, that would be a large enough sample to have a 90 percent confidence that the pattern you’re getting is significant.”To test their interpretation, the scientists examined the age at death of 70 more tyrannosaur skeletons at museums in Canada and the United States. The specimens included Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus and the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex.It was no surprise that hatchlings were absent in the primary study sample. Their fragile bones were not likely to survive to fossilization. In preparing the survival curve, scientists assumed the mortality rate of the very young to be similar to that of modern vertebrates like birds and crocodiles — up to 80 percent.At the other end of the life spectrum, the Red Deer deposit contained only one Albertosaurus that attained the probable maximum size and age for the species, 30 feet and 28 years. The oldest known T-rex died at 28, a giant apparently enfeebled by arthritis, fungal infections and other afflictions of aging.The few juveniles in the sample may have cleared up a mystery: why are they so scarce in the fossil record? Some paleontologists speculated that tyrannosaurs grew to adult size in such a brief time that they left no detectable fossil traces of their juvenile period of transition.“However, this notion is inconsistent with our growth curve,” Dr. Erickson and colleagues wrote in Science. “Instead, we suggest that these young animals simply had low mortality, just like older juveniles and subadults of most large terrestrial mammals today.”'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Q. What makes my dog shed enough hair in the spring and fall to make another dog?A. There is compelling information that the shedding process is touched off by photoperiod (the amount of sunlight in the day) and temperature, said Dr. Danny W. Scott, professor of medicine at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell and a specialist in veterinary dermatology.The same holds true for all other animals known to shed on a seasonal basis, including cats and horses, he said.The exact hormone that affects dogs’ hair follicles is not known, Dr. Scott said. There is good evidence that it is melatonin in minks, but that has not been documented in dogs, he said.Photoperiod and temperature hold sway when an animal is predominantly outdoors, Dr. Scott said, “but once you add artificial light, all bets are off.” A pet that sheds all year to some degree probably spends almost all of its time indoors, subjected to artificial light, he said.For an individual dog, shedding can also be linked to the presence of some type of metabolic or hormonal abnormality, Dr. Scott said. While such hormonal problems are fairly common in dogs, they are rare in cats and unheard of in horses.Dietary factors in canine shedding are unlikely in a country where most pets are fed a good diet, Dr. Scott said, adding that a shortage of protein or fatty acids would be suspected only if the pet ate primarily people food or a low-quality commercial food.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','A. They should learn that scientific hypotheses require evidence. The bulk of my commentary discusses the actual peer-reviewed data.Q. Why do some people attribute differences in professional achievement to innate ability?A. One of the reasons is the belief by highly successful people that they are successful because of their own innate abilities. I think as a professor at Stanford I am lucky to be here. But I think Larry Summers thinks he is successful because of his innate inner stuff.Q. What about the idea that men and women differ in ways that give men an advantage in science?A. People are still arguing over whether there are cognitive differences between men and women. If they exist, it’s not clear they are innate, and if they are innate, it’s not clear they are relevant. They are subtle, and they may even benefit women.But when you tell people about the studies documenting bias, if they are prejudiced, they just discount the evidence.Q. How does this bias manifest itself?A. It is very much harder for women to be successful, to get jobs, to get grants, especially big grants. And then, and this is a huge part of the problem, they don’t get the resources they need to be successful. Right now, what’s fundamentally missing and absolutely vital is that women get better child care support. This is such an obvious no-brainer. If you just do this with a small amount of resources, you could explode the number of women scientists.Q. Why isn’t there more support for scientists who have children?A. The male leadership is not doing it, but women are not demanding it. I think if women would just start demanding fairness, they might get it. But they might buy in a little bit to all this brainwashing. They are less self-confident. And when women speak out, men just see them as asking for undeserved benefits.Q. Why are you a scientist?A. I knew from a very young age — 5 or 6 — that I wanted to be a scientist, that there was something fun about it and I would enjoy doing it. I decided I would go to M.I.T. when I was 12 or 13.Q. As a girl, were you pressured not to try for M.I.T.?A. Of course. I was a very good math and science student, maybe the best in my high school. And despite all that, when it came time to talk to my guidance counselor, he did not encourage me. But I said, I want to go to M.I.T.; I don’t want to go anywhere else. So I just ignored him. Fortunately, my parents did not try to dissuade me.Q. Were there girls at M.I.T. then?A. Very few, but M.I.T. from its very start took women. I loved it. I am not saying it is perfect, but it was a great place to go to school.Q. Why did you decide to specialize in neuroscience? Did the fact that you were a transgendered person spark your interest in the brain?A. I think all transgendered people and gay people are aware from childhood that something is going on. But I thought I would be a chemist or an engineer. It was when I took a course from a fabulous neuroscientist that I just got interested in understanding the brain and how disease affected the brain.Q. When you were a woman did you experience bias?A. An M.I.T. professor accused me of cheating on this test. I was the only one in the class who solved a particular problem, and he said my boyfriend must have solved it for me. One, I did not have a boyfriend. And two, I solved it myself, goddamn it! But it did not occur to me to think of sexism. I was just indignant that I would be accused of cheating.Then later I was in a prestigious competition. I was doing my Ph.D. at Harvard, which would nominate one person. It came down to me and one other graduate student, and a dean pulled me aside and said, “I have read both applications, and it’s going to be you; your application is so much better.” Not only did I not win, the guy got it, but he dropped out of science a year later.But even then I did not think of sexism.Q. Why didn’t you see these episodes as sexism?A. Women who are really highly successful, they are just as bad as the men. They think if they can do it, anyone can do it. They don’t see that for every woman who makes it to the top there are 10 more who are passed over. And I am not making this up, that’s what the data show.And it may be that some women — and African-Americans, too — identify less strongly with their particular group. From the time I was a child, from the littlest, littlest age, I did not identify as a girl. It never occurred to me that I could not be a scientist because I was a woman. It just rolled off my back.Now I wonder, maybe I just didn’t take these stereotypes so seriously because I did not identify myself as a woman.Q. As a transgendered person, are you viewed as having an unusually valuable perspective?A. I think because I am transgendered some people view anything I say with suspicion. I am very different from the average person. But I have experienced life both as a woman and as a man. I have some experience of how both sexes are treated.Q. What about the idea that male scientists are more competitive?A. I think that’s just utter nonsense. Men just make this stuff up. But when women are made to feel less confident, they are less likely to enter the competition. I think a lot of this is just the way men and women are treated from the time they are very young.Take my experience with M.I.T. If I had been a guy who had been the only one in the class to solve that problem, I am sure I would have been pointed out and given a pat on the back. I was not only not given positive feedback, I was given negative feedback. This is the kind of thing that undermines women’s self-confidence.Q. What about the idea that women are too emotional to be hard-headed scientists?A. It is just patently absurd to say women are more emotional than men. Men commit 25 times the murders; it’s shocking what the numbers are. And if anyone ever sees a woman with road rage, they should write it up and send it to a medical journal.A. I think people do what they are rewarded for doing, and I think women realize, whether it’s conscious or unconscious, they are not going to get the rewards. So they put the hours into their families or whatever. That’s just a guess.Science is like art, it’s just something you have to do. It’s a passion. When I go into a lab, I’ll go without sleep, I’ll go hours and hours, day after day. And I think women would do that if they weren’t given so much negative feedback.Q. You write that as a man, you can complete a sentence without being interrupted. Are you treated differently in other ways?A. It’s when people don’t know that I was a woman that I can really see the difference. Even in just stupid things. You go into a department store and people are more likely to wait on you.Q. As a woman and then as a man, you have been a scientist for about three decades. Do you see things improving for women in science?A. Slowly, but not nearly at the rate one would expect. In biology, something like 50 percent of the best postdocs are women. It’s still very bad in physics and engineering and chemistry, but even in biology you don’t see women making the leap to tenure. And this disturbs me greatly. These women have worked very hard. They have fulfilled their side of the social contract. I think what we’ve got is just a lot more highly trained, frustrated women.'"
"'06-07-18,'1','Smoking increases the risk of erectile dysfunction by 50 percent, and obesity nearly doubles the risk, new research suggests. Researchers tracked the diet and health of more than 22,000 male health professionals from all 50 states from 1986 through 2000.At the start of the study, after controlling for other factors, they found that men with good or very good erectile function had a lower prevalence of smoking, a lower body mass index, and less hypertension, heart disease and diabetes than those who reported fair, poor or very poor function.Among men who started with good or very good function, those who expended energy equivalent to running 1.5 hours a week reduced their risk of future erectile dysfunction by 30 percent compared with the group that exercised least.But at any level of exercise, being overweight increased the risk of dysfunction. Men who were both overweight and physically inactive had a risk two and a half times that of men who were active and of normal weight.The findings, published in the July issue of The Journal of Urology, were partially financed by Pfizer, and one of the six authors has a financial relationship with that company.Smoking and obesity also increase the risk for heart disease, but they lead to erectile dysfunction at an earlier age, in time to begin preventive measures.'"

"'06-07-19,'1','It is Marilyn Monroe’s curse to be subjected to every manner of cultural-analytical grandstanding. She is the dislocation of identity, a candle in the wind, the postcoital promise, the American backyard, the sweet angel of sex, a resonance of sound in the clearest range of a violin, a deliverance, America itself.If this sounds made up, tune in at least for the blowhard preamble to “Marilyn Monroe: Still Life,” which appears tonight on PBS as part of the “American Masters” series. It culminates with this observation: “the classical pimples of the adolescent working his first gas pump would also pump for her.”Revolting. But this is what a certain kind of geezer pundit likes to do to Marilyn: smother her with language. The narration sounds like a terrible Norman Mailer rip-off except that it’s Mr. Mailer himself, professor emeritus of the University of Marilyn Blather. Like so many smart people recruited for documentaries, he drops his sense of humor and intones in that portentous, “would”-heavy way typical of programs about American culture. (“The mayo packet would change American drive-through cuisine forever.”)All the jawing about pumping pimples is particularly distracting, given that the documentary is supposed to be about still photography. Monroe qualifies for an “American Masters” program, the press materials for this show say, because she was such a great subject for photographers. Moreover, she even had ideas about poses, clothes and settings, and thus was an artist and not just a luminous bowl of fruit. That seems fine, and provides yet another essay-worthy pretext under which it’s O.K. for the millionth time to stare at the four cartoony circles that were Marilyn’s breasts and eyes. Mm, circles ... in all different configurations ... .But “Marilyn Monroe” also features no end of ashen-faced talking heads — many the age she would be now! — talking to the camera about beholding Marilyn, photographing Marilyn, sitting next to Marilyn in a taxi, wanting to sleep with Marilyn, feeling that they had a chance to sleep with Marilyn and worrying that they had missed their chance to sleep with Marilyn.We get it. She was sexy. Now shut up, old men, and show more pictures, please.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','Incest, rare meat, religious loonies and cornball kung-fu television mix it up in “Mad Cowgirl,” the story of, uh, who knows? “A woman, who is dying of a brain disorder, begins a surreal journey which descends into violence,” reads one of two synopses offered in the press kit. The alternate “cult version” puts it thus: “A woman hates her job and also the men in her life so she has to kill the 10 Tigers From Kwangtung to become a better woman.”This much is clear: the woman is a meat inspector and hard-core carnivore named Therese (Sarah Lassez). She may also be insane or a serial killer or the no-budget reincarnation of the Bride from “Kill Bill.” The men include her meatpacking brother (James Duval), a naughty pastor (Walter Koenig) and a Sri Lankan doctor (Linton Semage) who speaks in his native tongue, subtitled for our benefit, although Therese appears to be fluent, versed as she is in the lingua franca of the movie, a primitive dialect of crazy.A demented jag of blasphemy, multicultural weirdness, splatter-movie tropes and inchoate meat metaphors, “Mad Cowgirl” is an underground movie with little sense of grounding; the point is an aggressive pointlessness. The filmmaker, Gregory Hatanaka, has dedicated the thing to John Cassavetes, the demiurge of do-it-yourself cinema, and Doris Wishman, the goddess of berserk sexploitation pictures like “Behind the Nudist Curtain” and “Satan Was a Lady.”Directed by Gregory Hatanaka; written by Mr. Hatanaka and Norith Soth; directors of photography, Spike Hasegawa and James Avallone; edited by B.

"'06-07-19,'1','“This latest core C.P.I. data will not help dispel the notion that core C.P.I. inflation is now accelerating, and that rates will have to be raised further,” said Rob Carnell, an economist with ING.Still, investors appeared to shrug off the concerns raised by the numbers and focus instead on remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, during Senate testimony this morning. Mr. Bernanke said that while inflation is still on the rise, he believes the impact of the Fed’s past interest-rate tightening has yet to be fully felt.“We must take account of the possible future effects of previous policy actions,” he said.Investors apparently took that to mean the Fed was nearly done raising rates, and bid stocks upward. Major market indices jumped just after the text of Mr. Bernanke’s prepared remarks was released. By noon, the Dow Jones industrial average had gained more than 150 points for the day, and both the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite had climbed nearly 1.5 percent.The overall Consumer Price Index rose more moderately than the core component in June in part because of a decline in the energy prices that consumers pay, the first such decline since February. But with crude oil prices now once again near record highs, the June decline may be short-lived.“The reality is that inflation continues to accelerate,” said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisers. “Excluding energy, retail costs rose at a pace that cannot make anyone on the F.O.M.C. comfortable,” he said, referring to the Fed committee.Speculation about whether the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate next month by one-quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, has weighed on investors’ minds in recent months. High oil prices, international political instability and signs of a slowing economy have prompted nervous investors to pull money out of stock markets. More rate increases again, some analysts say, would further deepen the stock market’s slide.The government issued another worrisome statistical report today as well, saying that new residential construction fell by 5.3 percent in June.Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist with MFR, called the housing slowdown “too large to ignore.” He added: “We think that the survey is reflecting builder intentions to slow the pace of housing starts.”'"
"'06-07-19,'1','A summary of the top stories in Russian newspapers appears Monday through Friday.Members of the Public Chamber Commission on Civic Control decided on Tuesday to become independent trial observers following the bizarre conduct of recent court proceedings. The trial of soldiers charged with beating a conscript, Andrei Sychev, to the point where his legs and genitals had to be amputated has become farcical. Representatives from the prosecution and defense have accused one another of pressuring and intimidating witnesses. The former Atomic Energy Minister, Yevgeny Adamov, who faces up to 60 years in prison for embezzlement, wrote to the Public Chamber requesting that it ""send observers from the legal sphere,"" after he was extradited from Switzerland to face the Russian court. Gari Reznik, an attorney and member of the commission, said that by law, Mr. Adamov, who has been in a Russian prison for 15 months, can only be held for 12. ""Legally we don’t have the right to interfere in the juridical process,"" said Anatoly Kucheren, a Public Chamber member. Rather, the Public Chamber proposed observing the proceedings and waiting until the trials closed before making further decisions.RESIDENTS OF FAR EAST VILLAGE TIRED OF SHAKING: Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has gone to Russia’s Far East to investigate how those regions furthest from Moscow are implementing the federal center’s proposed national projects. Mr. Medvedev traveled Tuesday to the Pacific coast village of Tilichiki. An earthquake in April destroyed the town’s airport and damaged several apartment blocks, the hospital and school. Mr. Medvedev said the government would give nine electrocardiographs, four cars, and perhaps a helicopter to the hospital. He also promised new computers and internet service for the school. Oleg Kozhemyakov, governor of the Koryak Autonomous Republic where Tilichiki is located, told Mr. Medvedev that 1,221 out of 2,000 residents have received a total of 36 million rubles in government support. Mr. Medvedev also told residents that he would work to make Tilichiki a more earthquake- resistant city. According to Mr. Medvedev, residents told him to ask Moscow authorities to help them “stop shaking.” “We do not need more than that,” they said.OPPOSING OPINIONS ON EARLY VOTING MEASURE: United Russia on Tuesday again supported a measure allowing for early voting in elections. The initial hearing for the corresponding law on early voting was held on July 8. The practice was halted in 2002 when tighter security measures were instituted to protect against electoral fraud. United Russia’s deputy, Vladimir Gruzdev, said that with this measure “we want to give more voters the opportunity to cast ballots.” Members of the opposition are worried that reintroducing early voting would allow for more opportunities to commit fraud. The head of the Association for the Protection of Voter Rights (Voice), Lilia Shibanova said that most falsification in elections “is done during early voting.”Nikolai Patrushev, Chairman of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee, announced Tuesday that his agency was preparing a project to grant amnesty to participants in illegal armed formations in Chechnya. “Those who have been deceived by gangs and involved in criminal activities,” Mr. Patrushev said, “have a real chance to return to peaceful life.” Gennady Gadkov a member or the State Duma Committee on Security said that deputies are being called back from vacations to discuss the measure. The amnesty would most likely not apply to those who had committed murder, terrorist acts or kidnapping or who endangered the lives of law enforcement officers, Mr. Gadkov said. This is the seventh time an amnesty has been granted in Chechnya and the third since the start of the second Chechen campaign. Salim Beshayev, Deputy Chairman of the separatist Parliament of Ichkeria, said that “in the last six years Russian forces have inflicted such evil on the population of the republic, that no promise can lead Chechens to believe in the sincerity of Moscow’s intensions.BUSH MET WITH RUSSIAN NGO’S: President Bush met with various representatives of Russia’s non-governmental organizations during his stay in St. Petersburg, including Maria Gaidar, daughter of Yegor T. Gaidar, minister of finance during the early 1990’s. Ms. Gaidar is leader of the “Da!” movement that advocates a more democratic Russia. In an interview with Nezavisimaya Gazeta, she describes her impressions of the American president. She says her overall impression of Mr. Bush was “positive” and different from what she expected. She described him as having “quite a deep knowledge of many questions relating specifically to Russia,” contrary to her expectations of a “nice but awkward” person. Mr. Bush was mostly concerned with the development of democracy in Russia and “listened attentively” to participants like Ms. Gaidar and their analysis of the situation in Russia. She said her meeting with Mr. Bush was a good way for the president to include voices other than official representatives of government in the Group of 8 Summit.CHANGES WITHIN RIGHT-WING PARTY: Since this year’s change of leadership in the right-wing nationalist party Rodina, it has changed its oppositional approach and taken on a less aggressive stance, Vedomosti says. Dmitri O. Rogozin, former leader of Rodina, was well known for his opposition politics such as going on hunger strikes, his scathing critique of the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, and his sometimes questionable nationalist stances. As a result of its growing radical tendencies, the party elected Aleksander M. Babakov as party chairman. Since taking the helm, the party has moderated itself, both in action and speech. The party’s critique of the Kremlin and United Russia will become “constructive criticism” as opposed to its earlier sometimes rude remarks. Where under Mr. Rogozin the party participated in multiple street protests and opposition gatherings, it recently refused an invitation to the “Different Russia” summit and stayed indoors during the May holidays, a traditional time for protests. Through its change in political posture, Rodina hopes to make its legislative initiatives more palatable for the Kremlin and win over a larger portion of voter constituency in the upcoming 2007 parliamentary elections.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','“It’s 100 degrees outside; it’s 120 down here,” said Moe Nicholas, 41, a resident of Bedford-Stuyvesant who was waiting at the 57th Street and Sixth Avenue station. “It’s like we’re in Morocco.”Others saw it as the urban summer experience. “To me, this is part of living in New York,” said Richard Bianco, 55, a resident of Astoria who was trying to catch an R train home last evening. “This is par for the course.”Utility companies in the region, which had registered record power use on Monday, said by early last night that usage had been reduced slightly yesterday. The Long Island Power Authority, an exception, said a new demand record was set yesterday. In the city, Consolidated Edison advised thousands of households in western Queens to avoid using unnecessary appliances and imposed a “voltage reduction” in which households continue to receive power but at lower levels.Last night, power was out in parts of Woodside and Sunnyside. In Westchester about 5,000 customers were still without electricity. In New Jersey last night, about 40,000 customers statewide — half of them in the northern part of the state — were left without power as severe storms swept the area, breaking the heat but also felling trees and downing power lines.At La Guardia, power was cut to the Marine Air Terminal, used by the Delta shuttle, and to a section of the central terminal used by American, from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. on Monday night, and starting again at 8 a.m. yesterday.Chris Olert, a Consolidated Edison spokesman, said last evening that the airport’s power had been partly restored by 7 p.m. Sixteen Delta shuttle flights to Washington and Boston were canceled between 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., when service was restored with some delays, and 45 of 129 American Airline departures were canceled, with no service expected until today, according to spokesmen for the two airlines.Although the subway slowdown was far from the largest or longest that riders have experienced, some said the morning meltdown on the 1, 2 and 3 lines was one of the worst.“Every time there’s something out of kilter with the weather, something goes wrong with the underground,” said Tamara Cashour, 46, a teacher, as she waited at the 96th Street and Broadway station for downtown service on any of the three lines.“I depend on these lines, and they are unpredictable,” she saidNew York City Transit blamed a malfunction of the switching system for the breakdown.Service was disrupted at 9:16 a.m., and restored at 10:58 a.m., the transit agency said. During that time, no trains ran on the No. 1 line below 137th Street in Manhattan, all No. 2 trains were diverted to the No. 5 line between the 149th Street-Grand Concourse station in the Bronx and the Nevins Street station in Brooklyn, and service on the No. 3 line was halted entirely.Around 7 p.m., the subway system was thrown into disarray. The V and W were suspended in both directions. Queens-bound R trains stopped at 57th Street. To compensate, the E and F trains ran local in Queens. Lastly, the 7 train was suspended between Queensboro Plaza and Times Square because of a stalled train.Token booth clerks were telling annoyed passengers that in some cases, the delays were caused by lost power that led to signal failures.In the morning delay, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of commuters were stranded in subway cars that were halted in tunnels. Since power continued to flow, most cars were air-conditioned, and subway personnel on some trains encouraged passengers to assist one another by giving up their seats or sharing bottled water.Above ground, the ripple effect could be measured by crowding on city buses, and rising tempers. Along some bus lines, like the 104 on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, people emerged from subway stations dripping with perspiration only to find that buses were already too crowded to accept any more passengers.Ms. Cashour said she had intended to board a subway on the No. 1 line at 110th Street, but knew there were problems even before entering the station: 50 agitated people were waiting outside for a downtown bus.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','“This is the campaign where prowar Democrats and antiwar Democrats may sort themselves out on Iraq,” said Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee for president in 1988. He is neutral in the race, but has supported Mr. Lieberman in the past and recently spoke to Mr. Lamont about regional rail policy.“I don’t know what it is about Lamont,” Mr. Dukakis said, “but he seems to offer a straight choice that is causing a lot of Democrats to think through Iraq.”In many ways, Mr. Lamont is an accidental politician, complete with the boyish facial reactions and sheer earnestness that helped draw Mr. Imus’s derision. (The host is a fan of Mr. Lieberman.)Mr. Lamont wears moderately priced suits from Jos. A. Bank and, at 52, still uses words like heck and poppycock. He quit an exclusive country club in Greenwich this year, saying it was too white and too rich and he did not want it to become a campaign issue. He was not even his own first choice to challenge Mr. Lieberman; he tried to coax others — he will not name names — but they thought running against a three-term senator was foolhardy, he said.So, finding no takers, Mr. Lamont entered the race in March.With national reporters now traveling here to cover him, and his unlimited advertising budget giving Mr. Lieberman agita, Mr. Lamont has concluded that he might just beat the senator in the Democratic primary on Aug. 8 — as long as voters see him as credible, not just as a single-issue rich guy trying to buy an election.Iraq, in other words, may not be enough, Mr. Lamont says. More and more he is trying to round out his profile, pressing his ideas for universal preschool and his work as a guest instructor at a public high school in Bridgeport.He is also bringing up the other reasons he decided to run for Senate, sometimes out of the blue, such as the death of Ms. Schiavo.When her health began deteriorating in Florida last year, Mr. Lieberman emerged as one of a few Democrats in Congress who supported government intervention to keep her alive, on a feeding tube, against her husband’s wishes.“The last place I want my government is in my hospital room,” Mr. Lamont said.He has been on a steep learning curve ever since he entered the race. Blogs, for instance, were news to him. He had not heard of the Daily Kos until a voter mentioned it, even though it is a widely read political blog that has cheered Mr. Lamont on as a David against Mr. Lieberman’s Goliath. “I was like, ‘Daily what?’ ” Mr. Lamont recalled.Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the Daily Kos, said in an interview by e-mail message that he would have been more surprised if Mr. Lamont had heard of the Web site.“For whatever reason, people think Lamont’s candidacy is 100 percent blog-driven, when the reality is much different,” Mr. Moulitsas wrote. “Blogs are merely feeding off the excitement Lamont is generating in the grass roots.”Mr. Lamont has struck a chord with some voters by portraying Mr. Lieberman as out of touch, someone who is a national political figure instead of a leader in Connecticut, who appears on television more than he marches in local parades. It is a tactic common among underdog challengers, but there is a crucial difference in this race: Money.The candidate can tap a personal fortune of between $90 million and $300 million, according to campaign financial disclosures; advisers estimate his wealth at some $200 million.A scion of bankers at J. P. Morgan & Co., Mr. Lamont said that he grew up with a trust fund — he would not disclose its size — but that his inheritance accounted for less than 10 percent of his current wealth.Mr. Lamont used a bank loan in 1984 to start Lamont Digital Systems, a Greenwich telecommunications company that wires college campuses. It is privately held and has shrunk to about 40 employees today from 100 in 2001. Mr. Lamont drew a salary of $546,044 in 2005, and is now a minority shareholder.His wife, Annie Lamont, is a partner in Oak Investment Partners in Westport; according to the disclosure forms, one of her Oak holdings is valued at between $25 million and $50 million.Mr. Lamont has declined to publicly disclose several years of tax returns, despite pressure from Mr. Lieberman, but said he planned to release his 2005 returns shortly.He has already given his campaign $2.5 million, and said in an interview that he was willing to spend millions more. His ads have memorably painted Mr. Lieberman as out of touch and a Bush soul mate, including one in which the senator’s face morphs into the president’s.The challenge has unnerved Mr. Lieberman, friends of the senator say, so much so that he has announced he will run as an independent in the fall general election if Democrats shun him next month.Advisers to Mr. Lieberman try to paint Mr. Lamont as a power-hungry opportunist who voted with Republicans as a Greenwich selectman but is now posing as a liberal to woo the most strident voters, who are more likely to vote on a hot summer day. These advisers also accuse him of trying to buy the election.“He was born into privilege and believes it’s his birthright to go right to the top as a U.S. senator,” said Sean Smith, Mr. Lieberman’s campaign manager.Mr. Lamont grew up in Syosset, N.Y., in a family that had long been involved in business and usually voted Republican; a great-grandfather, Thomas Lamont, was a chairman of J. P. Morgan, though a great-uncle, Corliss Lamont, was a well-known socialist. Mr. Lamont attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard, and the Yale school of management before moving to Greenwich. He and his wife, Annie, have three teenage children, two girls and a boy.For years the Lamonts were members of the Round Hill country club in Greenwich, but Mr. Lamont said he resigned his membership because he did not want it to become a distraction in his campaign. Mr. Lamont said the club excluded people because it was so expensive, and also said he was “a little bit” concerned that many of its members were white.“It’s not as diverse as it should be,” Mr. Lamont said. “I didn’t pay as much attention to that before the race began, to tell you the truth.“They don’t have any discriminatory policies,” he added.He acknowledged that his only major stint in public service was born out of boredom, when he decided in 1987 to run for the Board of Selectmen. He served only one term, but continued to dabble in politics, supporting the presidential campaigns of Mr. Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Bill Bradley, and, in 2004, Bob Graham at first, and then Howard Dean and John Kerry.His political donations have included a total of $1,500 to Mr. Lieberman since the fall of 2002, when the senator voted to support military action in Iraq; $1,000 of it went to the senator’s presidential campaign in 2003, before Mr. Lieberman quit the race.Mr. Lamont said those donations did not suggest he once favored the war; he believes Mr. Lieberman, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and others were misled by the White House on Iraq. Rather, Mr. Lamont said he soured on Mr. Lieberman’s unremitting defense of the war and of President Bush.“The president rushed us into this war based on false assumptions, like W.M.D., and Senator Lieberman has cheered him on all the way,” he said, indulging in a bit of hyperbole, since Mr. Lieberman votes like other Democrats most of the time.Advisers to Mr. Lieberman say that Mr. Lamont has been callow on Iraq. At first the challenger was reluctant to endorse an immediate troop withdrawal; as liberals embraced him, he has became more full-throated. As the recent Senate debate on Iraq was unfolding, Mr. Lamont said he favored a plan by Senators John Kerry and Russ Feingold to set a firm exit date for troops — yet he also said he was comfortable with another Democratic plan that did not have a timetable.The Lieberman campaign accused him of trying to have it both ways, but Mr. Lamont said he was being a pragmatist. “Deadline, time frame, whatever words you want — just get the troops out,” he said. “In business we have deadlines all the time, we operate well with deadlines.”If he makes it to Washington, Mr. Lamont said, he hopes to become known as an advocate for preschool education, much as Al Gore became associated with global warming. Before hopping into his Ford Escape Hybrid recently, Mr. Lamont cited Mr. Gore as one of his heroes in politics — though not because he chose Mr. Lieberman as his running mate six years ago.“Gore spoke about something bigger than himself — global warming and the environment,” Mr. Lamont said. “I’m trying to get Democrats to think in a bigger way about Iraq, if I can. And schools and jobs and health care, too.”'"
"'06-07-19,'1','The crowd of nearly 2,000 demonstrators replied with chants of “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!”As part of the drama of the day, demonstrators read a statement asking the government to help them join Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon, Iran’s state-run television reported.Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s spiritual leader and the country’s most powerful figure, said in a speech on Sunday that Israeli strikes in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories proved how “the presence of Zionists in the region is a satanic and cancerous presence and an infected tumor for the entire world of Islam.”As President Bush and other world leaders struggled at a summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, to devise a plan to stop Hezbollah, Ayatollah Khamenei predicted it would fail. “The American president says Hezbollah should be disarmed,” he said in remarks carried on television, “but it will not happen.”Even Iran’s former president, Mohammad Khatami, who used his eight-year presidency to try to moderate Iran’s foreign policy, likened Hezbollah to “a shining sun that illuminates and warms the hearts of all Muslims and supporters of freedom in the world.”In a letter to Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, on Sunday, Mr. Khatami, who heads the Institute for Dialogue among Civilizations and Cultures here, called the “Zionists’ shocking atrocities in Palestine and Lebanon” a sign of “their violent nature.”Still, it was noteworthy that Mr. Khatami also implicitly urged restraint, warning of “the spread of catastrophe and scale of destruction in Palestine and Lebanon.”Underscoring the heightened sense of Iran as a dangerous regional player, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain accused Iran on Tuesday of supporting Hezbollah with weapons that are “very similar if not identical to those used against British troops in Basra,” in Iraq. Mr. Blair also accused Syria of supporting Iran “in many different ways” and both countries of providing financial support.Israel, the United States, the Europeans and many Arab states have long claimed that Hezbollah receives its weaponry from Iran, an assertion that many Iranian officials admit in private is true. The most significant recent change in Iranian support for Hezbollah is its transfer of longer-range rockets that can be fired into major Israeli cities, according to an analysis by Anthony H. Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But officially, Iran denies providing Hezbollah with weaponry — denials that contribute to distrust of Iran by the outside world.Asked Sunday about Israel’s claim that Iran supplied Hezbollah with missiles, Hamid-Reza Asefi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Iran offers Lebanon and Syria “spiritual and humanitarian support.” He added: “It is not true that we have sent missiles. Hezbollah is capable enough.”Even so, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has ratcheted up the threats by pledging to support Syria if it comes under attack by Israel.“If Israel commits another act of idiocy and attacks Syria, this will be the same as an aggression against the entire Islamic world and it will receive a stinging response,” Mr. Ahmadinejad was quoted by state-run television as telling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a telephone conversation last Thursday.Both Iran and Syria have praised Hezbollah’s crossover into northern Israel and its capture of two Israeli soldiers, the event that set off the Israeli offensive in Lebanon.Despite its heated oratory, Iran seems to be trying to position itself for a potential role in resolving the crisis over Lebanon. In Damascus on Monday, Iran’s foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said a cease-fire and an exchange of prisoners would be a possible way forward in the Israeli-Lebanese conflict.Speaking after a meeting with Syrian Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa, Mr. Mottaki said there should be an “acceptable and fair” resolution, adding, “In fact, there can be a cease-fire followed by a prisoner swap.”Even some of the most seasoned analysts of Iran’s backing for Hezbollah are restrained in their conclusions of Iran’s role in the recent crisis. “Iran will certainly benefit from Hezbollah strikes,” Mr. Cordesman wrote in his analysis. But, he added, “Until there are hard facts, Iran’s role in all this is a matter of speculation, and conspiracy theories are not facts or news.”'"
"'06-07-19,'1','Smith, 51, was the architect of the Rangers’ 1994 Stanley Cup championship team. He became the Islanders’ general manager on June 8, the same day Ted Nolan was named head coach and LaFontaine was named Wang’s senior adviser.The flurry of moves came a week after the Islanders made Bryan Trottier, one of their greatest former players, their executive director for player development. Trottier was a mainstay on the Islanders teams that won four consecutive Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983.“As I made clear at the press conference last month, we are running this as a business, incorporating the opinions of our hockey operations staff, including Ted Nolan, Bryan Trottier and Pat LaFontaine,” Wang said in a statement yesterday. “Despite Neil’s commitment to me that he could work in this environment, he later expressed to me on a number of occasions his philosophical opposition to our business model.”Wang said there were conflicts from the beginning with Smith. Even an issue as small as who was going to hire the equipment manager became contentious, Wang said.When asked what he felt the general manager’s role was, Wang said it was to make trades, oversee the scouting staff and negotiate contracts. The rest, Wang said, was to be determined by consensus.Smith apparently had trouble working with LaFontaine, 41, who played eight seasons with the Islanders. Smith acquired him for the Rangers for the 1997-98 season, but LaFontaine retired at the end of that season because of postconcussion syndrome.Unlike Smith, who was the Rangers’ general manager from 1989 to 2000, LaFontaine had never held a team management position.Neither had Snow, the Islanders’ backup goaltender, who turns 37 on July 28. Snow was 4-13-1 last season as a backup to Rick DiPietro.“I spoke with Garth at length throughout the spring about the general manager’s position, and he really impressed me with his passion and his knowledge,” Wang said in the statement. “When the job opened up, the choice was an easy one.“Garth knows the league as well as anyone, has an eye for talent and understands how our staff works as a team. Most importantly, Garth is a man of integrity, someone I trust will work hard, be creative and represent the Islanders with dignity.”Smith’s dismissal, LaFontaine’s resignation and Snow’s promotion were reminiscent of the dysfunctional Islanders teams of the 1990’s. While not qualifying for the playoffs from 1995 to 2001, the Islanders were at one point owned by John Spano, who was a 32-year-old Dallas businessman when he purchased the team in 1996 for a reported $165 million that it turned out he did not have. Spano ended up in prison for wire and bank fraud.At 36-40-6 last season, the Islanders finished 12th in the 15-team Eastern Conference and failed to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2001.Last month, Smith succeeded Mike Milbury to become the fourth general manager in franchise history. Yesterday, Snow became the fifth. One of his first orders of business may be to find a goaltender to replace himself.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','Mr. Brookwood said of Mr. Hester: “He’s really been through it all. He knows the issues; he knows what customers want.”Mr. Hester joined A.M.D. at the same time that the company announced that the executive widely credited with the success of the company’s Opteron chip, Fred Weber, was leaving to run a start-up.Mr. Hester, who had spent the previous five years running a high-performance computing company that was one of the first customers for the Opteron, was taking on a weighty responsibility.Inside A.M.D.’s Silicon Valley headquarters, the Opteron chip has the revered status of an Olympic champion. After all, it was the Opteron that propelled the company to overtake Intel, the longtime market leader, in the business of selling chips for computer servers, one of the fastest-growing segments of the microprocessor industry.Opteron won a huge early lead in the server market in part because it could run high-performance 64-bit programs at the same time as 32-bit programs, making it an instant hit with technology managers eager to protect their software investments. Since its release in 2003, the processor has been updated to run cooler and to conserve power.With the arrival of Mr. Hester, who works mostly out of the company’s Austin offices, A.M.D.’s efforts to bolster its technology ranks are largely complete. Mr. Hester reports to Dirk R. Meyer, a longtime A.M.D. executive who was appointed president in January, and works closely with Hector Ruiz, the chairman and chief executive.After nine quarters of giving up ground to A.M.D. in the overall microprocessor market, Intel has been striking back, starting with deep price-cutting earlier this year that has eaten into demand for A.M.D.’s chips.A.M.D. recently warned Wall Street that its second-quarter sales, which it will report tomorrow, will be 9 percent below its first-quarter total, missing analysts’ forecasts. The company said sales of notebook and desktop processors had dipped in the quarter, and analysts pointed to Intel’s drastic price cuts as the cause.Yesterday, Intel introduced a major new version of Itanium, its chip for high-end computers that, since its release five years ago, has been largely a disappointment. The new version promises faster performance and less energy use. And next week, Intel officially rolls out a new desktop computer chip named Core 2 Duo, earlier dubbed Conroe, that is based on the company’s new Core architecture. Intel has already announced a Core Xeon chip for servers called Woodcrest, and next month it is expected to announce a Core chip for notebook computers.With Woodcrest, Intel says it will reduce power consumption by 35 percent while improving computing performance by more than 80 percent, closing its performance gap with A.M.D. considerably. Reports from technology consultants who have worked with early versions of Conroe indicate that it does in fact give Intel a big lead in performance, particularly the version used in machines aimed at serious video game fans.“This new architecture is very critical to Intel retaining its lead,” said Dean McCarron, an analyst at Mercury Research. “There’s no question it dramatically changes the competitive position of Intel’s products.”Richard Whittington, an analyst with Caris & Co., said in a report last week that the new technology had the potential to help Intel win back some major ground in its biggest market, chips for desktop computers.Mr. Hester and other A.M.D. executives say that the technology in its laboratories gives them plenty of reason for optimism, and that in some product categories Intel is just catching up to advances A.M.D. pioneered. Just next month, for example, A.M.D. is expected to introduce improvements to Opteron, and both companies are designing chips to run cooler and consume less energy.Much like Intel, A.M.D. is working to increase the number of processors on each chip from two to four, and the company says it will introduce new designs for servers and desktop systems that will be released in mid-2007, followed later in the year by a new design for notebooks. Many analysts are also expecting the company to counter Intel’s pricing moves with price cuts of its own. At A.M.D.’s annual conference for analysts last month, Mr. Hester also disclosed an unusual plan to let other manufacturers build chips that work closely with its own chips, indicating an openness and flexibility that has not been seen before in the company’s strategy.With that effort, referred to as Torrenza, A.M.D. is licensing some of its chip specifications to other technology developers so they can add specialized functions, like advanced graphics and math processing.“We want to open up our technology and unleash a completely new wave of innovation,” Mr. Ruiz told analysts at the conference.Advanced Micro has picked up about five percentage points of market share over the past year, nearly all of that from Intel, according to Mercury Research. Today, A.M.D.’s overall share is about 21 percent, to Intel’s 74 percent, and at the analyst meeting Mr. Ruiz said the goal was to have a 30 percent share by 2008.Mr. Hester said A.M.D.’s road map for new products had not changed much since his arrival. Mostly he has focused on improving the way employees manage projects and pushing them to develop multiple designs at one time. He said he also emphasized cooperation inside development teams, rather than having teams compete for attention.The competitive situation has helped with this. “Being the underdog creates a culture of cooperation,” Mr. Hester said.Mr. Hester, who is 51, spent more than two decades in various positions at I.B.M.’s Austin offices, and in his last job there he ran the personal computing business. He is widely credited with paving the way for the PowerPC, a popular chip architecture.In 2000, Mr. Hester left I.B.M., and he and a partner founded Newisys (pronounced new-EYE-sis), one of the first server companies to sell an Opteron-based product. They sold the company three years later for an undisclosed amount.Despite a travel schedule that has allowed him to accumulate seven million frequent-flier miles over the course of his career, Mr. Hester, who was born and raised in Corpus Christi, Tex., has never ventured far from home for long. He said he turned down several new assignments at I.B.M. to avoid having to move out of Texas. These days he sometimes leaves the office by 4:30 to get home in time to go jet-skiing on a nearby lake with his 14-year-old son.Mr. Hester pointed to one measure of A.M.D.’s recent success: the number of computer companies that have committed to building products based on its processors. In May, A.M.D. had a major coup when Dell, which had been strictly an Intel customer, announced that it would begin to use A.M.D.’s Opteron chip in some of its servers. While Dell insists the commitment is very limited, Mr. Hester is confident the Dell relationship will broaden.“To me the best indication of whether you’re doing the right thing are the design wins you have in the market,” Mr. Hester said, referring to Dell’s choice of A.M.D.’s chips.'"

Mr. Soltani was arrested a year ago while defending two people accused of spying on Iran’s nuclear program. The judiciary said he had shared confidential details of the case with outsiders. He remains free on bail pending his appeal of the verdict, which he said had been delivered without the court summoning him or his lawyers.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','Procter & Gamble, the consumer goods company, said yesterday that it would close Rochas, the critically acclaimed fashion label, after its fall season.The Rochas ready-to-wear line was part of a small fashion division of the German cosmetics company Wella, which Procter & Gamble acquired in 2003. Rochas’s $4,000 suits and dresses, designed by the young Belgian Olivier Theyskens, were an odd fit with Procter’s core products, like Duracell batteries and Tide detergent.A Procter spokeswoman, Francine Gingras, confirmed that the fashion house would close after a report on the Women’s Wear Daily Web site yesterday afternoon. The company will continue making the lucrative Rochas fragrances. Mr. Theyskens could not be reached.The sudden end to one of the fashion industry’s most talked-about revivals is the latest rebuke to the industry’s longtime practice of throwing unlimited resources at fashion shows with the expectation that the publicity will help promote more high-margin fragrance and accessories businesses.Rochas, the Paris couture house founded by Marcel Rochas in 1924, had existed only as a fragrance from the time that Mr. Rochas died in 1955 until Wella, which made its classic Femme scent, brought back a clothing line in 1990 with the designer Peter O’Brien. Mr. Theyskens was hired in 2003.Although Rochas’s expenses were high, Mr. Theyskens’s work had been well received, setting the somber color tone of the fall season and almost single-handedly bringing back the pantsuit.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','Although the findings were preliminary, Dr. Relkin said, some doctors were already giving IVIg infusions to people with mild cognitive impairment, a mental decline that is often an early form of Alzheimer’s. IVIg is in short supply and can cost up to $10,000 a month, depending on the dose, and since it is not approved for Alzheimer’s, patients will probably have to pay for it out of their own pockets.The leading theory of Alzheimer’s is that the disease is caused by deposits of a protein called amyloid that build up in the brain, disrupt nerve function and ultimately kill brain cells. IVIg contains antibodies that stick to amyloid and may help clear it out of the brain. IVIg may also have anti-inflammatory properties that help patients with Alzheimer’s.Dr. Relkin said he and his colleagues had decided to test IVIg in Alzheimer’s patients after doing a small study in which they found that healthy, nondemented people had lots of antibodies to amyloid, whereas those with Alzheimer’s did not. The researchers wondered if some people might be naturally immune to Alzheimer’s, and whether they could pass on their good fortune to others via their antibodies.To explore the idea, the scientists tried giving IVIg to eight patients, age 75 on average, with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s. People at those stages have begun to slow mentally but can still do basic tasks for themselves and are not yet completely dependent on others. All the patients in the study had been given existing treatments for Alzheimer’s without success, and they continued to take those drugs along with the IVIg treatments. Baxter Healthcare Corporation, a maker of IVIg, helped pay for the study.This initial experiment was supposed to be a Phase I trial, meaning that the purpose was to try different doses to see if IVIg was safe, not to determine whether it worked.But soon after the treatments started, the patients’ families began saying that they seemed better mentally, more engaged and oriented, aware of the date and able to find their way around.“I was skeptical,” Dr. Relkin said, explaining that in the first few months of treatment, placebo effects typically occur, and friends or family who believe the treatment must be working often report, honestly but erroneously, that patients are getting better.But the changes became more pronounced, he said, adding, “By six months it was undeniable.” The patients’ scores on mental tests improved slightly as well.Levels of amyloid in the patients’ spinal fluid decreased, indicating that levels in the brain had almost certainly dropped, Dr. Relkin said.More telling, he said, was that when the treatment was stopped, the patients began to regress, both on mental tests and according to the observations of the people taking care of them.The researchers then treated them again, for nine months. The patients stopped declining in the first three months, and most seemed to improve a bit.The government has financed a larger study, to begin in 2007 and to include 210 patients at 21 centers in the United States, to assess the safety of IVIg for Alzheimer’s patients and determine whether it works.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','By The Associated PressQuarterly profit at Merrill Lynch climbed 42 percent, aided by a strong performance in stock trading despite a downturn in the markets.Merrill Lynch said yesterday that for the quarter that ended June 30, it had a profit of $1.58 billion, or $1.63 a diluted share, compared with $1.14 billion, or $1.14 a share, in the second quarter of 2005. Revenue increased 29 percent, to $8.2 billion.The results surpassed Wall Street projections for earnings of $1.52 a share on revenue of $7.53 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial.“This performance came in spite of an operating environment that became more uneven midway through the quarter,” said the chief financial officer, Jeffrey N. Edwards.Mr. Edwards would not comment on whether the continued stock market sell-off through July would have an effect on third-quarter earnings, but investors appeared to think that it would.

"'06-07-19,'1','Several large studios will start letting people create DVD’s of movies in their homes today using a new feature of CinemaNow, an online movie-downloading site.The movie industry has been experimenting with ways to rent and sell downloaded movies, but these efforts have been hampered because the movies generally had to be watched on computer screens. The new service allows the movies to be seen on any television set connected to a DVD player.“People like to watch movies in their living rooms, and this solves their problem,” said Curt Marvis, chief executive of CinemaNow, which is offering the download-to-DVD service. The studios participating include Sony, Disney, Universal, MGM and Lions Gate, which is a major shareholder in CinemaNow.CinemaNow has been selling downloaded movies since April from these and some other studios, but the movies were restricted to computer viewing, and the downloads included only the film. The new offering also includes the bonus material on DVD discs, like filmmakers’ commentary and extra scenes.The picture quality of the discs made through the downloading will not be as high as those on commercial DVD’s because the files need to be compressed to reduce the downloading time. Even so, it will take about three hours to download and burn a movie, hardly allowing for impulse purchases.Mr. Marvis said users would not be inconvenienced by the time. “I was testing the service over the weekend with my family,” he said. “We picked out a movie to see, launched the service, cooked dinner, ate and by the time we washed and put away the dishes, there was the movie.”'"
"'06-07-19,'1','The arrest of Mr. Carruthers, whose 10-year-old 2,000-employee company is one of the top sports betting Web sites, is a sign of how serious prosecutors are about cracking down, Mr. Sinclair said.The industry has “some real cowboys and some real shady characters, but David is not one of them,” Mr. Sinclair said.The BetOnSports Web site continued operating on Tuesday, though trading in its stock, which fell 17 percent on Monday, was suspended. Stock in PartyGaming, which is based in Gibraltar, fell 17 percent on Tuesday on the London Stock Exchange; its decline even dragged the exchange’s FTSE index lower. SportingBet, which is also based in London, fell 36 percent Tuesday after falling 13 percent on Monday.Analysts in London said that investors overreacted.“The indictment seems to be very BetOnSports specific and the market seems to be treating all online gaming companies in the same manner,” said Wayne Brown, an analyst with Altium Securities in London.Companies and analysts combed through the 27-page BetOnSports indictment Tuesday, trying to predict where the Department of Justice could be headed next. The indictment listed charges against executives stemming back to 1992 and focuses on the company’s sports betting operations, which it says violate a federal wire act that prohibits making sports bets across state lines. That gave some companies that have only casino games hope they could be left alone.On Tuesday, some online gambling executives challenged the idea that their business would be affected. Others conceded they were consulting with lawyers and not planning any trips to the United States. None, though, wanted to speak on the record for fear of drawing the attention and ire of the authorities in the United States.“This has nothing to do with us whatsoever,” insisted an executive from one of the largest online gambling sites listed in London when asked about the BetOnSports situation. Still, the company would not comment on the issue, he said.Online betting has grown to an industry that generates $12 billion profit a year, a figure that is expected to double by 2010.In addition to attracting customers from the United States and Europe, companies are turning to Asia for growth.Some forms of online gambling are illegal in countries outside the United States. Playing online casino games for money is illegal in Australia, for example. But the United States has been the most aggressive about prosecuting the operators.It is illegal to operate an online gambling site in the United States, but many lawyers say that the legality of a Web site that is based elsewhere, but attracts American customers, is up for interpretation. An American bookie, Jay Cohen, who ran a gambling Web site out of Antigua, served jail time after being convicted in 2000 of violating the wire act.The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s actions come as sentiment against United States prosecutors is running high in Britain’s business circles.It follows the extradition last week of three British bankers to a Houston court to face Enron-related charges; their extradition prompted protests in Britain. Now, the concern is that the same controversial extradition treaty could be used to force British online gambling executives to stand trial in the United States.'"

A Yukos spokeswoman, Claire Davidson, said the company was considering an appeal to a higher court.

"'06-07-19,'1','Martin Gallent, a former vice chairman of the New York City Planning Commission who regularly fought to preserve open space in urban settings, drowned Sunday while swimming in a lake in Westchester County. He was 75 and lived in Jackson Heights, Queens.The death was announced by his daughter Judith Gallent of Manhattan.Mr. Gallent was on the planning commission from 1969 to 1985 — during the Lindsay, Beame and Koch administrations — and was its vice chairman for 11 of those years. In December 1985, Mayor Edward I. Koch chose not to reappoint him, and critics said that was because of his frequent dissents on decisions to allow major construction projects in Manhattan. The commission has the power to reject projects, but can be overridden by the City Council.Mr. Gallent wrote 54 dissents while on the commission, many criticizing high-density developments as detrimental to light, fresh air and open space. He objected to several major Manhattan projects that qualified for bonuses allowing for taller, bulkier buildings than the zoning rules would normally permit.Mr. Gallent nonetheless took a balanced approach to urban planning, in the opinion of John E. Zucotti, who was chairman of the planning commission under Mayor John V. Lindsay.“I was able to reason with him to produce effective decisions,’’ Mr. Zucotti said. “He was a responsible community activist, concerned about urban design implications. My view of his dissents was that they were usually well-founded.”'"
"'06-07-19,'1','None of this is cause for alarm, Mr. White said. “A little bit of the frenzy and froth has burned off, and that’s probably a good thing, but nobody I’ve talked to is fearful that we’re heading to a down cycle,’’ he said. “The market is calming down as opposed to slowing down.’’He said that as buyers who relied on borrowed capital withdrew from the market, they were being replaced in part by pension funds and other institutional investors like endowment funds, which have increased their real estate holdings in recent years.The total number of transactions of apartment, retail and office buildings valued at $1 million or more decreased by 5 percent for the first five months of the year, compared with the same period last year, said Hessam Nadji, managing director of research services for Marcus & Millichap, an investment brokerage company based in Encino, Calif. The decline was driven by second- and third-rate properties, he said. Sales in those categories were down by 10 percent, while sales of top-grade properties in the same three sectors rose by 7 percent, he said.“There’s more discretion and more caution regarding product quality,’’ he said. “We’re trying to educate our seller clients that you have to be realistic about price expectation. It’s a different market.’’Mr. Nadji said the decline in sales volume was more pronounced for the apartment and retail sectors.Alan L. Pontius, director of national office and industrial sales for Marcus & Millichap, said sale prices were also dropping in some markets like Denver and South Florida. In Denver, for example, an office building recently sold for $5.8 million, about $300,000 less than the price it would have brought six months ago.Jeffrey A. Barclay, a managing director at ING Clarion, said that with rising interest rates, capitalization rates — the initial return that investors are willing to accept when they buy a building — were no longer falling. “The effects of interest rates going up are finally beginning to be felt,’’ he said. “There is a flight to quality, as there is in most markets when interest rates rise.’’ (ING Clarion, which is based in the Netherlands, was a partner in the development of the New York Times Company headquarters building on Eighth Avenue, but its interest was recently acquired by another partner, Forest City Ratner.)In recent years, lower-grade office buildings in a number of cities were bought by developers who paid a premium to transform them into residential condominiums, said Craig Thomas, the director of research for Torto Wheaton. But just as apartment building conversions have slowed to a trickle, so, too, have office building conversions. “Now you have to price these buildings at what you can generate from office occupiers,’’ Mr. Thomas said.As condominium development slows, office development is slowly starting to pick up, even in metropolitan areas like Atlanta, where the vacancy rate is 14.4 percent, according to CoStar Group. Nationwide, about 111.9 million square feet of space is under construction, up by 32 million square feet since the same quarter two years ago but still far below the 205.1 million square feet that were being developed in the fourth quarter of 2000, the research group said.Steve Sakwa, a senior real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch, said that a swelling development pipeline could harm the office market recovery. “Will it kill the market? No, but it may take away from landlords the ability to continue to push up rents or fill their buildings,’’ he said. “We would prefer to see less supply.”Bret R. Wilkerson, the chief executive of Property and Portfolio Research, a Boston research company that advises institutional investors, said the actual amount of construction under way, except in Washington, was relatively modest and construction costs remained high. But he said there had been an upsurge in projects in the planning stages.“What’s going on today is not yet a worry, but a couple of years down the road it could be a huge worry,’’ he said. “Overbuilding is one of those triggers that causes an ugly real estate market.’’In the Washington metropolitan area, which has had one of the strongest office markets in the country in recent years, 134 buildings, with about 16.5 million square feet, are currently under construction, more by far than any place else, according to CoStar. “People are getting ahead of themselves,’’ Mr. Sakwa said.The Lincoln Property Company of Dallas, for example, is redeveloping an office building owned by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Building Investment Trust at 15th and L Streets in downtown Washington, giving it a new glass facade and expanding it from 175,000 square feet to 325,000 square feet. But John Benziger, a senior vice president at Lincoln, said that of the 4 million square feet under development in Washington, about 40 percent had already been leased.But new space that is coming on the market is already having an impact in Washington. The city’s office vacancy rate at the end of the second quarter was 7.1 percent, up from 6.8 percent in the first quarter, according to Cassidy & Pinkard Colliers, a Washington-area brokerage firm.“In downtown Washington, we’re going to have a little bit of oversupply of product in the near term, in the next 18 months,’’ said William M. Collins, a managing director at Cassidy. “That’s going to push vacancies up.’’ But he said the market would eventually tighten because nearly all of the development sites would be used up.'"
"'06-07-19,'1','NEW hybrids of pineapple have catapulted what was once a symbol of luxury and exoticism into one of the most reliable and common fruits. The pineapple has become more like an orange than a peach: the quality varies, but there are no losers, only decent ones and better ones.That grilling season and pineapple season coincide is great, because like many fruits, pineapple takes well to the grill. Grilled pineapple can be eaten straight, for dessert, but it is best as the basis for fresh salsa. This can be served with anything grilled, especially fish or shellfish, chicken or pork.You can turn the grilled fruit into salsa in any number of ways, all of which involve adding a little liquid (something acidic is best, to counter the pineapple’s sweetness); something from the onion family, for sharp crunch; and a spice or herb.Before grilling I sprinkle pineapple with sugar, salt and chili; this is a dip used for much fresh fruit in parts of Latin America and Asia. The tiny amount of sugar doesn’t add much sweetness, but it does help the fruit brown. Salt and chili are essential, I believe, when using pineapple in a savory dish.For many people the most difficult part of cooking pineapple is dismembering it, but there are several straightforward techniques. I don’t recommend buying mechanically cored, peeled pineapple, because it loses too much of its juice in the process.My favorite technique takes maybe three minutes. Use a chef’s knife to cut off the top and bottom. Standing the fruit on its broad end, slice straight down to cut it in half, then into quarters. Cut off the woody core portion that forms the peak of the triangle of each quarter, and then use a grapefruit or paring knife to separate the flesh from the skin. Now you have four pieces of pure, edible fruit, ready for the grill.'"

"'06-07-19,'1','Catching W. off-guard, the really weird thing is his sense of victimization. He’s strangely resentful about the actual core of his job. Even after the debacles of Iraq and Katrina, he continues to treat the presidency as a colossal interference with his desire to mountain bike and clear brush.In snippets of overheard conversation, Mr. Bush says he has not bothered to prepare any closing remarks and grouses about having to listen to other world leaders talk too long. What did he think being president was about?The world may be blowing up, and the president may have a rare opportunity to jaw-jaw about bang-bang with his peers, but that pales in comparison with his burning desire to return to his feather pillow and gym back at the White House.“Gotta go home,’’ he tells the guy next to him. “Got something to do tonight. Go to the airport, get on the airplane and go home.” A White House spokesman said Mr. Bush had nothing on his schedule after he returned to Washington on Monday about 4 p.m.When he began meandering about how big Russia was, you expected him to yell, “Yo, Condi!’’ and ask his secretary of state: “Hey, what’s the name of that other big country that has more people than any other country in the world? It begins with a ‘C.’ Dad spent some time there.’’Perhaps it’s that anti-patrician chip on his shoulder, his rebellion against a family that prized manners and diplomacy above all. But when bored or frustrated, W. reserves the right to be boorish — no matter if the setting is a gilded palace or a Texas gorge.He treated Tony “As It Were” Blair like the servant in “The Remains of the Day,’’ blowing off his offer to help with the Israel-Lebanon crisis, and changing the subject from substance to fluff at one point, noting about his 60th-birthday Burberry gift: “Thanks for the sweater. Awfully thoughtful of you.’’ Then he razzed the British prime minister, who was hovering and wheedling like an abused wife: “I know you picked it out yourself.”After doing his best to undermine the U.N. and Kofi Annan, W. talked about the secretary general like a fraternity pledge he wanted to send out for more beer or a keg of Diet Coke: “I felt like telling Kofi to get on the phone with Assad and make something happen.’’His loosey-goosey confidence that everything could be fixed with a phone call — and not even a phone call made by him, and not even a phone call made to the Iranians, who have more control over Hezbollah — was striking. He seems to have no clue that his own headlong, heedless actions in the Middle East have contributed to the deepening chaos there, and to Iran’s growing influence and America’s diminished leverage.Mr. Bush may resent the sophistication required of a president. But when the world is going to hell, he should stop chewing and start thinking.'"

"'06-07-20,'0','According to the criminal and civil complaints, which were filed in federal district court in San Jose, Calif., Mr. Reyes routinely backdated documents in order to provide new employees with a larger compensation package. Brocade, which makes data storage networking products, is based in San Jose. It has previously restated its financial reports for 1999 through 2004.The criminal complaint does not say that any of the three company officials obtained direct financial gain from the suspected backdating scheme. Kevin V. Ryan, the United States attorney for Northern California, said that the government was not obligated to prove personal financial gain in this case.Instead, the Justice Department lawyers are building a case that suggests the intent was to beat the competition for highly qualified employees. The company used stock options to lure people to the company and retain them when rivals tried to hire them away, the department claims.The S.E.C.’s complaint does allege that Mr. Reyes was motivated by personal gain and did himself receive backdated options. “He was thus motivated to continue the scheme, in part, to enrich himself and his fellow officer,” the S.E.C. complaint says. Although Brocade’s board approved those grants, the government did not name the board as a defendant.The S.E.C. alleges that from 2000 to 2004, Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen falsified company records, including minutes of directors’ meetings, and offers of employment, and understated Brocade’s expenses and overstated its income. Ms. Jensen reported directly to Mr. Reyes. The S.E.C. alleges that Mr. Reyes backdated options grants on at least nine occasions in 2001 and 2002 and on six occasions in 2003 and 2004.Mr. Reyes was given sole authority to grant stock options by Brocade’s board, in essence making Mr. Reyes the company’s compensation committee, the government alleges. It says that Mr. Reyes and Hansen often waited until the end of a fiscal quarter before granting options at the lowest price for that quarter.The government alleges that Ms. Jensen’ staff routinely printed out the historical closing prices for Brocade’s stock and highlighted the low dates. The S.E.C. complaint says that the practice became so routine that by June 2003, “an H.R. employee prepared a memorandum describing the practice.”The S.E.C. claims that Mr. Canova learned of the backdating in April 2001 and was warned that options paperwork had been forged, but that he took no action and failed to advise the company’s auditors and its board.Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen will be issued summons to appear in court on Aug. 2, the United States attorney said.'"

"'06-07-20,'0','The political implications were clear from the roster of people questioned in the inquiry, including Mayor Richard M. Daley, who was Cook County’s top prosecutor when some of the most egregious complaints were lodged, and his former assistant, Richard A. Devine, now the Cook County state’s attorney.Mr. Boyle rebuked a former Chicago police superintendent, Richard J. Brzeczek, saying he “did not just do his job poorly; he just didn’t do his job.” But he had only mild criticism for Mr. Daley, who as prosecutor received a letter alleging serious abuse in 1982 but delegated its investigation. “We accept his explanation, but would not do it the same way he did,” Mr. Boyle said of Mr. Daley.A few prisoners had cattle prods placed against their genitals, guns shoved into their mouths or plastic typewriter covers held over their heads until they passed out, Mr. Boyle said, adding that most were abused with milder weapons like “the fist, the feet, telephone books.”Prisoners who have alleged torture and their lawyers said they were profoundly disappointed with the report and that Mr. Daley and Mr. Devine should face federal indictment along with former Commander Jon Burge, whom they accuse of overseeing torture, and some officers under his command at what are known as Detective Areas 2 and 3. They cited at least recent 20 instances of court testimony by police officers, prosecutors and other officials that they said constituted continuing criminal behavior that would justify charges of obstruction of justice, perjury, racketeering and civil rights violations.“Somebody needs to go to jail,” said one of the lawyers, Lawrence Kennon. “Burge needs to go to jail. His henchmen need to go to jail. The mayor should be indicted for covering up.”The report, along with 1,452 additional pages on the remainder of the 148 cases, is likely to become fodder for five civil cases alleging abuse pending in federal court, as well as more than two dozen instances in which prisoners are challenging their convictions based on accusations of mistreatment by the police.Mr. Boyle, whose investigation was ordered by a judge in 2002, said a copy had also been requested by the United States attorney’s office, which has previously declined to pursue the case.A spokeswoman for Mr. Daley said the mayor was in San Francisco and would not comment on the report until later this week, if at all. The city’s corporation counsel praised the special prosecutors’ “hard work” but said she had not yet thoroughly reviewed the lengthy report.Mr. Burge, who joined the police force months after returning from the Vietnam War in 1970, and rose to the rank of commander before being fired in 1993, did not respond to a telephone message left at his home in Florida. He has previously denied wrongdoing.Mr. Brzeczek, who ran against Mr. Daley for state’s attorney in 1984 and is a lawyer in private practice, denounced the report as “a big political cover-up,” and questioned why it focused on his brief tenure as police chief when abuse accusations stretched for many years before and after.“I think it’s the work of two political appointees who had to fix the blame on someone who’s not connected to Daley — that’s me,” Mr. Brzeczek said in a telephone interview.Asked whether he would read the report, he added, “I have some back issues of The National Enquirer that I’m going to read first.”In a written statement, Mr. Devine, the prosecutor, said that when he was Mr. Daley’s assistant, “claims of systemic abuse at Area 2 had not yet crystallized,” and that in terms of the critical complaint that came to his attention, “I had no reason to believe that the claims were not handled appropriately.”Both he and Philip J. Cline, the current Chicago police superintendent, pointed to changes in policies, including videotaping of interrogations and the computerization of abuse complaints, that they said would prevent such a pattern from occurring again.The special prosecutors enlisted eight lawyers and several former F.B.I. agents for the investigation, which included 217 subpoenas and produced 33,360 documents.But the report offers no recommendations and little synthesis of the accusations of systemic abuse under Mr. Burge’s command. Instead, it recounts a handful of cases, giving both the details of the underlying crimes and conflicting testimony through years of criminal and civil actions.In each case, the prosecutors say whether an indictment could have been sustained against certain officers, though the conclusions are rendered moot by the overall decision that no prosecution is permissible.David Bates, who said he was tortured four times over two days of interrogation in 1983, called it a “half-baked report” that is “hard on my family.”“Torture did exist,’’ Mr. Bates said Wednesday. “There were several sessions of torture, starting with slaps and kicks and name-calling. What happened to me happened to so many other individuals.”“They never gave me water, they never gave me food,” he added. “They only gave me pain.”'"
"'06-07-20,'0','SEATTLE, July 19 — The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation awarded more than a quarter of a billion dollars on Wednesday to researchers in 19 countries to speed the lagging development of an H.I.V. vaccine.The grants, totaling $287 million, are the largest private investment in making such a vaccine, the foundation said. They represent a significant shift in emphasis, to large-scale collaborative projects instead of small teams of researchers working independently.The money will be given over five years to 16 scientific teams, including two New York groups. The scientists applied for the grants before Warren E. Buffett announced last month that he was giving $31 billion to the Gates Foundation.The Gates Foundation has made development of an effective vaccine against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, a major goal, and the new grants bring to $528 million the foundation’s investment for this purpose. By contrast, the National Institutes of Health has spent $3.4 billion since the 1980’s to develop a vaccine.A vaccine to fight H.I.V., the human immunodeficiency virus, is the best hope to control the AIDS epidemic, health officials and experts say. But that hope has been frustrated again and again.'"
"'06-07-20,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, July 19 — Confounding Wall Street skeptics, Apple Computer released quarterly financial results Wednesday that showed strong growth in both its iPod music player and its MacBook portable computer businesses.Some analysts speculated in recent weeks that the extraordinary growth in its portable digital music business might be coming to a close. The company reported that it sold 8.1 million iPod players, however, an increase of 32 percent over the comparable quarter a year ago.And the company cited a recent report from the market research company NPD that said Apple still held a 75 percent share of the digital music player market.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said net income increased 48 percent, to $472 million, or 54 cents a share, from $320 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier. Revenue for the period, the third quarter of its fiscal year, climbed 24 percent, to $4.37 billion, from $3.52 billion a year earlier. Thompson Financial reported that analysts had expected earnings of 44 cents a share.“We are thrilled to have reported the second-highest quarterly sales and earnings in Apple’s history,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer. The company’s strongest quarter ever was its holiday quarter last year — the first quarter of its 2006 fiscal year— when it announced record profit and revenue.'"
"'06-07-20,'0','The share sales happen according to a formula, the company’s filings said. Before the split of Viacom and CBS, National Amusements sold $640 million in shares in the company in 2004 and the first nine months of 2005 under a similar arrangement.The newly separated Viacom has been aggressively buying back shares. But the stock price has continued to decline. In February, National Amusements sold $59 million of Class B shares priced around $42.25 a share, and has continued to sell each month. The latest sale, on July 10, generated $26.2 million at a price around $36.62 a share. Viacom B shares closed yesterday at $34.25.The shares sold this year represent about 11 percent of the roughly 40 million Class B shares Mr. Redstone controlled in Viacom at the beginning of the year, keeping his stake at 6 percent of the Class B shares outstanding. National Amusements also owns about 47 million Class A multiple-voting shares through which Mr. Redstone controls 71 percent of the company’s votes.Over all, the share sales so far involve a small but significant portion of Mr. Redstone’s holdings in Viacom. But they are notable because Mr. Redstone, who is 84, has been a reluctant seller of shares and an ebullient champion of Viacom’s prospects. He has long complained that its shares are undervalued by the stock market. That, in fact, was the major reason Viacom and CBS underwent their corporate split. Viacom was pitched as the higher-growth stock of the two companies, with CBS paying higher dividends.But the split has not yet had its desired effect. Viacom shares have fallen about 24 percent from their high this year while CBS has moved mainly sideways. And National has not been selling its shares in CBS, in part because that company has not been buying back its stock.Share buybacks are currently in vogue across corporate America, and media companies have been no exception. Time Warner, the News Corporation and the Tribune Company have carried out repurchase programs as part of broader attempts to ignite their share prices. The rationale is that buying your own company’s stock at low prices is a good investment, and shrinking the shareholder base instantly increases earnings per share.But Mr. Redstone has been in an unusual position because of National Amusements’ large stake in Viacom. While he has been obliged to sell shares at prices he may consider too low, as Viacom’s chairman he endorses the buyback plan.“Sumner has always had his money on the line in this thing and he still has an enormous amount of money in it,” said Lawrence J. Haverty Jr., a portfolio manager specializing in media stocks at Gabelli Asset Management.Of the share sales, he said, “It’s either intelligent estate planning or proper respect for the market’s need for liquidity.”National Amusements is a private company that owns a chain of movie theaters in addition to its controlling stakes in Viacom and CBS. Mr. Redstone declined to say what the company had done with the more than $820 million it had made so far from the share sales.'"

"'06-07-20,'0','But Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said he felt confident that the company’s aggressive rollout of new products, coupled with belt-tightening announced in April, would put the company back on track.“We have a tight handle on spending and are making good progress,” Mr. Otellini said in a conference call with analysts after the earnings announcement.In April, Intel announced a sweeping restructuring aimed at improving efficiency and trimming costs, and at speeding the completion of critical projects like its new chip architecture, known as Core. Intel plans to release its first mainstream desktop PC chip based on the new architecture next week, slightly sooner than expected.The earnings report, issued after the close of the market, pushed shares of Intel down slightly in after-hours trading. They had ended regular trading up 28 cents, at $18.49.The bright spot of the quarter for Intel was its gross profit margin of 52.1 percent, better than its April forecast of 49 percent but still down sharply from last year. The company attributed the strength in the second quarter to lower-than-expected production costs. But the executives warned that gross margin would decline again, to 49 percent this quarter, because of lower prices and costs associated with ramping up production of new products.One surprise from Intel was its inventory levels, which have taken a heavy toll on its profit margin in the past. In the second quarter, inventories swelled to $4.3 billion, an increase of about 20 percent over last year, causing some concern among analysts.But Mr. Otellini defended the inventory levels, contending that Intel needed to build inventory so it could avoid the trouble it has had in the past with meeting customer demand. “I’m very comfortable with the current build plan and factory loading,” he said.Apjit Walia, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said that while the inventory level came as a surprise, it indicated a certain optimism on Intel’s part. “Over all, the fact they’re building inventories means Intel executives are thinking sales will be strong in the second half,” Mr. Walia said.In April, Mr. Otellini vowed to cut $1 billion in expenses, and last week the company announced it would start by cutting 1,000 management positions. Intel said in June that it was selling its communications chip business to Marvell Communications, and some analysts have speculated that Intel may also sell its memory chip business.“The restructuring story is just starting,” Mr. Walia said. Like many analysts, he expects Intel to announce many more layoffs in the second half of the year.On Thursday, A.M.D. is expected to announce that its sales in the second quarter declined 9 percent from last year, providing further evidence that the price war between the two companies is taking its toll.'"
"'06-07-20,'0','Stopping the practices will allow people in uniform to “focus on the hard job that we’ve asked them to do,” said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York and the lead sponsor of the bill with Mr. Enzi.Like the House bill, the Senate version would give state regulators clear jurisdiction over insurance sales on military bases within their borders and would require the Defense Department to report people who violate military sales rules to those licensing agencies. It would also establish a central registry for tracking the agents base to base.Both measures abolish an archaic form of mutual fund, known as contractual plans, with sales charges that consume half of an investor’s first-year contributions. Contractual plans have virtually disappeared from the civilian market, but they continued to be promoted heavily to military personnel until about 18 months ago.The largest seller, First Command Financial Services of Fort Worth, dropped the product in December 2004. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, First Command paid $12 million to settle lawsuits in which federal securities regulators accused it of deceptive sales practices.This month, the Pentagon published final versions of rules that it developed for the sale of insurance and other financial products on military bases, encompassing many of the provisions in the current legislation.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who was among the bill’s co-sponsors, said he applauded the military’s efforts to strengthen its rules. “But vigilance always fades,” he said, “and that’s why we need legislation.”The Senate bill does not include House provisions that would bar military lenders from using threats, appeals to a commanding officer or involuntary garnishing of a service member’s pay. But Senator Clinton said she did not think that those differences were “deal breakers.”The matter of abusive military lending is more likely to be addressed, she said, in negotiations over the House and Senate versions of Defense Department authorization bills. The Senate version, unlike the House bill, would limit the interest rate on loans to service members to 36 percent — effectively ending military access to “payday loans,” which are very short-term loans with finance charges that can run up triple-digit annual interest rates.But the Senate measure would not eliminate military demand for payday loans, said Dennis Bassford, chief executive of Moneytree in Seattle, and a board member of the Community Financial Services Association, an industry group. It would simply drive that demand to Internet lenders, “where the price will be double and there’s no way to effectively regulate it.”A wild card that could affect the outcome of the Congressional negotiations is a new Pentagon report on payday lending, expected to be released as early as this week. If the study shows the need for action, as many consumer advocates expect, it could bolster the Senate’s position, said Kimberly Warden, a vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer group.The best outcome would be to adopt both the Senate bill approved yesterday and the payday lending provision, said Fred Becker, president of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. “Taken together,” he said, “they represent a monumental step forward in protecting our men and women in uniform from predatory lenders and unscrupulous salespeople.”'"

"'06-07-20,'0','A closely watched barometer of inflation grew at a strong pace in June but shed little light on whether the Federal Reserve would increase interest rates again next month.While the Labor Department reported yesterday that core consumer prices had the largest sustained rise since 1995, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, sounded a less-than-hawkish tone on inflation in testimony on Capitol Hill. Without a more declarative position from Mr. Bernanke, economists were left to speculate whether the Fed may pause when it meets next month or approve its 18th consecutive increase in interest rates.The Labor Department reported that the core Consumer Price Index, which does not include food and energy prices, rose by 0.3 percent in June, its fourth consecutive increase. That was a larger increase than economists expected, and represented the longest period of high inflation in the core rate since the first four months of 1995.The consensus estimate, according to a survey by Bloomberg News, was for a 0.2 percent rise in June.The core index was 2.6 percent higher last month than in June 2005, which was the biggest year-to-year jump since early 2002.Over all, consumer prices rose 0.2 last month, a more moderate pace than the 0.4 percent rise reported in May. A retreat in energy prices in June helped hold down the number. Energy prices declined 0.9 percent last month, the first time since February they dropped.'"

"'06-07-21,'0','HOYLAKE, England, July 21 — Tiger Woods surged into the lead of the British Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, firing a seven-under-par 65 today to hold a one-shot cushion over Ernie Els midway through the second round.Chris DiMarco stood three shots behind Woods on a warm day on the Wirral Peninsula.Woods holed out for an eagle, his second in as many days, with a 4-iron from the middle of the 14th fairway that bounced three times before smacking the flagstick and disappearing into the hole for a 2.Woods turned to his caddie, Steve Williams, and said, “It went in!” before the two exchanged a high-five.“I was just trying to land the ball on the front edge and let it chase on there and get my 4 and go on,” said Woods, who stood at 12-under-par 132. “It happened to go in.”After missing the cut at the United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club last month, Woods’s 65 equaled the lowest British Open round ever shot at Royal Liverpool.Only minutes before Woods finished his round, DiMarco also carded a 65 on the strength of eight birdies against just one bogey. Els stood at 11-under-par.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','A tunnel that links downtown Boston with Logan International Airport was reopened to bus traffic today, after being shut down by Governor Mitt Romney for emergency repairs to bolts that hold up concrete ceiling panels in the tunnel.The governor ordered the closure of the eastbound lanes of the Ted Williams Tunnel on Thursday after two bolts holding a panel in place were found to have slipped an inch and a half inch from their foundation. Similar panels fell last week in a nearby highway tunnel, killing a woman who was riding in a car.Engineers and construction crews worked through the night to secure the panels, which are part of the air handling system for the tunnel. It was re-opened about 7 a.m. Eastern time.The tunnel is part of the $14.6 billion Big Dig project, which was intended to ease traffic congestion in Boston by eliminating the old elevated Central Artery and putting major highways underground. Mr. Romney ordered all the tunnels in the project inspected after the accident last week.Although the panels in the Ted Williams Tunnel are lighter than the ones that fell in the Interstate 90 connector tunnel, Mr. Romney said the slippage of the threaded bolds, encased in epoxy fastener, posed “a very substantial threat to public safety .” He overruled engineers for the state’s Turnpike Authority, who had decided that the slipped bolts were not an immediate concern.The Big Dig project has been plagued by cost overruns, delays, leaks and other problems linked to its construction. Authorities have begun an investigation to determine whether the woman’s death should lead to criminal charges.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','They pulse, some artists on the outside say, with memory and longing and madness. Others are less impressed, saying the works are interesting examples of human ingenuity but fall short of real artistic achievement.Mr. Johnson, 46, has something of the middle-aged biker about him, with long slicked-back hair, unfortunate tattoos, a growing paunch and an unruly beard that puts one in mind of ZZ Top or a garden gnome.He was in a changeable mood on Saturday, eager to hear about the opening but also aware that it was, in the scheme of his life and future, a small thing. He spoke with easygoing and sometimes lighthearted candor, punctuated with wariness and flashes of despair. He declined to discuss the details of his crimes, though he admitted to a past attraction to drugs and violence.When the conversation turned to his paintings, though, he held his own in the art-speak department. “I love myth and chaos and space,” he said.Mr. Johnson was 20 when he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 1980, drawing a sentence of 15 years to life. According to court papers, he and two friends had stabbed an acquaintance to death after a party in San Jose, in a dispute over the sale of cigarettes laced with PCP.Nine years later Mr. Johnson was charged with the nearly fatal stabbing of one guard and with assaulting another. That case went to trial, with Mr. Johnson saying he had been startled and, thinking he was under attack by a gang member, had acted in what he thought was self-defense. He was convicted and sentenced to two additional terms of nine years to life. His chances of ever being paroled, he said, are small.The prison here is an expanse of grim concrete bunkers, spread out over 275 acres not far from the California coast and the Oregon border. It is as sterile and monochrome as Mr. Johnson’s paintings are bursting out with color.About 3,300 of the state’s most dangerous prisoners are held at Pelican Bay, which is among the toughest prisons in the nation. But even here there are varying levels of security. The problem prisoners, including Mr. Johnson, are held in the Security Housing Unit, which everyone calls the SHU (pronounced like “shoe”).He lives in an 8-by-12-foot concrete cell. His meals are pushed through a slot in the door. Except for the odd visitor, with whom he talks through thick plexiglass, he interacts with no one. He has not touched another person in 17 years.Asked about his circumstances growing up, Mr. Johnson assessed his current state instead. “I am of the dungeon class,” he said.In “Donny: Life of a Lifer,” a short book he wrote in 2001, Mr. Johnson said the lack of sensory stimulation and human contact in the SHU was a form of torture. “I’d cut off my right arm,” he wrote, “to be able to hold my mother.”His art, he said on Saturday, is a solace, an obsession and a burden.He orders his supplies from the prison commissary once a month. The M&M’s are 60 cents a pack, and he gets 10 packs at a time. He puts from one to five of the candies in each of the jelly containers, drizzles a little water in and later fishes out the chocolate cores, leaving liquid of various colors, which get stronger if they sit for a couple of days.He has tried other candy, but there are perils. “It’s the same process with Skittles,” he said, “but I end up eating them all.”Sometimes he experiments with other materials. “Grape Kool-Aid in red M&M color makes a kind of purple,” he wrote in a letter to a reporter not long ago. “Coffee mixed with yellow makes a light brown. Tropical punch Kool-Aid granules can be made into a syrup and used as a paint wash of sorts. But it’s a bear to work with and it’s super-sticky and it never dries.”And there are frustrations. “If lint gets in a piece, I feel like screaming,” he wrote.While prison officials will not allow Mr. Johnson to have conventional art supplies or much of anything else in the SHU, they have not interfered with his work or stopped him from mailing his paintings to his family and friends. The prison will not let him keep the proceeds from his sales, Mr. Johnson said, and he intends to donate the money to the Pelican Bay Prison Project, a nonprofit group that will use it to help the children of prisoners.On the outside, the paintings have drawn admiration and even awe.“It has the vibration of color you find in van Gogh’s work,” said Mr. Caballero, the Mexican gallery owner. “Sometimes it looks like Motherwell. Sometimes it looks like de Kooning. And there is also something of Munch.”Stephen A. Kurtz, a semiretired psychoanalyst who has worked with prisoners and helped arrange the show in Mexico, said he generally had no use for their art.“The prison art I’ve seen is very stereotypical: women with breasts out to the next block and beefy guys with them,” Mr. Kurtz said.Mr. Johnson’s work, he said, is a different matter. “It reminds me,” he said, “of Pollock in the early-to-mid-1940’s, when he was in Jungian analysis.”Mr. Johnson’s circumstances and materials may influence viewers’ perceptions, and not everyone is convinced that he is the real thing.“I’m not really responding to it aesthetically,” said Brooke Anderson, director and curator of the Contemporary Center at the American Folk Art Museum, “but I’m totally responding from its place of origin. It kind of reminds me of spin art. It feels very psychedelic, like the 1970’s hippie culture.”Mr. Johnson is working in a rich tradition of art produced in prisons and asylums, Ms. Anderson continued.“Time and the availability of time,” she said, “has an awful lot to do with an explosion of expression.”'"

"'06-07-21,'0','“I think we’re going to see a quick succession of cases,” said Scott S. Balber, a lawyer with Chadbourne & Parke who would not say whether any of his corporate clients had been contacted by regulators regarding the backdating of options.So far, federal prosecutors in San Francisco, Manhattan and Brooklyn have opened more than 33 cases looking at potential accounting problems or fraud; the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining at least 80 companies. More than a dozen senior executives have been dismissed. Nearly every company has been reviewing its practices.“This case will not be the last,’’ said Linda Chatman Thomsen, the director of the S.E.C. enforcement division.An option gives the holder the right to buy shares of stock at a predetermined price in the future, commonly the market price on the date they were granted. Instead of offering higher salaries, companies sometimes prefer to lure potential hires with stock options, conserving company cash.According to the criminal and civil complaints filed Thursday in Federal District Court in San Jose, Calif., Mr. Reyes routinely backdated documents to provide new employees with a larger compensation package. Brocade, a maker of data storage networking products, is based in San Jose.The Department of Justice criminal complaint does not contend that any of the three company officials directly made financial gains from the backdating. But Kevin V. Ryan, the United States attorney for Northern California, said the government was not obligated to prove personal financial gain in this case.Instead, prosecutors are building a case that suggests that the intent was to hire highly qualified employees that other companies had wanted.The S.E.C.’s civil complaint does contend that Mr. Reyes was motivated by personal gain and did receive backdated options himself. “He was thus motivated to continue the scheme, in part, to enrich himself and his fellow officers,” the S.E.C. complaint says.Although Brocade’s board approved those grants, the government did not name any directors as defendants. Ms. Thomsen and Mr. Ryan did not rule out the possibility that others at Brocade might be charged. Mr. Ryan also declined to discuss whether any employees or former employees had been granted immunity to testify or help the government build its criminal case.At a news conference in San Francisco, Christopher Cox, the chairman of the S.E.C., called the backdating practice “poisonous” and said “the S.E.C. is committed to bringing it to an end nationwide.”The criminal charge carries a penalty of as much as 20 years in prison and a fine of $5 million.Lawyers for Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen denied the charges. “Financial gain is always the motive in securities fraud cases, and here there was none,’’ Mr. Reyes’s lawyer, Richard Marmaro, said in a statement. A call to Mr. Canova’s lawyer was not returned.Options are a powerful incentive for executives to try to get the stock price higher so that the option becomes “in the money,’’ meaning the shares can be bought at a price below the current market price.Handing out in-the-money options is not illegal as long as the grants are disclosed to shareholders. At the time in question in this case, in-the-money options had to be counted as an expense on the company’s books. (New rules now require companies to deduct options as an expense.) Failure to disclose or to deduct in-the-money options from income could lead to securities fraud charges. And because such options do not qualify for tax breaks once they are exercised, such grants raise tax fraud issues, too.Yet what remains unclear is where regulators and prosecutors will draw the line when it comes to backdating. Brocade’s case may be different because it involves allegations of doctoring documents.But other companies will argue that the rules establishing a stock option’s grant date were not always clear, or at least open to interpretation. For a period during the 1990’s, for example, several companies including Microsoft granted stock options for rank-and-file employees at monthly lows, often with the blessing of auditors.Other companies may suggest the backdated options were caused by legitimate paperwork delays; there was sloppiness but no criminal wrongdoing. And even among top S.E.C. regulators, there is a significant debate brewing over another common but disturbing options practice: at what point does the opportunistic granting of stock options at attractive prices ahead of good news become illegal?Defense lawyers are struggling to get a sense how far investigators will pursue cases and where the line should be drawn between aggressive grant practices and fraud.Brocade “is a good case to start with because it involves allegations of falsified documents,’’ said Kenneth A. Raskin, head of the global executive compensation, benefits and employment law practice at White & Case. “Other cases are not going to be as black and white.""The Brocade case illustrates how one company granted stock options in a frenzied Silicon Valley culture.Technology start-ups were sprouting throughout the Bay Area and beyond and desperately needed to fill jobs. Stock prices often swung wildly from day to day. And instead of offering higher salaries, companies preferred to offer stock options.At the same time, few outsiders scrutinized the practice. Accounting and law firms sought to please their clients; misinformation, intentional or not, was abundant.Indeed, backdating stock options was so common among Silicon Valley firms, several West Coast lawyers and compensation experts said, that it was viewed at the time as the equivalent of running a stop sign in the desert. Executives were often willing to push the boundaries or in some cases simply ignore the rules.“It was a high-risk, high-reward time,” said Tom G. LaWer, a partner at Greenberg Traurig’s Silicon Valley practice. “You had people who were entrepreneurs. They often started with small companies where every day is a bet-your-company decision. In this case, a lot of them concluded the risk was small and the reward was great.”From 2000 to 2004, Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen falsified company records, including minutes of directors’ meetings, and employment-offer letters and understated Brocade’s expenses and overstated its income, according to the S.E.C.Ms. Jensen reported directly to Mr. Reyes. The S.E.C. contends he backdated options grants on at least nine occasions in 2001 and 2002 and on six occasions in 2003 and 2004.Mr. Reyes was given sole authority to grant stock options by Brocade’s board, in essence, making him the company’s compensation committee, the government contends. Mr. Reyes and Ms. Jensen often waited until the end of a fiscal quarter before granting options at the lowest price for that quarter.In fact, the practice became so routine that by June 2003, “an HR employee prepared a memorandum describing the practice,” the S.E.C. complaint says.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','“We did really, really well in a quarter that is seasonally slow,” said Eric Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, in an interview. “Big companies as they get larger seem to slow down. We continue to innovate.”Google earned $721.1 million, or $2.33 a share in the quarter, compared with $342.8 million, or $1.19 a share, in the period a year ago. Excluding charges related to stock-based compensation and a gain from the sale of its shares in Baidu, the Chinese Internet company, Google earned $2.49 a share. Analysts had expected the company to earn $2.22 on that basis.Excluding the payments it makes to companies like AOL that carry its search advertising, Google’s revenue was $1.67 billion, up 88 percent. That is a bit higher than the $1.65 billion that analysts expected.In a conference call with investors, Mr. Schmidt said that one top company priority was to expand its advertising business. One aspect of this is to build services for graphical and video advertisements of interest to brand marketers, the strongest area of Yahoo’s business.It also wants to expand its advertising auction system into other media; in that system, advertisers bid to have ads displayed on Web pages. Within three months, Mr. Schmidt said, Google will integrate the radio advertising system from its acquisition of dMark Broadcasting into its main service. He did not say what this integration would entail.The company hopes to start selling advertisements on mobile phones, a service it offers in Japan.Google continued its breakneck expansion, adding 1,152 employees in the second quarter, leaving it with 7,942 employees on June 30.Sergey Brin, Google’s president for technology, said the rate of hiring had slowed. The employee base grew 20 percent in the first quarter but only 17 percent in the second quarter.“That gives us more time for people to get up to speed,” he said.Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Company, said that Google did seem to be able to manage the expansion. “They are on a hiring frenzy, yet their expenses seem to be under control,” he said.Mr. Rashtchy noted that spending on marketing was lower than he expected, given that Google had announced some high-profile deals, like an arrangement to install software on computers made by Dell Inc.Google spent $699 million on capital projects in the quarter, including $319 million on real estate. The rest went for computer servers and related technology, mainly to support its search service.George Reyes, the chief financial officer, said that capital expenses would probably increase over time. He assured investors that these investments were “prudently thought out” and the company was purchasing property, rather than leasing it, because it would save money in the long run.Google’s revenue from its own network of Web sites continued to grow faster than that from other sites for which it sells advertising.Revenue from sales on other sites — deducting the payments made to those sites — was $212 million, up 56 percent.The company said its business was especially strong in Europe but that it lagged in most of Asia.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','The judge also rejected a separate motion to dismiss by AT&T, which had argued that its relationship with the government made it immune from prosecution.Judge Walker noted that his ruling should not be interpreted as an indication that his review of classified material presented by the government confirmed the accusations in the suit.The government’s surveillance of telephone and Internet activity as part of its effort to track terrorists was disclosed in an article in The New York Times last December. In filing its lawsuit, the Electronic Frontier Foundation cited the testimony of a former AT&T technician who disclosed technical documents about the installation of monitoring equipment at an AT&T Internet switching center in San Francisco.“This cases arises against the backdrop of the accountability of the government as it pursues its surveillance program,” said Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a civil liberties group based in Washington. “This is a significant victory for the principle of government accountability.”Cindy Cohn, legal director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the lawsuit was one of about 35 filed in different states in response to disclosures about the surveillance program, which the Bush administration has acknowledged. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced legislation to consolidate those cases before a special court that had previously been established under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to deal with such issues.Separately, at the request of AT&T, Verizon and the government, a federal court in Chicago has begun to consider whether the cases should be consolidated or heard before separate federal courts.An AT&T spokesman, Walt Sharp, said the company was evaluating its options in light of the judge’s ruling. Mr. Sharp emphasized that the company was committed to protecting the privacy rights of its customers.In a separate lawsuit filed before a federal court in Detroit, the American Civil Liberties Union is suing the National Security Agency over the surveillance program.Lawyers for the Electronic Frontier Foundation said they assumed the government would appeal the ruling, and said the next phase of the case would deal with whether the judge would permit the discovery phase of the trial to continue during the appeal process.“Everyone expects the government to appeal, and that could take some time,” said Robert D. Fram, a partner at Heller Ehrman, the San Francisco firm representing the foundation in the case.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','“This isn’t the outside independent scrutiny” that is needed, said Brad MacGowan, a college counselor in Newton, Mass.But Chiara Coletti, a board spokeswoman, said, “No other firm could have done a more thorough, thoughtful and timely analysis.” She said the board trusted Booz Allen’s integrity.Other critics faulted the report for not explaining how the scoring problems had occurred in the first place.When the board announced the errors, it said some answer sheets had swelled because of moisture, throwing off the scanning machines used by its contractor, Pearson Educational Measurement. It has never explained the source of the moisture.“They don’t believe in disclosure,” said Senator Kenneth P. LaValle, a Long Island Republican who is chairman of the New York Senate’s Higher Education Committee, referring to the board. “They truly are a very secretive organization and they feel they don’t owe anyone any answers. I am more deeply committed than ever before that there needs to be more accountability.”Mr. LaValle, who sponsored truth-in-testing legislation in the 1970’s, said he would redouble his efforts to seek more oversight of the board and other testing organizations.Robert A. Schaeffer, public education director for the group FairTest, called the report “a 75-page red herring with a lot of tangential detail that avoids the fundamental questions about how the problems occurred.”“The only way we’re going to get real answers,” Mr. Schaeffer added, “is through the courts and legislative investigation.”Lawyers in Minnesota have filed a lawsuit on behalf of students affected by the scoring errors, and a federal court hearing is set for August.Gil I. Irwin and Patrick W. Houston, the vice presidents at Booz Allen who led the study, said they were not asked to assess blame but to recommend procedures for the future.“Whether the papers were wet because of rain, or because of someone’s sweat, is not important,” Mr. Houston said. “However the water got there, if you have the process and controls in place to pick up the problem and identify it and go back and score it in the proper manner, that’s what’s important.”After the problems emerged, the board adjusted the scoring procedures in a number of ways, including having each answer sheet scanned twice, and allowing answer sheets a drying-out period.The report said that with the changes “the current process is reliable and has prudent controls in place to safeguard scoring accuracy.”'"
"'06-07-21,'0','FRANKFURT, July 20 — The luxury automaker BMW on Thursday chose its head of production, Norbert Reithofer, to succeed Helmut Panke, the chief executive who had directed the company’s successful expansion into the United States while pushing it to ever-higher profits.Mr. Panke, who has reached BMW’s mandatory retirement age of 60, will hand over the leadership to Mr. Reithofer, 50, on Sept. 1, the company said.Mr. Reithofer, a 19-year veteran of the company who has been on the BMW management board since 2002, currently oversees BMW’s growing network of production sites, which have fed its expansion outside its home market in Europe.He has also run the company’s plants in Rosslyn, South Africa, and Spartanburg, S.C.The selection of Mr. Reithofer, with his blend of technical expertise in auto manufacturing and international experience, signals that drastic change at BMW is unlikely in the coming years, analysts said.“He was the absolute top candidate,’’ said Fredrik Westin, an analyst with WestLB in Düsseldorf. “He represents a coherent continuation of the strategy Panke began.”'"
"'06-07-21,'0','“This is a fairly aggressive move, and you have to take this as a positive,” said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “One of the raps against this management is that they don’t listen to investors.”Investors were encouraged by the quarterly results and the stock buyback announcement, which were disclosed after the close of market trading. In after-hours trading, shares of Microsoft rose about 5 percent, to $24.11. In regular trading, the shares fell 55 cents, to $22.85.Sales rose 16 percent, to $11.8 billion, compared with nearly $10.2 billion in the quarter a year earlier. The quarterly revenue slightly surpassed the Wall Street consensus of $11.6 billion, as compiled by Thomson First Call.Net income for the quarter was $2.83 billion, or 28 cents a share. That included a charge for legal expenses of $351 million, or 3 cents a share, to pay a fine that the European Commission announced last week for Microsoft’s failure to comply with an antitrust order.Setting aside the legal charge, the quarterly profit was 31 cents a share, or 1 cent a share above the analysts’ consensus of 30 cents a share.In the year-earlier quarter, Microsoft reported a profit of 34 cents a share, which included legal charges of 5 cents a share and a tax gain of 9 cents a share. Yet even brushing away all the one-time charges, Microsoft’s profits were flat compared with a year ago, though revenue was 16 percent higher this year.In April, when Microsoft announced that its expenses in the coming year would be significantly higher than previously disclosed, the company’s stock priced dropped. Yesterday, Microsoft provided more detail on where that additional $2.4 billion would be spent: Xbox product costs; marketing and sales; new product development and research in fields like business intelligence, security, software tools and mobile phone software; and online services like Internet search.In a conference call, Chris Liddell, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, characterized the added spending as an investment in the “next wave of growth for the company.”By product group, sales at Microsoft’s client unit, which is mostly the Windows desktop operating system, grew to nearly $3.4 billion, up 12 percent, or slightly higher than the pace of personal computer shipments over all during the quarter.Sales by the company’s server group, whose products compete with Linux as an alternative on data-serving computers, rose 18 percent, to nearly $3.2 billion.Server sales edged ahead of the information worker group, mainly Microsoft’s Office suite, which reported a 6 percent increase in sales, to $3.1 billion.The weak link for Microsoft continues to be its MSN unit, which includes its Web sites, online advertising and search. MSN revenues fell nearly 10 percent, to $580 million, and the unit lost $190 million. It is paying the costs of getting out of the dial-up Internet access business and investing heavily to build up its online advertising and search technology.Corporate customers do seem to be making commitments to Microsoft’s new products next year, as reflected in a $2 billion increase in so-called unearned revenues, said Richard Sherlund, an analyst for Goldman Sachs & Company.The unearned revenue mainly covers corporate contracts, typically spanning three years, to license Microsoft products. The unearned revenue is recognized as sales gradually over the course of the contract.Some analysts are already assuming in their financial models that Windows Vista, the next version of the desktop operating system, will be delayed another three months or so beyond its scheduled introduction to consumers in January. Mr. Liddell reiterated the company’s intention to ship Vista in January, but he said if the timing slipped by a quarter it would “not be particularly significant” financially.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','Newspapers nationwide were forced to improvise yesterday to produce one of their staples — the daily television listings — after a fire on Wednesday night crippled the principal source of those listings, a subsidiary of the Tribune Company based in upstate New York.The electrical fire, of unknown origin, damaged the offices and computers of Tribune Media Services in Glens Falls, N.Y. The company provides daily listings for most of the nation’s newspapers, as well as for the Sunday TV sections published by many of the papers.Early last night, the number of newspapers affected and the extent of the disruption in newsrooms was unclear, according to Jay Fehnel, the vice president for entertainment products at Tribune Media Services. Mr. Fehnel said the computers disabled by the fire were brought back online by 3 p.m., and the company would work through the night to send listings to its clients.“Each newspaper has its own production schedule,’’ Mr. Fehnel said, adding that the ability to publish TV listings as usual in today’s papers would depend on such things as the time zones in which they are published. “Many papers will not be affected,” he said.Tribune Media Services provides its lists to most of the nation’s daily newspapers, Mr. Fehnel said, but he declined to say how many. The company has dominated the newspaper listings business since acquiring its only competitor, TV Data Technologies in 2000.'"

But on a down day for the market, Wall Street seemed skeptical about the company’s growth strategy and its shares declined.Wachovia, the nation’s fourth-largest banking company, had double-digit revenue growth in the quarter as it absorbed an auto lender, Westcorp. Wachovia bought Westcorp, a 19-branch Southern California operation, for $3.4 billion in March.But it was Wachovia’s bigger West Coast purchase, a $25.5 billion deal announced in May to buy Golden West Financial, a savings and loan company based in Oakland, Calif., that seemed to be behind the response to the earnings.Wachovia’s share price dropped more than 6 percent on the day the deal was announced; it declined again Thursday as Golden West said that it had missed the analysts’ target for its second-quarter earnings.Shares of Golden West dipped 62 cents, to $74.18. Wachovia shares declined 69 cents, to $54.24.Wachovia, which has a strong consumer banking business in the South and the Northeast, has been focused on Western expansion in recent quarters as it seeks to extend itself nationwide.'"

"'06-07-21,'0','Some Senate Republicans expressed similar sentiments Thursday but none opposed the measure. “Other states with much less impressive minority progress and less impressive minority participation are not covered, while Georgia still is,” said Senator Saxby Chambliss. “This seems both unfair as well as unwise.”President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the bill into law after violent attacks on civil rights marchers demanding the right to vote. It instituted a nationwide prohibition against voting discrimination based on race and banned poll taxes and literacy tests.In regions where discrimination had been especially pronounced, the Justice Department was given the authority to review changes to election procedures, like redistricting, to judge if they would be discriminatory.The current legislation retained the so-called pre-clearance requirement for nine states, most of them in the South, and for parts of seven others, including Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx in New York.Another provision opposed by some Republicans requires the printing of bilingual ballots in political jurisdictions that meet a threshold for the percentage of citizens who have difficulty with English.Most Republicans joined united Democrats in pushing ahead, saying that while the Voting Rights Act had produced historic results, it was still warranted.“South Carolinians, you have come a long way,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from that state, which is among those covered by the law. “But we, just like every other part of this country, still have a long way to go.”Civil rights leaders praised the Senate action and called on Mr. Bush to send a strong signal to the Justice Department that the measure must be strongly enforced.The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who watched the Senate debate from the gallery, said that the Bush administration had sided with states in voting rights cases and that it had been left to the courts to intervene.“So far, the Department of Justice has favored states’ rights over federal enforcement,” Mr. Jackson said. “We see a pattern.”The legislation was named for several civil rights figures: Coretta Scott King, Fannie Lou Hamer and Rosa Parks.As the Senate voted, Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia, who was beaten in the 1965 voting rights march on Montgomery, Ala., came to the floor, and other lawmakers provided their memories of the era as they spoke in support of the legislation.“I recall watching President Lyndon Baines Johnson sign the 1965 act just off the chamber of the Senate,” said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and one of three current senators serving when the law was originally passed. “We knew that day we had changed the country forever, and indeed we had.”'"

Semtech said some options were not dated correctly.A special committee set up by Semtech directors uncovered the problems and continues its work, the company said.Semtech is among more than 60 companies whose options grants are being studied by regulators or internal panels to see if they were backdated. Backdating can inflate the value of options by timing grants to coincide with days when the stock price was low.Semtech has delayed its most recent quarterly financial report and is the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry over its options practices. Semtech also said a third shareholder lawsuit had been filed over options grants.Another software company, Verint Systems Inc., said yesterday that it had been asked to supply information on its stock option grants to the S.E.C. Verint makes software for analyzing communications networks.Verint, based in Melville, N.Y., said yesterday in a regulatory filing that the request was related to questions about stock option grants issued by Comverse Technology, which owns 57 percent of Verint.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','He said he hoped that the postponement was a sign that prosecutors were dissatisfied with the evidence gathered against Mr. Chen, which his lawyers have called flimsy. He is charged with destroying public property and with gathering a crowd to block traffic. Government officials in Shandong, which is on China’s northern coast, have declined to comment on the charges.Mr. Li said that to ensure that Mr. Chen was defended at the hearing, he intended to remain near the courthouse in case the trial was suddenly declared under way.Having already issued a formal letter of indictment against Mr. Chen, it would be unusual for prosecutors to undertake a fresh inquiry into the charges.More likely, legal experts working for Mr. Chen said, the local authorities would prefer to hold the trial at a time when it would attract less attention from his domestic supporters and from the international news media, which have recently carried detailed coverage of the case.Mr. Chen, blind since childhood, provoked sharp retaliation from Communist Party leaders in the city of Linyi in Shandong Province after he sought to organize a class-action lawsuit on behalf of local peasants who had been forced to have abortions and undergo sterilization operations to help the city meet its quota for controlling population growth.He was held under effective house arrest since last August and was formally arrested only last month.Mr. Chen has received strong support from legal scholars and defense lawyers in Beijing and among human rights groups in China and abroad.But so far, the local authorities seem determined to press ahead with the criminal case. There are no signs that more senior officials in Beijing are looking to intervene to stop the prosecution despite what legal experts say are glaring legal irregularities.Overseas rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for Mr. Chen’s release on humanitarian grounds.“When Chen tried to make proper use of China’s legal system, the response wasn’t due process,” Sophie Richardson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said in a statement. “It was house arrest, physical abuse, and then disappearance. His case is a textbook example of how little the rule of law means in China.”'"
"'06-07-21,'0','With one of their first-round draft picks, Josh Boone, out for the next four to six months because of a shoulder injury, the Nets may enter the free-agent market, after all.Boone, a 6-foot-10, 237-pound power forward out of Connecticut, was expected to contribute off the bench. His absence will leave the Nets with a front line of Jason Collins, Nenad Krstic and Cliff Robinson, a free agent who is expected to re-sign as early as today when he takes a physical.The Nets must now seriously consider acquiring another big body for their frontcourt.“We’ll have to reassess what we were thinking about and see if we can find a bigger player to fill that spot,” Rod Thorn, the Nets’ president, said yesterday during a conference call with reporters.In the past few weeks, the Nets had said that they had not been busy trying to acquire free agents. Thorn had said that the team might not use any of the three exceptions it had to sign them: the midlevel exception (under which the team can a sign a player or players for up to $5.215 million over all), the biannual exception ($1.75 million) and a $2 million trade exception.Although Boone is expected to return between November and January, he may not help much right away because he will have missed his first N.B.A. training camp.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','The separatists have disputed this, saying Mr. Basayev, who in addition to leading a terrorist group was vice president of the separatist government that Russia forced from power six years ago, died when a truck in his convoy hit a pothole, accidentally detonating explosives the separatists were moving.They note that early on July 10, Russian officials reported that an accidental explosion had killed several terrorists, and then, in the evening, amended the report, saying the blast had been a special operation that had been aimed at Mr. Basayev and killed him.Whether he was killed by accident or by counterterrorism agents, the opposing claims have been joined by all manner of theories and speculation.First, a Russian television station said Mr. Basayev’s group had been hit by a sophisticated missile that zeroed in on its cellphone signal. Other reports said a beacon had been placed in equipment or ordnance expected to be used by Mr. Basayev, and this allowed the Federal Security Service, or F.S.B., the domestic successor to the K.G.B., to track him.Kommersant has since suggested that he was killed by rivals from Dagestan, contending that his body was riddled with bits of shrapnel identical to those contained in improvised bombs made by a well-known Dagestani bomb maker.Another prevalent theory is that Russia killed Mr. Basayev weeks ago, and then staged an operation for public relations purposes before the Group of 8 summit meeting, which ended Monday.Conspiracy theories are common in Russia. Parts of the population, subjected for years to Soviet propaganda and since then to television stations controlled by oligarchs or state interests, are deeply skeptical and prone to inventing or accepting alternate accounts of major events.The Kremlin restated its official account, holding the meeting in secret but broadcasting scenes of Mr. Putin leaving the ceremony.Dmitri S. Peskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Mr. Putin had met with fewer than 12 participants in the operation that had killed Mr. Basayev, and had issued them medals for heroism and service to the country. He said a majority of the participants came from the F.S.B., but declined to discuss additional details or to say what other security agencies had been represented.“All of them are people who are never in public and never will be,” Mr. Peskov said.He dismissed the separatists’ claims that their vice president died in an accident. This is an “informational war, and has nothing to do with reality,” he said. The separatists, in turn, have described the Kremlin’s version as propaganda.'"
"'06-07-21,'0','Nokia, the maker of mobile phones, said yesterday that its second-quarter profit rose 43 percent, the biggest increase in more than three years, on growth in China and India and sales of more expensive handsets in Europe.Net income was 1.14 billion euros ($1.44 billion), or 0.28 euro a share, compared with 799 million euros, or 0.18 euro a share, in the period a year earlier, the company said.Nokia is increasing sales by introducing cheaper handsets aimed at China and India, while offering multimedia phones with music players and cameras in Europe and the United States.Nokia’s profitability is under pressure as competition from Motorola and the Samsung Electronics Company pushes average prices lower. Motorola posted profit and sales on Wednesday that beat analysts’ estimates.“Despite the nice stories about growth in China and India, it’s clear the competition in all segments, not just emerging markets, is fierce,” said Theo Maas, a money manager at the ABN Amro IT Fund in Amsterdam.'"

"'06-07-21,'0','IT’S “tentpole time” in Hollywood, when the studios unfurl their costliest and coolest blockbusters (called tentpoles) and the weekend box-office winners are trumpeted as if a movie’s take provided valuable insight into our pop culture.Well, it doesn’t. It doesn’t even seem to provide much insight into the Hollywood business model — consider the hundreds of jobs cut recently at M.G.M, Warner Bros., Dreamworks and other studios. (Even the production chief at Disney, which produced the summer’s biggest smash, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest,” was pink-slipped on Monday.)A generation ago, when Variety first started making a big deal of weekend box office, it was arguably a valuable exercise. That was a terrible time for Hollywood: the number of filmgoers had dropped to 15.8 million in 1971 from 78.2 million in 1946. Most films opened in a very small number of theaters as the studios nervously awaited the public’s verdict. The response of the audiences and critics in key cities determined whether a film would “go wide” and get advertising support.I was a young executive at Paramount when films like “Bonnie and Clyde,” “Midnight Cowboy” and “Easy Rider” were building their surprise constituencies. The lesson was clear: These films had moved the needle of our pop culture. Public tastes were changing and we had to keep pace.I fondly remember the brief, chaotic meetings when we studied the box office results and asked ourselves, “What does all this mean?” And since we couldn’t come up with an answer, we decided to make films that we ourselves wanted to see: “Harold and Maude,” “The Conversation” and “The Godfather.”And that meant the ultimate heresy: no sequels. To us, they were stultifying. They were also downright D-class. Francis Ford Coppola was outraged when my boss, Robert Evans, and I told him there was one exception to that rule: “The Godfather.” Mr. Coppola eventually succumbed. As things turned out, he was right about the process. He was thankfully wrong about “Godfather II.”'"
"'06-07-21,'0','Most of the popular music best suited to this kind of intense immersion either murmurs under the mass-media radar, like Mr. Franks’s, or is fundamentally misunderstood, like Sade’s. It is largely free of the defiance and attitude pumped into pop and rock by that musical embodiment of ego and aggression, the bass drum, which roughly demarcates the line between public and private music. This experience is private.Alongside Mr. Franks’s songs in my vacation playlist are two complete albums by Mr. Gilberto, “Amoroso” and “João”; Joni Mitchell’s travel album, “Hejira”; Jane Siberry’s “When I Was a Boy,” produced by Brian Eno; “A Turtle’s Dream” by the jazz singer Abbey Lincoln; the British singer-songwriter Nick Drake’s first two albums, “Five Leaves Left” and “Bryter Layter;” and generous helpings of Sade.Traditional film music, another important ingredient, includes excerpts from three Ennio Morricone scores (“Bugsy,” “Lolita” and “In the Line of Fire”); Alberto Iglesias’s complete scores for the Pedro Almodóvar films “Talk to Her” and “Bad Education”; fragments of Gabriel Yared’s score for “The Talented Mr. Ripley”; and the final section of Edward Shearmur’s music for “The Wings of the Dove.”Music arranged and conducted by the German maestro Claus Ogerman is also scattered through the playlist. Closely associated with Antonio Carlos Jobim, Mr. Ogerman orchestrated “Amoroso”; the late-60’s pop-jazz classic “Bill Evans Trio With Symphony Orchestra”; “Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim,” the Chairman of the Board’s quietest record; and Diana Krall’s “Look of Love.”Mr. Ogerman’s richest orchestrations turn songs into miniature movie scores in which the singers and instrumentalists become protagonists in bittersweet romantic dramas with noirish undertones. When Ms. Krall sang songs from “The Look of Love” four years ago at Radio City Music Hall, she wore a filmy white dress that recalled Kathleen Turner in “Body Heat.”A classic example of this introspective pop with panoramic vision is Ms. Mitchell’s “Hejira.” Thirty years after that album was released, it still stands as the high artistic watermark of the singer-songwriter movement. Its greatness owes almost as much to its sound as to its literary content. The dialogue between Ms. Mitchell’s agitated rhythm guitar and the responsive electric bass of Jaco Pastorius creates a spontaneous, erotically charged give and take between a woman and a man (or between the singer’s feelings and thoughts) as she flees a failed relationship by going on the road alone. These sprawling internal monologues, crammed with rich poetic detail, reflect on love, death, change and personal choice with a candor and depth that remain unsurpassed among singer-songwriters.In 1993, Ms. Mitchell’s younger and artier fellow Canadian Jane Siberry released an album of comparable sweep, “When I Was Boy.” Its songs, embellished with sound effects, describe a spiritual quest that’s more abstract and elevated, and less overtly autobiographical, than “Hejira,” but no less compelling. The record is a personal epic whose centerpiece, “Sweet Incarnadine,” describes the moment of sustained eye contact when two people shed their defenses and leap off the precipice into total intimacy and trust.Abbey Lincoln, whose singing suggests Billie Holiday fortified by faith, explores the meaning of life and death in her 1995 masterpiece, “A Turtle’s Dream.” Its nine-minute centerpiece, “Down Here Below,” is her one-sided conversation with a God she both reveres and questions in language that transcends her usually singsongy verses. Leading her ensemble of bass, drums, violin and viola, the pianist Kenny Barron delivers a sublime extended solo that matches the intensity of Ms. Lincoln’s voice, hovering on the edge of rapture and tears. I’ve seen Ms. Lincoln perform the song in concert several times, but no performance came close to the one captured on this record.The recordings of Nick Drake, the English singer-songwriter who died in 1974 from an overdose of antidepressants, still exert a seductive mystical tug. These records are memorable less for what their enigmatic lyrics say than for the blend of Drake’s vocal drone, his guitar and the exquisite orchestrations that billow up around them and cast a spell of hushed mysticism and refined melancholy.If you pay close attention to Sade, whose records are often mistakenly lumped with Norah Jones’s as yuppie brunch music, you’ll discover they offer some of the deepest pop insights into the vicissitudes of relationships. In songs like “The Sweetest Taboo,” “Kiss of Life,” “Paradise,” “Love Is Stronger Than Pride” and “Haunt Me,” the instrumentation and subtle groove conjure atmospheres in which the singer vacillates between ecstasy, ambivalence and grief. From moment to moment, the instrumentation seismically gauges the fluctuating emotional temperature.Here are some more scattered cuts from albums on this season’s vacation playlist. “Tea in the Sahara,” the Sting song from the Police album “Synchronicity,” takes you by magic carpet into a North African desert to sketch a story of desire and obsession borrowed from Paul Bowles’s “Sheltering Sky” and embellished with Moroccan flavors. Thomas Dolby’s “Screen Kiss,” from his album “The Flat Earth,” describes a smoggy, wide-screen Hollywood nightmare in a Bruce Wagner novel.On her album “Blossom’s Planet,” that eternal pixie Blossom Dearie applies her sweet/tart wisp of a voice to Jobim’s “Wave” and wafts it heavenward like skywriting stretching over the ocean. With its layered, pop-symphonic production by Trevor Horn, Seal’s “No Easy Way,” from his “Human Being” album, is a haunting breakup song borne on retreating waves of sadness. Peter Gabriel’s “Mercy Street,” a brooding meditation from his album “So,” depicts a solitary figure moving through the sullen New England cityscape described by Anne Sexton’s poem “45 Mercy Street.” And Kate Bush’s “Sensual World,” inspired by Molly Bloom’s stream of consciousness in Joyce’s “Ulysses,” floats an intoxicating erotic reverie on a wave of sitar.There are dozens more candidates for this playlist. When you make your own list of favorites, let T. S. Eliot’s “Four Quartets” be your guide:That it is not heard at all, but you are the music'"

"'06-07-21,'0','Today we call them neoconservatives, but in the 1980’s, those who believed that America could remake the world to its liking with a series of splendid little wars were known within the White House as “the crazies.” Grown-ups in both parties, including the first President Bush, rejected their vision as a dangerous fantasy.But in 2000 the Supreme Court delivered the White House to a man who, although he may be 60, doesn’t act like a grown-up. The second President Bush obviously confuses swagger with strength, and prefers tough talkers like the crazies to people who actually think things through. He got the chance to implement the crazies’ vision after 9/11, which created a climate in which few people in Congress or the news media dared to ask hard questions. And the result is the bloody mess we’re now in.This isn’t a case of 20-20 hindsight. It was clear from the beginning that the United States didn’t have remotely enough troops to carry out the crazies’ agenda — and Mr. Bush never asked for a bigger army.As I wrote back in January 2003, this meant that the “Bush doctrine” of preventive war was, in practice, a plan to “talk trash and carry a small stick.” It was obvious even then that the administration was preparing to invade Iraq not because it posed a real threat, but because it looked like a soft target.The message to North Korea, which really did have an active nuclear program, was clear: “The Bush administration,” I wrote, putting myself in Kim Jong Il’s shoes, “says you’re evil. It won’t offer you aid, even if you cancel your nuclear program, because that would be rewarding evil. It won’t even promise not to attack you, because it believes it has a mission to destroy evil regimes, whether or not they actually pose any threat to the U.S. But for all its belligerence, the Bush administration seems willing to confront only regimes that are militarily weak.” So “the best self-preservation strategy ... is to be dangerous.”'"

No date was set.“We are very optimistic that the court in St. Louis can fashion some reasonable conditions for his release,” the lawyer for Mr. Carruthers, Tim Evans, said Friday after the brief hearing before a federal magistrate.Mr. Carruthers was arrested Sunday at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport as he waited to board a flight to Costa Rica, where the company has its headquarters.He along with 10 others, including the founder of BetOnSports, were named in a 22-count indictment unsealed this week by federal prosecutors in St. Louis.

Mr. Evans declined to say precisely why he preferred to move the detention hearing to St. Louis.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','Then the men spray painted names on the coffins, and for a few moments the bodies became people again, loved ones, memories.No. 37 became Sally Wahbi, a 7-year-old who died in an attack on the Civil Defense Building in Tyre on Sunday. No. 35, Alia Alaedeen, who suffered serious head injuries as she was escaping the town of Sarifa on Wednesday and died Thursday. And No. 73 became Mariam Abdullah, who along with Zahra, Hadi and Myrna was among the 23 people killed in an Israeli attack on a pickup truck escaping the town of Marwaheen last Saturday.“God, you gave her to me — now take her to heaven,” Mariam Abdullah’s mother moaned. “Take her to Paradise, and protect the victims of evil.”The scene continued for several hours as bodies in plastic bags, some of them soaked in blood, were photographed and placed into coffins, which were then nailed shut and lined up. The numbers on the wall corresponding to those on the coffins only went up to 74, but the men continued to place bodies into coffins.“We need a small coffin,” one of the men shouted. The crowd went silent, and soon a body the size of a doll came out, what one doctor called a posthumous birth from a pregnant mother in the trailer. The men broke into chants of “God is great.”Halfway through, there was a bang as a plane dropped leaflets over the crowd warning them to move at once. “Due to the terrorist acts against the state of Israel that came from your villages and your homes, the Israeli Army has been forced to respond immediately against these acts even within your villages, for your own security,” the note read in Arabic. “You are ordered to leave your villages and head immediately north of the Litani River.”“They talk about terrorism, but we see this as terrorism, too,” Mohammed Abdullah, 53, a retired army officer, observed quietly, bracing for bodies of his relatives to emerge. “But the United States is standing quiet, and that allows them to continue.”He last saw his family on July 9, when they drove from their home in Beirut to Marwaheen, where they planned to set up the family’s summer house. He intended to join them next week, but last Saturday they called and said they were evacuating the village with several relatives after the Israelis warned them to leave.When he saw a television report about an attack on a convoy headed from Marwaheen to Tyre, he immediately realized the implications. Only 4 of the 27 passengers in the pickup survived, among them his daughter Marwa, 10.He wished he could bury them in Marwaheen, he said, but it was impossible to do so with the roads bombed and the shelling continuing. So he relented and accepted having them temporarily buried Friday.It took until the afternoon for all 82 coffins to be loaded onto two Lebanese Army trucks. The trucks pulled into a trench gouged by a tractor, and the men began unloading the coffins, placing them side by side, grouped by family name.“If you speak the truth here you are called a traitor,” Mr. Abdullah said. “But we all know that this is a war between Iran and America. I am paying part of the price for it.” Then he suddenly grew pensive as he stood at the edge of the trench.“That’s my daughter, No. 9,” he said, pointing at a coffin coming out of the truck as. “It’s a nice number, don’t you think? And No. 7, it’s a nice number, too. It’s my wife. And there’s No. 10. I hope they will be lucky.” HASSAN M. FATTAHThe Way Out Passes Through a NeighborThe stranded families stumbled like sleepwalkers across the polished tile of the airport floor. In the crush of people leaving Lebanon, the airport here in the Syrian capital is one of the first stops, and travelers — babies balanced on hips and giant bags in tow — blearily watched blinking screens, hoping desperately for a flight.“Did he say Doha?” asked a young Lebanese woman in an agitated voice, as her 3-year-old son raced around her, and her husband sat wordlessly nearby wearing earplugs.There is more, of course, to these travelers’ woes than broken vacations. As Israel continued to bombard Lebanon, Lebanese had yet to fully digest the sudden and painful turn of events, and still found themselves in a stunned, dreamlike state, shaking their heads at just how terribly different their lives are now.“We went to sleep and everything was O.K., but we woke up and we were suddenly nothing,” said the owner of a car-rental agency in Beirut, who was in front of a television showing the leader of Hezbollah, the Shiite group that is fighting Israel.Wealthier Lebanese, many of whom live abroad and return to their tiny, beloved mountainous country to summer, like most of those waiting in the airport lounge, had deeply believed that a fresh new chapter in their country’s history had begun. Since the end of the civil war in the early 1990’s, the country has gradually rebuilt its economy to become a sought-after vacation spot.The bombings of the past week have cut deeply, and left many wondering whether they would ever be back to live.“Look at any Lebanese now, and you see sadness and a big question mark,” said the businessman. Christian Garaud, a Lebanese filmmaker, sat on a vinyl seat cradling his 12-day-old son. He had traveled to Beirut from his home in Morocco, so his son could be born there. In life, he said, one gets only a few good chances, and Lebanon seems to have consistently missed the ones it has been given.Throughout recent history, Lebanon’s many sects have had many opportunities to unite, most recently after the assassination last year of Rafik Hariri, the former prime minister whose death set off protests in Beirut, bringing people together across religious and sectarian lines and pressured the Syrian government to withdraw its forces, which for years had occupied Lebanon.“It was the first moment in our history that Christians and Muslims came together,” Mr. Garaud said. “It was like people in the Bronx and people in Westhampton all waving the same flag.”Now attitudes seem farther apart than ever. Even in the airport, about the only people in a crowd who nodded in support of the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, practically a folk hero among poor Lebanese Shiites, were two Syrian businessmen.“We don’t approve of what Hezbollah is doing,” said the mother looking for the Doha flight, who said her name was Helena. “The economy was really getting better.”Max Marcus, a gangly 25-year-old Canadian whose grandmother is a Lebanese Shiite, understood the Shiite side of things firsthand. He had just traveled to his grandmother’s town in southern Lebanon when a bridge nearby was bombed.“She’s angry at the bombs that are dropping, and she supports Hezbollah,” Mr. Marcus said.“You’ve got to understand, they aren’t all terrorists,” he said. “They are protectors in a place where there was a bad war.”Minutes later, his flight to Doha was called and he loped off to his gate. SABRINA TAVERNISEAccording to those who knew him, Muhammad Harara, 27, was a gentle soul with a slow waddling gait because of congenitally dislocated hips. Unable to find work, he lived with his brother’s family, where he was a favorite uncle.But according to the Israeli military, he was a “Hamas military wing operative” who was preparing to fire an antitank missile at Israeli tanks from the roof of his relatives’ home.What is certain is that an Israeli tank fired on Mr. Harara around 6 a.m. Friday, blowing him apart and killing his sister-in-law and two of her children.The tank shell left a gaping hole where there had been two narrow windows in the stairwell leading to the roof. By the end of the day, the only evidence of Mr. Harara’s early morning presence there was a slash of darkening blood and human remains on the cinder-block wall.Mr. Harara’s brother, Jaber, looking dazed as neighbors gathered to mourn in the alley beside his home, insisted that there were no weapons in the house and that no one in the family belonged to any armed group. “I used to work in Israel,” he said. “The Israelis would never have given me permission to work there if anyone in the family had such links.”He said his brother had gone to the roof with one of his nephews to see if they could spot Israeli tanks, which were rumored to be moving north along the border after leaving the Mughazi refugee camp farther to the south hours before.But like most accounts from this part of the world, it was not that simple. Another relative, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, said later that while the Muhammad Harara who was killed was not a Hamas member, his nephew, who was on the roof that morning and is also named Muhammad Harara, is a member of Hamas’s military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.That Muhammad Harara, 20, lay Friday on the top floor of the Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, recovering from mild shrapnel wounds suffered when his uncle, mother and two brothers were killed. He denied being a member of any armed group and spoke quietly of the traumatic morning.The family rose as usual at 4:30 a.m. to go to a nearby mosque to pray, he said. Everybody was talking about the Israeli tanks moving north, and so when they got home, he and his uncle headed for the roof where there is a clear view of the open ground between Gaza City and the border fence separating the Gaza Strip from Israel.His mother followed them up the stairs shouting for them to come down, but he ignored her.He got to the roof first, saw the tanks, saw a flash and turned to tell his uncle to go back down. Before he could do so, however, the shell ripped through the windows of the stairwell landing below. The blast knocked him down and blew his uncle’s mangled body past him onto the roof.“The shell was faster than me,” he said.Another brother, Omar, who had gone back to bed after the morning prayer, rushed up the stairs to find his mother and two brothers dead in the stairwell. He got to the roof where he found his uncle and other brother. He was shouting for someone to call an ambulance when a second shell struck, wounding him with shrapnel.The two surviving brothers crawled back down the stairs past the blackened bodies of their mother and brothers.Muhammad Harara said he had been studying to be a social worker at the Islamic University in Gaza and had hoped to help people like his disabled uncle.“No spirit for that now,” he said, lying in a hospital room below old stickers celebrating men who had died fighting Israel.From a second-story window in Tibnine in southern Lebanon, Joseph Salmassi spent much of the past week with his wife and daughter watching buildings disintegrate around them, wondering whether theirs would be next. “We had to flee,” said Mr. Salmassi, an American of Lebanese descent who runs a gas station in Dearborn, Mich. “We called the embassy so many times, and they said, ‘We can’t get to you.’ ”So Mr. Salmassi, 53, said he paid $3,000 to hire two taxis to drive him and his family to Beirut, where they hoped to find a way back to the United States.“We put white blankets on top of the cars so the airplanes wouldn’t hit us,” he said.“Bombs landed on the side of the road as we traveled,” he added. “There were cars lying on the side of the road with dead people in them.”Mr. Salmassi, who said his family had gone to Lebanon to visit his wife’s parents, arrived here Friday morning along with hundreds of other Americans fleeing Lebanon aboard the amphibious assault ship Nashville.The ship is one of the dozens the United States and other countries have been using to ferry their citizens from the conflict. In the last three days, about 3,000 Americans have arrived in Cyprus from Lebanon. An additional 2,000 were scheduled to land late Friday or early Saturday morning, with thousands more in coming days, according to officials at the American Embassy here.The mass evacuations are threatening to overwhelm the island, which was already saturated with vacationers during its peak tourist season.The demand for the island’s limited resources has led the government to call for international assistance.“Up until now Cyprus has been basically left alone and unassisted in its effort to help so many thousands of people,” Christodoulos Pashardes, a spokesman for the government said Friday, Agence France-Presse reported. With hotel rooms scarce, the United States has set up a temporary housing site in the capital, Nicosia, with food, water, medical personnel and about 300 cots.Some of the evacuees made their own travel arrangements for getting home from Cyprus, but most are expected to take flights chartered by the United States. The evacuees were originally told they would have to reimburse the government for the flights, as required under United States law, but the State Department announced that it would waive the requirement.“You don’t know if you’re going to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” said Kamil Saber, a 42-year-old resident of Somerset, N.J., who was on vacation in Lebanon. “You could be driving next to a truck that could be targeted. You never know.” RENWICK McLEAN'"
"'06-07-22,'0','The Microsoft Corporation confirmed yesterday that it was developing a portable music player to compete with the iPod from Apple Computer for a share of the $4 billion market for portable entertainment devices.The first products are to go on sale this year and are being developed under the code name Zune, the general manager, Chris Stephenson, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. Part of the project is a service that will compete with Apple’s iTunes.Microsoft is abandoning a strategy of relying on partners to produce devices with its Windows software to compete with iPod. They so far have failed to dent Apple’s 77 percent share of the market in the United States for digital music players, according to the market researcher NPD Group Inc. Even with its own product, Microsoft has an uphill climb.“It will take an awful lot for Microsoft to dislodge an entrenched competitor like Apple,” an analyst with Jupiter Research, Michael Gartenberg, said. “Given Apple’s history with iPod, it’s not like they’re going to sit back while Microsoft enters the market.”Stock in Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., rose $1.02, to $23.87 a share.Microsoft’s statement, sent by a spokeswoman, Sally Julien, provided no description of the products. She declined to comment further or to make a Microsoft official available. Apple said it had no comment. Record labels and broadcasters may be eager to work with Microsoft to blunt Apple’s power in dictating prices, Mr. Gartenberg said. Still, Microsoft will face difficulty matching Apple’s appeal both with consumers and media companies.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','And the connection between Brocade and Wilson Sonsini is even deeper; Mr. Sonsini is a former member of the Brocade board, which granted Gregory L. Reyes, the company’s chief executive until early last year, the sole authority to award stock options. The practice was legal, but suggests a lack of checks and balances at a company where an insider headed what court filings have termed a compensation “committee of one.”A Wilson Sonsini spokeswoman said the firm represented so many of these companies because it provides legal counsel to a large portion of the Valley’s publicly traded companies.The practice of backdating options dates to the early 1990’s but took on momentum during the frenzied days of the Internet era, when the competition for available talent was fierce. Numerous Silicon Valley insiders described the practice as routine — so much so that the universe of technology companies ultimately placed under the microscope may well far exceed the dozens already under scrutiny by the Justice Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission, if not both.“People out there really duped themselves into thinking they were doing this for the benefit of stockholders when in reality they were defrauding them,” said Pearl Meyer, a managing partner at Steven Hall & Partners, a New York executive compensation firm that has worked with scores of Valley-based companies. “Talking to people out there, they clearly viewed this as a victimless crime.”There is little doubt that Silicon Valley provided the perfect setting for cutting corners. The heady days of the tech boom gave many a sense of entitlement, if not also a sense that they were the primary force keeping America strong in the world economy. It was also a maverick culture where clever ways of gaming the system were admired rather than excoriated.“There’s been a lot of stuff going on in the Valley since the 1990’s that has been pretty fast and loose,” said Michael S. Melbinger, an executive compensation lawyer at Winston & Strawn in Chicago. Compensation plans were adopted “during the dot-com boom and bust,” he said, “that were just sloppy at best.”Few outsiders scrutinized these practices, though, and some were unaware of them.Backdating was often “a client-driven strategy with the accounting firms saying, ‘Sounds O.K. to me,’ ” said Allan Koltin, the president of PDI Global, a consulting firm based in Chicago that works with many large accounting firms. “The client put the suggestion out there and the accounting firm, if they were smart enough and could figure out how to agree with the technology firm’s perspective, they pretty much won themselves a new client.”The same might be said of the law firms that advised these companies on the legality of backdating. As scores of Silicon Valley firms went public in the late 1990’s, there was enormous pressure on many accounting firms and law firms to keep their newly minted clients happy.“These guys were dancing on leather tabletops in their leather pants,” Mr. Melbinger said. “The rules didn’t apply to them. They were the new Masters of the Universe. If they called one firm and they wouldn’t do it, you’d have firms lining up to take their business.”But some in Silicon Valley, including Joseph A. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. commissioner who now teaches at Stanford Law School, wonder if the technology sector is being singled out prematurely before all the facts are known.“Options are more highly used in the tech sector than other sectors,” Mr. Grundfest said. “So it stands to reason that more tech companies would be caught up in this controversy.”Brocade might provide “a rather extreme example” of backdating, Mr. Grundfest said, “but you can have options-dating issues that are far less serious and can arise from a simple inattention to detail.“You’re going to get the whole spectrum, you’re going to get all the colors of the rainbow,’’ he added, “so we need to learn more before we reach for any broader conclusions.”Options give an employee the right to buy a stock at some point in the future at the price of the stock on the day it was granted — commonly referred to as the strike price. The lower the strike price, the more an option is worth to the recipient. (A stock option, however, is valuable only when shares of the company are trading at a higher price than the strike price.)Options have been an especially popular form of compensation in Silicon Valley, where they have been described as the area’s very lifeblood. They allow tech companies with enormous upside potential but scarce cash — companies that a recruiter might reasonably have described as the next Microsoft in the second half of the 1990’s — to lure new talent, even if they cannot match the salaries of larger, more established companies.The manipulation of options has taken on many forms. There have been clear cases of deliberate backdating, with executives fiddling with option grant dates to take advantage of a stock’s lower price, to more murky cases when options were granted just before the release of positive news that was likely to cause a jump in a stock’s price.Some say the problem seems to have grown worse after the dot-com fall, when a steep decline in stock prices rendered so many options worthless.“When these options became worth not very much, people got tricky,” said Sanford Robertson, a partner at Francisco Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., and a co-founder of the investment bank Robertson, Stephens & Company.“They’d do anything they could to make sure these things were worth something,’’ Mr. Robertson said. “If a stock spiked downward, they would move the date by a week or two, which could be worth a lot of money given the fluctuation in price of some of these stocks.”Mr. Robertson blamed an “options society that had gotten way out of hand in 1999 and 2000” and also the sense of entitlement so prevalent in Silicon Valley back then.Brocade seems a particularly egregious example of backdating, at least if prosecutors are to be believed. Two former officials there are accused of doctoring documents, including the minutes of board meetings and job-offer letters, so that it appeared that workers were granted options when the company’s stock was trading at a lower price.While federal investigators are investigating dozens of companies over possible backdating of options, the number that backdated options at some point may be significantly higher, according to Erik Lie, a professor at the Henry B. Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa. The number may be as high as 1,000 companies, Mr. Lie said at a recent investor conference.Linda Chatman Thomsen, chief of enforcement at the S.E.C., said in an interview that the government filed charges against Brocade first “because it was ready.’’“It wasn’t necessarily,’’ she said, “the most egregious case.”'"

"'06-07-22,'0','“In this city we’ve got an amazing problem with not just witness apathy, but with witness fear,” Mr. Corradino said.Prosecutors also struggle nationwide to persuade frightened witnesses to testify. The fears are not unfounded. In New York City, for instance, at least 20 witnesses to crimes have been killed since 1980.Five members of Mr. Gomez’s family had followed the case closely and attended the first three days of the trial. Mr. Gomez’s parents, who were among them, broke down in tears when they heard the news, said Richard Mancini, the victim advocate for the Fairfield district.“They were crushed,” he said. “Their spirit was almost broken.”The family did not return a request for comment left with the victim advocate.On the day of his death, Mr. Gomez had acted as the middleman on a PCP sale in the East End and had argued with local dealers after the drugs turned out to be bad, Mr. Corradino said.The dispute escalated in front of a grocery store at the corner of Stratford Avenue and Fifth Street, where gun violence is not unusual. A few men attacked Mr. Gomez, Mr. Corradino said, and then one shot him once in the face. Police showed up just a few minutes later, but most of the witnesses had disappeared.Neighbors who had watched cars peel away were hesitant to talk, Mr. Corradino said. Their fear, he said, “was palpable.”Further complicating the investigation, Mr. Corradino said a videotape from the grocery store’s security camera had a gap for the period when the murder occurred.The police nonetheless were able to build a case over the next few months by interviewing local drug dealers.Three witnesses said Mr. Williams had fired the fatal shot. One even brought in a picture of Mr. Williams that he had cut from his 1999 Harding High School yearbook, according to a police affidavit.Based on those witness accounts, the police arrested Mr. Williams in September 2004 and charged him with murder, punishable by up to 60 years in prison.As the trial approached, Mr. Corradino asked the Bridgeport Police Department and its fugitive task force to find the three witnesses and present them with subpoenas. He also put investigators from the prosecutors’ office on the case. They dropped off subpoenas at the witnesses’ last known addresses and questioned people in their neighborhoods about their whereabouts.But the police and investigators had little success, Mr. Corradino said, and giving them more time would not likely have made a difference.“I don’t think the outcome would have been different,” he said.Mr. Corradino was not the only lawyer in the case dealing with reluctant witnesses. Miles Gerety, the public defender representing Mr. Williams, said he had planned to argue that another man killed Mr. Gomez. At least two witnesses had identified that man as the killer, Mr. Gerety said. But one of those witnesses was “absolutely terrified” to take the stand, he said, and in the end, the case was dismissed before he was to testify.Although Mr. Corradino said he had worked on cases in which witnesses failed to testify, he had never had a trial dismissed because his witnesses could not be located. As of Thursday, the investigation into Mr. Gomez’s death was closed, Mr. Corradino said.“Any case where the victims don’t come forward is egregious,” he said. “It offends my sense of responsibility as a public servant.”'"
"'06-07-22,'0','PEORIA, Ill., July 21 (AP) — Caterpillar, the construction equipment maker, said Friday that its second-quarter earnings rose 38 percent, reflecting its strongest financial performance in at least four decades.Caterpillar said higher prices helped sales top $10 billion for the quarter and it raised guidance for the full year, citing strong demand from nonresidential and highway construction markets.A slowdown in the housing industry in the United States affected results, but the impact was more than offset by sales in other industries, including mining, energy and infrastructure development.The chief executive, James W. Owens, told analysts that it was the best quarter in the company’s history and concluded Caterpillar’s most profitable first half since 1966, reflecting continuing strong fundamentals in those industries.Net income rose to $1.05 billion, or $1.52 a share, from $760 million, or $1.08 a share, in the second quarter of 2005.

"'06-07-22,'0','“It’s very complicated,” Donna Bennick, Ms. Hahn’s lawyer, said of the disposition of the estate. “I’m trying to unravel it myself.”Since it appears that the mother and daughters have a good relationship, it seems unlikely that the daughters would contest their mother’s claim to any proceeds from the property, lawyers said.“So all roads ultimately lead to Rome,” Charles F. Crames, an estate and trust lawyer in Manhattan, said this week.It was a court judgment ordering Dr. Bartha to be evicted and the house to be sold as a way of satisfying his ex-wife’s claim that seemed to precipitate what may have been Dr. Bartha’s decision to destroy the house.Investigators said a gas line had been tampered with before the blast. Dr. Bartha was the only person in the house when it exploded on the morning of July 10. He was plucked from the rubble and died in the hospital five days later.Property was an emotional issue for Dr. Bartha. In a rambling, often incoherent e-mail message sent to his ex-wife before the explosion, he said one of his earliest memories was of hiding in a cave in his native Romania during World War II. In a tale of wounded family pride, he told how his father owned a gold mine, which was nationalized after the war. The family lost its home in the village of Rosia Montana, Romania, he wrote, and his mother was obsessed with getting it back, to no avail.Dr. Bartha’s parents bought the town house at 34 East 62nd Street in 1980 for $395,000, according to court records, but did not move in until 1986. Ms. Dershowitz said the price of the house was low for the time because it was occupied by tenants who had to move out before the Barthas could move in.In his final e-mail message, Dr. Bartha indicated that he did not want his daughters to inherit the house.Berating his ex-wife, apparently over the divorce, he wrote, “Cordula with this you disinherited your children.”“The ultimate irony would be that she gets to administer the estate,” Harold A. Mayerson, former chairman of the Matrimonial Law Committee for the New York City Bar Association, said of Ms. Hahn.If a will is found that cuts the daughters out of the estate, they could conceivably contest it by challenging his mental competency at the time he made the will, lawyers said.“You have a right to disinherit a child,” Mr. Crames said. “However, if there is no will, no matter how bad your attitude toward your children, your spouse inherits first, and then your children. In this case, there is no spouse, because they were divorced.”Dr. Bartha has nephews, who unsuccessfully tried to claim a share of the house from Dr. Bartha’s mother after she died, according to court papers. Phone messages left for one of the nephews, Thomas Bartha, were not returned.Eric Proshansky, a lawyer for New York City, said the city was considering filing a claim for cleanup costs, but had not calculated how much that would be. The city’s claim would go first in line, followed by the ex-wife’s.The property, worth $6 million when the house was standing, is probably worth about $7 million as a hole in the ground, said Guthrie Garvin, a broker who is director of sales from East 60th to East 76th Street for Massey Knakal, a brokerage firm.He said the property would probably be sold for a town house. “There is a great appetite for town houses in that area,” he said. “With the price of town houses in that area, you’re right in prime territory.”While the ghoulish history of the property might scare off some buyers, Mr. Garvin said, there is always someone undeterred, attracted by the chance to build a dream house. “That’s the kind of area where you’re going to have a very sophisticated buyer and somebody who’s going to do a top-of-the-line renovation,” he said.Dr. Bartha’s former lawyer, Mr. Garr, said the doctor had little or no assets apart from the house and perhaps some retirement funds.Ms. Dershowitz, the divorce referee, said that Dr. Bartha had aspired to be a cardiologist but had never qualified as one. Instead, he had worked all his career as an emergency room doctor. She said he had lived very frugally, cooking with a microwave and a hot plate.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','It will be another nerve-racking experience for those close to Gatti, like his manager, Pat Lynch, who has often wondered how Gatti continues to walk away from his bouts.“After one of his fights against Micky Ward, they were both laying next to each other in the hospital,” Lynch said. “Arturo looked over at Micky and said, ‘We’ve got to start getting paid more for this.’ ”Gatti has been paid well because when he fights, people pay attention. He lives in Hoboken and has a huge following in New Jersey. Gatti has fought his last seven bouts in Atlantic City, and many of his fans have made the journey.Kery Davis, the senior vice president for programming at HBO Sports, offered no apologies for Gatti’s receiving more television exposure than fighters who might have fewer losses.“People love to see warriors go to war,” Davis said in an interview earlier this month in Las Vegas. “With Arturo, people know that win or lose, they’re going to see a great fight, they’re going to see a guy give his all.“This is the television business. At the end of the day, we’re about entertainment. Fighters understand that. Arturo Gatti is an entertainer. He doesn’t entertain you with his words or by dancing into the ring. He entertains you with his style, with his fists.”Many expected that Gatti would have burned out long ago, but at 34 he will be attempting to win a world title in his third weight class. (He has held superfeatherweight and light welterweight titles.)Some of Gatti’s fights have played out like scenes from a movie. In March 1996 against Wilson Rodriguez, Gatti’s eyes were swollen badly in Round 1, and he was knocked down in Round 2. But in Round 5, Gatti broke one of Rodriguez’s ribs with a left hook that knocked him down, then knocked him out with a left hook in Round 6.Lynch recalled how flustered he was watching that bout.“Arturo bought a BMW before that fight, and I told him not to,” Lynch said. “After the fight, he said to me, ‘Two things went through my mind when I was on the ground. No. 1, Pat Lynch is having a heart attack. No. 2, there goes my BMW.’ ”Gatti had another memorable victory in October 1997. Gabe Ruelas hit him 17 consecutive times in Round 4. But in Round 5, Gatti landed another of his devastating left hooks to knock out Ruelas.Gatti is most often asked about his three toe-to-toe fights against Ward. All of them went the 10-round distance, with Gatti winning their second and third meetings. Gatti’s trainer, Buddy McGirt, recalled the ninth round of the first Ward fight, when Gatti was doubled over in pain from a body punch.“I saw tears rolling down his eyes,” McGirt said. “He said, ‘My side hurts, but I’m going to make it through the last round.’ I told him I wasn’t going to let him get hurt, that if I didn’t see some bounce, I was going to stop the fight. He got up and started bouncing in the corner. He finished the fight.”Baldomir, a native of Argentina who trains in Los Angeles, figures to be a tough opponent for Gatti. Baldomir won the W.B.C. title by defeating the Brooklyn native Zab Judah in January at Madison Square Garden.But Gatti’s being involved in another brawl would hardly be surprising; he is a fighter who has made a career of absorbing and delivering punishment.“You never have any doubt that Arturo will give his all to win,” McGirt said. “That’s why people can’t get enough of him.”'"
"'06-07-22,'0','Ryan spoke briefly at another event later Thursday and said he had merely postponed a decision on a Bonds indictment “in light of some recent developments.” He was not more specific, and his office refused to clarify.“One thing we got from the statement yesterday from the prosecution, even though it’s kind of Delphic, is that they are determined to go forward and get Bonds,” Peter Keane, a law professor at Golden Gate University, said Friday.Anderson pleaded guilty to steroid distribution and money laundering last year in connection with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative scandal. He was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home confinement.Anderson’s lawyer, Mark J. Geragos, said it was an explicit part of the plea agreement that Anderson would not have to testify further. He also said it would be illegal to question Anderson about a secretly recorded conversation the government has of him talking about Bonds and drugs. A federal judge is reviewing the legality of that tape.Geragos repeated Anderson’s position in a telephone interview Friday. “I can tell you his stance has not changed one iota,” Geragos said. “His two-week stint only increased his resolve.”Keane said there was a misperception that the government had to indict Bonds, or others, or conclude the investigation at the end of the grand jury, which was investigating perjury and obstruction of justice.“What’s driving the government’s timeline is not the timeline of a particular grand jury,” Keane said. “Another grand jury can come in and be brought up to speed in a matter of days. The only thing the government has to be concerned about is the statute of limitations, which is five years from the time Bonds testified. So they have plenty of time.”On Dec. 4, 2003, Bonds told a grand jury that he did not knowingly use steroids, despite drastic changes to his physique and documents with his name on them from 2001 to 2003 showing drug schedules and test results, The San Francisco Chronicle has reported.Now Anderson may have to decide how long he is willing to be in prison rather than testify.“It’s one thing to go to prison when you know you’re going to be imprisoned for a maximum of two weeks,” Tony West, a former federal prosecutor based in San Francisco, said in a telephone interview. “It’s another thing when you’re facing 18 months. And that’s the situation the government is trying to create here. Nothing focuses the mind like prison time.”West said Anderson seemed to be the only witness who could talk authoritatively about the use of steroids by Bonds.“He has the ledgers which indicate certain knowledge by Barry Bonds inconsistent with grand jury testimony by Barry Bonds,” West said in a telephone interview Friday. “So he’s very important on that point of perjury.”Government investigators say they believe Anderson supplied Bonds with performance-enhancing drugs since before the 1999 season, when Bonds started a home run binge in his mid-30’s, a time when most hitters decline in productivity.Anderson admitted to providing steroids to other baseball players but refused to talk about Bonds.West said the new jury of 23 people, drawn from the county jury pool, can quickly get up to speed.“Usually what the government will do is read in key testimony from the previous grand jury through a witness to the new grand jury,” West said. “They might have an agent on the stand who will read in portions of key testimony. They might have kind of a summary witness who will present the grand jury with key elements of the case.”Jonathan R.

The nearly 3,000-pound facsimile, used by the United States Navy for training exercises, was knocked onto a Bronx section of the New England Thruway when the flatbed truck that was transporting it broke down and was rear-ended by another truck, the police said.The dummy missile was in a fiberglass case, adorned with military markings and words that included “Missile” and “Inert.” The case cracked open as it fell to the ground.An officer at the scene peered through the crack, saw the metal tube that looked like a Tomahawk missile, and took no chances. Detective Brian Hearn of the Bomb Squad received a phone call about 20 minutes after the accident. “This guy comes across and says: ‘Look, I’m not kidding. I got a cruise missile sitting in the middle of I-95,’ ” Detective Hearn said.The highway was shut down for hours. Radiation readings were taken; frantic phone calls to the Navy were made. A dozen firefighting units went to the scene, and so did the Police Department’s Emergency Service Unit and Bomb Squad.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','By The Associated PressWall Street wrapped up a volatile week with a down session yesterday as conflicting news from the technology sector added to investors’ uncertainty about earnings and sent the Nasdaq composite index to its lowest close in 14 months.The major indexes finished the week mixed after swerving sharply session to session.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 59.72 points, or 0.55 percent, to 10,868.38, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 8.84 points, or 0.71 percent, to 1,240.29.The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.03 points, or 0.93 percent, to 2,020.39 after plunging 41.29 Thursday. It was the lowest finish for the Nasdaq since May 17, 2005, when it closed at 2,004.15.The chip maker Advanced Micro Devices posted a disappointing earnings report, and the computer maker Dell warned that its quarterly results would likewise fall short of expectations. Yet Microsoft beat analysts’ forecasts, and investors were cheered on the announcement of its stock buyback.Testimony this week on Capitol Hill by Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was seen as bullish on the economy, but also a warning that inflation is gaining traction and that more interest rate increases are probable.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','Tomorrow Comedy Central will broadcast the last of Mr. Chappelle’s finished work in the third installment of “The Lost Episodes.” Mr. Chappelle has called the network’s decision to show those sketches “a bully move.”Mr. Chappelle’s spokeswoman, Carla Sims, had little to say about the conspiracy.“If we responded to every hoax that was out there, I wouldn’t get any work done,” she said, before adding that commenting officially about the site would do nothing but give it unearned credence.The overblown theory has been deflated as a viral Internet marketing scheme, a way for a Web site to gain popularity through file sharing and blogs. The original postings about the theory all came from Jason Hill, 33, co-founder of the Philadelphia-based Web development company WebLinc LLC.According to several sites, WebLinc registered the domain name ChappelleTheory.com in October, two months before its unofficial debut. The plan was to use the site to promote a clothing site called anti-social.com, which sells Dark Crusaders T-shirts for $18.“We’re definitely getting a resurgence of traffic now,” Mr. Hill said.After a lull of several months, the Chappelle Theory site reached a high this month of 4 million hits in one day, compared to about 2 million in the last few months, according to the Internet traffic monitor Alexaholic.com.WebLinc attributes the spike in interest to the broadcast of Mr. Chappelle’s newest material.Chappelle Theory first came to fame on the gossip site Defamer, and then made the rounds on MySpace and Friendster in early December, a time when the Web was rife with Chappelle conjecture.This was before Mr. Chappelle’s interviews with Oprah Winfrey and James Lipton and after the rumors of drugs, insanity and his escape to Africa. But Mr. Chappelle, though much talked about, was not talking.“So that was the perfect time for it because everyone was sort of wondering,” said Todd Jackson, editor in chief of dead-frog.com, a news blog for what he calls “comedy nerds.”Mr. Jackson was one of the first to debunk the conspiracy theory.“When I first saw the site I was pretty certain it was obviously a fake,” said Mr. Jackson, 35, who, as the former editorial director of Comedy Central’s Web site, once worked down the hall from “Chappelle’s Show.”He pointed to one of the more fantastic claims as proof. It alleges that while Ms. Winfrey interviewed Tom Cruise in January 2004 (the couch-jumping incident occurred in May 2005), she faced the camera and said, “Dave Chappelle, you should be ashamed of yourself.” She added, “I’m going to make sure you never work in Hollywood again.”According to the conspiracy, as written by Mr. Hill and his friends, Ms. Winfrey taped that message and somehow transmitted it solely to Mr. Chappelle’s home television in Ohio.Through the blog tracker Technorati.com, Mr. Jackson discovered the connection between WebLinc and the theory. He later exposed it on his blog.“A lot of people were savvy enough to know this was viral marketing, but I still see the link every once in a while, and I still see people saying, ‘Hey, I don’t know if this is true or not,’ ” said Mr. Jackson, who said he received a free Dark Crusaders T-shirt in the mail.Darren Hill, 30, Jason Hill’s brother and co-founder of WebLinc, admitted that Chappelle Theory was published to “promote the Anti Social brand.” Still, he said, he saw some value in the Web site.Mr. Jackson agreed. “As long as it’s making people laugh, there’s some validity to it,” he said.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','THE United States must rekindle the kind of diplomatic activity that befits its status and furthers its interests. Of the six players most directly involved in the confrontation — Israel, Hezbollah, Hamas, Syria, Iran and the elected Palestinian government — the only one with which we talk is the one with which we agree. As a result, the United States, facing one of the more severe crises in decades, has been missing in action. Watching the United Nations from the sidelines, it has subcontracted diplomacy in a region it deems vital to a party it doesn’t trust.American diplomacy should focus on immediate reciprocal and verifiable cease-fires, prisoner swaps, preliminary steps toward Hezbollah’s demilitarization and, on the Palestinian side, allowing the Hamas government to govern by easing the financial boycott. This cannot work without engaging Syria and Iran and renewing efforts to establish a comprehensive peace. None of this will be easy or tidy. But it is certainly preferable to a policy that in one breath tells innocent civilians that our thoughts are with them, and in another that the time for a cease-fire has not yet come. Our thoughts they can do without. It’s action they need.— ROBERT MALLEY, the director of the Middle East Program at the International Crisis Group.'"

In New York State, they must have brakes, a bell, lights if riding after dusk and a helmet if under 14. In return, they may use public roadways in a lawful fashion.The right of cyclists to use the road is not conceded by all drivers. In my six years of cycle commuting, I have been threatened, harassed, squeezed out of the lane and hit by a car. No driver is told to “get on the sidewalk,” as we cyclists frequently are (although riding on the sidewalk is illegal in New York City).I have often been complimented by pedestrians, other cyclists and even drivers on my clear signaling and road position. And I ride every day I possibly can.Bicycles are not toys, but transportation, and cyclists have responsibilities, but also rights.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','DECISIONS, decisions. A recent one made by Kathleen Rice, the new-wave Nassau County district attorney (she’s young, she’s a techie, and she’s the first woman to be elected district attorney on Long Island), to ban part-time prosecutors from her domain has cast her as a skirt-wearing Simon Legree. Even her sister lawyers at the serious-minded New York Women’s Bar Association, to which she belongs, are furious with her.Ms. Rice’s contends that she is simply trying to deliver 24/7 law enforcement to the citizenry that elected her to this $150,000-a-year post, and that part-timers do not belong in litigation, appeals and investigative positions on her 170-member staff. That doesn’t fly with the bar association. It’s commendable that she raised the number of women in senior positions to seven from two; nice that she has put in place the strictest D.W.I. policies in the state, established special victims’ and economic crimes bureaus, and revamped the rackets bureau; but not nice that she marginalized a chunk of her staff en route.It’s a bad example, says the bar association, to inform the 12 part-timers on her staff, all of whom happened to be female, most juggling careers and parenthood, that their services would no longer be required unless they worked full time. How retro to issue an ultimatum. Not to mention anti-family-friendly, in a “Devil Wears Prada” sort of way. Ten of the 12 part-timers knuckled under and stayed. Two resigned, but did not go quietly. They brought their complaints to the bar association. Unlike Ms. Rice, who grew up in Garden City with nine siblings and honed her argumentative skills at the dinner table, they have the association’s backing.The association’s president, Elaine N. Avery, says that it is totally unconscionable that the most powerful female prosecutor on Long Island has, six months into ascending to a pulpit that belonged to a man for the last three decades, issued a decree “that sets us back 30 years” on the issue of balancing a law career with family-friendly life choices. The association fears Ms. Rice’s my-way-or-the-highway management style will deter bright young women from applying for prosecutorial slots in Nassau and elsewhere. Ditto bright young men with work-life issues.“Here is a woman who should be a role model for us, and now this decision may have a trickle-down effect,” said Ms. Avery, who visited Ms. Rice in her cavernous office here last month to seek a policy retraction — or at least a policy softening — and left empty-handed. Further negotiations are pending. But Ms. Avery and her bar associates aren’t the only women fuming.'"
"'06-07-22,'0','ONLY two years after foreign central banks had become virtually the only net buyer of United States Treasury securities — and thus the financier for United States budget deficits — these banks have turned into net sellers of securities.The Treasury reported this week that foreign central banks were net sellers of Treasuries in May, as they had been in March. The May sales, of $14.3 billion, were the largest for any month since August 1998, when the United States government was running surpluses and the supply of Treasuries was shrinking.The United States needs to attract big investments from overseas to finance its large and growing trade deficit and its ability to get such investments from private, as opposed to official sources, is closely watched by some traders as a sign of whether the dollar may decline further.Thus, the latest results appeared positive. Nongovernment foreign investors plowed $90 billion into American securities, with more money going into corporate bonds than into Treasury securities.The charts show totals over rolling 12-month periods, smoothing out what can be volatile monthly figures. In the 12 months through May, foreign official institutions, mostly central banks, bought a net $137 billion of long-term American securities, including Treasuries, government agency bonds, corporate bonds and common stocks. That number, while sizable, is well below the record of $245 billion purchased in the 12 months through September 2004.'"

"'06-07-23,'0','When Dad used that voice, he didn't want an answer. I crept into the room. The whole family was gathered around the TV but the set was turned off. This must be some really bad news.I eased myself down between Bud and Janie on the sofa. They all looked so somber I thought someone must have died.""All present and accounted for,"" Dad said. ""Okay, here's the big announcement. I got a transfer. We're moving again.""I tingled all over, as if my body had gone to sleep for an instant. A transfer. TriDex transferred its salesmen every year or two, to keep them on their toes. Indiana was our sixth transfer in ten years. TriDex did not know or care that this was my favorite of all the places we had lived. Lately I'd been hoping we might get to stay here. I loved Indiana. I had lots of friends. It was flat, you could ride your bike everywhere. In the winter it froze hard and snowed a lot, so you could stay inside and watch TV all the time.I waded into the rising silence: ""Moving where?"" ""Mississippi,"" said Dad, ""and I don't want any lip out of you."" ""Aw now, Lee, don't say it that way."" Mom interposed herself between Dad by the sliding glass door and us on the sofa. ""Y'all, this is big news for Daddy - for all of us, really. You know how bad I been wanting to get closer to Granny and Jacko ... and you know how I hate the winters up here.""That was true. Mom was a flower of the South. Her feet had been cold since the first time Dad moved her away from Alabama.""Are you nuts?"" Bud said. ""We can't move now, Mom. I just made varsity."" Bud was a wrestler. Dad was proud of the fact that Bud wrestled so hard he puked after every match.""Aw now, Bud, come on, it's a better territory for Daddy,"" said Mom, ""and anyway we haven't got a choice, so let's just go on and be happy about it.""""You all can go, I don't care, I'm staying,"" said Bud. ""I'm a senior this fall, Mom, we can't move to - where did you say? Mississippi? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!""Bud took my breath away saying things like that, things that would have got me backhanded and sent to my room. Dad darkened and loomed in his corner, but stayed silent. Bud looked like Dad, and Dad respected him for that.""Okay Bud, you stay here,"" Mom said with a desperate smile. ""Who's gonna cook your supper and wash your dirty clothes?"" ""If Buddy's staying I wanna stay,"" Janie said.""Nobody's staying,"" said Mom. ""We know how to move, we've done it plenty of times. The movers will be here Monday morning bright and early to start packing.""Bud got up and slammed down the hall to his room BANG! ""I'll be dog,"" said my father. ""I'll be god dog, that boy ..."" ""Now Lee,"" Mom said, ""don't start.""""Start what? Don't you start."" ""I told you they'll need some time, honey. Of course they're not gonna be happy at first - having to go off from all their little friends."" She turned anxious eyes on Janie and me. ""I promise, you'll like it down there. You'll make new friends. Daddy's found us a beautiful house in the country. The schools are supposed to be great.""I mustered up a sneer. ""Yeah, I bet. Mississippi?"" I'd never been there, but I knew all about it from the evening news. Mississippi was last in everything you could measure. There was nothing down there but redneck sheriffs and protesting Negroes and civil rights workers buried in earthen dams.""There's nothing wrong with Mississippi,"" Mom said. ""It's nice and warm, for one thing, and at least the people will understand me when I talk.""""What if we don't want to go?"" I said. ""Why do we have to?"" ""Daddy's got a new territory."" She fingered a sheaf of honey-gold hair from her eyes. ""A smaller territory, so he won't have to be gone so much."" She turned smiling, but Dad's eyes were narrowed down, fixed on me, waiting for one word that would give him the right to come over there and strangle me.""Mississippi is the Magnolia State,"" Janie read from the World Book. ""The capital is Jackson. The products are cotton, lumber, poultry, and cattle.""""Good, Janie,"" said Mom. ""I told you those books would come in handy.""Mom was trying to sell this as a big promotion for Dad, but I knew better. I was almost sixteen, I knew everything. I read their mail, I went through their filing cabinet. I read the life insurance policy and thrilled at how rich we kids would be if they died. Many nights I had heard my father god-dogging the name of Larry Semple, his district manager. I knew that a smaller territory in Mississippi had to be a comedown from a three-state sales district based in Indiana. I knew just where to stick in the knife. ""Why does he have a smaller territory?""A subterranean vibration from Dad's side of the room, a trembling of air.Janie preened for the invisible camera that always followed her around. ""Well, I'm glad we're moving,"" she announced. ""I hate this place too, Mama. It's cold. And I want to live closer to Granny.""""Attagirl,"" Mom said. ""The power of positive thinking."" I coughed the word ""suck-up"" into my hand. ""Mom! He called me a suck-up!"" ""I did not. I coughed. Can't a person even cough?""On Monday we watched the movers load our things onto a giant orange tractor-trailer from Allied Van Lines. On Tuesday we set out down the brand-new interstate highway toward our future. We drove all day, into the late afternoon. South of Memphis we hit a bump that banged my cheek against the glass. The four-lane highway had become a broken two-lane. A sign saidThe land flattened out and got wide. At first glance it looked like Indiana again: green flat fields running off to the horizon, fence lines and grain elevators in the blue distance. But instead of neat Midwestern farmhouses I saw tarpaper shacks, poor black folks on the porches: skinny kids in rags, stooped old men in straw hats. Occasionally a mansion peeked out of a huge grove of oaks - a Greek temple with columns, white and impressively hidden.Mom said, ""Can you imagine living in a house like that? I would feel just like Scarlett.""""Mama,"" said Janie, ""that girl hasn't got on a shirt."" ""Don't stare, Jane. People can't help it if they're not as well off as us.""""Hmp."" My father scratched his neck. ""Anybody's willing to work can get along these days. Not like we had it in the Depression."" ""They let her just run around without a shirt?"" Janie threw herself against the seat to watch the girl receding in the rear window. ""She's as old as me.""""Well, it's hot down here, honey,"" said Mom. ""I'm sure she has a nice shirt she wears all the time.""In our air-conditioned car we were almost chilly, but beyond the glass you could see waves of heat rising up from the road and the fields. Even flashing by at sixty-five miles an hour, you could see sweat on people's faces.""Oh heavenly days,"" Mom said, ""it's so good to be home. Let's just open up and see how she feels."" She cranked down her window. In an instant, every ounce of cool air was sucked out and replaced with this blast of summer air - a hot, wet slap in the face. We hollered and moaned until Mom rolled the window back up.She grinned. ""Hot! Just like I like it."" Now that we were back in the South, Mom's accent had kicked in - the thickest sweetest south-Alabama accent you ever heard. Just lack I lack it!""I am never going outside again - never,"" said Bud. ""This house better have dang good air-conditioning.""""Oh, you'll be seeing plenty of outside,"" Dad assured him. ""You boys got a world of grass to cut.""""It's a country place, y'all,"" Mom said. ""It's out from town, so it's got all the peace and quiet you'd ever want, and a great big old yard. I can't wait to put in some azaleas. They'll be blooming when Indiana is still up to their eyeballs in snow.""""Nobody knows if the stupid school even has a wrestling team,"" Bud said.""I'm sure if they don't, they have something just as good,"" said Mom. ""They practically invented football down here."" ""I hate football,"" said Bud.""Don't let anybody down here hear you say that,"" Dad said. ""I mean it, Bud.""""Mommy, I'm hungry,"" said Janie. ""Well you weren't twenty minutes ago, when we had lunch."" Mom rattled the Kroger sack. ""What you want, honey? Peanut butter, or there's still one ham and cheese.""""Peanut butter but take off the crust."" ""The crust is the best part,"" said Dad.Dad was not just saying this to make Janie eat the crust. This was the thing about Dad: not only was the crust good enough for Dad, he considered it the best part. He liked the neck of the chicken on Sunday. He liked leftover corn pone with cracklins, served cold, with turnip greens, for breakfast. He liked food that tasted like when he was poor.He squinted into the distance at the long line of cars backed up in our lane - a traffic jam in the middle of nowhere, stretching around the next curve. ""Would you look at this?"" He blew out a sigh as if all these cars had stopped way out here just to get on his nerves. He folded his hands behind his neck, cracked his shoulder joints. ""Come on, people,"" he said, drumming his fingers on the wheel. ""We got miles to go.""We idled behind an old station wagon from Kentucky, overflowing with kids who stuck out their tongues at us and smeared their dirty feet on the windows. You could just smell the misery rolling off that car. The parents were shrunk down in the front seat, ignoring everything to the best of their ability.""Thank God we had just the three,"" said Dad. Mom smiled. ""Amen to that."" ""You guys,"" Bud said. ""Thanks a lot.""""Take a look at that car, boy,"" said Dad. ""That right there is as good an argument for birth control as you'll ever see."" ""Lee.""Janie said, ""What's birth control?"" ""Now see what you started?""""It's a way of making sure you don't take on more than you can handle."" Dad laid his hand on the horn to join the chorus. Across a flat field I saw a column of black smoke rising behind a wall of pines. ""Hey Dad, something's burning.""He looked where I was pointing. ""You know you may be right, it's a durn house afire, and all these people are just rubbernecking."" He pounded the horn. ""Get a move on! Didn't you ever see a fire before?"" The guy with all the children honked too, and waved his fist out the window.That was something large and on fire, sending up rolling clouds of black smoke and flashes of flame. The people in front of us began three-point-turning their cars, driving past us. Mom said, ""Everybody's going the other way.""Dad coasted forward one car length. ""It would take you twice as long, time you went around."" He fiddled with the radio, settling on an old flat-voiced man giving a farm report.""Your soybeans is headed up again, and your cotton holding steady as she goes,"" the man said. ""All you boys out spraying today, this report is brought to you by the good people of TriDex Chemical, We Know What Bugs You.""My father said, ""Hey hey!"" and turned up the volume. ""Listen to that. Just got here and already talking about us on the radio.""""That's a good sign,"" said Mom. ""It's like a welcome. I tell you, Lee, this is all going to work out for the best.""More people were giving up, turning around, heading the other way.We crept around the bend. Now we could see it was not a house burning but something in the road, hidden by the rise just ahead. State trooper cars flashed blue lights. Troopers in wide-brimmed hats waved traffic off the highway.""Heck of an accident,"" Dad said. ""Must be a tanker truck, way it's burning.""""That's cool,"" said Bud. ""It's not 'cool,' Bud,"" Mom said. ""Someone might be hurt."" ""No, but I mean look at it burn,"" Bud said. ""Don't get too close, Daddy. I don't want to see any burned people.""""Don't worry, Janie. Neither do I."" Now we could see it was a tractor-trailer jackknifed, sprawled on its side across both lanes. A crowd of firemen and state troopers stood at a healthy distance, watching the fire- a huge orange toy, broken and burning, pouring fire from the cab and the split-open trailer.Two men in gray uniforms stood off to one side. One of them bent over with his hands on his knees, as if he was about to throw up. It took me a moment to think, Hey I know that guy, and to flash a picture of where I'd seen him: yesterday, closing the doors of the Allied Van Lines truck at our house in Indiana.""Hey Dad,"" I said, ""that's the guy who put our stuff on the truck."" ""What?""""That guy, there! Isn't he the guy from Allied?"" And then it dawned on me why our driver was standing there with those state troopers beside the burning wreck. The wreck was his truck. Our truck.Dad steered the Oldsmobile onto the grassy bank. He switched off the engine, rolled down his window, folded his hands on the wheel. Hot acrid air filled the car. We heard the popping and crackling, the rifle-shot of aerosol cans exploding, a deep monstrous underneath sound, like a beast sucking air.Janie said, ""Why did we stop?"" ""You idiot!"" I cried. ""Don't you get it? That's our stuff!"" ""What do you mean our stuff.""""Children."" I shiver to remember the silvery calm of Mom's voice. ""I don't want to hear another word.""A trooper came bowlegging down the hill toward us. ""Folks,"" he said, ""I'm gone have to ask you-all to just move on along.""My father's neck turned very red, as if he'd been sunburned suddenly. I could not see his face, but the sight of it was enough to back the trooper up a step.""Come on now,"" he said. ""Y'all had your look, let's move on along now.""My father did not speak. He just stared at the man. ""Sir? Maybe you didn't hear what I said.""My mother leaned across the seat. ""Officer, that truck is from Allied Van Lines, isn't it?"" ""Why, yes ma'am, it is.""""Well see, I'm Peggy Musgrove, and this is my husband Lee? And the thing is, I do believe those are our belongings on that truck.""""Hm."" The man's face didn't change. ""Y'all movin' down this way?""""Yes, sir, we were,"" Mom said, in a voice that probably sounded chipper to him, but seemed to me one note short of a scream. ""Well, I hate to be the one to tell you, ma'am, but I don't think you're gone be able to save too much out of that."" He indicated the conflagration with a little wave of his hand, as if maybe we hadn't noticed it. ""Could you ask your husband to come up here and talk to us a minute?""""I don't think he is able, right now,"" Mom said. ""Would it be all right if I came in his place?""Bud opened his door. ""I'll go with you, Mom."" ""Me too,"" I said.""Bud, you come. Daniel, you and Janie stay here with Daddy."" She glanced at her hair in the mirror and got out, smoothing her skirt. I had often seen our mother rise to one occasion or the other, but I've never seen her rise as she rose that afternoon. She marched with Bud up among all those troopers and stood answering their questions as if she had practiced for just such an occasion. . . .'"
"'06-07-23,'0','HOYLAKE, England, July 23 — Tiger Woods won the 135th British Open at Royal Liverpool Golf Club today, outlasting Chris DiMarco by two shots to notch the 11th major title of his career.Woods shot a final-round 67 and finished the championship at 18-under-par 270. DiMarco shot a 68.The victory was Woods’s first since his father, Earl, died on May 3 after a long battle with cancer. When his final putt dropped, Woods cried for several minutes, burying his face into the shoulder of his caddie, Steve Williams, as the applause from the grandstands reverberated on the 18th green.Williams pointed to the sky as Woods walked off the green.“After my last putt, I realized that my dad is never going to see this again,” Woods said.Today’s victory gave Woods back-to-back British Open titles, the first time that feat has been accomplished since Tom Watson won the championship in 1983. It also moved him into a tie with Walter Hagen for the most professional major titles, leaving Woods seven short of the record held by Jack Nicklaus, his childhood hero.Nicklaus and Woods have each won three British Open championships.Woods missed the cut last month at the United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club after a nine-week layoff that included mourning the death of his father, but he finished tied for second two weeks ago at the Western Open and saw his game come together at Royal Liverpool.Despite hitting one driver all week, Woods averaged 291 yards off the tee by hitting low, running long irons. He only missed one fairway in the final round, which he began with a one-shot lead over DiMarco, Ernie Els (71) and Sergio Garcia (73).DiMarco, who dueled with Woods in the final round of the Masters before finishing second, nearly caught him today. Playing one group in front of Woods, DiMarco made birdie on the 198-yard par-3 13th hole to pull within a shot, but Woods answered with three birdies in a row on holes 14, 15 and 16 to maintain his lead.'"

"'06-07-23,'0','Mr. Brown dismissed as preposterous any suggestion that the I.R.S. was soft on rich tax cheats. He said that the money saved by eliminating the estate tax lawyers would be used to hire revenue agents to audit income tax returns, especially those from people making over $1 million.Mr. Brown said that civil service rules barred the estate tax lawyers from moving over to audit income taxes. An I.R.S. spokesman said that the agency had asked for permission to allow such transfers twice, but that the Office of Personnel Management had not responded.Estate tax lawyers are the most productive tax law enforcement personnel at the I.R.S., according to Mr. Brown. For each hour they work, they find an average of $2,200 of taxes that people owe the government.Mr. Brown said that careful analysis showed that the I.R.S. was auditing enough returns to catch cheats and that 10 percent of the estate audits brought in 80 percent of the additional taxes. He said that auditing a greater percentage of gift and estate tax returns would not be worthwhile because “the next case is not a lucrative case” and likely to be of relatively little value.That is a change from six years ago, when the I.R.S. said that 85 percent of large taxable gifts it audited shortchanged the government. The I.R.S. said then that it would hire three more lawyers just to audit taxable gifts of $1 million or more.Over the last five years, officials at both the I.R.S. and the Treasury have told Congress that cheating among the highest-income Americans is a major and growing problem.The six I.R.S. tax lawyers, some of whom were willing to be named, all said that clear evidence of fraud was pursued vigorously by the agency, but that when audits showed the use of complicated schemes to understate the value of assets, the I.R.S. had become increasingly reluctant to pursue cases.The lawyers said that the risk analysis system the I.R.S. used to evaluate whether to pursue such cases gave higher-level officials cover to not pursue tax cheats and, in the process, emboldened the most aggressive tax advisers to prepare gift and estate tax returns that shortchanged the government.“This is not a game the poor will win, but the rich will,” said John Hruska, another I.R.S. estate tax lawyer in New York who, like Ms. Phillips, is active in the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents I.R.S. workers.Colleen M. Kelley, the national union president, said: “If these lawyers are not there to audit the gift and estate tax returns, then a lot of taxes that should be paid will go uncollected, and that impacts every taxpayer who is paying their fair share.”'"
"'06-07-23,'0','The original version of the Senate bill would have expanded drilling in an area known as Lease Sale 181 to 2.9 million acres, about 900,000 acres more than the administration was planning to offer for lease.But the new bill, introduced Thursday night, would open an additional 5.7 million acres, mostly in deep waters. Supporters say the area could produce 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to satisfy a quarter of the nation’s electricity needs for a year, and 1.26 billion barrels of oil, enough to satisfy the national demand for about two months.The final version also includes several new components to placate lawmakers from Florida, who wanted wider protections around the state shoreline, and to assuage gulf state lawmakers, who demanded a cut of royalties generated by any new energy development. The bill places a moratorium on drilling in waters from 125 miles to 234 miles off Florida’s gulf coast until 2022. The earlier version had set a 100-mile limit.The bill also creates a revenue-sharing plan that would give Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana 37.5 percent of the royalties from new areas of production and from new leases in existing areas. Currently, the federal government keeps all royalties beyond those generated by drilling within three miles of a state’s coastline.Negotiators did not accommodate a request from Alaska’s senators, who wanted to include the same revenue sharing formula for their state. Despite projected large volumes of energy resources in Alaskan waters, Senate negotiators said that keeping the bill narrowly focused on the gulf would enhance its chances of passage.The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the energy production from the areas designated by the final bill would generate royalties of $1.55 billion in the first 10 years.Opponents argue that the concession to Florida puts energy-rich waters off limits and that the revenue-sharing plan is ill advised at a time federal deficits remain uncomfortably high, about $300 billion.“This is bad fiscal policy for the country,” said Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the ranking Democrat on the energy committee. “It is starting us down the road of ceding to coastal states revenues from off-shore drilling at a time the government needs all the revenues it can get, given the size of the deficit.”Democratic senators said Friday that they would try to add a conservation component to the bill. Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, who with Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, introduced a bipartisan bill this week intended to improve fuel efficiency standards for cars, said he would try to attach his effort to Mr. Domenici’s as an amendment.“It’s time we get beyond this false either-or debate that says we must either drill more or stop using fossil fuels entirely,” Mr. Obama said. “The only way to achieve energy security is to promote a balanced approach that addresses both production and efficiency.”'"
"'06-07-23,'0','Academic freedom means that if I think that there may be an intellectual payoff to be had by turning an academic lens on material others consider trivial — golf tees, gourmet coffee, lingerie ads, convenience stores, street names, whatever — I should get a chance to try. If I manage to demonstrate to my peers and students that studying this material yields insights into matters of general intellectual interest, there is a new topic under the academic sun and a new subject for classroom discussion.In short, whether something is an appropriate object of academic study is a matter not of its content — a crackpot theory may have had a history of influence that well rewards scholarly scrutiny — but of its availability to serious analysis. This point was missed by the author of a comment posted to the blog of a University of Wisconsin law professor, Ann Althouse: “When is the University of Wisconsin hiring a professor of astrology?” The question is obviously sarcastic; its intention is to equate the 9/11-inside-job theory with believing in the predictive power of astrology, and to imply that since the university wouldn’t think of hiring someone to teach the one, it should have known better than to hire someone to teach the other.But the truth is that it would not be at all outlandish for a university to hire someone to teach astrology — not to profess astrology and recommend it as the basis of decision-making (shades of Nancy Reagan), but to teach the history of its very long career. There is, after all, a good argument for saying that Shakespeare, Chaucer and Dante, among others, cannot be fully understood unless one understands astrology.The distinction I am making — between studying astrology and proselytizing for it — is crucial and can be generalized; it shows us where the line between the responsible and irresponsible practice of academic freedom should always be drawn. Any idea can be brought into the classroom if the point is to inquire into its structure, history, influence and so forth. But no idea belongs in the classroom if the point of introducing it is to recruit your students for the political agenda it may be thought to imply.And this is where we come back to Mr. Barrett, who, in addition to being a college lecturer, is a member of a group calling itself Scholars for 9/11 Truth, an organization with the decidedly political agenda of persuading Americans that the Bush administration “not only permitted 9/11 to happen but may even have orchestrated these events.”Is the fact of this group’s growing presence on the Internet a reason for studying it in a course on 9/11? Sure. Is the instructor who discusses the group’s arguments thereby endorsing them? Not at all. It is perfectly possible to teach a viewpoint without embracing it and urging it. But the moment a professor does embrace and urge it, academic study has ceased and been replaced by partisan advocacy. And that is a moment no college administration should allow to occur.Provost Farrell doesn’t quite see it that way, because he is too hung up on questions of content and balance. He thinks that the important thing is to assure a diversity of views in the classroom, and so he is reassured when Mr. Barrett promises to surround his “unconventional” ideas and “personal opinions” with readings “representing a variety of viewpoints.”But the number of viewpoints Mr. Barrett presents to his students is not the measure of his responsibility. There is, in fact, no academic requirement to include more than one view of an academic issue, although it is usually pedagogically useful to do so. The true requirement is that no matter how many (or few) views are presented to the students, they should be offered as objects of analysis rather than as candidates for allegiance.There is a world of difference, for example, between surveying the pro and con arguments about the Iraq war, a perfectly appropriate academic assignment, and pressing students to come down on your side. Of course the instructor who presides over such a survey is likely to be a partisan of one position or the other — after all, who doesn’t have an opinion on the Iraq war? — but it is part of a teacher’s job to set personal conviction aside for the hour or two when a class is in session and allow the techniques and protocols of academic research full sway.This restraint should not be too difficult to exercise. After all, we require and expect it of judges, referees and reporters. And while its exercise may not always be total, it is both important and possible to make the effort.Thus the question Provost Farrell should put to Mr. Barrett is not “Do you hold these views?” (he can hold any views he likes) or “Do you proclaim them in public?” (he has that right no less that the rest of us) or even “Do you surround them with the views of others?”Rather, the question should be: “Do you separate yourself from your partisan identity when you are in the employ of the citizens of Wisconsin and teach subject matter — whatever it is — rather than urge political action?” If the answer is yes, allowing Mr. Barrett to remain in the classroom is warranted. If the answer is no, (or if a yes answer is followed by classroom behavior that contradicts it) he should be shown the door. Not because he would be teaching the “wrong” things, but because he would have abandoned teaching for indoctrination.The advantage of this way of thinking about the issue is that it outflanks the sloganeering and posturing both sides indulge in: on the one hand, faculty members who shout “academic freedom” and mean by it an instructor’s right to say or advocate anything at all with impunity; on the other hand, state legislators who shout “not on our dime” and mean by it that they can tell academics what ideas they can and cannot bring into the classroom.All you have to do is remember that academic freedom is just that: the freedom to do an academic job without external interference. It is not the freedom to do other jobs, jobs you are neither trained for nor paid to perform. While there should be no restrictions on what can be taught — no list of interdicted ideas or topics — there should be an absolute restriction on appropriating the scene of teaching for partisan political ideals. Teachers who use the classroom to indoctrinate make the enterprise of higher education vulnerable to its critics and shortchange students in the guise of showing them the true way.'"

The Yonkers City Council and Greenburgh Town Board support this alternative, and Bruce Ratner, the developer, has agreed to doubly replace the 1.6 acres of parkland needed for the ramps and to pay $10 million for their construction.The county suggested that the ramps also serve recreational purposes, so we have combined this request with a previous plan for recreational boating on the unused reservoir.

"'06-07-23,'0','IF you doubt that the major labels have surrendered to the independents the adventure of recording great musicians in contemporary works, here is proof: The Juilliard String Quartet, for decades a mainstay of the CBS (later Sony) roster turns up on Bridge with three durable scores for quartet and voice. The ensemble and the soprano Benita Valente, who sings here, gave the premieres of all three, and they perform them with the authority and nuance of long acquaintance.The earliest, Ginastera’s 1973 String Quartet No. 3, shows this Argentine composer in what he called his neo-expressionist style, his enchantment with his country’s folk music well behind him. His string writing is abstract, densely chromatic and tactile, yet texts have a way of nudging the shape of a vocal line and Ginastera’s settings of Spanish poets, including García Lorca, take on an Iberian lilt.John Harbison’s setting of Willam Carlos Williams poetry in “The Rewaking” (1991) creates an atmosphere of disquieting beauty by darting freely from Dvorakian Romanticism to contemporary angularity. Between those extremes is old-fashioned tone painting: Williams’s “Woodthrush” and “To a Woodpecker” are flecked with string lines based on bird calls, and the title song uses violent figuration to describe a storm. The vocal settings, though chromatic, are islands of calm.Richard Wernick’s String Quartet No. 5 (1995), a memorial to the assassinated Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, frames two angry, passionate quartet movements with pained settings of short, searing poems by the Zionist poet Hannah Senesh, in English translations from the Hebrew.Ms. Valente’s vibrato is wider now than it was, but she conveys these texts with an irresistible directness, a quality matched by the Juilliard players’ probing renderings. ALLAN KOZINNMENDELSSOHN’S piano trios have become so ubiquitous that it can be as hard for listeners to know what to hope for in a new recording as it must be for performers to figure out what to offer.The shelves groan with riches. One approach puts a premium on elegance: the 1927 reading of the D minor Trio (Op. 49) by Alfred Cortot, Jacques Thibaud and Pablo Casals (reissued in 2002 by Naxos), for example, or the versions by the various incarnations of the Beaux Arts Trio. Others, like the Istomin-Stern-Rose Trio in the 1960’s and 70’s and, more recently, the pianist Martha Argerich with the violinist Renaud Capuçon and the cellist Gautier Capuçon, take a zestier, more free-spirited view.The three superb musicians on this new recording, all in their 20’s, face the hefty competition easily by playing with an irresistible spontaneity best heard in the scherzos, where — even in the more troubled C minor Trio (Op. 66) — they momentarily evoke the trim sprightliness of a much younger Mendelssohn. They approach these works as interior high dramas, contests between melancholy and ecstasy. And if the passion in their playing puts them closer to Istomin-Stern-Rose than to Cortot and company, they also play with an unassailable precision.Nor does this ensemble lack elegance. Julia Fischer’s violin lines, though hard-driven in the outer movements, also convey warmth and shapeliness in the music’s quietly intense passages: the almost prayerful slow movements, for example, or parts of the C minor Trio’s finale. Daniel Müller-Schott’s cello playing matches those extremes and adds an engaging lugubriousness when Mendelssohn seems to invite it, as in the opening bars of the D minor Trio. And Jonathan Gilad’s piano, woven beautifully into the texture, has a bright sparkle of a sort that other recordings of these works don’t quite match. ALLAN KOZINN'"
"'06-07-23,'0','HOME buyers often engage in a nerve-racking game of chicken when they sign a contract to buy a new house before their old one has sold. And while most of these deals work out, buyers sometimes have to take out what are known as bridge loans so that they can raise enough cash to buy the new place.“Over the past six months or so, it looks as though a lot of people went out and signed contracts to buy houses thinking they would quickly sell the home they are living in,” said Bob Moulton, the president of the Americana Mortgage Group, a brokerage firm in Manhasset, N.Y. “Now they’re realizing either that they can’t sell the house so quickly or that they can’t get the price they were hoping for.”As a result, “bridge loans are very popular right now,’’ he said.Michael Sahn, a real estate lawyer in Uniondale, N.Y., said most contracts do not make the purchase of the new house contingent upon the sale of the old one. In other words, the buyer must go through with the purchase even if the current house does not sell.At the same time, he said, most contracts do specify that if the buyer backs out of the deal, he or she will forfeit the deposit made when the contract is signed, usually 10 percent of the purchase price.“And that’s not all you lose,” Mr. Sahn said, ticking off a list: money spent on the home inspection, title search, survey and legal services.'"

"'06-07-23,'0','But he and some top American lawmakers said they saw no role for American troops in such a force.NATO officials in Brussels reacted with concern to the talk of so substantial and delicate a new mission. NATO troops are already stretched thin in Afghanistan, and they face fresh demands to send troops to the troubled Darfur region of Sudan. That raised questions about the practicability of a NATO option for Lebanon.Mr. Peretz said Israel would support an international force so long as it had a more muscular mandate than that of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or Unifil. Its 2,000-member contingent has been completely bypassed by the warring parties in the latest fighting and is widely seen as ineffectual.""We have had this very, very miserable example of Unifil, which was not able to stop Hezbollah,"" Ambassador Daniel Ayalon of Israel said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. ""We would like to see an effective force which has some capabilities to defend itself and also to bring law and order.""Mr. Ayalon also said Israel had no intention of remaining in Lebanon once its current operation concludes. ""What we’re doing now inside of Lebanon is really mopping up,"" he said. ""It’s going to be in-and-out operations, and we’re not going to stay in Lebanon, not at all.""In Beirut, Prime Minister Fouad Siniora played down the talk of a multinational force, saying, ""I think it’s very early to talk about this matter."" Lebanon’s ultimate objective, he said, was to control all its territory without outside help.The NATO idea drew cautious support from two senior American lawmakers.Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that while the composition of a multinational force would have to be discussed, ""certainly, the nomination by Israel of NATO is as good as any.""Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of Mr. Lugar’s committee, said that while a peacekeeping force made sense, ""this would be a huge mistake to have U.S. forces on the ground in Lebanon.""Mr. Bolton did not entirely rule out a possible American role in such a force, but said, ""We have not contemplated the notion of American troops in Lebanon for that kind of mission.""Like many other Americans, Mr. Bolton said, he has a clear memory of the October 1983 truck-bomb attack on a United States Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241 people and led to the withdrawal of international peacekeepers stationed there after the Israeli invasion of 1982.Whatever was done to bring peace in southern Lebanon, Mr. Bolton said, it must be conducive to a lasting solution — a point made repeatedly by Ms. Rice.Mr. Bolton brushed aside reports that Syria was prepared to talk with the United States.""I suppose it’s better than nothing,"" Mr. Bolton told “Fox News Sunday.” But he said that what Syria needed to do first was to press Hezbollah to release the two Israeli soldiers whose capture touched off the hostilities, and to stop firing rockets into Israel. ""Syria, along with Iran, is really part of the problem here,"" he said.The Bush administration has been loath to engage Syria and Iran directly regarding the Lebanon crisis, viewing them as deeply unhelpful actors in the region.Senator Dodd criticized what he called ""this sort of juvenile attitude that we’re not going to talk to people we disagree with.""While most American lawmakers have supported Israel, Mr. Dodd said he believed that it might now be going too far in Lebanon.""They’re now radicalizing Lebanon"" and areas beyond, he said. ""That is dangerous for Israel.""Meantime, the official NATO response to a possible role in Lebanon was measured, but unofficially, several officials said expressed serious reservations.""There has been no political discussion about the alliance’s role in the crisis,"" a NATO spokesman, James Appaturai, said.Unofficially, the Israeli suggestion caught NATO by surprise. When the alliance’s secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Sheffer, spoke last week with Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, there was no mention of a NATO role, diplomats said.""We got the distinct impression that the U.N. would be prepared to adapt its mandate, making it more robust,"" said a NATO diplomat who insisted on anonymity because the issue was so sensitive among all 26 member nations.""We wonder why Peretz raised the idea now,” the diplomat said.Any NATO role would need an official request from both the Israeli and Lebanese governments. Such a request would put NATO under considerable pressure to agree, provided it operated under a United Nations mandate, with a clearly defined role and duration.Even then, some alliance members would resist such a mission.France, which has historically close ties to Lebanon and its region, would oppose NATO assuming a big role there, particularly along the Israeli-Lebanese border, according to NATO officials.France had opposed but failed to stop NATO from expanding ""out of area"" beyond its historic base of Europe, to Afghanistan in 2002, to Sudan, where it is involved in airlift operations, and to Iraq, where it is training military officers. France sees these developments as turning NATO into a tool of convenience for the United States.Germany, too, would be reluctant to join the force because of the special relationship it has forged with Israel in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust.This would place Germany in a difficult situation if caught in crossfire between Hezbollah and Israeli troops.Chancellor Angela Merkel, asked on the German television channel ZDF about taking part in such a mission, replied: ""At the moment, it is not on the agenda.""NATO would face difficult decisions over which countries would provide the troops and equipment. It estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 troops would be required.Britain is already committed to Iraq and now commands the new NATO mission in southern Afghanistan, where it has sent 5,000 troops. By September, Mr. de Hoop Scheffer said, total NATO forces in Afghanistan could reach 18,000.And for NATO to send troops to Lebanon would likely mean rejecting the United Nations request for about 7,000 highly trained and mobile troops to help stop the fighting in Darfur, a NATO official said.'"

Note the use of “we.” I had already crossed a line there, I suppose, throwing off the mantle of authority. I was just one of the gang. How could I possibly use my position to harass anyone?The next week, as the students filed in and found their seats, I was at the blackboard writing “Be Specific” and “Show, Don’t tell,” followed by “Why is this night different from all others?” (I liked this one, using the Passover question in a Jesuit university. I like to mix things up. Some people might say I have a boundary problem.)When I turned around, there he was in the front row. He looked as if he’d walked out of the 1940’s — there was something about his face, haircut and lack of fashion that bespoke an earlier era. I gasped. Then I recovered and asked, “Where did you come from?”He explained that he’d signed up for the class but got lost last week. We were in a basement, after all. He kept smiling at me, and I felt a rush of pleasure. I was wearing my favorite red plaid skirt, and I was glad of that. And I found myself laughing a little louder, making jokes, telling stories about my former life in Hollywood and Los Angeles, dropping references about how I was divorced, single.You’ll have to stay after class,” I told him and paused, then added, “Not because you’ve been bad!” I found myself constantly playing up the student-teacher relationship, pointing out and then making fun of the silliness of the power politics when it comes to teaching adult students. “I have to tell you what you missed,” I explained, smiling.“Of course,” he said, putting on a serious face. But I knew. And he knew. We were already playing at roles.“O.K., class, let’s discuss how to write an expository essay,” I began in an effort to sound professorial, but in truth I was in performance mode.I exaggerated my valley girl accent in an effort to seem exotic to the Fairfield County preppies, even though I really was one of them, having grown up in Stamford.After class I learned that he, too, was divorced and was returning to school for his B.A. He said he was interested in science and was taking this class to help him write reports. I should have told him right then to run, to flee, to find another class. I knew nothing about those logical things: supporting arguments, compare and contrast, footnotes, the Chicago Manual of Style. I was all right brain, intuitive and circuitous, and anything I had to teach him about writing would do him no good in the sciences. But of course I didn’t tell him any of that. I told him about the first assignment, which was to write an essay about an ordinary event in your life.He wrote about buying a chicken at Stop & Shop. I read his essay one morning in bed, drinking coffee, surrounded by student papers. His essay stood out for its simplicity, honesty and attention to detail. “Chickens were on sale today for 69 cents a pound,” he wrote, “and I decided to buy tomatoes and onions and a 2-pound chicken, which I planned to brown and then stew.”I never paid attention to what chicken cost per pound. When I bought a chicken, I simply bought a chicken. Here was a man who not only knew how much chicken cost but was also a wonderful writer. And his essay provided a recipe for chicken stew.I read it again. After I finished, I thought about the fact that I had very little money, a daughter who depended on me, no guarantee of teaching work next semester and a mother in the hospital anticipating surgery the next day. But for some reason, knowing that this man, my student, paid close attention to the price of chicken made me feel better about being in this world.Midway through the semester he asked me what the rules are when it comes to the semicolon.“What do you mean?” I asked, smiling, stalling for time.“I don’t know what it’s for. It confuses me.”“Well, the semicolon is tricky,” I said. I had no idea how to use a semicolon. “Actually I think it’s best to avoid it at all costs. It will only get you into trouble.”But after class he persisted. He looked at me with eyes so brown they were almost black. He was wearing a black T-shirt and black jeans, and he told me he had recently taken a job as a short-order cook at Friendly’s and was also working in a gas station on weekends to pay his way through college. He liked to fish and planned to study marine biology, and as he leaned into me he told me he really wanted to understand how to use the semicolon.“I’m actually not sure,” I told him. “But I’ll find out for you.”THAT night I read in “Woe Is I” by Patricia T. O’Conner that the semicolon is like a blinking yellow light between two connected but independent sentences. You read through the first sentence, but before going to the next, the semicolon warns you to slow down and look both ways.I told this to my student, and he seemed pleased. Not just pleased with the information but with the fact that I had looked it up just for him. I suspect he also must have been pleased about the meaning itself, about proceeding with caution, because that’s how he and I proceeded in whatever it was we were or weren’t doing. For me, being in his presence but not being able to act on my feelings or ask him about his was heated and excruciating.I finished out that semester with my professionalism intact only to have him sign up the next term for my creative writing course, where our noncourtship continued. Over the summer he enrolled in my private writing workshop, and after that he left for college 45 minutes away at Wesleyan, where he spent the next few years completing his B.A. in geology and earning a master’s.All the while we circled around each other, talking late at night on the phone, discussing lovers past and present, revealing childhood secrets, sometimes going out to the movies or to dinner. But we remained completely platonic. As it turned out, he was not younger than I but two years older, yet he still felt like my student.Then one night after we’d had dinner, four years after we started our tantalizing dance, he hugged me, and something shifted. A week later, he took me fishing, and we actually caught a trout. He brought a bottle of Champagne back to my place “to cook the trout in,” but of course we drank it instead. And at the kitchen sink, where I was washing the dinner dishes, he came up from behind and kissed me. And suddenly, just like in the movies, we were sliding along the counter with pots and pans tumbling and dishes crashing until we found ourselves in the living room on the big leather chair that had been given to me by a friend who’d found success in Hollywood and felt sorry for me — poor single-mom adjunct professor back in Connecticut.By then I knew the rules of grammar all too well, or at least I knew the rule about the semicolon. My student and I had minded the semicolon and proceeded from the first sentence of our relationship to the second with greater caution than surely any semicolon in history had ever required. But my daughter had left for Los Angeles to spend time with her father. A year earlier my mother had died. There wasn’t a single semicolon or any other punctuation to delay us, so my student and I proceeded quickly.And now we are married.'"

"'06-07-24,'1','“Unless we figure out how to move forward from here, we will have missed a unique opportunity to help developing countries and to spur economic growth,” Ms. Schwab said. “There was no package on the table that we could have recommended to the President or to the United States Congress.”Ms. Schwab and Mr. Johanns said that they came to Geneva prepared to make further concessions on agriculture tariffs and what are called trade-distorting subsidies, which protect farmers from overseas competition, but they said that the European Union and some developing countries failed to make similar offers.Ms. Schwab said in a telephone conference call with reporters that when American officials added up the latest European market-access proposals for farm products, “it became quite clear that there was no there there.”Mr. Johanns added: “There are no negotiations planned in the future. This round has been suspended.”But European negotiators declared that it was the United States that had been intransigent. They said that the Americans failed to recognize that the European Union had gone through a series of painful cuts in tariffs and subsidies for their own farmers, and had not matched those steps with fresh concessions.“Unfortunately the Americans were not able or willing to do their part,” said Peter Mandelson, the chief European Union negotiator. “They preferred to stand still.”The latest round of global trade negotiations has been sputtering almost since it was begun in 2001 in the city of Doha in Qatar. At the outset, negotiators were hoping to make the talks a centerpiece of the wealthy industrial countries’ commitment to helping the poor countries of the world expand their exports.The talks became known as the “Doha Development Round” because of their focus on alleviating poverty in countries with goods to sell to Europe, the United States and other wealthy parts of the world. In all, 149 countries were involved in the negotiations, but they tended to be break into blocs of countries with similar interests.In theory, the wealthy countries were hoping to gain greater access to poorer countries for their manufactured goods and some services, like insurance, in exchange for allowing the poorer countries to export more easily to them.But the talks foundered over barriers to agricultural trade, not only in Europe and the United States but also among the “top tier” of advanced developing countries, like India and Brazil, which have resisted farm imports because of widespread disquiet among their farmers. This summer, for example, some Indian farmers have publicly committed suicide over their inability to sell their produce at high prices.Most of the tension was was between Europe and the United States, however. Last October, the Bush administration proposed a sweeping set of cuts in both tariffs and subsidies and called on the Europeans to do the same. The Europeans responded with a package of cuts that the United States deemed insufficient.Trade deals have a history of rough going in Congress, and the Bush administration concluded that it could not get approval for a trade deal unless American farmers could be certain that they could win much greater access for their products in Europe and in India, China and other countries.The United States offered to cut spending on farm subsidies to $19.7 billion from $47.9 billion now. But European officialss said that those figures were misleading and that the United States offer was actually much smaller than that.President Jacques Chirac of France said about a week ago that the European would not consider further concessions unless the United States agreed to still deeper cuts in farm subsidies.After the Group of 8 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia, Mr. Lamy held what American officials said was a “confessional” round of talks, in which he asked each party to “confess” privately what it would offer hypothetically if other parties were more forthcoming in their concessions.The Bush administration was stymied, American officials acknowledged, because the farm bloc in the United States had become so distrustful of other nations’ protectionist practices that they told American officials they could not support a trade deal that did not win them much greater market access.In June, 57 senators from both parties wrote to President Bush, demanding that the United States make no further offers to lower American barriers until further changes came from Europe.“An unbalanced proposal that asks U.S. agriculture and rural communities to give more while getting less in market access is unacceptable,” the senators said.Trade officials said these letters reflected the political reality in the United States: that a trade deal would not be approved by lawmakers if it was what they called a “Doha lite” accord, with only limited lowering of barriers on all sides.Ms. Schwab said today that despite those political constraints, she and Mr. Johanns came to Geneva over the weekend and told Mr. Lamy privately what the United States would do if the Europeans were more forthcoming.Though only Mr. Lamy knew all the details of what the United States and the Europeans had offered, Ms. Schwab said, it was clear that the gap between the two sides was so great that continuing the talks would be futile.“When we talked to Lamy yesterday, as things started getting pretty rocky, he acknowledged that it would not be useful for the U.S. to put its flexibilities on the table at this point, because they would be pocketed and there would not be convergence,” Ms. Schwab said.'"
"'06-07-24,'1','Three officers were grazed by bullets yesterday morning, when the police fired more than two dozen shots at a pit bull that had locked its jaws around a fourth officer’s leg in a Bronx building, the authorities said yesterday.In all, the police fired 26 bullets at Red, the pit bull, during a confrontation inside a fourth-floor hallway at 480 Concord Avenue, in the Port Morris neighborhood, about 12:10 a.m. Nine shots hit the dog, according to its owner, Theresa Franco, and a number of errant bullets grazed the officers in the leg, the police said.Red, who was 12 years old and weighed about 45 pounds, died at the scene, while the four injured officers were listed in stable condition at Lincoln Hospital.Five officers were on the fourth floor at the time of the shooting, trying to mediate a dispute between a resident and the superintendent, when they came upon the pit bull outside Ms. Franco’s apartment, the police said. The narrow hallway was dimly lighted and the dog seemed agitated, witnesses said. Suddenly, the dog charged one of the officers and bit his leg, the police said. Gunfire erupted and within seconds, the three officers were hit and the dog was dead.The officers, who were from the 40th Precinct, were not identified.

"'06-07-24,'1','Woods’s victory gave him back-to-back British Open titles, a feat last accomplished by Tom Watson at Royal Birkdale in 1983. He earned roughly $1.34 million.Woods said this claret jug meant more than his previous two. Woods said he had wanted to win the Masters in April because his father’s health was fading. Earlier this year, Woods flew to California from Florida several times to be with his father, including in March during his preparation for the Players Championship.“To win your first tournament after my father had passed away, it makes it that much more special,” Woods said.Woods’s first chance to dedicate a victory to his father’s memory came at the United States Open at Winged Foot Golf Club last month, but he missed the cut after a nine-week layoff. After a second-place finish at the Western Open two weeks ago, though, Woods brought an efficient strategy to Royal Liverpool, which was host to its first British Open since 1967.With the course playing short in a warm, dry summer, Woods used his driver only once in 72 holes, relying on long irons to guide him around in 18-under-par 270.On Sunday, he missed just one fairway, pulling away from his playing partner, Sergio García, who shot a final-round 73 in his latest miss in trying to win his first major.“It’s a shame,” García said. “That’s the way it goes sometimes. I didn’t play the way I should have.”DiMarco, also in search of his first major, nearly chased down Woods while playing in the group in front, but his every move was followed by an answer from Woods.DiMarco pulled to a shot behind the lead after he birdied No. 13 and Woods bogeyed No. 12. But Woods reeled off three birdies in a row, making an 8-footer on No. 14, a 10-footer on No. 15 and a 30-footer on No. 16.“He just kept putting pressure on me,” Woods said of DiMarco. “I just had to continue to try to be patient, make birdies whenever I could. Whatever I do, just don’t drop a shot and give him any momentum.”When the two players met in the scorer’s hut, DiMarco said, “Hey, Tiger, would you just give me a little chance for once?” Both players laughed.They took turns praising each other after the tournament, and during the trophy presentation Woods acknowledged the death of DiMarco’s mother, Norma, on July 4.“Everyone sends their best to your family,” Woods told DiMarco. When Woods saw DiMarco’s father, Rich, after the round, he patted him on the back.DiMarco said, “I know my mom would be very proud of me right now.”Like DiMarco, Els tried to pressure Woods, but he also failed to find a formula to take him down. Woods, who led DiMarco, Els and García by one stroke entering Sunday, is now 11 for 11 when holding the lead after 54 holes in majors.Hank Haney, Woods’s swing coach, said Woods’s plan to hit 2-irons off the tees was hatched the Saturday before the tournament began, when Woods realized during a practice round that his driver might put him in jeopardy.“It took him two holes, and he could see the theme of the course,” Haney said. “Bunkers on each side and every one looks the same.”In hitting his targets Sunday, Woods looked nothing like the golfer who shot 76 in each of his two rounds at Winged Foot. Haney said all Woods needed was time.“No one wanted to give him a chance to put his feet back on the ground,” he said.At Royal Liverpool, Woods played with poise and confidence to hold off a leader board thick with talent and increase his distance from the world’s No. 2 player, Phil Mickelson.When the last of his rivals could no longer threaten him, Woods only had to sort out the details of his walk, between ropes lined with fans in an old seaside neighborhood. As the applause washed over him, Woods’s stoic mien slowly gave way after he made his final stroke.It was 6:15 p.m. on the Wirral Peninsula, and a champion had come home.'"
"'06-07-24,'1','“This time of year,” Torre said, “you’re certainly going to go with people that have been consistent for you.”The fifth starter has been consistently awful in July. Three pitchers have taken a turn in the role: Shawn Chacon, Kris Wilson and Ponson, all of whom pitched Sunday.In the four starts those pitchers have made this month, they have allowed 20 earned runs in 13 innings for a 13.85 earned run average. Ponson, at least, pitched into the seventh inning last Tuesday, making his struggle Sunday a major letdown.Because of visa problems, Ponson did not arrive in Canada until 3 a.m. Saturday. But Ponson said his schedule was irrelevant. Pitch location ruined his day.Catcher Jorge Posada said that no matter what he called, Ponson’s pitches seemed to do the opposite. Ponson allowed six runs, five hits and three walks, leaving with one out in the third. He struck out five.“Posada was asking for fastballs down and away, and I threw it right down the middle,” Ponson said. “He’s asking for inside, and my ball’s just cutting right down the middle. Especially with that team over there, if you throw it down the middle, they’re going to hit it hard.”The Yankees have three more series with the Blue Jays, who are two games behind them in the American League East. The Boston Red Sox are in first place by two and a half games over the Yankees.From the moment third baseman Alex Rodriguez threw wildly to the plate Thursday, the Blue Jays never seemed to stop hitting. At the time, the Yankees had a 3-0 lead against the Toronto ace Roy Halladay with their own ace, Mike Mussina, on the mound.But the Blue Jays came back to win that game, and they took three of four in the series. The Yankees helped revive a division rival at a critical time.“We had to play well here,” said John Gibbons, the Blue Jays’ manager. “We were on the edge of hanging in there or disappearing.”Toronto is in the thick of it now, led by a deep lineup. Yankees starters had a 9.50 earned run average in the series, blowing leads in two losses. But center fielder Johnny Damon said he still believed his Yankees were the front-runners.“I feel like we are,” he said. “Granted, we got our brains beat in here, but it is a much-improved Toronto Blue Jays team. They’re especially tough playing here. We just need to be better, and we weren’t as good as we should have been on this trip. But all in all, I think we’re going to be the team that pulls through this.”On Sunday, the Yankees took a 3-2 lead in the third when Posada crushed a three-run homer into a luxury box near the right-field foul pole. But the Blue Jays homered three times in the bottom of the inning, piling up eight runs.It was 4-3 when Ponson left the game, and Torre called for Wilson, a right-hander, to face the left-handed Eric Hinske. On Wilson’s second pitch, Hinske hit a three-run homer.Asked why he did not use the left-hander Ron Villone to face Hinske, Torre said: “I’d rather have the other pitchers try to get through the early innings. The pressure innings are where I want Villone — the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth. We couldn’t make it through the third.”It was 10-3 after the third, and when the game finally ended, the Yankees were relieved to look ahead to their next series, at the Texas Rangers. Their starter Monday is Randy Johnson, Posada noted, and the Yankees must trust in him.“You never look back; it’s as simple as that,” Posada said. “You’ve got to keep trying to find a way to stay positive.”That made sense after a game that offered nothing encouraging.Alex Rodriguez is hitless in 10 at-bats since connecting for his 450th career homer and 2,000th career hit Friday. Rodriguez returned to third base Sunday and handled the only ball hit to him, throwing to second for a forceout in the second inning. Now he heads to Arlington, Tex., where he played for three seasons and has a .331 career average. “I don’t want to jinx myself,” Rodriguez said, “but I’ve enjoyed hitting there.” ... Joe Torre said he would speak with General Manager Brian Cashman about promoting a pitcher from the minors. T. J. Beam and Matt Smith are among the candidates. ... Though the Yankees have struggled to find starters in trade talks, Washington is willing to make deals. Nationals starter Ramón Ortiz has a 3.34 earned run average in his past five starts, and Tony Armas Jr. pitched well Sunday. ... Hideki MaTSui (broken left wrist) took 75 swings off a tee Sunday at the Yankees’ complex in Tampa, Fla.'"

"'06-07-24,'1','COOPERSTOWN, N.Y., July 23 — When opera stands in for narrative fiction, one means of transmission is substituted for another. Think of Guy de Maupassant’s “Boule de Suif” as an e-mail message. Every picture, every gesture and every word is laid out in the writer’s fixed space. Readers take the materials and imagine them as they will.Think of “The Greater Good, or the Passion of Boule de Suif” — Stephen Hartke’s resetting of 19th-century French storytelling onto the 21st-century opera stage — more as a telephone call. What holds our attention is the emotional tone of the caller, the resonance of the voice, the smoothness of the delivery and the quality of the reception. Opera is both concrete (directors, lighting people and costumers tell us what to see) and ephemeral (there is no narrator, no paternal voice to sort out what we are seeing).Mr. Hartke’s opera with a libretto by Philip Littell had its premiere at the Glimmerglass Opera on a wet Saturday night. Its jobs were to make Maupassant’s wicked portraits of the French bourgeoisie as real as we could imagine them for ourselves, and to find another kind of narrator. Language tells stories in one way, music and stage pictures in another. One medium must be torn down and another built on top of its ruins.Maupassant’s setting is the 1870’s and France’s ill-conceived and disastrous Franco-Prussian War. Nine of his characters are specimens of an affluent middle class fleeing Germans with their assets in tow. A fellow traveler is a prostitute nicknamed Boule de Suif (loosely translated as Butterball) and illustrious among the male population of Rouen. She is good, generous and reviled by the others. For the greater good she gives herself to a German officer, her fee the safe passage of all. Good works are rewarded with added contempt. Maupassant, like his patron and friend Flaubert, loathed the provincial city that produced both writers.Mr. Hartke brings some deft tone painting to his work. There are the physical touches. Soupspoons clang harmoniously at dinner. From the orchestra pit carriage wheels grate and groan as they overcome inertia; ostinatos remind us of bouncing progress over bad roads. As Boule de Suif renders her services to the German commandant upstairs, bedsprings squeak endearingly.'"

"'06-07-24,'1','“There certainly was never a desire on the part of the company to drive Alison out,” Mr. Kubovy said. “We worked long and hard to keep Alison with us.”Ms. Chase spoke out in several telephone interviews from her home in Brooksville, Me., just as Pilobolus was celebrating the 35th anniversary with its premier engagement: a four-week season at the Joyce where “Ben’s Admonition” is being performed through Aug. 12. She said that she wanted to make the point that artists own their work.Despite the separation from Ms. Chase, Pilobolus — one of the world’s best-known modern-dance companies with its mingling of mime, dance, acrobatics and showmanship — said it was thriving financially and artistically, with expanded educational services, more touring and more commissions.Ms. Chase choreographed five pieces, alone or in collaboration, appearing on this season’s Joyce programs. She said that she asked the company not to perform the works and to “dare to tell the world what you’ve done to the mother of Pilobolus.”Mr. Kubovy declined. “She does not own that work,” he said, “nor does she have the right to decide whether or not we perform it.”Ms. Chase’s departure, the latest chapter in the Pilobolus family saga, provides an unusual glimpse into behind-the-curtain politics at a collaborative dance company founded on utopian principles in the spirit of the 1960’s. The dispute has split current and former trustees and company members. But it is also connected to the sticky business of deciding who controls the rights to a piece of choreography.The biggest recent example is the legal dispute over the rights to Martha Graham’s work. Ron Protas, her legal heir, has waged a long and unsuccessful battle to gain the rights, but courts have ruled that the Martha Graham Center owns most of the dances, because she either assigned it the rights or choreographed the dances as “works for hire.” In a different model, a trust controls the rights to George Balanchine’s works.But Pilobolus is different from a company dominated by one towering personality.Named after a fungus, it grew out of Ms. Chase’s dance class. Four men inspired by her instruction — Jonathan Wolken, Lee Harris, Moses Pendleton and Robby Barnett — formed a company in 1971, and Ms. Chase joined in 1973. Michael Tracy came aboard shortly after. The company set up shop in Washington Depot, Conn., in Litchfield County.“We formed this company as a repository for our expression of the world,” Mr. Barnett said.After personnel changes, four artistic directors remained: Mr. Wolken, Mr. Barnett, Ms. Chase and Mr. Tracy. Personality differences took their toll. A rift grew between the Mr. Wolken and Mr. Barnett on one side and Ms. Chase and Mr. Tracy on the other. Collaboration waned. The company was growing busier, and management became cumbersome. Financial problems mounted.The collaborating artists and the board decided it was time to bring in an executive director. Mr. Kubovy arrived in January 2004. Ms. Chase said that she was enthusiastic at first. Soon, she said, Mr. Kubovy began imposing his will on artistic matters.“He began dismantling the fabric that was the artistic soul of Pilobolus,” she said, and made himself the face of Pilobolus. “As this autocratic regime was being established, I realized this was stifling me creatively.”Ms. Chase said that she had wanted to do larger-scale, more ambitious works. In January 2005 she asked permission to do outside pieces that would broaden her horizons. Four months later the company proposed that she reduce her role, but stay on as a for-hire choreographer. It rejected her claim that she owned her works, and it asked for written confirmation that Pilobolus had ownership but offered her access to her pieces.“It’s like turning around and asking me to be a janitor,” she said. “As a working artist, I haven’t left my kids with babysitters and gone through all this work to have the board own it.”Mr. Kubovy said that the dances had always been copyrighted by the company, and that there was never any doubt that it owned the work. Since they were joint creations, assigning ownership was impracticable, he said, and “would invite a wasps’ nest of complications.”In interviews, Mr. Barnett and Mr. Wolken agreed that the company owned their work, saying that they had recently signed contracts to that effect. “The idea of individual ownership of our works remains antithetical to everything we founded the company on,” Mr. Barnett said.Mr. Tracy, who did not respond to phone messages, had sent a long and passionate e-mail defense of Ms. Chase to the trustees before a special meeting last October to vote on her status. So did Peter Neill, a former board president. “Make no mistake,” Mr. Neill wrote, “she is being driven out.”At that meeting, with negotiations stalled, the trustees voted to remove Ms. Chase from the board and to dismiss her unless she agreed to the reduced role outlined in the offer, according to board minutes. The vote came after a motion by a committee that included Mr. Kubovy and the board chairman, Edward J. Klaris, the minutes said. Ms. Chase choreographed her last piece for Pilobolus in November.She accused Mr. Klaris of having worked in collusion with Mr. Kubovy to have her removed.Mr. Klaris, who is married to Robin Pogrebin, a reporter for The New York Times, rejected any notion that he had waged a campaign against Ms. Chase. “My mission was purely to try to figure out what was best for this nonprofit institution,” he said. He said that Ms. Chase had stopped getting along with others in the company, obstructed decision making and neglected administrative duties.Yet, he said, Ms. Chase’s talents were formidable, and he had spent hundreds of hours working to keep her. In the end, with no legal recourse, he added, Ms. Chase has gone to the news media with a misleading story to seek sympathy.Mr. Kubovy said that, despite everything, he deplored Ms. Chase’s departure. “It’s sad for everyone,” he said.'"
"'06-07-24,'1','Gleevec, the pill that transformed cancer treatments by offering an easy way to aim at a deadly type of leukemia, may cause serious heart damage, researchers cautioned on Sunday.They found evidence that the treatment caused heart failure in 10 patients who took Gleevec, which is made by Novartis, the Swiss drug maker.Patients should not stop taking the drug, known generically as imatinib, but should be watched closely for heart damage, the researchers said. Other drugs in the same class, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, may also damage the heart, the researchers report in the August issue of the journal Nature Medicine.“Gleevec is a wonderful drug, and patients with these diseases need to be on it,” Thomas Force, who led the study, said in a statement.“We’re trying to call attention to the fact that Gleevec and other similar drugs coming along could have significant side effects on the heart and clinicians need to be aware of this. It’s a potential problem because the number of targeted agents is growing rapidly.”When Gleevec hit the market in 2001, it made headlines because it stopped a difficult type of cancer, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or C.M.L., in most patients. Studies show it keeps 80 percent to 90 percent of C.M.L. patients cancer-free for at least five years. The patients die in usually half of the 4,600 new C.M.L. cases diagnosed each year.'"

"'06-07-25,'1','Some analysts think Iran is now debating internally whether to cut off its oil exports if it is threatened, either as a result of the Lebanon conflict or over its nuclear ambitions. Iran has sent contradictory signals, with a key nuclear negotiator, Javad Vaeedi, saying in March that Iran would consider such a move, only to have Iran’s oil minister say later the same day it would not.Any step by Iran to cut off its own oil revenues would be so hard politically for the government in Tehran that many experts say it would not be tempted to go down that road.But even a temporary shut-off would be a huge psychological blow to the global market, and Iranian leaders may calculate that there would be an advantage in the economic damage to Europe and the United States.For months, the United States has sought to tighten the noose around Iran by getting the United Nations Security Council to threaten sanctions over its suspected nuclear weapons program. Iran says its nuclear program is civilian in nature.Russia, China and some European leaders, fearful that Iran could follow through on its threat to turn off the oil spigot in reply, even if temporarily, have resisted.The difficulty of getting other countries to cooperate aside, even American officials acknowledge that any sanctions would exclude Iran’s energy sector.Given Iran’s dependence on oil exports for income that supports a broad range of subsidies for food, fuel and other necessities for its people, excluding energy from any sanctions plan raises real questions about how effective such a step would be.American officials acknowledge that oil complicates American diplomacy but insist that they will not alter basic policies, especially on Iran, which the West accuses of supporting groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.“The fact that Iran has oil power has not made one whit of difference in our determination to stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons,” said R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs. “I don’t think it has with our allies, either. We are not going to allow Iran’s supposed oil power to exert any leverage over us.”But Iran’s ability to rebuff the West on these matters has only increased as oil prices have risen from about $27 a barrel at the start of the Iraq war, to $65 a barrel in the spring as tensions rose over Iran’s nuclear program, to $75 on Monday as the conflict continued in Lebanon.Indeed, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, each $5 increase in oil prices translates into $85 million a week for Iran’s bank account, emboldening its leaders and making whatever aid it supplies to Hezbollah easier to finance even as the crisis threatens to spread.“Oil has been embedded in our diplomacy for decades,” said Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was an aide to President Jimmy Carter and undersecretary of state for economics under President Bill Clinton. “It’s always given producing countries leverage, but now that leverage is magnified more than ever before.”Oil has also always had ramifications for the United States’ domestic politics. Iran’s new leverage comes not just from its rising oil revenues but also because the price of gasoline at the pump is a potentially damaging liability for the Bush administration, as it has been for other American presidents.At least since 1973, the year of the last full-scale war between Israel and its neighbors and the imposition of an OPEC oil embargo, oil has occupied a central space in the American political psyche. Six years after the oil shock came the overthrow of the shah of Iran, the doubling of oil prices and gas lines at home that helped hustle President Carter from office.Today the Bush administration faces rising criticism from hard-liners that its Iran policy is not stiff enough. But if the diplomatic course is challenging, the military options may be more treacherous and, analysts say, would almost certainly drive the price of oil even higher.That possibility has not stopped conservatives like William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, who was a major booster of the decision to wage war on Iraq, from calling for an airstrike on Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons facilities.Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a speech this year, “No one who is honestly assessing the decline of American leverage around the world due to our energy dependence can fail to see that energy is the albatross of U.S. national security.”Indeed, the extraordinary power of oil to transform world politics today extends far beyond Iran, or even the Middle East.In April, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complained that the hunt for oil and gas was “distorting international politics in a very major way.” Now that comment is turning out to be both prophecy and understatement.New oil money has given not only Iran but also Russia more resources to resist Western pressure. As he played host to the Group of 8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg last week, President Vladimir V. Putin was able to swat away criticism from President Bush about Russian domestic and foreign policies.He boasted, in fact, that Russia’s oil, natural gas and nuclear energy capacities made it the biggest energy player in the world.Months before the summit meeting, Russia was hoping to use the final communiqué to endorse its approach on energy, in which the state basically controls the oil sector. The Bush administration joined with Europe to block such an endorsement, American officials say.But energy remains a major American irritant with Russia and by extension China.The Bush administration has stepped up its efforts to support pipelines that would carry oil and natural gas to the West, bypassing Russian territory.Russia, in turn, has pressured Central Asian countries to oppose American energy projects and the use of the area for military bases.To do that, Russia has joined with China to mobilize a five-year-old group called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, whose members include several Central Asian countries. The Defense Department is even worried that the group could move from its focus on energy to become a military alliance to rival NATO.Many American analysts say energy issues are driving Russia and China into each other’s arms politically, and that if anything American policies are accelerating the trend.Meanwhile, the new oil politics are rearranging the international playing board, not simply giving Iran latitude in the Middle East but allowing Venezuela, for another example, to try to blunt Washington’s influence in Latin America.“We are seeing a radical change in how countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela on the supply side, and China and India on the demand side, bring the world marketplace to bear on foreign policy,” said Carlos Pascual, a former top aide to Ms. Rice and now foreign policy studies director at the Brookings Institution.“I don’t think any of us have done a terribly good job of thinking through how far behind the eight ball we are on these issues,” he said.'"

Eric N. Gioia, a city councilman whose district includes much of the area having problems, even broached the idea of jailing him.But Mr. Burke, an electrical engineer by training and a 33-year veteran of Con Ed, is not flinching.Sitting in an office at Con Edison’s sprawling power plant in Astoria yesterday afternoon, he defended the utility’s handling of the trouble and declined to respond to his critics. On his tours of the areas where Con Ed’s repair crews were working to restore the power, he has not encountered hostility, he said.“I have not heard anger” from customers, he said. “I’ve also heard a lot of compliments about the crews.”Most customers simply wanted to know when their lights would come on again, he said, and he was sorry to say he could not tell them with any precision. In an open-collared dress shirt with two ballpoint pens and his identification badge clipped to the breast pocket, Mr. Burke, who became the company’s chief executive last fall, was more comfortable describing why some customers suffered only partial failures and why some overhead power lines caught fire.The way the power failure spread was a “very extraordinary event,” which he likened to a freakish storm. He said Con Ed initially underestimated how widespread the problem was because so few customers called to complain about a disruption.

"'06-07-25,'1','So, just what does the civil liberties protection officer think about the much-debated N.S.A. program?Alas, he cannot say. “It’s being handled directly by the president and the attorney general,” Mr. Joel said. “It’s not my job to tell the president what the rules are.”Caroline Fredrickson, director of the Washington legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Joel’s cautious stance reflected an inherent problem with such posts, which were recommended by the Sept. 11 commission and have also been created at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.“Those offices are crippled by their lack of authority,” Ms. Fredrickson said. “They are directly under the supervision of whoever’s running their agency.”But Mr. Joel said he had the clout he needed. He has worked closely with another new enterprise, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, since it first met in March. The board was established by the intelligence reform act of 2004, but it took months for President Bush to appoint its five members and more months for the Senate to confirm its chairwoman, Carol E. Dinkins, a Texas lawyer and a former deputy United States attorney general.Ms. Dinkins said neither her board nor the civil liberties officers needed immense legal powers to do their work. “We’re able to bring a strong power of suasion in saying, ‘Here’s what needs to be considered and here’s why,’ ” she said. Among other issues, the board has been discussing the government’s terror watch lists and how people can get off them, she said.The amiable but cautious Mr. Joel made a splash last month by hiring a former colleague of Ms. Fredrickson’s, Timothy H. Edgar, who had been the A.C.L.U.’s top national security lobbyist for five years. Given the organization’s outspoken attacks on Bush administration intelligence policies, including those regarding its treatment of detainees and domestic surveillance, it was an unexpected move. “He’s been working the same issues from the other side,” Mr. Joel said of Mr. Edgar.Mr. Joel was born in Laos and grew up in Guatemala, El Salvador, Panama and Jamaica as his father traveled for the United States Agency for International Development. His father, a German-born Jew whose family fled the Nazis, met his mother, a Korean, while both were working for the United Nations during the Korean War, Mr. Joel said.Mr. Joel worked as a privacy and technology lawyer for the Marriott Corporation before being prompted by the Sept. 11 attacks to join the general counsel’s office at the C.I.A.There he worked on the legal rules governing American spies when they encounter American citizens in their work. He was part of what he called the “civil liberties infrastructure” created by the intelligence reforms of the 1970’s, which established inspectors general, Congressional oversight committees and new laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.“These rules were developed to try to avoid the mistakes that led to the abuses” exposed by the Church Committee in the Senate in the 1970’s, he said. That history of invasions of privacy is part of his standard slide show at training sessions, he said.Now, as the government pushes for greater sharing of information on terrorist threats among federal, state and local agencies, Mr. Joel is working on guidelines to make sure privacy is not sacrificed in the process, he said. He also wants to explore how to expand the use of software to protect privacy rather than invade it, by “anonymizing” data so that analysts can do searches without looking at real names and personal information.Mr. Joel said he taught intelligence officers “the civil liberties SAFE-T cycle” — “Spot issues, Assess rules, Formulate protection, Execute protection, Test compliance.” But he is trying not to duplicate the efforts of the lawyers already at work in the spy agencies who have long conducted training on such matters.“We’re not here to create an additional layer of bureaucracy,” he said, addressing a common complaint about Mr. Negroponte’s office.The existing offices often respond to complaints and problems, Mr. Joel said. “My job is to try to get involved early and try to avoid problems.”'"

"'06-07-25,'1','WASHINGTON, July 24 — The Department of Homeland Security must take steps to curtail the repeated interrogation of people at international airports or border posts simply because their names resemble those of terror suspects, says a report released Monday by the department’s inspector general.The problem, the report says, is not that customs officials stop and question a person whose name matches or is a close match to one of the approximately 200,000 names of known terrorists or terror suspects.What is troubling, it says, is that after individuals have been interrogated once, they are far too frequently interrogated again and again, each time they try to enter the United States.The inspector general, Richard L. Skinner, cited the case of a Pakistani-American named Omar Khan, a business consultant and frequent international traveler who has been repeatedly stopped and then cleared only after delays of several hours.Inflexible rules mean that supervisors do not have “authority to make timely and informed decisions regarding the admissibility of individuals who they could quickly confirm are not the suspected terrorist,” the report said.'"
"'06-07-25,'1','The Oregon law could remake the face of the state, where some of the most restrictive land-use rules in the nation are designed to keep forest and farm areas intact and cities compact. After a bumpy ride through the courts, backers of the measure were handed a clear victory this year.Government officials say the measure has essentially knocked out “the Oregon way,” the distinct set of rules that have long angered many property owners but delighted the urban-planning community. It has made for chaos at the county level, many officials say, by taking away local government’s ability to plan for development in an orderly fashion.In some suburban neighborhoods, residents say property claims would allow gravel pits, industrial plants and used-car lots to be built next to their parks and homes. And some farmers say Measure 37 threatens Oregon’s rural economy.“One thing is clear,” Sheila A. Martin, a professor of urban planning at Portland State University, wrote earlier this year in a report on the initiative, “Measure 37 has disabled the tools used over four decades to prevent sprawl and preserve agriculture and forest land in Oregon.”Since the measure was approved, Oregon property owners had filed 2,755 claims covering 150,455 acres, according to the university’s Institute of Portland Metropolitan Studies, which is tracking the measure’s impact. If all the claims were paid, state officials say, it could amount to more than $3 billion in compensation. But not a single claim has been paid, the institute reported.Instead of paying property owners, local government agencies have routinely chosen to waive the regulations, clearing the way for numerous developments in rural areas.“They want to put all these five-acre lots and build houses right in the middle of our valley,” said Bill Rynearson, a farmer who lives near La Grande, in northeast Oregon. He has been fighting a developer’s request to build a housing subdivision on 1,750 acres.But supporters of the measure, which was approved by 61 percent of voters, say that the worst fears of opponents have not been realized, and that the law simply gives Oregon property owners the right to basic compensation when regulations harm the value of their land.“This has turned out to be the most overhyped measure in the history of Oregon,” said David Hunnicutt, president of Oregonians in Action, which sponsored the initiative.The number of claims was inflated, Mr. Hunnicutt said, because a single claim against both the state and county was counted by the Portland Institute as two. The real number is closer to 1,500, he said.The imperious nature of Oregon’s slow-growth regulations brought on a backlash, Mr. Hunnicutt said, adding that voters fully understood the implications of countering those rules. “The mess created by Oregon’s land-use laws led to the passage of this measure,” he said.While other Oregon groups have reacted with outrage to the request to drill and mine inside the Newberry national monument, Mr. Hunnicutt defended the landowner’s demands and said there were remedies that could keep the scenery intact.The active volcano was made a national monument in 1990. Deschutes County, which regulates property in the surrounding area, designated Mr. Miller’s property as open space in 1992, limiting development.A resident of Portland, Mr. Miller said he had had an ownership stake in 157 acres just south of here since 1969. “You could get a really good-sized geothermal plant in there,’’ he said, “and the only thing you’d see from afar is a big cooling tower with a nice little plume.”Across Oregon, which has been accustomed to the praise of out-of-state groups that hold the state up as model for how to grow without destroying the state’s special features, the unraveling of the political consensus on property compensation is the subject of much soul-searching.Oregon has protected more farmland than any other state, environmental leaders say, but it has lost the support of many farmers for those regulations.“We’ve learned something,” said Elon Hasson, of 1,000 Friends of Oregon, an active antisprawl group. “It’s clear that some people have been hurt by the laws, and there needs to be a way to deal with that.”Polls taken since Measure 37 was approved show consistent support for Oregon land-use regulations. But they also show that people want protection for private property and compensation for government actions.“Oregonians are saying they want it all,” said David Bragdon, president of the Metro Council, which oversees many government functions in the Portland metro area. “They want to be able to eat chocolate cake three times a day and never get fat.”'"
"'06-07-25,'1','Peaches has a one-track mind. Every one of her songs is about sex: straight, gay, bi, all-purpose. At Irving Plaza on Saturday night, she started her set in a gold lamé leotard and headdress — vaguely Cleopatra-ish — and ended up in a black bikini, collar and wrist cuffs. She did a little bump-and-grind and a lot of strutting. Most of her lyrics can’t be quoted in this family newspaper.But her act isn’t exactly about enticement or desire. It’s about bravado and the spectacle of a woman who’s willing to be as raunchy as a man.For her debut album in 2000, “The Teaches of Peaches,” and through years of touring, Peaches backed herself up with rudimentary drum machines and samples. The stark, mechanized sound harked back to early-1980’s electro and old-school hip-hop, and Peaches’s savvy breakthrough song, which posited sex as a painkiller, gave club disc jockeys something to toy with.Concept aside, on sheer musical terms Peaches was no competition for equally explicit, far more articulate and rhythmically savvy rappers like Lil’ Kim, or dancehall toasters like Lady Saw. (Peaches, however, appreciates homosexuality, while hip-hop and reggae rhymers often revile it.) Wisely, Peaches picked up another 1980’s idea: adding power chords to the drum-machine beat, à la Run-D.M.C. Lately she has been shifting from raps, which take a lot of writing and rhyming, to hard-rock songs that allow for far more repetition; luckily, Peaches can sing, wailing like Joan Jett, and now she occasionally plays guitar. (Peaches, a Canadian whose real name is Merrill Nisker, used to be a music teacher.)On her new album Peaches is backed by additional musicians (including Ms. Jett), and onstage she now leads a four-woman band. At the end of the set, they wore matching jackets that announced them as “Peaches and the Herms.”'"
"'06-07-25,'1','Beta Vista simply does not run games properly on many of the big monitors that Microsoft and media companies are encouraging consumers to buy. I have no doubt that Microsoft will come up with a solution before Vista is released. But it is such a glaring problem, and one that goes so directly to the heart of the gaming experience, that if any halfway serious gamers asked me right now if they should install the beta Vista on their main PC’s, I would say no. Why? On many widescreen monitors, most 3-D games play only at a lower, boxy resolution, which is then stretched to fit the bigger screen. Needless to say, it doesn’t look great. (Solitaire works wonderfully.)“As can be the case with beta software, one can encounter incompatibilities and untested situations,” said Rich Wickham, head of Microsoft’s Windows Games group. “Newer builds of Windows Vista have already integrated updates that have significantly improved and we feel have resolved the issues as referenced here with the operating system.”The broader point is that Microsoft seems to understand what it needs to do to help bring gaming on PC’s — as opposed to playing on consoles like PlayStation and Xbox — a bit closer to the cultural mainstream. Vista does a fine job of giving parents control over when their children play and what kinds of virtual experiences they have. In terms of overall usability, Vista makes games as easily accessible and understandable to use as e-mail, photos and music.But this video-display issue raises a question about how well the company really understands the hardcore players who will always be the tastemakers and most faithful customers in PC gaming.The big difference between a serious computer gamer and a serious console gamer is that the PC gamer has probably spent thousands of dollars on his game machine. Gamers drive the top end of the PC industry because they are the only consumers who will regularly spend $500 on a video card or $700 to upgrade to the very latest chip from Intel or Advanced Micro Devices. Recently, gamers have been snapping up the widescreen LCD monitors that have come down in price. The reason PC gamers spend that money, and don’t sit on the couch playing Nintendo, is to experience the very best full-motion graphics in the world.So when Microsoft said it would send me a top-end PC to try Vista, I immediately asked them to recommend a first-rate monitor I could buy to plug into it. And Microsoft did recommend one: a 24-inch widescreen LCD panel from Dell.That made sense because one of the features on the Dell monitor is the technology known as HDCP, for high-bandwidth digital content protection. The big picture, as it were, is that the media and computing industries are pushing HDCP monitors so that movie and television studios can distribute high-definition video online without worrying as much about piracy.So my first big shock came when I hooked up the monitor to the computer and simply could not play most games I tried, even games that Microsoft had preloaded onto the PC, at the monitor’s full resolution of 1,920 by 1,200 pixels. Not Dungeons & Dragons Online, not Auto Assault, not World of Warcraft. (The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion worked fine.)My second shock was when I went online and realized that lots of people using beta Vista were having the same problem with lots of games (and still are). But the biggest surprise has been that Microsoft has not been able to fix the problem since I asked about it almost two weeks ago. That tells you it’s not as minor an issue as it seems.Microsoft’s explanation is basically that this is a test version of Vista and that it will be fixed soon. I am sure that’s true. Microsoft also said that game companies are partly to blame for miscoding their games.It has to be said, by the way, that the VoodooPC hardware has been fabulous. On this rig Vista really should be like a Lamborghini. But right now, Vista is like a beautiful six-speed Lamborghini that looks great and feels great but just won’t shift into sixth gear. Microsoft is saying, We’re working on sixth gear.It won’t happen soon enough.'"
"'06-07-25,'1','Are evangelical missionaries good or bad? That’s the question in tonight’s PBS documentary, “The Tailenders.” The missionaries’ smugness and salesmanship tend to irritate other humanitarian workers, who typically see themselves as more respectful of the people they’re tending to. What’s more, the program implies, silencing the stomping beats of, say, the Solomon Islands in favor of pallid “Jesus Loves Me” singalongs seems just wrong.But more disturbing than this, the documentary contends, is the psychological and spiritual danger that many progressives believe is wrought by missionaries, who swipe from indigenous people their happy, peaceful ways and stick them instead with the greed, selfishness, jealousy and wrecked natural landscapes known to be the key features of global industrial capitalism.Despite a century of such complaints, however, Protestant missionaries persist. And they’re dogged. They dress in uncool hiking clothes and pack up uncool backpacks and buses with uncool food and uncool Bibles and venture way the heck into the jungle where they — and this is the subject of “The Tailenders” — learn thorny indigenous languages so they can actually talk with people who have never heard of America, capitalism, jihad, McWorld or Jesus Christ. Missionaries may be the most parochial and audacious avatars of our modern world.Still, after tonight’s effort to wrestle with this paradox, you will not know for sure whether missionaries are good or bad. But you will talk about it. This gorgeous, inspired and gutsy film, the first feature documentary by Adele Horne, who also produces video art, opens up new ideological vistas on religion, technology and globalization. It dares viewers not to be surprised by it.The focus of “The Tailenders” is the Global Recordings Network, founded in 1939 in Los Angeles by an evangelical named Joy Ridderhof. She wanted to disseminate Bible stories via phonographs and gramophones. Still photographs bring to life her adventures among those she aimed to convert; there she crouches, pale and delicate, with various less-delicate-looking figures in jungles and on beaches, marveling at a tape recorder. Of the 8,000 languages and dialects believed to exist, Global Recordings has now produced Christian propaganda in more than 5,485 of them. No linguistics department could pull this off.'"
"'06-07-25,'1','Children who live with smokers have been found to be at risk for a variety of health problems in even the best of circumstances. Now a new study finds that if the children happen to need surgery, they may be at even greater risk.Researchers from Harvard report that children exposed to secondhand smoke experienced more breathing problems under general anesthesia. The study, which appears in the current journal Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, was conducted by Dr. Dwight T. Jones of Children’s Hospital Boston and Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.The study looked at more than 400 children being operated on for problems like fluid in the middle ear or hernias. Before the surgery, the patients’ families were given general health surveys, which included questions about smoke exposure. In all, about 40 percent of the children had been exposed to secondhand smoke, and they were much more likely to experience problems, the study found.For example, 38 percent secreted too much mucus, compared with 8 percent of children from nonsmoking homes. They were also more likely to engage in breath holding and to have airway constrictions. The biggest problems were seen in the wakeup period, the researchers said.This is not the first study to show that children exposed to cigarette smoke are at risk for disease, respiratory and nonrespiratory alike. “Among those exposed to passive smoke,” the researchers wrote, “children are especially vulnerable.”But the results suggest that doctors should screen the families of children facing surgery to see if there are members who smoke. The families should then be warned that procedures that ordinarily are done on an outpatient basis might end up requiring an overnight stay, the study said.'"

"'06-07-26,'0','The family that pops Prozac together stays together, perhaps, but the family that piles into an old Volkswagen bus the color of a banana surely has more entertainment value. That at least seems true of the happily (for us) unhappy relations at the center of the bittersweet comedy of dysfunction “Little Miss Sunshine,” a tale about genuine faith and manufactured glory that unwinds in the American Southwest, but more rightly takes place at the terminus of the American dream, where families are one bad break away from bankruptcy.Written by the newcomer Michael Arndt, and directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, seasoned music-video directors making an effortless feature-film debut, “Little Miss Sunshine” relates the story of the Hoovers, just around the time that the youngish, harried Sheryl (Toni Collette) takes her suicidal brother, Frank (Steve Carell), under her wing. (“I’m glad you’re here,” she says. “That makes one of us,” he answers.) Straight from the hospital, Frank moves in with Sheryl’s family, including her 7-year-old daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin); teenage son, Dwayne (Paul Dano); husband, Richard (Greg Kinnear); and father-in-law, a heroin-tooting crank simply called Grandpa (Alan Arkin).The bandages on Frank’s wrists are as fresh as his wounds when he enters the Hoovers’ fold, a dim burrow filled with clutter and noise. Eccentric families are a mainstay of comedy, and at least in their schematized personalities (the sullen son, the desperate dad), the Hoovers are not much different from most, despite the vials of white powder tucked in Grandpa’s fanny pack. They may be more downmarket than Wes Anderson’s Tenenbaums and a lot scruffier than the average big-studio clan. (Their kitchen looks as if it hasn’t been remodeled since Alice slaved for the Bradys.) But like most American comedy families, they are also a familiar social microcosm, a group of radically individualized souls in search of one another.The means to that end is the competition of the film’s title, a child beauty pageant called Little Miss Sunshine. Soon after Frank moves in, Olive, a dumpling of a child with oversize glasses and a seemingly endless reserve of optimism, receives unexpected word that she has been invited to compete in Little Miss Sunshine, just days away. Short of cash if not bright ideas, Richard decides to pile the fractious, reluctant brood into the family’s antique VW bus so that Olive can live out her dream and prove herself a winner. Much like Steinbeck’s Joads, the Beverly Hillbillies and millions of other westward-ho pioneers, the notably named Hoovers set a course for California, the land of sunshine, bleached teeth and eternal promise, leaving dusty Albuquerque behind.“Little Miss Sunshine” doesn’t look particularly ambitious, in terms of either its narrative or its function-over-form visual style. But tucked in between all the hurt and the jokes, the character development and the across-the-board terrific performances is a surprisingly sharp look at contemporary America, one that sets the metaphor of the stage (and, by extension, competition) against the cherished myth of the open road. Like her father, who’s peddling a get-rich scheme, and like her brother, who yearns to fly the coop by becoming a jet pilot, Olive lives in a fantasy world that has become more real than her own life. When she watches a video of Miss America accepting her tiara, the image flickers in her eyeglasses, but it might as well be projected on her frontal lobe.It’s on the road that the Hoovers first lose and then find themselves, both as individuals and as a family. There is engine trouble, naturally, which leads to a delightful sight gag that involves Richard tucked behind the wheel as the rest of the family pushes — then scrambles inside — the bus. An emblem of an earlier, possibly more freewheeling era, this temporary mobile home seems an unlikely vehicle for transformation, but it takes the Hoovers across state lines and through a series of emotional and psychological roadblocks. In between the fast-food joints, hot tears and hurled insults, there are wide-open spaces and a suggestion of freedom along with a sign for the “Carefree Highway,” an actual state route that here seems more like a cruel joke.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','Here’s where things get tricky. Vineyards can be good and they can be bad, so all the talk of terroir won’t help the wine at all if the vineyard is no good. In an effort to sort things out, Burgundy classifies its better vineyards as premier cru, and the best as grand cru. You can imagine, given the already high demand for Burgundy, that such designations are tantamount to saying, “Charge a fortune for this bottle.’’In an effort to find some more reasonably priced Burgundies (reasonable being a relative term for these wines), the wine panel decided to taste an assortment of village Burgundies from the Côte d’Or, the heart of Burgundy. These wines are made from grapes that all come from within the boundaries of a particular village, but not from vineyard sites rated premier cru or grand cru.Usually, though not always, they are less expensive than premier and grand cru wines. The exception is when you find a wine from a simple appellation made by a top producer or négociant, like Maison Leroy.For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Beth von Benz, a wine consultant, and Scott Mayger, general manager at Telepan, a restaurant on the Upper West Side. We decided to stick with the Côte d’Or because we were curious about how good, or bad, these village wines would be.Good deals for pleasing wines can often be found in the Côte Chalonnaise to the south, from villages like Givry, Rully and Mercurey. Conversely, famous Côte d’Or villages like Gevrey-Chambertin and Pommard have long had the reputation as underachievers, getting by on their venerated names rather than the quality of the wines.Meanwhile, consumers can easily fall prey to romance. Whose tastebuds would not be aroused by the prospects of a Vosne-Romanée, the site of some of the most heralded vineyards in the world, like Romanée-Conti and La Tâche? A village Vosnes-Romanée, of course, benefits greatly by association.Nonetheless the 25 wines we tasted offered a clear idea of why Burgundy is so beloved. The best of these wines were harmonious and deep with pure, elegant flavors. “How quiet Burgundy is,’’ Mr. Mayger noted. “The wines don’t assault you.’’Surprisingly, 17 of the bottles came from the 2003 vintage, characterized by an intense heat wave that resulted in small yields of very ripe grapes. Many purists have criticized the vintage as full of baked, jammy flavors with little nuance or delicacy.No doubt, the ’03’s are opulent wines, but we found the good ones to be highly enjoyable and ready for drinking now.Our top two wines, the ’03 Savigny-lès-Beaune Vieilles Vignes from Catherine and Claude Maréchal, along with the ’03 Vosne-Romanée from Jérôme Chezeaux, were both noteworthy for their sheer seductive powers.A trio of wines from Gevrey-Chambertin as well as two from Chambolle-Musigny, all 2003’s, showed more power than delicacy yet were never overbearing. These included Gevrey-Chambertins from Harmand-Geoffroy, Sylvie Esmonin and Rossignol-Trapet and Chambolle-Musignys from Louis Jadot and Frédéric Magnien.Of the eight wines from other vintages, only a 2002 Pommard from Labouré-Roi made our top 10. It’s possible that in the blind tasting, the other vintages, particularly the three 2002’s, seemed closed up in comparison to the accessible ’03’s. But most of these wines from other vintages simply didn’t measure up in quality, with one exception, a 2004 Nuits-St.-Georges from Philippe Pacalet.This was one of my favorite wines of the tasting, earthy and perfumed with delicate, pure flavors, and I was outraged that my colleagues did not agree. The Pacalet cost $64, which made it the second most expensive wine in the tasting after a 2002 Volnay from Michel Lafarge for $65.The wines in our top 10 ranged from $30 to $58. On the one hand, this is a lot of money for a bottle of wine, and it’s a significant reason to choose carefully. But when you think about the pleasure in these wines, and how the value of the dollar has dropped in recent years, maybe they don’t seem like such bad deals after all.BEST VALUECatherine & Claude Maréchal Savigny-lés-Beaune Vieilles Vignes 2003  $35***Dense, intense, pure, with balanced, lingering flavors of berries, herbs and smoke.

"'06-07-26,'0','He said the workers were being cautioned to be alert to danger: “We are reminding everybody to keep their wits about them.”The other worker, Jesse Warren, 23, of Topeka, Kan., touched a line carrying power and was able to scream for help before he lost consciousness. Paramedics rushed him to a hospital where he is recovering.Mr. Warren was one of 3,000 utility workers from 13 surrounding states who have been assisting 1,000 workers from the local power company, Ameren UE, since high winds last Wednesday caused extensive damage. A second storm on Friday added to the damage and cut power to about 600,000 customers at one time or another, Ameren reported.The out-of-town workers were being housed in hotels an college dormitories and company employees have established an emergency laundry in the headquarters parking lot to assist them. They are also distributing ice and other supplies to workers in the field.Among those 7,000 still without power today in hard-hit Florissant was Pam Flotte, who had been enduring 95-degree heat in her home each evening after work, with a leaking refrigerator and freezer that damaged the floors.Some relief came Tuesday, when the four members of the Flotte family were able to move into the home of a neighbor whose power was restored, along with the neighbor’s married daughter and week-old child.Mrs. Flotte said her family has resisted the temptation to eat at restaurants during this period of storing food in a cooler. “We’re living on peanut butter, ham and hotdogs,” she said.Mayor Francis Slay of St. Louis announced today that eight hot meal centers were being opened in the city, and expected to serve 20,000 people per day. The Salvation Army said to date it had provided food and shelter for 250,000 people in connection with the power failures.Power was out in scattered areas around the region including several across the Mississippi River in Illinois. Utility officials said they expected all power to be restored by Thursday.Susan Gallagher, a spokeswoman for Ameren, said the damage caused by the storms was the worst in the company’s 100-year history, although the costs have not yet been tallied. “We’ve been focused on getting customers back on and we don’t have costs yet,” she said.She said the storms damaged 400 distribution lines, three times the number usually affected by powerful storms.An industry group that tracks electricity consumption said today that last week’s heat contributed to record power demand throughout the country.In the week ending July 22, according to the Edison Electric Institute, American utility companies delivered 96,314 gigawatt hours, breaking the record set a year ago by more than 1 percent. A gigawatt is a billion watts.Temperatures eased downward today in the Los Angeles area and the operator of California’s power grid said it did not anticipate ordering any blackouts, although it said conservation was still needed.Nevertheless, some parts of the region, particularly the valleys and mountains near the city, remained under heat alerts, and thousands of houses and businesses remained without power after the prolonged heat wave led to the failure of neighborhood transformers.Triple digit temperatures were expected in the mountains and low elevations, according to the National Weather Service. One area, Woodland Hills, had 21 consecutive days of peak temperatures over 100 degrees including a Los Angeles County record of 119 degrees on Saturday.A peak of 105 was predicted for the area today.Despite the decrease in peak temperatures in the Los Angeles, the region will remain hot with a midafternoon high predicted at 86 degrees.Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa urged residents to conserve energy to protect the local distribution system. “Understand, this is not a supply problem,” he said. “We have record use of energy, but we have a sufficient supply. It’s a distribution issue. These transformers are going out across the city because of record-breaking temperatures and the demand on electricity.”Nevertheless, the Independent System Operator, which transmits about 80 percent of California’s power said it expected at about 49,500 megawatts today, after exceeding 50,000 megawatts earlier in the week. Demand was expected to fall to about 46,250 megawatts on Thursday, the agency said.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','Mr. Neupert, 50, is leading Microsoft’s new strategy in health care. In 1998, after 11 years at Microsoft, he left to become chief executive of Drugstore.com, an online retailer of pharmacy and health products. From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Neupert served on President Bush’s Information Technology Advisory Committee, and he was co-chairman of a health technology subcommittee that published a report called “Revolutionizing Health Care Through Information Technology.”Mr. Neupert returned to Microsoft last September, after persuading Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, and Craig Mundie, a senior strategy executive, that Microsoft should be doing more in the health care sector.“I’ve had an opportunity to see how messed up the health care system was,” Mr. Neupert explained. “And to really have an impact, you need a footprint like Microsoft’s.”The software system Microsoft is buying is called Azyxxi (pronounced ah-zik-see). It is designed to retrieve and quickly display patient information from many sources, including scanned documents, E.K.G.’s, X-rays, M.R.I. scans, angiograms and ultrasound images. It was first used in Washington Hospital Center’s emergency department in 1996, and has since been adopted at six other hospitals, including the Georgetown University Hospital, in the MedStar Health group, a nonprofit network in the Baltimore-Washington region.The Azyxxi software, Mr. Neupert said, will be “our foundation,” adding, “You’ll find us expanding to a suite of health care solutions.”The Microsoft plan, analysts say, could be risky. The software Microsoft is purchasing — the price was not disclosed — is a homegrown system that has not been used outside a few hospitals. It has no installed base of customers, and there are already several established suppliers of clinical information technology systems, including Cerner, Epic, G.E., Eclypsis and others.Most of the big health care software suppliers, analysts point out, are also big customers for Microsoft operating systems, databases and programming tools. “This puts Microsoft in the uncomfortable position of potentially competing against its major customers,” said Dr. Thomas Handler, a health technology analyst at Gartner.Dr. Craig F. Feied, a principal designer of the software, describes Azyxxi as mainly a “data exploration engine” that typically works with existing clinical systems rather than replacing them.Analysts and health care experts who have seen the software work in the Washington hospitals say it is impressive technology. Many hospitals and clinics, they say, have many different kinds of patient information in electronic form, but the different computer systems and software programs cannot share the data. That is the principal problem the Azyxxi system addresses, analysts say.The need to quickly collect, sort and display health information from many sources, they say, is a vital requirement in developing regional and national health information networks — a policy goal in the United States and dozens of other countries.At the Washington Hospital Center, the system has done its job. In 1995, before the system was introduced, the emergency ward handled 37,000 patients a year, waits stretched up to nine hours, and there seemed to be an urgent need for more doctors and rooms, Dr. Feied recalled. Today, the emergency department handles nearly 80,000 patients a year and 70 percent of them are diagnosed, treated or admitted in three hours or less. The staff has increased only 5 percent, and few rooms were added.The problem, Dr. Feied said, was mostly that patients were waiting in rooms because doctors could not quickly find the patient records, treatment history and other information to treat them.“We weren’t doctor-poor or bed-poor,” he said. “We were information-poor.”Whether that experience can be widely repeated and commercialized under Microsoft, however, is uncertain.“This is extremely interesting as a signal of Microsoft’s intentions in health care, but we’ll have to see what comes next and how this plays out,” said Dr. Blackford Middleton, an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School and a health technology expert at Partners Healthcare, a nonprofit medical group that includes Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','MINNEAPOLIS, July 25 — No one was happy with 3M’s second-quarter results on Tuesday.Not the chief executive, George Buckley, who said he was disappointed. Not investors, who sent 3M shares tumbling.Even analysts — usually deferential toward executives — sounded testy on a nearly two-hour-long conference call with 3M management.3M’s second-quarter profits jumped 17 percent and fell within the lowered guidance it gave about three weeks ago. But they missed analyst expectations, as did its third-quarter guidance.The maker of everything from Scotch tape to furnace filters has gotten much of its growth in recent years by making glare-reducing screens for LCD televisions and computer monitors. But several problems in that business cropped up in the last quarter:— 3M acknowledged earlier this month that it overestimated demand for new TVs prompted by the World Cup.— The company said sometimes 90 percent of the film made for large-screen LCD televisions at a new plant in Decatur, Ala., was wasted, though the factory is running better now.'"

"'06-07-26,'0','In his opening salvo, Mr. Spitzer branded Mr. Suozzi as a serial tax raiser, saying Mr. Suozzi’s turnaround of Nassau County “is a consequence of one thing: property tax increases.”But the reality was that Nassau County was in dire straits when Mr. Suozzi took over in 2002. While he did raise taxes as part of a regimen of tough medicine, including steep job cuts, his management was widely praised for staving off a state takeover of the debt-ridden county, widely derided for its fiscal mismanagement.Mr. Spitzer also criticized Mr. Suozzi’s idea to charge a rush-hour toll on the Long Island Expressway. And he accused Mr. Suozzi of planning $1 billion in new sales taxes — Mr. Suozzi’s “taxpayer savings plan” on his Web site does include a projection for increasing sales tax revenue by $1 billion annually by changing the way sales taxes are collected, from wholesalers instead of retailers, to reduce chances for tax evasion — and by taxing items purchased on the Internet.Mr. Suozzi also continued to attack Mr. Spitzer as being too closely allied with entrenched interests that he said have given Albany a dysfunctional culture, saying, “He’s embraced by all the politicians, all the insiders and all the lobbyists who have given us this broken system.”True? Mr. Spitzer’s campaign donors do include a Who’s Who of unions, top lobbying firms and even out-of-state business interests like Kentucky horse breeders.But Mr. Suozzi went on to say that if he were elected, it would be “without the help of the insiders,” and he has faced his own accusations of raising money from insiders in Nassau County. A recent report in Newsday found that a dozen contributors with ties to county contractors were listed on the invitation of a golf fund-raiser for Mr. Suozzi. Each pledged at least $10,000, the paper reported, raising concerns about a pay-to-play atmosphere. Mr. Suozzi has said the fund-raising was legal.Mr. Suozzi also attacked Mr. Spitzer for refusing to hire outside counsel to represent the state when he disagrees with the governor. Mr. Spitzer said he considered it his sworn duty to represent the governor, even if he disagreed with his policies, including the legal battle over increasing education funding to New York City. And he said it was a waste of money to hire outside counsel.But he appeared to falter when Mr. Suozzi said previous attorneys general “had hired outside counsel when they disagreed with the governor on serious political matters.”Mr. Spitzer disagreed. “You are simply wrong when you say other attorneys general have done that,” he said. “They haven’t done it. It’s the wrong thing to do. This is what the job requires. It is obligatory.”But New York has a history of attorneys general refusing to represent the governor when they disagree with his positions. In 1984, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo openly feuded with Attorney General Robert Abrams over Mr. Abrams’s refusal to take some cases.Asked if he would live in the governor’s mansion, Mr. Spitzer also said “yes.” But Mr. Spitzer does not plan to move his family to Albany, only to occupy the mansion himself when he is in town.And on the subject of the death penalty, Mr. Spitzer said his position “has always been the same,” though it appears to have evolved. In a 1994 commercial, he differentiated himself from other candidates for attorney general by saying he was the only Democrat supporting the death penalty. But during yesterday’s debate, he said the issue “has not been at the top of my priority list” and appeared to support its use in a narrower range of crimes than in the past.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','SALT LAKE CITY, July 25 —Five-year-old Destiny Norton, whowas known for her smile, disappearedfrom the yard of her home alittle over a week ago, setting off awidespread search by thousands ofUtah residents, the police and F.B.I.agents. That search ended Mondaynight, the police said, when Destiny’sbody was found in the basement of aneighbor, who was charged withhomicide.The girl was reported missing July16 after she walked out of her houseinto the backyard, which was surroundedby a fence. When her father,Rick Norton, went out to check onher about five minutes later, he toldthe police, she was gone.At least one Salt Lake City newspaper,The Deseret News, said thesearches for the girl had drawn thesupport of the family of ElizabethSmart, who was abducted in 2002 andlater found alive. A $30,000 rewardhad been offered in the case.Neighbors said that the man whowas arrested, Craig Gregerson, 20,had lived in a house about 150 feetfrom the Nortons’ for about a yearand a half. They described him as arecluse and said his wife occasionallylived there with him.A spokesman for the Norton family,Jeannie Hill, said that althoughthey were neighbors, the Nortons didnot know Mr. Gregerson.A police spokesman said in a statementlate Monday that Mr. Gregersonwas arrested on charges of criminalhomicide.

"'06-07-26,'0','O’Brien and Cara-Beth Burnside, the president of the alliance’s board of directors, have been added to the X Games selection committee, which had been exclusively male. In addition, the winner of the women’s street and vert events will make $5,000, up from $2,000 a year ago. The men’s winner made $50,000.“Two thousand dollars for first place, for being the best in your sport,” Burnside said of last year’s top prize. “Maybe if I was 16 that would be cool.“We don’t want what the guys are getting,” she added. “But we want something respectable.”But the female skateboarders face obstacles more challenging than the ramps, curbs, hedgerows and benches they are accustomed to vaulting. Nothing resembling Title IX’s federal legislation promoting gender equity in sports exists in network boardrooms, where the skateboarders face television executives who are focused on ratings.Chris Stiepock, general manager of the X Games, which will be conducted Aug. 3-6 in Los Angeles, said ESPN cannot afford adding more programming for women’s skateboarding without suffering a ratings decline.“There’s only room for so many sports,” Stiepock said. “Our ultimate responsibility is to our viewer, and our viewer is a male teen.”Stiepock said ESPN’s studies show that women’s action sports lag far behind men’s in popularity and participation. The exceptions are skiing and snowboarding, two events featured at the Winter X Games.Stiepock said ESPN would like to add women’s surfing to the summer offerings and broadcast the event on television, but it would require eliminating another sport.After last year’s X Games, some members of the alliance sought support from the Women’s Sports Foundation, an organization that promotes the causes of women and girls in sports. Donna Lopiano, the foundation’s chief executive, said that representatives from her organization have talked to their counterparts at the X Games about the alliance’s concerns. Although she said she does not expect immediate results, Lopiano said she intends to keep pressing ESPN with recommendations to improve opportunities for women.“ESPN has done a lot for women’s sports,” she said. “Going forward, when they see these recommendations, we hope there will be change.”Change is what the alliance, which has about 30 members, is seeking. In the 39-year-old Burnside, the alliance seems to have found a leader. An action sports icon, Burnside competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics in snowboarding halfpipe, finishing fourth, and she has won a slew of medals at the X Games and Winter X Games during the past 10 years.At the 2005 Games, she won a gold medal in the skateboard vert event, where riders pull maneuvers on a massive halfpipe ramp.“When I started skateboarding, the only girl I saw was Cara-Beth Burnside,” O’Brien said. “She was an inspiration to me.”Although Burnside receives a salary from sponsors, she estimated only a half-dozen other women worldwide earn a living exclusively from skateboarding. Sponsorship money and contest winnings do not amount to much in a sport where the idea of gender equity has just begun to gain traction.Still, members of the alliance are mindful that in recent years other action sports where women feature prominently, such as inline skating and wakeboarding, have been dropped from the X Games.“I don’t want to be too gnarly on the X Games,” Burnside said. “I don’t want them to say, ‘Forget you.’ ”Acknowledging the vulnerability of her sport, Burnside said, “Should I skate for nothing and just feel lucky to be there?”'"
"'06-07-26,'0','The S.E.C. is in an awkward position. The hedge fund industry is growing quickly and is a major force in the markets, accounting for as much as 30 percent of trading activity, but it is virtually unregulated.The commission has the authority to investigate any kind of fraud it suspects, but the court’s decision to throw out the registration requirement limits its ability to conduct routine exams and improve its understanding of the industry.Some lawyers said Tuesday that they were not surprised that Mr. Cox did not ask Congress for more authority.“I think there is some reticence by regulatory agencies overall to admit a need for, or affirmatively ask for, help from Congress,” said Jim C. McCarroll, a partner at the law firm Reed Smith who focuses on hedge funds and funds of hedge funds. “They prefer to exercise their individual regulatory authority before seeking a legislative fix.”Mr. Cox explained some of steps he would ask the commission to take to reclaim some of the authority it had lost when the court declared its registration requirement invalid.For example, the Investment Advisers Act has strict rules on what books and records must be kept to back up performance data. The registration rule required hedge funds to have those books and records after the funds registered, but exempted them from having them for periods before they registered. Mr. Cox said he wanted that exemption to be reinstated.Mr. Cox also said he would introduce a measure to permit the commission to sue managers on behalf of investors in the fund.Mr. Cox said 10 hedge funds had withdrawn their registrations since the appeals court decision, but more had registered. “Although these are early returns and may not be indicative of the final outcome, we have actually experienced a net increase in the hedge fund registration,” he said.The Treasury Department, meanwhile, has formed a group to examine potential risks in the industry, including the exposure that many large banks could have to certain trades. The group, which first met a few weeks ago, will work with members of the hedge fund industry and the banks who manage their accounts.The 1998 near-collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was invoked several times during the hearing.In his testimony, Randal K. Quarles, under secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, asserted that the conditions that had led to that spectacular near-collapse were not as prevalent today.“There is reason to believe there is less risk posed by the hedge fund industry than in the past,” he said, including less leverage, less concentration of risk and more awareness by the banks that manage the hedge funds’ accounts.He said one risk he saw was embedded leverage, or bets that hedge funds have taken with derivatives that are less apparent on the balance sheet.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) — The Internet bookmaker BetOnSports said Tuesday that it had removed David Carruthers from his job as chief executive after his arrest in Texas on racketeering charges.BetOnSports is named alongside Mr. Carruthers and 10 other people charged with racketeering, conspiracy and fraud in a 22-count indictment.“On July 24, the contract under which David Carruthers acted as C.E.O. of the company was terminated,” BetOnSports said in a statement on Tuesday. “Clearly, while he remains in the custody of the U.S. government he is unable to perform his duties.”The company also moved on Tuesday to distance itself from the scandal, saying that the founder, Gary Kaplan, had not been involved in the group’s day-to-day management.Mr. Carruthers, 48, has been in custody since July 16, when he was arrested by federal authorities while changing planes in Texas. The company said it had not had any contact with Mr. Carruthers since his arrest.

"'06-07-26,'0','As the 193 million acres of national forest become increasingly popular playgrounds, there are more clashes with the small cadre of forest rangers who work as law enforcement officers, the figures showed.In some of the incidents reported last year, a ranger near Lake Tahoe was run down by a man who later pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon — a snowmobile.In the deep-forested foothills of California, where new strains of high-potency marijuana are grown for sale by Mexican cartels, shots were fired at rangers. And a pair of Forest Service archaeologists were threatened by people who complained that the archaeologists’ scientific work was interfering with a self-described “vision quest” of fasting and feasting.“There’s been a huge increase in the number of incidents, in large part because what had once been urban problems are now happening deep in the backwoods,” said Jeff Ruch, executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a nonprofit group representing about 10,000 people who work on public lands, which compiled the assault figures.At the same time, the number of rangers with police power has been nearly halved in the last decade, to 550 from more than 980 because of budget cuts and because some rangers have been assigned to other duties. There is now one law enforcement ranger for every 291,000 acres, or one for every 733,000 visitors, according to Forest Service figures.“There’s no question that the forests have become much more dangerous and the amount of violence we’re dealing with has greatly increased,” said John Twiss, director of law enforcement for the Forest Service.Mr. Twiss said officials were working on a plan to rebuild the depleted ranks.The larger problem, rangers say, is not that national forests have become crime-infested jungles. But that as cities like Reno; Denver; Phoenix; Tucson; Albuquerque; and Boise, Idaho; and smaller communities like Bend, Ore., and Moab, Utah, grow at rates far beyond the national average, they bump against the public land that surround them, carrying urban crimes to open space.In fast-growing Snohomish County, Wash., a woman and her daughter were killed earlier this month on a popular hiking trail. The crime remains unsolved.“Our biggest problem with corpses is all the bodies being dumped in the national forest,” Mr. Leveille said. “Particularly in the south, as you get closer to Vegas.”Reno is emblematic of the problems. The Biggest Little City in the World, as Reno calls itself, is starting to live up to its nickname — growing 45 percent in the last 15 years. Its metropolitan area, with about 400,000 people, has 96 miles of border with the national forest.There are plenty of bird-watchers, dog-walkers, hikers and assorted daydreaming nature lovers, forest rangers say. But a lot of people also use the forest as a party site, a dirt-bike playground, a hideaway for a drug laboratory, or a dump.“Last week we broke up a rave,” said Mr. Leveille, a veteran of 28 years in the Forest Service. “It was pretty wild — about 250 people, a lot them high on Ecstasy. Most folks just scattered. But some of them wanted to linger around and touch us, and that’s considered a federal offense.”Methamphetamine laboratories are a particular problem, rangers say, mainly in the forests with the biggest canopy cover, like those in the Appalachian Mountains and the Pacific Northwest. In the last four years, rangers made 1,600 felony drug arrests and seized 759 methamphetamine laboratories in national forests, government records show.“Methheads — tons of them,” said Mr. Leveille, a short, wiry ranger with a graying Fu Manchu mustache and a graveled voice worn down by years of smoking and fighting fires.Mexican drug cartels operate in 33 of the 155 national forests, said Mr. Twiss, the chief of law enforcement. Rangers say that as the nation’s borders have tightened in recent years, marijuana cartels have moved into national forests, particularly in California. They say it is easier to grow marijuana and ship out it of American national forests than to bring it across the border. But that poses a huge problem for Forest Service law enforcement officers, who are not used to dealing with that level of organized crime, rangers say.“Every forest in California has a cartel,’’ Mr. Twiss said, “and these people are heavily armed and they are dangerous.” Fires at the urban edges, many caused by arsonists, take up more time than ever, rangers say, as housing subdivisions are built in areas prone to wildfire.“All around you, none of these houses were here just four years ago,” said Mr. Leveille, driving on the road to Mount Rose outside Reno, thick with the kind of ponderosa pines in the old TV series “Bonanza.”For the thousands of homes fresh-planted among the pines, the selling point was proximity to a national forest, wilderness as a backyard.“These rich homes, we get a lot of calls from people who live here who are just scared to death of fire,” Mr. Leveille said. “They’re very demanding. And gunfire — oh, God. Anytime they hear people shooting their rifles, they think it’s a war. But our shooting regulations are minimal on public land.”By far the biggest problem, Mr. Leveille said, is with people riding off-road vehicles or snowmobiles, a complaint echoed by the public-land employee group. “In many parts of the West, it’s a Mad Max situation, with a quarter-million people on a weekend and one ranger to keep them from tearing the place up,” said Mr. Ruch, the director.Here in the Sierra foothills of Nevada, off-road bikes have torn up grasslands and ripped into areas clearly marked off-limits. At one trailhead, a sign and a kiosk newly installed by the Forest Service were spray-painted with graffiti.Within three miles of downtown Reno, Mr. Leveille pointed to a rock-sheltered archaeological site, where natives centuries ago left pictographs, a series of ancient stories etched in stone. Rangers have caught people chipping away at the artifacts. And now they do not dare put up any signs of the pictographs’ presence.“We can’t say, This is an archaeological area; don’t loot it,” Mr. Leveille said. “That would be like putting cases of beer here and saying, Don’t drink it.”'"
"'06-07-26,'0','Constructive play helps children develop social skills while laying an important foundation for reading and math, said Dominic F. Gullo, a professor of elementary and early childhood education at Queens College.For example, he explained, children who set up a pretend post office or a restaurant in what is called a “dramatic play area” learn how to take turns, how to speak clearly to one another, and how to make up their own stories — stories that are the foundation for writing.Playing with blocks teaches children the basics of math as they learn that two small blocks put together have the same length as one long block.Children who never learn to play with one another — who rely on grown-ups to resolve disputes — never learn the self-regulation and teamwork for their adulthood.Professor Gullo said the trend toward more academics in kindergarten cut across urban, suburban and rural areas and across social classes.“For this age, play is work,” said Carmen Fariña, who retired this month as a deputy schools chancellor for the New York City Department of Education, and who has been a teacher and principal as well.David Cantor, the department spokesman, said the agency wanted kindergartens to have play areas and to emphasize the importance of play.But teachers say the message that play matters does not reach the classroom.“The play kitchen, I had to remove it to make space for the math station and the reading station,” said Patricia Wilson, a kindergarten teacher at Public School 28 in the Tremont section of the Bronx. “The dress-up area, I miss it. If a child is timid, playing in the dress-up area helps him make friends.”Milagros Perez, a kindergarten teacher in the same school, agreed. “They do need to socialize and learn to share,” she said of the children. “They need that interaction with their peers. That has been lost. There is a lot of fighting now.”The pressure to make kindergarten more academic can be especially intense in poorer neighborhoods. Schools there, struggling to meet the demands of the federal law known as No Child Left Behind, are ratcheting up academic expectations.“Our real mission is closing the achievement gap,” said Diahann Billings-Burford, director of external relations for Achievement First in New York.At Achievement First, classes run from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the school year, with gym, music and dance in the afternoon; in July, the school day goes from 7:30 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. with only academic classes.ON the recent morning, the children in Mrs. Rattray’s and Mr. Gonzalez’s classroom read aloud from a story about a girl named Ann who brought her dog, Dan, to school. Then they filled out worksheets with questions like “Where did Dan go?” and “Who is Ann?”One girl, slumped in her chair, twisted the hem of her skirt. A boy rocked in his chair. Another boy sucked his thumb and, with his other hand, wrote the answers on the worksheet on a clipboard.Mrs. Rattray said that ideally, every child would have time to play with blocks and a dress-up corner. But we do not live in an ideal world, she added, and the order and structure of Achievement First is a big improvement over the chaos of many urban schools. The children are reading, a big accomplishment.“Achievement First gives them a solid foundation,” she said.But even as she took pride in her students’ progress, Mrs. Rattray betrayed ambivalence about the method. “If it were my own child,” she said, “I would want more time for play.”'"
"'06-07-26,'0','“This parallels what Dr. King was doing in Memphis when he was killed,” said the Rev. Eric Lee, chief operating officer of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles. “He was speaking out on behalf of African-American sanitation workers, who had poor wages and poor working conditions, and it’s the same thing for security officers here.”William Julius Wilson, a professor of sociology and social policy at Harvard, calls the drive “a very important development for black workers with low to modest levels of education.”“The position of the African-American worker in today’s labor market,” Professor Wilson said, “has been severely weakened because of job losses, the decline in manufacturing and the union movement’s downward spiral.”Many African-Americans recall that when Southern blacks moved north, it was unions that helped lift large numbers of them into the middle class. Later, however, blacks’ enthusiasm for organized labor waned, given some unions’ discrimination against them and, more recently, a focus on attracting low-wage Hispanic immigrants as crucial to ending labor’s decline.But the service employees say they have obtained the signatures of most of the 6,000 guards they are trying to organize here this summer. One supporter is Mr. Johnson, who hopes that the raise he expects to get as a union member will help him buy a four-bedroom home for his family of six so they can leave their cramped two-bedroom apartment.“We’re trying to get a house,” he said, “but we can’t afford the house payments.”Though many building owners and security companies are unenthusiastic about the organizing drive, they have not resisted as fiercely as employers typically do. They decline to say why, but may have concluded that digging in would be unwise, considering the strong support for the drive from clergy members and politicians, as well as the service employees’ record of success.Using tactics that have included sit-ins and the picketing of executives’ homes, the union has organized far more workers than any other in the last decade.Robert Rediger, the chief lawyer for the city’s security contractors, declined to address the union’s assertion that the guards were underpaid. Rather, Mr. Rediger took a cooperative tone, saying the two sides would meet in August to discuss procedures that could quickly lead to unionization in the office buildings.Officials of the city’s five largest security companies either declined to comment or did not return phone calls.Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has urged the employers not to battle unionization, seeing it as a way of advancing his efforts to reduce poverty in South Los Angeles and of improving security as well. Low wages, he said, have led to extremely high turnover, leaving many guards with little training and a lack of familiarity with their buildings and tenants.“I didn’t raise this as just a labor-management issue,” Mr. Villaraigosa said, “but as a homeland security issue.”Among the service employees’ successes has been the organizing of thousands of Los Angeles janitors, who now average some $2.50 an hour more than the guards and, unlike most guards, have employer-paid health insurance. Andrew L. Stern, the union’s president, noted that nonunion guards often worked in the same buildings as unionized janitors.“They’re doing jobs that require more skill,” Mr. Stern said, “but they’re paid less in wages and benefits. It’s pure exploitation of African-American workers.”The organizing is just the kind of ambitious effort that the service employees and other unions that quit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last year said they would undertake. The service employees have unionized 4,000 security guards in the San Francisco area, 1,500 in Minneapolis-St. Paul and, of some 40,000 guards in New York City, about 4,000 there. They are also seeking to organize guards in Boston, Seattle, Sacramento and Washington.The Rev. Lawrence E. Logan, senior pastor at Bethel A.M.E. Church, said he expected unionization here to lift black neighborhoods by improving wages, providing families health insurance and enabling many guards to work one job instead of two so they can spend more time with their children.Thinking back decades, Mr. Logan recalled, “Dr. King used to say that any religion that tries to save the soul but doesn’t do anything that deals with the conditions that damn the soul is a dry-as-dirt, do-nothing religion.”'"
"'06-07-26,'0','“For anyone to imply that we didn’t cooperate with central baseball, it’s false,” Cashman said.Cashman would not say how he would have reacted if Watson had asked about Hughes. But, in a way, he answered the question by noting that the Yankees have Hughes on an innings limit this season. Cashman has vowed not to include Hughes in possible trades for players like Alfonso Soriano and Bobby Abreu.The Yankees have been protective of Hughes, their prized prospect who turned 20 last month. Hughes, a right-hander with a 95-mile-an-hour fastball, has a 6-3 record and a 2.85 earned run average for Trenton. He has struck out 90 and walked 25 in 82 innings, after pitching 30 innings for Class A Tampa to begin the season.As Watson tries to assemble the most talented 24-man roster possible and make up for what he called the embarrassment of the United States baseball team’s not qualifying for the 2004 Olympics, he is dealing with some obstacles. He cannot simply pick the best players because they may not be available in another month.Since the 12-team tournament will be played from Aug. 26 to Sept. 6 in Cuba, it conflicts with the Sept. 1 date for expanding major league rosters to 40, from 25. The players Watson is considering for the United States team cannot be on 25-man rosters, but most of the players he would prefer are candidates to be promoted after rosters expand.Watson said it was “very tricky” trying to determine which players might still be in the minors in early August, which is when he wants to complete the roster.Mets outfielder Lastings Milledge and Tampa Bay infielder B. J. Upton are on the preliminary roster. But if the Devil Rays trade shortstop Julio Lugo by Monday’s nonwaiver trade deadline, as they are expected to do, Upton will almost certainly be promoted to the majors and will no longer be a candidate for the team. Watson said Milledge’s situation would become clearer in a few weeks.“If Lastings Milledge is not in the big leagues on Aug. 16, we have a good chance to get him,” Watson said. “If he’s in the big leagues, there’s no chance.”Other players on the preliminary roster are Delmon Young, a Class AAA outfielder for the Devil Rays; Alex Gordon, a Class AA third baseman for the Kansas City Royals; Homer Bailey, a Class AA pitcher with the Cincinnati Reds; Chris Denorfia, an outfielder the Reds recently recalled from Class AAA; Matt Lindstrom, a Class AA reliever with the Mets; and Curtis Pride, who has played for six major league teams in his career. The former major league manager Davey Johnson is the United States manager.Watson has spoken to the general mangers of all 30 major league teams and told them that the players who commit to playing would stay with the United States team for the duration of the tournament, a prospect that could be dicey for teams. For instance, if a player was picked and his team later had some injuries and wanted him to leave Cuba, Watson said that would not be possible.“There are no flights leaving Cuba on Sept. 1,” Watson said.There are two six-team groups in qualifying, and the winner of each will advance to Beijing. The United States is in a group with Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Canada, Brazil and Aruba. The other group consists of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Panama, Nicaragua and Colombia.The third- and fourth-place teams will have another chance at qualifying for a chance to win what will be the final Olympic baseball gold medal during a supplemental tournament next year. After 2008, baseball will be eliminated as an Olympic sport.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','Nearly five years after Sept. 11, Congress has still not passed a law reducing the risk of mass casualties from an attack on a chemical plant. A bill has been slowly working its way through the Senate and the House, but the chemical industry is committed to making it so weak that it could actually make plants less safe. The House Homeland Security Committee is expected to vote tomorrow on two amendments that are important to making this a real chemical plant security bill.The first amendment would require some high-risk chemical plants to replace the most dangerous chemicals with safer alternatives. It is a relatively mild proposal, since it does not cover all plants, and it gives the plants a large role in the decision about which safer technologies they should adopt. But the industry is fighting for its right to use whatever chemicals it deems best, or most profitable, no matter how much risk that poses to people who live, work and attend school nearby.A second critical amendment would make clear that states have the right to regulate chemical plant safety more strictly than the federal government. The chemical industry wants the federal bill to expressly pre-empt, or invalidate, state safety rules. It says it wants a single national standard to avoid “confusion.” But what the industry really wants is a weak national standard that prevents states from taking a more serious approach to the terrorist threat.Tomorrow’s votes will likely be decided by a few moderate Republicans, including Christopher Shays and Rob Simmons of Connecticut, and Curt Weldon and Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania.

"'06-07-26,'0','“Ghosn can make mistakes, too,” said Koji Endo, an auto analyst in Tokyo for Credit Suisse First Boston. “He pulled off a huge turnaround, but now he’s struggling to take Nissan to the next stage.”Nissan said sales would bounce back later in the year, as eight new models hit worldwide showrooms, including new versions of its Altima and Sentra sedans. But analysts faulted the company for not spacing out new models more evenly, and for failing to keep up with Honda and Toyota in fuel-saving technologies, like hybrid vehicles.The company is also struggling to overcome quality problems. While other carmakers, like Toyota, have also experienced rising recalls in recent years, analysts said Nissan’s problems were rooted in a drive to ramp up production too quickly at new factories like one in Canton, Ala.Nissan said it took a charge of 23 billion yen ($197 million) in the quarter to cover the costs of a voluntary recall of Altimas built in American factories from January to May. The action was taken after reports that the vehicles’ engines burn oil too quickly and could catch fire.On Monday, the company announced another recall, this one involving 135,000 minivans in Japan.There’s “no end in sight to the quality problems,” Takaki Nakanishi, an auto analyst in Tokyo for J. P. Morgan Securities wrote in a report. He wrote that if Nissan did not fix the source of these problems soon, it could suffer damage to its reputation that “can not only hurt near-term earnings but also do lasting damage to brand value.”Nissan said that as new models are rolled out later this year, it expects a pickup in sales that will more than make up for declines in the quarter. The company said it was sticking with its original forecast of posting a net profit of 523 billion yen ($4.5 billion) in the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2007.“We will have a year with two halves,” said Simon Sproule, a Nissan corporate vice president in charge of global communications. “In the second half, we will come on very strong.”The company also said it benefited in the first quarter from a stronger dollar, which raises the value in yen of overseas profits. Because of the currency move, Nissan’s total sales in the first quarter actually rose 3.1 percent, to 2.2 trillion yen, despite the declines in numbers of vehicles sold, the company said.Another bright spot for the company was China, where the number of vehicles sold rose 42.6 percent in the quarter, to 92,400.Still, analysts said the wide range of difficulties facing the company could be a warning that Mr. Ghosn is not paying close enough attention to Nissan and has instead spread himself too thin between the Tokyo-based company and Renault in Paris. Some analysts have raised questions about whether he could add a third company, especially one as large and complex as G.M.They said the troubles reflected a lack of longer-term vision by Mr. Ghosn, who has had mixed results in maintaining growth at the revitalized company. But analysts also note that Mr. Ghosn saved Nissan by squeezing fat and restoring employee morale, exactly the sorts of skills that he would need to accomplish a quick turnaround at G.M.“Ghosn has a strong short-term focus on cutting costs,” Mr. Endo said. “His strategy is closer to the Big Three” than the traditional Japanese focus on longer-term investments.Mr. Endo said Mr. Ghosn had also erred by following Detroit in another way: by giving Nissan a product lineup that relied too heavily on gas-guzzling pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. Mr. Endo said this had hurt Nissan as soaring gas prices drive consumers to smaller, more efficient vehicles like those offered by Honda and Toyota.Nissan’s recent difficulties stand in contrast to Honda and Toyota, which are expected to post strong profits and strong sales gains when they report earnings in coming weeks.These concerns have been reflected in Nissan’s stock, which has dropped 19.2 percent over the last three months. On Tuesday, Nissan’s stock ended up 28 yen, at 1,180 yen. The earnings announcement came after the close of trading.'"

"'06-07-26,'0','“I’m just here to tell you some things I’ve figured out,” said Melissa Etheridge, strumming an acoustic guitar. It was a casual interjection, not the kind of statement most artists would use to elicit applause. But it met with a full-blooded roar on Monday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, as Ms. Etheridge must have expected it would.After all, her fans understood the things she was referring to. They were no doubt aware of the breast cancer that cut short Ms. Etheridge’s last tour, in 2004. And they surely knew about her triumphant return to the spotlight on last year’s Grammy Awards, when she acknowledged something that had long been an open secret: her stylistic debt to Janis Joplin.That performance, a soul-rattling rendition of “Piece of My Heart,” was immediately inscribed as legend, and not just because it was the rare Grammy production that jolted the senses and still made sense. Ms. Etheridge, recovering from her treatments, took the stage with her head uncovered, laying bare her vulnerability and yet — through the force of her presence — signaling her will to fight.Ms. Etheridge included a studio version of “Piece of My Heart” on her first greatest-hits album, “The Road Less Traveled” (Island), released late last year. She also featured “I Run for Life,” an inspirational anthem for breast cancer survivors, a group well represented on Monday night, as Ms. Etheridge confirmed by asking for a show of hands.Struggle has always anchored Ms. Etheridge’s music, providing her with either a thrashing heart or a wounded soul. She gave most of the concert over to familiar songs of misplaced passion, like “I Want to Come Over,” or of humiliated rage, like “I’m the Only One.”Backed simply but effectively by some longtime collaborators — the guitarist Philip Sayce, the bassist Mark Brown and the drummer Fritz Lewak — Ms. Etheridge gave each big chorus the additional heft of her voice, still a raspy and incandescent howl.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','“This is the season for peas,” Mr. Bouley explained. “They’re so delicious, you can’t ruin them.” He’ll make you think you can cook peas as well as he does, at least until you get home.At the latest cooking demonstration in mid-June, 10 students, including this reporter, gathered at three rows of tables facing Mr. Bouley’s sparkling copper-and-stainless-steel private kitchen for a class about fish. (Advance registration: davidbouley.com).Against a long wall of slate — “I bought it in Massachusetts,” Mr. Bouley told us, in case we might be in the market for a 200-square-foot blackboard — he and his colleagues had written, in chalk, a huge display of possible menu items being tested here. On this night, seven men (including an amateur fisherman and a college professor) and three women (including a financial advisor and a museum curator) sat in rapt attention, scribbling detailed notes on the chef’s rambling sermon.The scheduled 6 p.m. class began, by Bouley standards, remarkably promptly at 6:20 p.m.; having never arrived anywhere early in his life, he would find it illogical to change now.As he swept into the room from behind, he was greeted by two students who had heard rumors that the 53-year-old Mr. Bouley, a longstanding bachelor whose salt-and-pepper hair has turned mostly salt, is engaged. The chef’s green eyes twinkled as he confirmed the news that Aug. 24 is his wedding day.He then began a commentary that would not stop for four hours. It was a tilt-a-whirl of tips, opinions, tastes and philosophy accompanied by an unlimited supply of white wine — a Neil Ellis 2004 Sauvignon Blanc from South Africa, a classically quirky Bouley choice — and a four-course Bouley fish menu of dishes loosely based on recipes provided to students inside a lovely Bouley menu sleeve.“Recipes?” Mr. Bouley replied incredulously to one student, who asked him to explain why his chefs don’t seem to be following them. “I don’t follow recipes. I never had a friend who became a good chef by following a recipe. You’ll never make it to Page 2, with recipes.”For most of the class, Mr. Bouley stood in front of his kitchen. Three young chefs labored nonstop for two hours over pans and cutting boards in the background to prepare his dishes.Every so often, Mr. Bouley picked up a platter and carried it around the room like a proud papa, but most of the evening he was too busy trying to remember the name of the New Jersey store where he buys his soy sauce (Mitsuya, in Edgewater) or the downtown grocery where he gets his Thai ingredients (Bangkok Center Grocery on Mosco Street).That didn’t deter students in search of useful cooking tips. One asked Mr. Bouley point-blank what he should do with a piece of salmon for 10 guests next weekend.“Do you want to spend the evening cooking or talking to your friends?” Mr. Bouley asked, flashing his crooked smile. Without waiting for the reply, he offered the closest thing any student would get to a real recipe that night.“Fillet it and roast it,” he said.It is at such moments that students may feel that Mr. Bouley’s professional skills and fancy kitchens give him a slightly unfair advantage over hoi polloi. I mean, when he instructed his chefs to cook the salmon with a blow torch, I had to say to myself, that isn’t happening in my apartment.'"
"'06-07-26,'0','These new places, often open late and in prime locations, have also made fans of New Yorkers who may have previously known nothing about Israeli cuisine beyond fast-food falafel.A walking tour of five new downtown spots offers a glimpse of the vibrant mix of stews, sandwiches and sweets eaten on the go in good times and in bad from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Start off at Taim, a diminutive falafel-focused spot at 222 Waverly Place (Seventh Avenue South); (212) 691-1287. Taim was among the first to offer the sabich, a pita sandwich of fried eggplant and hard-cooked egg that is as popular in Israel as cheese steaks are in Philadelphia. Traditional condiments for a sabich include pickles, onion, tahini and two types of hot sauce: yellow amba, which is mango based, and red pepper harissa.“In the last five years it’s become a really big sandwich, eaten everywhere,” said Einat Admony, Taim’s chef.The sabich entered the Israeli fast-food pantheon thanks largely to Oved, a one-name-only purveyor in the Tel Aviv suburb of Givatayim. At Oved’s namesake shop, the hot sauce ratios are expressed in soccer score terms using local rivals. For example, Maccabi 2 to Hapoel 1 (Maccabi’s team colors include yellow, Hapoel’s red) would be two parts amba, which is yellow, to one part harissa, which is red. Oved’s shtick helped launch a national sandwich craze.Today, the sabich is making a play in New York. Last year it showed up at Chickpea, 23 Third Avenue (St. Marks Place), with a branch at 210 East 14th Street; (212) 254-9500. The co-owner, Erez Itzhaki, held a contest to give the sandwich a new name.“We wanted to choose a name that would be more friendly,” he said.The result? The Chickplant, which is stuffed into fluffy house-baked pita. Hot sauces come in squeeze bottles.A lower calorie riff on the sabich, with eggplant that is grilled, not fried, is on the menu at Aroma, the first stateside branch of Israel’s largest coffee chain, which opened this month at 145 Greene Street (Houston Street); (212) 533-1094.“In Israel we call it an Iraqi sandwich,” said Hanoch Milwidsky, the head of the company’s New York operation. “We’re going to change the name here for obvious reasons.” In New York it will be called the oriental sandwich.The shop, the first of many planned in the United States, will have its own bakery producing another beloved Israeli snack, the stuffed cheese, meat and veggie pies known as burekas. These puff-pastry pies, of Turkish and Balkan origin, come in many forms. Tiny ones from a Brooklyn bakery are sold at Holyland Market, a two-year-old spot at 122 St. Marks Place (First Avenue); (212) 477-4440. The larger incarnation, called the Treat Bureka, which Aroma serves, will be offered “complet,” as they say in Israel: filled to order with a hard-cooked egg, tahini and pickles.Aroma, with its healthy focus, is not offering the one dish that most reminds Israelis of home: schnitzel. The Israeli version of this German dish replaces veal or pork with chicken or turkey and is usually served with fries and a salad or stuffed into French bread or pita.“There’s a competition that goes on” over whose mother makes the best schnitzel, said Ido Ben-Shmuel, a Jerusalem native and Paris-trained chef now in New York. “Some use panko or even crushed corn flakes. My favorite is the simplest, with bread crumbs, salt and pepper.”At the cheerful Yummy Shawarmy, 71 Seventh Avenue South (Bleecker Street), (212) 989-7170, the menu lists Schnitzel From Your Mother’s Kitchen, available in a sandwich or on a platter. The owner, Kobi Weichman, uses extra-crispy pounded chicken. He also offers shakshuka, an all-day breakfast of runny eggs with slow-simmered tomatoes and peppers. Of North African origin, it long ago entered the national repertory.At Hummus Place, which added shakshuka to its menu last year, Mr. Apple presents the dish in its own frying pan, just as it is served at Dr. Shakshuka, the eatery in Haifa, Israel.“We wanted to give something a little different, something traditional,” said Mr. Apple, who opened his third Hummus Place this month on the Upper West Side (the other locations are 109 St. Marks Place (First Avenue), (212) 529-9198; and 99 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, (212) 533-3089).At all three, meals end with cardamom-scented Turkish coffee and malabi, a fragrant panna-cotta-like custard cooked with vanilla and rosewater and topped with almonds, coconut and sweet rose syrup.Chaim Cohen, a Tel Aviv chef who is a consultant at Taboon in Hell’s Kitchen, hopes to serve a malabi offshoot next winter — a warm cinnamon-scented drink called sachlab. It will be one of the restaurant’s many high-end takes on the simple food offered at the new places downtown.“I think what people really like are street food flavors,” Mr. Cohen said. “If you miss something about home it’s this kind of food.”'"

"'06-07-26,'0','Some analysts think Iran is now debating internally whether to cut off its oil exports if it is threatened, either as a result of the Lebanon conflict or over its nuclear ambitions. Iran has sent contradictory signals, with a key nuclear negotiator, Javad Vaeedi, saying in March that Iran would consider such a move, only to have Iran’s oil minister say later the same day it would not.Any step by Iran to cut off its own oil revenues would be so hard politically for the government in Tehran that many experts say it would not be tempted to go down that road.But even a temporary shut-off would be a huge psychological blow to the global market, and Iranian leaders may calculate that there would be an advantage in the economic damage to Europe and the United States.For months, the United States has sought to tighten the noose around Iran by getting the United Nations Security Council to threaten sanctions over its suspected nuclear weapons program. Iran says its nuclear program is civilian in nature.Russia, China and some European leaders, fearful that Iran could follow through on its threat to turn off the oil spigot in reply, even if temporarily, have resisted.The difficulty of getting other countries to cooperate aside, even American officials acknowledge that any sanctions would exclude Iran’s energy sector.Given Iran’s dependence on oil exports for income that supports a broad range of subsidies for food, fuel and other necessities for its people, excluding energy from any sanctions plan raises real questions about how effective such a step would be.American officials acknowledge that oil complicates American diplomacy but insist that they will not alter basic policies, especially on Iran, which the West accuses of supporting groups like Hezbollah and Hamas.“The fact that Iran has oil power has not made one whit of difference in our determination to stop them from acquiring nuclear weapons,” said R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs. “I don’t think it has with our allies, either. We are not going to allow Iran’s supposed oil power to exert any leverage over us.”But Iran’s ability to rebuff the West on these matters has only increased as oil prices have risen from about $27 a barrel at the start of the Iraq war, to $65 a barrel in the spring as tensions rose over Iran’s nuclear program, to $75 on Monday as the conflict continued in Lebanon.Indeed, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, each $5 increase in oil prices translates into $85 million a week for Iran’s bank account, emboldening its leaders and making whatever aid it supplies to Hezbollah easier to finance even as the crisis threatens to spread.“Oil has been embedded in our diplomacy for decades,” said Stuart E. Eizenstat, who was an aide to President Jimmy Carter and undersecretary of state for economics under President Bill Clinton. “It’s always given producing countries leverage, but now that leverage is magnified more than ever before.”Oil has also always had ramifications for the United States’ domestic politics. Iran’s new leverage comes not just from its rising oil revenues but also because the price of gasoline at the pump is a potentially damaging liability for the Bush administration, as it has been for other American presidents.At least since 1973, the year of the last full-scale war between Israel and its neighbors and the imposition of an OPEC oil embargo, oil has occupied a central space in the American political psyche. Six years after the oil shock came the overthrow of the shah of Iran, the doubling of oil prices and gas lines at home that helped hustle President Carter from office.Today the Bush administration faces rising criticism from hard-liners that its Iran policy is not stiff enough. But if the diplomatic course is challenging, the military options may be more treacherous and, analysts say, would almost certainly drive the price of oil even higher.That possibility has not stopped conservatives like William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, who was a major booster of the decision to wage war on Iraq, from calling for an airstrike on Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons facilities.Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a speech this year, “No one who is honestly assessing the decline of American leverage around the world due to our energy dependence can fail to see that energy is the albatross of U.S. national security.”Indeed, the extraordinary power of oil to transform world politics today extends far beyond Iran, or even the Middle East.In April, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complained that the hunt for oil and gas was “distorting international politics in a very major way.” Now that comment is turning out to be both prophecy and understatement.New oil money has given not only Iran but also Russia more resources to resist Western pressure. As he played host to the Group of 8 summit meeting in St. Petersburg last week, President Vladimir V. Putin was able to swat away criticism from President Bush about Russian domestic and foreign policies.He boasted, in fact, that Russia’s oil, natural gas and nuclear energy capacities made it the biggest energy player in the world.Months before the summit meeting, Russia was hoping to use the final communiqué to endorse its approach on energy, in which the state basically controls the oil sector. The Bush administration joined with Europe to block such an endorsement, American officials say.But energy remains a major American irritant with Russia and by extension China.The Bush administration has stepped up its efforts to support pipelines that would carry oil and natural gas to the West, bypassing Russian territory.Russia, in turn, has pressured Central Asian countries to oppose American energy projects and the use of the area for military bases.To do that, Russia has joined with China to mobilize a five-year-old group called the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, whose members include several Central Asian countries. The Defense Department is even worried that the group could move from its focus on energy to become a military alliance to rival NATO.Many American analysts say energy issues are driving Russia and China into each other’s arms politically, and that if anything American policies are accelerating the trend.Meanwhile, the new oil politics are rearranging the international playing board, not simply giving Iran latitude in the Middle East but allowing Venezuela, for another example, to try to blunt Washington’s influence in Latin America.“We are seeing a radical change in how countries like Russia, Iran and Venezuela on the supply side, and China and India on the demand side, bring the world marketplace to bear on foreign policy,” said Carlos Pascual, a former top aide to Ms. Rice and now foreign policy studies director at the Brookings Institution.“I don’t think any of us have done a terribly good job of thinking through how far behind the eight ball we are on these issues,” he said.Published in the International section on July 25, 2006.'"

"'06-07-27,'0','“Take him away, damn it, finish him off there,” he said, according to the transcript accepted by the court. General Baranov uttered an epithet.Then he continued: “That’s the whole order. Get him out of here, damn it. Come on, come one, come on, do it, take him away, finish him off, shoot him.”Mr. Yandiyev was videotaped being led away. He has not been seen since.General Baranov has been awarded the Hero of Russia medal and promoted. He now serves as the head of Russia’s military forces in the North Caucasus.After seeing the videotape, Mr. Yandiyev’s mother, Fatima S. Bazorkina, searched for her son in vain. She eventually filed a complaint with the European court. Russia, having ratified the European Convention on Human Rights in 1998, falls under the court’s jurisdiction.The decision released today — the first decision the court has made on a disappearance in Chechnya — found that Russia was liable for Mr. Yandiyev’s death. Russia had neither investigated the disappearance in a timely and thorough manner nor provided his mother any explanation of his disappearance, the ruling said. And Mr. Yandiyev had never been logged into the appropriate custody records, it further noted, obscuring the trail from the beginning.“The Court considered that fact in itself to be a most serious failing, since it enabled those responsible for an act of deprivation of liberty to conceal their involvement in a crime, to cover their tracks and to escape accountability for the fate of a detainee,” the ruling said.The court ordered Russia to pay more than $44,000 to Ms. Bazorkina, as well as more than $15,000 in her legal expenses.Russia has three months to appeal. A spokesman for the North Caucasus Military District, which General Baranov now commands, declined to comment, saying the Russian military had not yet reviewed the decision.Ole E. Solvang, director of the Stichting Russian Justice Initiative, a private organization that helped Ms. Bazorkina pursue the case, said he expects that Russia would pay the judgment.“There is little doubt that Russia will pay the money,” Mr. Solvang said. “The bigger issue will be in terms of properly investigating this case and prosecuting the people who are responsible for this disappearance and to undertake appropriate measures to make sure that this cannot happen again.”Ms. Bazorkina said that while she would like the verdict to help her learn the full truth of her son’s disappearance, and to prosecute General Baranov and other soldiers, she is realistic. “Of course it will be difficult,” she said. “It is very difficult to fight a general.”Disappearances have been one of the most chilling aspects of the second Chechen war. The human rights organization, Memorial, estimates that as many as 5,000 people have vanished after detention or roundups during the war. Almost all are presumed dead, and Chechens blame Russian forces or their pro-Kremlin local proxies.But lines of responsibility, while widely accepted as pointing to Russia, have been difficult to prove.Russia insists that the number of people who have disappeared is smaller, and says its own investigations have found that the reported number of abductions is inflated because the tally includes runaways and refugees. It also says families in the Caucasus report their sons missing or abducted when they actually have left home to join the rebels.Rights groups counter that their own estimate is conservative, because many families, fearing the authorities or having no faith that Russia will honestly investigate their claims, do not bother to report the disappearances or kidnappings.Roughly 200 more cases of grave human rights abuses in Chechnya are before the court. Mr. Solvang said this decision — unanimously accepted by seven judges, including a Russian — could help push the Russian government to account for the abuses committed in the Chechen wars.“It has the potential to be effective,” he said.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','The EMI Group, the British music giant, has decided to call off its efforts to merge with the Warner Music Group, ending for now the possibility that two of the music industry’s leading companies could combine.The decision by EMI comes after each company rejected takeover offers from the other, and after a European court ruling raised doubts about whether a merger could win regulatory approval.EMI said today that those two factors led it to abandon plans for a merger. Pointedly, however, EMI did not rule out bidding for Warner in the future.“When the board of EMI put forward its proposals to acquire Warner Music, it believed, and continues to believe, that there are good arguments for regulatory approval of a combination,” EMI said in a statement.Last month, Warner’s board rejected EMI’s latest offer of $31 a share, which valued Warner at about $4.6 billion, after a series of bids and counterbids that started in May.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','Anna Hinken, a US-Visit spokeswoman, said that requiring legal permanent residents to undergo such a check would make it possible to intercept people who were using a stolen or fraudulent legal permanent resident card, or green card, to enter the United States illegally.It will also comply with a legal requirement that the Homeland Security Department use biometrics to confirm the validity of government-issued travel documents at the border, she said.“This will make people safer,” Ms. Hinken said, “because no one can steal their permanent resident card and pretend to be them.”The new review system, which would not be put into effect for several months, would affect an estimated one million people a year, Ms. Hinken said; that represents the approximate number of times that legal permanent residents re-enter the United States after having traveled abroad.But some immigrant advocates said the plan was reminiscent of the effort, started after the 2001 terrorist attacks, to require Middle Eastern and South Asian men on temporary visas in the United States to register with federal authorities.“The security measures required to become legal permanent residents in the first place are sufficient to guarantee our homeland security,” said Shirley Lin, a spokeswoman for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York. “This is an unnecessary measure that sends a wrong signal to those expressing their desire to become a full part of United States society.”The announcement on Thursday will involve just a proposed rule, meaning there will be a 30-day comment period before the changes could become final, Ms. Hinken said.Besides extending the requirements to legal permanent residents, officials want to start doing the reviews for some Canadian visitors, Ms. Hinken said.The proposed system would not affect most Canadians who visit the United States as tourists or Mexicans entering the United States with a government-issued border crossing card. The requirement would just apply to some Canadians entering the United States with work visas.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','The EMI Group, the British music giant, has decided to call off, for now, its efforts to merge with a rival, the Warner Music Group, executives briefed on the two companies’ negotiations said yesterday.The decision by EMI comes after the two companies rejected each other’s escalating takeover offers and after a European court ruling that raised doubts about regulatory approval of such a deal.EMI is expected to make a formal announcement today, ending the latest round of deal-making efforts between the corporations, which have circled each other for several years.Last month, Warner’s board rejected EMI’s offer of $31 a share, which valued the company at about $4.6 billion, after a series of bids and counterbids that started in May.EMI’s move comes two weeks after the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg overturned regulators’ approval in 2004 of a merger of the music units of Sony and Bertelsmann, plunging the industry into confusion. The ruling means regulators will re-examine the Sony-Bertelsmann venture, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a process that could take as long as a year. Analysts, however, do not expect the venture to be unwound.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','Maine, who was acquired with Jorge Julio in the January deal that sent Kris Benson to Baltimore, followed Friday’s shutout against the Houston Astros by throwing seven more scoreless innings to extend his shutout streak to 17. He allowed three hits, all singles, and walked three while striking out seven. His earned run average has dropped to 2.45 from 5.40 on July 3, and he is making Randolph’s decision on the pitching staff a difficult one.“The whole deal is to bridge the gap between potential and performance,” said the Mets’ pitching coach, Rick Peterson. “He’s closing the gap quick.”Maine relied on his sneaky fastball, a pitch that appears to accelerate as it hurtles through the strike zone, and his slider and changeup to sail through the early going. He allowed only two singles to Aramis Ramírez. In the sixth, Juan Pierre had a one-out bunt single, and Maine compounded the trouble by walking Todd Walker.“I just got in his face and challenged him to finish up strong,” Randolph said.Maine struck out Ramírez on three pitches, the last one a 93-mile-an-hour fastball. Against Jacque Jones, Maine fought back from a 2-0 count to induce an inning-ending groundout. In the seventh, Maine struck out Michael Barrett, John Mabry and, after a walk to Ángel Pagán, he struck out Ronny Cedeño to retire the side. “It’s more of a confidence thing,” Maine said. “Before, I thought I had to make the perfect pitch in every situation.”Despite his success yesterday, Maine is not guaranteed another start. Orlando Hernández will pitch Saturday and Tom Glavine on Sunday. But that is as far as Randolph is willing to announce. “We’ll see,” Randolph said. “He needs to solidify a spot. Seventeen scoreless innings for him right now, that’s good.”Maine is competing with Pelfrey, Hernández and, perhaps, another pitcher or two currently wearing other uniforms for the final two slots. The Mets are searching to upgrade their starting pitching, but they will not make a trade for the sake of making one. A few months ago, the Mets may have also been pursuing a second baseman. But Valentín’s inspired play has made that a moot point.Valentín began the year 0 for 15. On May 27, he was batting .214. During that series in Florida, Randolph replaced Kazuo Matsui with Valentín at second base. Since then, Valentín has emerged as an integral part of the lineup, batting anywhere from leadoff (in José Reyes’s absence) to seventh or eighth. Since Valentín began playing regularly, he has hit .314 with 9 homers and 32 runs batted in. “He’s been probably our M.V.P. in a lot of ways,” Randolph said.It was Valentín — not Beltrán, David Wright or Carlos Delgado — who stopped the Cubs’ no-hit effort with a bloop single against Roberto Novoa in the seventh. The Chicago starter, Mark Prior, left with two outs in the sixth with the bid still intact. He was replaced because he had walked five batters to send his pitch count soaring.The Mets pressured the Cubs in the eighth, but Delgado stranded runners on second and third. In the ninth, Cliff Floyd left runners at first and third.The Mets’ 10th-inning rally began with a two-out single by Beltrán. Delgado followed by fisting a double down the third-base line, away from an infield playing him to pull to right. Glendon Rusch intentionally walked Wright to load the bases for Valentín, who has two grand slams in the past three weeks. But this time, Valentín did not need to hit the ball that far. With a compact swing, he roped a shot to shallow center.The Mets mobbed Valentín after he touched first base, throwing fake punches and pretending to stamp on him. Valentín dropped to the grass and rolled around to avoid injury, he joked.“You don’t want to do that too often,” Valentín said. “I’ve seen guys get on the disabled list after that. But it’s a great feeling.”Perhaps thinking ahead, Maine stayed on the periphery of the fray. He did not need to risk getting hurt, either. His right arm is too valuable these days.Even though the Mets will not say it publicly, they will not permit Lastings Milledge to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2008 Beijing Olympics that begins next month. The Mets intend to recall Milledge from the minor leagues when rosters expand Sept. 1. ... The Mets are expected to option Heath Bell to Class AAA Norfolk when they activate Pedro Martínez from the disabled list. ... Brian Bannister, recovering from a hamstring injury, made his first rehab start last night, pitching for Class A St. Lucie. He allowed four runs, three earned, and six hits in five innings. He struck out one and walked four.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 26 — To punctuate an almost untouched 30-yard touchdown run in the national championship game against Southern California, the Texas sophomore running back Ramonce Taylor boldly thrust the ball across the goal line with his left hand.Through photographs, Taylor’s celebration has become immortalized in Longhorn lore.But Taylor, 20, will not be immortalized in any more photos as a Longhorn. This week, Texas announced that he was transferring, two months after he was hit with a state felony charge of marijuana possession. On May 14, sheriff’s deputies in Bell County, Tex., said they found four pounds of marijuana in his car.Taylor is expected to transfer to a team in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and would be eligible to play immediately.Texas issued a statement in which Taylor said of his transfer: “Frederick Douglass once said, ‘No struggle, no progress.’ I’ve had my share of struggles, and now it’s time for progress.”The arrest of Taylor, who scored 15 touchdowns last season, had been Texas’ most significant off-field problem since winning the national championship, but it pales in comparison to the troubles experienced by Southern California.'"

Using special software, the Nano then becomes a training partner, providing time, distance and speed information on its color screen or via voice prompts piped through the headphones.Once you reach home, the Nike+iPod can connect to your PC or Mac and upload data about your run.The kit, available online for $30, works best with the Nike+ line of shoes, which cost about $100. The shoes have a small hole in the instep that cushions the sensor. The sensor itself weighs less than an ounce, so you won’t notice it during your wind sprints.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','Mr. Neupert, 50, is leading Microsoft’s new strategy in health care. In 1998, after 11 years at Microsoft, he left to become chief executive of Drugstore.com, an online retailer of pharmacy and health products. From 2003 to 2005, Mr. Neupert served on President Bush’s Information Technology Advisory Committee and helped run a subcommittee focused on technology in health care.Mr. Neupert returned to Microsoft last September, after convincing Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, and Craig Mundie, a senior strategy executive, that Microsoft should be doing more in health care.“I’ve had an opportunity to see how messed up the health care system was,” Mr. Neupert said. “And to really have an impact, you need a footprint like Microsoft’s.”The software system Microsoft is buying, Azyxxi (pronounced ah-zik-see), is designed to retrieve and quickly display patient information from many sources, including scanned documents, E.K.G.’s, X-rays, M.R.I. scans, angiograms and ultrasound images. It was first used in Washington Hospital Center’s emergency department in 1996, and has since been adopted at six other hospitals, including the Georgetown University Hospital, that are part of the MedStar Health group, a nonprofit network in the Baltimore-Washington region.The Azyxxi software, Mr. Neupert said, will be “our foundation,” adding, “You’ll find us expanding to a suite of health care solutions.”The Microsoft plan, analysts say, could be risky. The software it is buying is a homegrown system that has not been used outside of a few hospitals. It has no installed base of customers, and there are already several established suppliers of clinical information technology systems, including Cerner, Epic Systems, GE Healthcare, Eclipsys and others.Most of the big health care software suppliers, analysts point out, are also big customers for Microsoft operating systems, databases and programming tools. “This puts Microsoft in the uncomfortable position of potentially competing against its major customers,” said Dr. Thomas J. Handler, a health technology analyst at Gartner.Dr. Craig F. Feied, a principal designer of the software, describes Azyxxi as mainly a “data exploration engine” that typically works with existing clinical systems rather than replacing them.Analysts and health care experts who have seen the software work in the Washington hospitals say it is impressive technology. Many hospitals and clinics, they say, have various kinds of patient information in electronic form, but the different computer systems and software programs cannot share the data. That is the principal problem the Azyxxi system addresses, analysts say.The need to quickly collect, sort and display health information from many sources, they say, is a vital requirement in developing regional and national health information networks — a policy goal in the United States and dozens of other countries.At Washington Hospital Center, the system has done its job, Dr. Feied said. In 1995, before the system was introduced, the emergency ward handled 37,000 patients a year, waits stretched up to nine hours, and there seemed to be an urgent need for more doctors and rooms, he recalled. Today, the emergency department handles nearly 80,000 patients a year and 70 percent of them get a diagnosis, are treated or are admitted in three hours or less. The staff has increased only 5 percent, and few rooms were added.The problem, Dr. Feied said, was mostly that patients were waiting in rooms because doctors could not quickly find the patient records, treatment history and other information to treat them.“We weren’t doctor-poor or bed-poor,” he said. “We were information-poor.”Whether that experience can be widely repeated and be made commercially successful under Microsoft, however, is uncertain.“This is extremely interesting as a signal of Microsoft’s intentions in health care, but we’ll have to see what comes next and how this plays out,” said Dr. Blackford Middleton, an assistant professor at the Harvard Medical School and a health technology expert at Partners Healthcare, a nonprofit medical group that includes Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.'"

"'06-07-27,'0','“Her coming here really helps us out,” said Mrs. Ellis, explaining that they would have lost a day’s work if they had to travel to Colstrip.“If we were making it, we wouldn’t be asking for help,” Mr. Ellis said, but improving their business also “helps the entire town.” On sale day, he hires up to 36 employees, and people attending the auctions pour into Baker to eat and shop in local businesses.“One job lost in eastern Montana hurts a lot of people,” said Ms. Jutila, whose Colstrip office is one of 10 regional small-business development centers in the state.A handful of small-business development centers were formed in the late 1970’s in a pilot program, and circuit riders appeared soon afterward. “They’ve always been able to go where the action was,” said James J. Chrisman, professor of management at Mississippi State University in Starkville, who studies the centers.Today, there are more than 1,000 centers in all the states, the District of Columbia, and the territories. The Small Business Administration provides up to 50 percent of the operating costs; additional money comes from state and local sources. Though circuit riders are not required by law, Congress mandated that each state provide 100 percent geographic coverage.Having circuit riders from regional centers is often less expensive than running numerous offices, said Jon Ryan, Iowa’s director. Budget cuts four years ago caused a reduction in support staff and the closings of four regional centers, leaving 12 instead of 16. That created a greater need for circuit riders to reach those areas not easily served by the remaining offices.No national data is kept about which states have circuit riders, but all states offer one-on-one counseling in the office or by circuit riders, at no charge.Morrison Woods, who runs the center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, estimates that of the 1,000 or so clients his office serves each year in 11 counties, 30 percent to 40 percent are served by circuit riders. Six of nine counselors do circuit riding 22 to 23 days a month, he said.Many circuit riders report that rural clients have the same misconceptions about starting a business as the general public does: that it will be easy or that no training is necessary.“We don’t want to discourage people” Mr. Woods said, “but instead of a dream, it can become a nightmare.”What circuit riders do is provide their expertise, offering advice in developing business plans and cash flow projections, as well as discussing the feasibility of ideas and referrals to banks and organizations that provide financing. And circuit riders can help businesses make transitions in a changing economy.In Texas, for example, some areas have partly shifted from agriculture to tourism; bed-and-breakfast inns and dude ranches are sprouting up or replacing working farms and ranches, Mr. Woods said.Circuit riders also help reach populations with specific challenges.Montana provides a counselor who exclusively oversees the entrepreneurial development needs of veterans and Native Americans. In Texas, a fair number of counselors are bilingual, to better serve the large Hispanic communities.David Baenziger, a business adviser in the San Antonio center, also counsels clients in the office, as most circuit riders do. But in rural areas clients are “a little more reticent — they really want to get to know you, to develop relationships so you can build trust.”Being on site has some unexpected advantages. “Sometimes we go into a client’s store and be secret shoppers, to see what’s what,” he said. Recently, he visited an adult day care, pretending to be a potential client. “The owner knew he had problems, but he needed someone” not known by staff “to observe.”John Donovan, until recently director for the Butte, Mont., center, recalls some unusual visits. One client ran a “health mine.” “Our meeting was at a card table way down in a mine shaft,” he recounted. “I was sitting there soaking up radon.” Another client, a vintage rifle maker, sought advice about adding machinery to improve the manufacturing process. “I shot one of their large caliber rifles as part of a demo. It was fun, especially hitting the target at 100 yards — with no scope,” he said.Not all clients own new businesses or even small ones.Sherm Anderson, president of Sun Mountain Lumber in Deer Lodge, Mont., has been in the logging business since 1976. Several years ago he planned to expand into manufacturing, taking the business from $3 million annually to more than $50 million. He considered hiring outside counsel to prepare a highly complex business plan, but went with the local Small Business Development Center in Butte, because Mr. Donovan, the center’s adviser at the time, had firsthand knowledge of the economic, geographic and natural resources of the region.Small-business development centers nationwide, which serve more than 1.3 million clients a year, are successful, said Donna Ettenson, spokeswoman for the Association of Small Business Development Centers in Burke, Va.An association study shows that for each federal dollar used to aid small-business development centers, there is a return of $2.56 in federal taxes paid. And a recent economic impact statement indicates that small businesses that received in-depth assistance from development centers from 2003 to 2004 experienced 10 times the job growth of average American businesses.David W. Muñiz, co-owner of Glass and Home Innovations, in Libby, Mont., a client of the Kalispell center, regrets not seeking counsel 20 years ago with his first business. “I got into business on a wing and a prayer,” said Mr. Muñiz, who was a mill laborer with no business experience. “I went into it with the desire to not be controlled. That’s the worst reason.”He ended up filing for personal bankruptcy, rather than company bankruptcy, for $500,000 in debt as he felt it was “morally wrong” not to repay all of the money, which took five years.And, in his current business, he said, “I’ve learned to listen to other people.’’'"
"'06-07-27,'0','ConocoPhillips, the first major American oil company to report results for the second quarter, said yesterday that its profits leapt by nearly two-thirds, a windfall it owes largely to soaring oil prices.The company, based in Houston, said it earned $5.19 billion in the second quarter, compared with $3.14 billion in the period last year. Nearly all of its businesses, which include offshore oil drilling, natural gas exploration and operating oil refineries, reported profit growth.Conoco’s results, which exceeded the expectations of many analysts, are expected to set the pace for what oil analysts predict will be another round of reports of soaring profit from the industry.Its exploration and production business earned $3.3 billion, accounting for 64 percent of the overall gain in net income for the quarter. The company stepped up output of oil and natural gas by 38 percent, taking advantage of new production capacity it gained by acquiring Burlington Resources for $35.6 billion in December. The deal made Conoco the largest natural gas producer in the United States.Refining profits rose as well, though not as sharply. Conoco’s 2006 results are far outpacing the record profits the company posted last year, when it had $13.53 billion in net income. Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, earned $36.1 billion last year. Its second-quarter results are expected this week, as are those of Chevron and Shell.'"
"'06-07-27,'0','Shortly after the government settlement was announced, it ran into sharp criticism from some prominent senators, who wrote to the Justice Department expressing concern that Boeing could use the settlement to reduce its tax bill.These senators included Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; John Warner, Republican of Virginia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee; and John McCain, an Arizona Republican and a longtime Boeing critic who is leading new investigations into weapons spending.Mr. McNerney, in a conference call yesterday, said that while the decision not to deduct the $615 million would be costly in the short run, it was an important long-term move to improve Boeing’s reputation and move the company in a new direction.“Without question, the short-term impact of the tax issue is significant,’’ Mr. McNerney said. “However, the long-term value of Boeing’s reputation is even more significant. I feel strongly that the right thing for Boeing to do is not to seek tax deductibility for the settlement charges.”Mr. McNerney added, “Simply speaking, my intent is to focus on the future and put this behind us.”Boeing’s decision was immediately hailed by Senator Grassley, who said that “it’s good’’ but who continued to criticize Justice Department lawyers who negotiated the Boeing settlement for being “asleep at the switch.”“We can’t depend on having klieg lights from Congress for the right thing to happen,’’ Mr. Grassley said. In a letter sent this month to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Mr. Grassley and the other two senators wrote that allowing Boeing to claim the settlement as a tax deduction would result in “leaving the American taxpayer to effectively subsidize its misconduct.”Loren Thompson, an industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, a research organization in Arlington, Va., that promotes free-market economics, said Boeing could afford to pass up the tax break because of a corporate turnaround that has strengthened the company’s finances.“Boeing’s strategy is to keep its nose to the grindstone and avoid anything that looks controversial and hope that the anger of Senator McCain will move on to other companies,’’ Mr. Thompson said.Besides the government settlement payment, the other charge came because of delays in a $4 billion military surveillance aircraft program for Australia and Turkey. Known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, the program outfits Boeing 737-700’s with advanced radar systems.The $1.1 billion write-off was somewhat offset by a strong performance by Boeing’s commercial aviation division, where profits rose by 51 percent, to $719 million on revenue of $7.11 billion. Boeing reported a record $142 billion backlog in orders, which represents 487 planes.One big hit is the company’s coming 787 Dreamliner, a midsize fuel-efficient craft. So far it, has 364 orders from 25 air carriers, and is sold out until 2011. Orders have been so strong that Mr. McNerney said the company was even considering expanding its production plants. First deliveries of the plane are expected in the fall of 2008.On the military side, where Boeing is the No. 2 contractor after Lockheed Martin, revenues remained flat at $7.8 billion for the quarter, compared with the same quarter in 2005. Profits were $309 million, compared with $821 million in the second quarter of last year, as a result of the charges.In response to questions about the new Airbus A350 Extra Wide Bodyplane that was introduced at the Farnborough International Air Show last week to compete with Boeing’s 787 and 777, Mr. McNerney said:“They seem to be trying to cover two of our planes with one plane, which is a tough putt. We don’t see it has a plane that can compete with our 777, and it’s a little big and a little heavy to do the mission the 787 can do. So, in summary, they’ve got a single plane trying to cover two of the most successful planes we have.”'"
"'06-07-27,'0','“You’ve got guys with the classic hipster look, urban surfers, retro 50’s or the highly articulated rock star look,” said Simon Marc, a stylist who owns a salon called Mr. Pinkwhistle in San Francisco, where Mr. Geraghty recently had his hair styled. “For different looks, different products.”Sometimes on the same head, as Mr. Geraghty’s transformation shows.With so many gels, creams and waxes crowding shelves, a lot of men aren’t sure what to choose. “You open guys’ medicine cabinets in New York City, my God, you see so many products,” said Antonio Prieto, who has a salon bearing his name in New York. “Most guys don’t know if something works for them because they really don’t even know how to use it.”The biggest mistake men make with gels is using too much, said Julio Rodriguez, the owner of Jules Cooper Color and Design in Montclair, N.J. “The finer your hair, the less gel you need,” he said. “I usually tell guys to start with a dime-size amount if they have fine hair, a nickel if they have medium hair and a quarter for thick hair.”Many men also make the mistake of letting gel stiffen in place. “What too many guys end up with is the Ken doll look, hair that stays completely in place even in gale-force winds,” said Eric Roos, a founder of Nancy Boy, which manufactures men’s styling products.“That hard, crunchy look is definitely out,” said Phil Sacino, the owner of the American Male Salon in Mountain View, Calif. “I mean, if somebody can cut themselves running their hands through your hair, that’s not sexy.”Gelled hair doesn’t have to draw blood. Because gels are made of water-based polymers, applying them to wet hair dilutes them, softening their effect. Brushing gelled hair also breaks the polymer bonds, eliminating the stiffness but leaving enough coating to give hair a “memory” that allows it to be styled.Glopped-on gel tends to flake when brushed or tousled. Gels made of higher quality polymers are less likely to flake (and more likely to slim down your wallet).Mr. Marc said hair stylists are increasingly using gels to make hair thicker and coarser and then turning to other products to do the final styling. In his San Francisco salon, he worked a generous dollop of Rene Furterer Strong Hold Gel into Mr. Geraghty’s locks and dried and combed it out. Then he applied a dab of Bumble and Bumble Sumo Wax.Hair waxes, which have been around for many years, work by clumping strands of hair together, encouraging them to stay in place. Another perennial men’s hair product that is making a comeback is pomade, which is traditionally made of oils like castor oil or petrolatum.Creams and pastes are often hybrids — mixtures of gel, oil and wax. American Crew’s Forming Cream contains petrolatum, lanolin wax, castor oil and polymers. Matrix recently released a men’s styling line that includes an all-style wax that combines beeswax and several oils.The choices don’t end there. Some products come in matte, shiny or high-shine formulations. “More shine is better on curly hair, because it tends to acknowledge the shine,” said Craig Hanson, the creative director for American Crew, which sells eight men’s hair styling products shaped like hockey pucks. “With super-straight hair you don’t want the shine factor.”And then there’s climate. “If you’re in Palm Springs, you want a styling product with moisturizers,” Mr. Hanson said. “If you’re in New York in all that humidity, you want a product with an antihumectant that repels moisture.”David Cannell, Ph.D., the senior vice president of research and development at Redken NYC, says that there are more types and subtypes of styling products on the market than there are jobs for them to do. “You can take two very different products, with very different ingredients, and end up with basically the same effect,” he acknowledged.But why limit yourself to just one effect?“What we’re seeing is more and more guys who want one look for work, something businesslike and a little conservative, and something a little more avant-garde when they go out clubbing,” Mr. Marc said. “That’s the great thing about these products. With the same haircut, if it’s done right, you can be one person by day and somebody totally different by night.”'"

Profits were $309 million, compared with $821 million in the second quarter of last year, as a result of the charges.In response to questions about the new Airbus A350 Extra Wide Bodyplane that was introduced at the Farnborough International Air Show last week to compete with Boeing’s 787 and 777, Mr. McNerney said:“They seem to be trying to cover two of our planes with one plane, which is a tough putt. We don’t see it has a plane that can compete with our 777, and it’s a little big and a little heavy to do the mission the 787 can do. So, in summary, they’ve got a single plane trying to cover two of the most successful planes we have.”'"

"'06-07-28,'1','“The Constitutional Council effectively highlighted the importance of intellectual property rights,” Mr. Ménard said, adding that Apple Computer and other companies could not be forced to share their copy-protection technology without being paid for it.The council’s decision affects Apple’s market-dominant iTunes Music Store by undermining the government’s original intention — to force Apple and others to sell music online that would be playable on any device. Apple’s own iPod is the only portable music device that can play music purchased on iTunes, which lead rivals to complain about anticompetitive practices.The French minister of culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, advocated enforced interoperability as a way to ensure diverse cultural offerings on the Internet by limiting technical constraints on digital works.While the Constitutional Council highlighted the need for compensation, it was not such good news for Apple and other companies that what remained in place is the principle of forced interoperability, said Jean-Baptiste Soufron, legal director of the Association of Audionautes, a group opposed to copy restrictions. “It is good news for Apple because they receive monetary compensation, but much bigger bad news if it forces them to license iTunes,” he said. “We might see the first test case of this by the end of the year.”The broader concern for Mr. Soufron and many writing impassioned entries in French blogs, was the council’s elimination of reduced penalties for file sharing. The law, as passed, reduced the penalty for file sharing at the consumer level to the equivalent of little more than a parking fine.This measure had been advocated by Mr. Donnedieu de Vabres as a way to address the reality of massive file sharing of music and video files among French youths. The penalties for those sharing files for financial gain on widespread levels had always been strict, with fines of up to 300,000 euros, or $382,500, and three years in prison. No individual user, however, has ever been jailed for file sharing in France.Once again making reference to property rights as expressed in the Declaration of Human Rights, the council found that no distinction should be made between those violating the property rights of others.“By eliminating the reduced penalties, the council put ordinary people sharing music back in the same league as criminal counterfeiters,” Mr. Soufron said. “I guess the good news is that we will have a chance to defend ourselves in court, unlike under the system with simple fines.”The council’s decision will be chilling beyond those looking to share music, warned Christophe Espern, an advocate of open-source software.“The law passed by the Parliament made it arguably possible for the open-source community to reverse-engineer and make a program compatible with reading iTunes songs,” Mr. Espern said. “The Council has enforced the rights of proprietary and made reverse engineering entirely illegal.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','Directors of Pfizer could decide as early as today on a successor to Hank McKinnell, the chairman and chief executive, possibly ending a fierce competition within the company, a person close to Pfizer said last night.Directors could also decide to hasten Mr. McKinnell’s retirement, which is now scheduled to take place in February 2008, when he will reach Pfizer’s mandatory retirement age of 65, this person said.The person spoke on condition that he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. He emphasized that the board would not necessarily make any decisions today.Since February 2005, three executives at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company, have been vying to take over for Mr. McKinnell in a highly public succession race. In the last several months, investors have traded rumors that the race has polarized Pfizer, as the executives appeal to Mr. McKinnell for support while trying to consolidate their power bases.This week, the internal fight took a new twist. A person claiming to be a senior Pfizer employee sent an anonymous letter to directors — and reporters — critical of one potential successor, Jeffrey B. Kindler.'"
"'06-07-28,'1','The decision by the Democrat-controlled Legislature and the Democratic governor is not without its political peril, because reining in property taxes could well involve increasing other taxes or reducing spending, alienating some voters and providing grist for Republican candidates.The reasons for the steady increases vary among the state’s 566 municipalities. In many towns, residents have voted to increase property taxes to pay for school improvements or to avoid cutting services. And in some cases, businesses that change owners are able to avoid tax reassessments, placing a greater share of the burden on homeowners.As a result, the rising property tax is adding to the woes of the middle class, which has been stung in recent years by the federal alternative minimum tax while trying to keep up with rising energy prices.But one thing is certain: lawmakers are hearing a growing chorus of complaints from constituents, and some are even concerned by the threat of a taxpayer revolt if nothing is done.As Gov. Jon S. Corzine said recently, “That was my sense last fall out on the stump.”Mr. Corzine also acknowledged that the public had grown weary of temporary solutions. “We don’t have to satisfy the public that we have perfection here,” he said, “but I think the public has heard all the grand schemes and all the good intentions.”His concerns were echoed by Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr., who held up approval of the state’s budget earlier this month as a way to force the property tax issue, and who first proposed the special session and found a willing partner in Senate President Richard J. Codey.“It’s an indefensible inequity in New Jersey that is strangling every group and every class in our state,” Mr. Roberts said in a recent interview. “It’s affecting the competitiveness of our state. It’s affecting the equality of our state.”In evaluating the property tax rates in New Jersey, a central question emerges: How did tax bills grow so much so quickly?The answer lies in what critics say is an over-reliance on property taxes, which are mainly used by municipalities — with virtually no direction from the state — to pay for local services like public education and police and fire departments. Indeed, New Jersey has come to depend on property taxes for about 45 percent of its total tax revenue, while nationwide that figure is only is about 30 percent.“Part of the problem in New Jersey is that we depend on municipalities for a variety of functions, but they only rely on one revenue instrument,” said Henry A. Coleman, director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University.By some estimates, the total property taxes in New Jersey must be cut by about a fifth — or about $4 billion a year — to begin to ease the property tax burden.“That’s a nice number, but I don’t think you can have any illusions about how difficult it will be to reach,” said Mr. Coleman, who is also vice chairman of the New Jersey Coalition for the Public Good, a group that advocates changing the tax system.Mr. Corzine is expected to present his ideas for overhauling property taxes in an address to the Legislature on Friday that will open the special session. Over the next several weeks, four legislative committees — covering school financing, municipal consolidation, employee benefits and Constitutional reform — will consider ways to solve the property tax puzzle.Although the governor declined to discuss his recommendations in an interview last week, there has been widespread speculation that he may suggest a cap on property tax increases and financial incentives to municipalities that consolidate some costly operations.Other states have resorted to different measures.For instance, South Carolina this year eliminated a portion of the property tax allocated for schools and replaced it with revenue from a one percent increase in the state’s sales tax. Texas, which also held a special session on property taxes this year, raised its cigarette tax per pack by a dollar.Whatever proposals Mr. Corzine puts forth, he acknowledged that they will only be the start of a conversation about solving one of the state’s most intractable problems.“There are no silver bullets,” he said. “I think you’ll try to get a more holistic approach to it.”Mr. Meyerle of the Coalition for Property Tax Reform said the possibility for change might finally be at hand for pragmatic reasons: next year’s state legislative elections.“If they do nothing,” he said of the legislators, “I don’t think the majority party will be the majority party anymore.”For starters, Mr. Meyerle says that the rising cost of public education has to be addressed. From 1997 to 2005, revenue from property taxes for education has increased to $10.8 billion from $7 billion.But Mr. Coleman of Rutgers says school costs — while one reason for higher property tax bills —is not the only problem. “I don’t want to reaffirm that we are at this place because of dirty old schools,” he said. “That is misplaced.”One way to address school costs is to increase state financing for education, he said, noting that New Jersey provides about 40 percent of all money for public education, while the national average is nearer to 50 percent.The consolidation of municipal services is another obvious place to begin, although some local officials say such an effort could be a difficult sell.“Obviously it’s tough for everybody,” said Mayor Peter A. Capodice of Union Township who lauded the idea of incentives for sharing services. “We all feel the pain.”Joyce Slous, a Realtor at Schweppe Burgdorff Realtors in Upper Montclair, N.J., said that she gained some perspective on the depth of New Jersey’s pain at an international real estate conference last week.“I met realtors from all over the country and the amount of taxes we pay in New Jersey is just mind-boggling,” Ms. Slous said. “These people are paying $1,800, $2,400. I’m personally paying $11,000 a year on a condo in Cedar Grove.”And how have residents shown their frustration?“I’ve got one customer that’s gone away to Virginia,” she said.'"
"'06-07-28,'1','The Core 2 Duo, Intel says, can deliver as much as 40 percent better performance while using as much as 40 percent less power and giving off less heat.Mr. Otellini said Intel planned to ship at least one million of the processors within two months, giving computer makers the opportunity to sell PC’s with the chips during the holiday shopping season.Three companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Gateway, announced that they would be among the first to sell systems based on the new processors, starting in a few weeks. Systems based on Intel’s Core 2 Extreme, aimed at video game enthusiasts, are already available, the company said.For computer makers, the arrival of the chip comes as Microsoft has revealed that Vista, the next major release of Windows, will probably not arrive before the end of 2006, missing the holiday shopping season.“This move by Intel represents a potential bright spot for the computer industry, which had been hoping for Vista to arrive,” Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a market research and consulting firm, said. “This could have a significant impact on the computer industry’’ during the fourth quarter.The Core 2 Duo also arrives just as Intel is completing a review of its operations in hopes of becoming more efficient. Mr. Otellini declined to reveal whether the company, which earlier this month announced it would lay off 1,000 managers, would have additional job cuts.Last week, Intel reported a sharp decline in sales and profit for the second quarter in the face of slowing computer sales and competition from Advanced Micro.Intel has been losing market share to Advanced Micro, which is also delivering higher-performing chips that are more power-efficient. While Intel remains the far larger chip supplier, Advanced Micro has picked up about five percentage points of market share in the last year, according to Mercury Research, a technology research company.In a response to the Intel announcement, A.M.D. said it “is now quite accustomed to Intel reacting and attempting to follow our lead.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','HEMPSTEAD, N.Y., July 27 — While nobody on the Jets was available to speak Thursday when the Eric Mangini era formally got under way, a central question was answered on the first day of training camp. Curtis Martin, the team’s warhorse of a running back, is not sufficiently recovered from arthroscopic surgery last December on his right knee to resume full practices.Martin, 33, was placed on the physically unable to perform list, which will preclude him from practicing with the team. He will be able to use the team facilities for his open-ended rehabilitation and participate in team meetings, and can be upgraded to the active roster at any time.Mangini, who was hired as the head coach in January after Herman Edwards left for Kansas City, declined to comment. A team spokesman said Mangini would address Martin’s situation Friday after the first of 27 scheduled training-camp practices at Hofstra University.Martin, the fourth-leading rusher in National Football League history with 14,101 yards on 3,518 carries, was joined on the list by wide receiver Justin McCareins, offensive lineman Trey Teague and defensive back Rayshun Reed. There is sufficient time for the players to regain their fitness before the season opener at Tennessee on Sept. 10, but their designation was a matter of some urgency; a player cannot be placed on the list if he starts training camp on the active roster.During a full-squad minicamp last month, Martin, who is entering his 12th N.F.L. season and his ninth with the Jets, was held out of most drills, but he dismissed concerns about his availability for this season. “This isn’t the first injury that I’ve come off of,” he said. “Most of the years I’ve played in the league, I’ve come off an injury.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','Analysts attending the meeting said the Microsoft strategy, presented in greater detail than in the past, was a pragmatic one.“It’s not really about beating Google,” said Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs & Company. “But Microsoft has to do well enough to keep people in the Microsoft environment — on the desktop, the Web or gaming online — so they don’t leave the Microsoft environment to go to Google for search.”As a business, Internet search is crucial because ads linked to search words have been such a fast-growing advertising market — and Google has been the runaway leader.Microsoft has spent the last two years, and hundreds of millions of dollars, building its own search advertising technology, called AdCenter. The new advertising system was introduced only two months ago. In a demonstration, Microsoft showed how the AdCenter system lets advertisers measure clicks on the keywords they purchase by time of day, day of the week and often by the age, gender and geographic location of the person seeing the ad. Microsoft’s MSN services like Web e-mail require users to register and submit some personal information, which Google does not.“You get better information on what’s working in your ad campaign and better return on investment,” said Yusuf Mehdi, chief of advertising strategy for Microsoft’s Internet services. “That’s something you can’t do on other systems.”In a demonstration, Mr. Mehdi showed some of the work being done by a group exploring the future of advertising in Microsoft’s research labs. In a digital television prototype, a viewer who liked a dress worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in an episode of “Sex and the City” could click on it, automatically pausing the video, and on the screen an Internet search result would appear, identifying the dress, its maker and a link to buy it.Still, Microsoft expects its progress in advertising to be gradual. The company projected that in fiscal 2007, which began this month, the revenue from its online services business would grow 7 percent to 11 percent, to $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. That would be an improvement from last year, when online services revenue fell 2 percent, to $2.3 billion, and the unit lost $77 million.By contrast, Google, in its recent quarter alone, reported that profit doubled to $721 million while revenue grew 77 percent to $2.4 billion.Microsoft executives acknowledge that as computing increasingly gravitates to the Web and often toward ad-supported services, it creates both a technical and business challenge for a company whose great strength is in personal computer desktop software.But the Microsoft vision is that Internet services can complement rather than cannibalize the company’s traditional business if they are built into products like Windows.“Microsoft’s current offerings represent a huge advantage that we can migrate into this services world,” said Ray Ozzie, the chief software architect.Despite its struggle to adapt to Internet services, Microsoft as a whole is performing quite well. In the year ended last month, the company’s revenue grew 11 percent, to $44.3 billion, and its operating profit rose 13 percent. to $16.5 billion.Even though Microsoft has grown fairly strongly for years, its stock price has been stagnant. Investors worry that the future of computing belongs to new Internet-based rivals, like Google.In private conversations, Microsoft executives said that the skeptics were taking a short-term perspective and that Microsoft had repeatedly proved skeptics wrong.Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer, noted that in the 1990’s, when Microsoft began to move into corporate data centers with server software, many industry experts scoffed. Microsoft, they predicted, would surely fail.Last year, Microsoft’s server and tools business reported revenue of $11.5 billion and operating profit of $4.3 billion.“It took real research and development and a long time to get there,” Mr. Mundie said. “We’re doing that all the time. We make big long-term bets. That’s what’s going on here now, and it’s very different than this general perception that the company isn’t really doing anything interesting.”At the meeting, Microsoft declined to pledge that Windows Vista, its new operating system, would be shipped to consumers in January, the most recent prediction given. Vista has been repeatedly delayed, and Microsoft said there was no reason yet to push the schedule back further.But Mr. Johnson, co-president of the platforms and services group, said, “We will ship Windows Vista when the product is ready,” leaving open the possibility of added delays.Microsoft’s shares fell 2 percent, to $23.87, on Thursday amid concern about the timing of Vista’s debut.Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive, said the company’s pace of Windows releases would accelerate. “We will never repeat the experience of Windows Vista again,” Mr. Ballmer said. “We will never have a five-year gap in major releases again.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','Exxon’s quarterly profit, released a day after ConocoPhillips reported similarly strong results, offers Democrats an attractive midterm election topic that assigns the blame for high prices at the pump to the perceived cozy relationship between the Bush administration and the oil giants.Soon after Exxon reported its earnings, Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat and a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, released a caustic statement. “While American families get tipped upside down and have their savings shaken out of their pockets at the gas pump, the Bush-Cheney team devises even more ways to line Big Oil’s pockets,” he said.Henry Hubble, Exxon’s vice president for investor relations and corporate secretary, acknowledged yesterday in a conference call with analysts “the impact today’s high energy prices have on consumers and family budgets” while “our companies do benefit from these conditions.”He said the answer was not more taxes on oil profit but efforts to “bring more product to the market and ease supply pressure.”Investors had much to cheer about, even if they, too, were shaking their heads at the pump.Profit from oil and natural gas sales rose 45 percent from a year earlier, to $7.1 billion.The company reported that it repurchased $6.8 billion worth of stock during the quarter, topping its target by $800 million. It said it expected buybacks to rise to $7 billion in the third quarter.Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 13 cents, to $66.47, in New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has risen about 20 percent this year.The quarter’s results appeared to reflect well on continuing efforts at cutting costs and improving return on assets since the merger of Exxon and Mobil seven years ago. They also appeared to validate the early decisions by Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive who succeeded Lee R. Raymond at the end of last year. Mr. Tillerson has moved to raise production in Africa, Russia and the Middle East and expand exploration in Indonesia and Madagascar.The company’s crude oil output rose more than 9 percent, to 2.7 million barrels a day, as growth in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Russia offset declines in North America and Europe. Gas output rose only slightly, largely because of expanding operations in Qatar.Exxon’s total production gain of slightly more than 6 percent, the equivalent of four million barrels of oil a day, compared favorably with the performances of its rivals BP and Royal Dutch Shell, which have reported second-quarter production declines of 2.5 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively.The company said it spent $4.9 billion for the quarter on capital and exploration projects, an increase of 8 percent over the previous year.Though analysts said they were impressed with the results, some continue to say that the company needs to do much more with its overflowing cash of nearly $40 billion.“These are record earnings that exceeded expectations,” said Fadel Gheit, senior energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “Their earnings benefited from record oil prices as well as very high production growth. The only negative in the report — but this is industrywide — is rising cost inflation. Everything energy companies are using, like materials and labor, are costing them more today than anytime before.”Mr. Gheit added that future quarterly earnings could well continue to satisfy investors, but “only if oil prices continue to rise.”Mr. Hubble, the Exxon vice president, said gasoline sales in the United States and elsewhere should remain strong. “We continue to see demand growth year-on-year,” he said. “We’re running our capacity full. We’re selling everything we can make. It correlates best with G.D.P. growth. The economy is still performing well around the world.”Analysts noted that much of Exxon’s production growth was provided by the recent start-up of the Erha project 60 miles off Nigeria in 3,900 feet of water. Exxon estimated that with the Erha North satellite project scheduled to come on stream during the new quarter, total Erha production would rise to 190,000 barrels a day by the end of the year.'"
"'06-07-28,'1','WASHINGTON, July 27 — In a blunt assessment of the efforts to overhaul the United States’ spying apparatus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers criticized the director of national intelligence on Thursday for a “lack of urgency” in addressing failures that led to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the faulty assessments about Iraq’s banned weapons programs.The assessment was in a report by the House Intelligence Committee’s Subcommittee on OversightMore than a year after the director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, was given a mandate to fuse the operations of 16 disparate intelligence operations, the report said that an incremental approach had been taken when urgent steps were needed to correct “the deficiencies identified by study after study.”The report, the first official report card on Mr. Negroponte’s office, also concluded that one of the primary reasons for the intelligence failures before the Iraq war — a “groupthink” among analysts across the spying community — had yet to be seriously addressed and that intelligence analysis remained clustered around just 10 percent of the available data.“Judging from the analysis presented in the briefings the committee has received on various topics over the past year,” the report stated, lawmakers were “concerned that the analytical community is still too risk-adverse and subject to groupthink.”The report also criticized continued lack of communication between spy agencies and a cumbersome bureaucracy that governed security clearances. Noting that “information sharing within the community is one of the most critical tenets of intelligence reform,” it stated that progress on that front was “limited to understanding the task at hand.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','Mr. Torain made the controversial comments in May on WWPR-FM, known as Power 105, and was fired soon after. The station is owned by Clear Channel Communications of San Antonio, which, through a publicist, declined to comment yesterday.Mr. Torain’s threats came as part of an on-air exchange of insults with his rival, Raashaun Casey, 28, who is known as D.J. Envy and works at radio station WQHT-FM, known as Hot 97. In addition to threatening Mr. Casey’s daughter with sexual abuse and offering $500 for information on where she went to school, Mr. Torain also used racial and sexual epithets to describe the child’s mother, Gia Casey, who is part Asian.Mr. Casey did not return calls to his office yesterday seeking comment on the dismissal of the charges, and Ms. Casey could not be reached for comment.Members of Asian-American groups, including John C. Liu, a city councilman of Chinese descent, had demanded that Mr. Torain, who is black, be punished.Mr. Liu said yesterday that he was disappointed by the district attorney’s decision. The issue, he said, is not whether Mr. Torain “would have actually done anything to harm the child directly, but whether someone listening on the public airwaves would have somehow gotten it into their head that they were going to get a cash reward” for harming a child.Asked in the telephone interview if he regretted his language or wanted to apologize to the parents, Mr. Torain replied: “I’m done with that line of questioning. You’ve got a decision by a court. What more are you looking for? Case dismissed means not enough evidence to go forward, or however else you want to interpret that.”Mr. Torain compared himself to Lenny Bruce, the comedian, and others involved in free-speech cases.“If you’re in the media you’d better know what happened to me,” Mr. Torain said, “or else you’ll just be another sheep sitting around, and all of a sudden one day you’ll be told that you don’t represent the demands of a certain community and then you’re out of a job.”Mr. Torain said he had no plans to seek his old job at Power 105 but planned to stay in New York. “I most certainly will be back on radio, and television as well,” he said. “I’ve got a great television deal in the works.”'"

"'06-07-28,'1','Mark Green, the last of the candidates for attorney general to put a campaign commercial on television, began to broadcast one yesterday that highlighted his record but did not mention any of his rivals.Mr. Green, the former New York City public advocate, bought airtime for his 30-second commercial in western New York, just as one of his fellow Democratic rivals, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Jeanine F. Pirro, the Republican candidate, did.But while Mr. Cuomo and Ms. Pirro took jabs at each other in their ads, Mr. Green’s commercial has him speaking only about himself. The commercial is being broadcast in Buffalo and Albany and will run for a week, said Mark Benoit, a spokesman for the Green campaign.Mr. Benoit would not say how much the campaign was spending on the commercial. “Let’s say that it’s a substantial buy, comparable to what the Pirro and Cuomo campaigns spent in those markets.”Looking at the camera, Mr. Green says: “As a young public interest lawyer, I took on Congressional and corporate corruption. Then as consumer commissioner, I shut down big tobacco ads targeting our kids. As the elected public advocate, I stopped companies from discriminating against women who were domestic violence victims.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','A revamped qualification system for selecting the United States team has emphasized golfers who are playing their best this year. The United States team will be completed Aug. 21, the day after the P.G.A. Championship, when Tom Lehman will use his two captain’s picks to round out the 12-man squad.Europe’s team, captained by Ian Woosnam, will comprise the top five players on the Ryder Cup world-points list and the top five players on the European Ryder Cup points list through Sept. 3. Woosnam will complete the team with his two captain’s picks.Currently, the last four spots on the United States team are held by J .J. Henry, Zach Johnson, Brett Wetterich and John Rollins, who would each be making his Ryder Cup debut if they hold on to their positions.“You win a tournament, it’s a huge number, so you can jump way up in a hurry,” Lehman said of the qualifying procedure during a news conference last month. “But the guys who are consistently playing well week after week are the ones that are near the top.”Vaughn Taylor, a two-time PGA Tour winner who is 11th in the standings, said during the British Open that his lack of name recognition was of no great consequence, at least in his view. He said he just wanted to make the team.“I always tend to fly under the radar,” Taylor said. “I mean, every weekend in the U.S., people don’t even know who I am. It doesn’t bother me.”In recent years, it has been lesser-known European players who have helped take down the United States, as Phillip Price did in shocking Mickelson in singles during the 2002 Ryder Cup.This year, however, the Europeans occupy 10 of the top 24 spots in the official world golf ranking, and the United States occupies six.“The unknown is never welcomed in a situation,” Montgomerie said during the British Open when asked about the potential makeup of the United States team. “If there are five rookies on that team, it will be unknown to know what to expect. The rookies in the past on these Ryder Cups, on both teams, have performed actually quite well.“We’ll just have to see how that situation evolves.”The United States team might have received a boost when Chris DiMarco surged into sixth place on the points list after his second-place finish to Woods at the British Open. Even before the championship finished, DiMarco said if he was forced to choose between winning his first major and making the Ryder Cup team for a second time, he would opt for the team.Last year, DiMarco rolled in the decisive putt to help the United States defeat the International team at the Presidents Cup.“Obviously, winning a major would always solidify your career,” DiMarco said. “Playing for your country is probably the greatest thing I’ve ever done in golf. It would mean that much more for me to come back and go to the K Club and be a part of that team.“Once you’ve been on a team, you don’t want to miss any.”'"
"'06-07-28,'1','It should come as no surprise that most states failed to have a “highly qualified” teacher in every class in all major subject areas as required by the No Child Left Behind law (news article, July 25).We are simply repeating the history of the 1980’s and 90’s when we failed to meet any of the eight goals in “Goals 2000 Education.”They were greater school readiness; a 90 percent high school graduation rate; improved student achievement, especially in reading; adult literacy; safe schools; improved teacher education; student science and mathematics achievement; and greater parental involvement.Next year, Congress will have to decide whether to re-enact, revise or scrap No Child Left Behind.

"'06-07-28,'1','“All This Intimacy” may not be the most substantive play in New York this summer, but it’s almost certainly unchallenged in the creative use of spermatozoa as a scenic motif.The play, a world premiere by Rajiv Joseph, is about a cad who impregnates three women in less than two weeks, and no, those squiggly things on the walls of David Newell’s set are not paisley graffiti. The visual concept actually perfectly matches the play itself: not particularly subtle, only fleetingly funny, yet with a certain can’t-look-away pull.The cad is a 30-year-old poet named Ty (Thomas Sadoski), and he doesn’t exactly exude animal magnetism. Yet his girlfriend (Gretchen Egolf), his neighbor (Amy Landecker) and one of his poetry students (Krysten Ritter) all find him bedworthy. None of them require any coercion; in fact, any succumbing is done by Ty. But Mr. Joseph isn’t interested in a two-sided discussion of sexual responsibility; he just wants to set Ty up for a big fall and then watch him plummet.Which he does: the three women meet, and they’re not happy. Neither is Franny (Kate Nowlin), sister of Ty’s girlfriend, who is about to marry Seth (Adam Green), Ty’s best friend. “You are going to ruin my wedding pictures!” she moans, once she hears the news and envisions a pregnant maid of honor.This batch of contrivances isn’t as amusing as it could be, partly because the director, Giovanna Sardelli, has the actors working on different planes: Franny and the young poetry student are played as caricatures (ones that haven’t been funny in years), but no one else is. And, of course, there’s only so much mileage a playwright can get out of a louse, or at least a nonmusical one. You keep expecting the whiny Ty to burst into “Lumbered” from “Stop the World, I Want to Get Off” (“For my little bit of pleasure I’ve been punished beyond measure”). But, alas, he never does.To his credit, though, Mr. Joseph at least avoids giving this sitcom of a play a sitcom ending. Its most striking, honest moment is the final minute, when there’s not a laugh in sight.'"
"'06-07-28,'1','Why the changes? In 72 percent of the cases, the companies chose not to give any reason when they notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of the departure.That was up from 58 percent in 2004, when 1,451 companies changed auditors. Companies audited by the Big Four accounting firms, generally the larger companies, are even less likely to give reasons, with 82 percent choosing to remain quiet.The rules now in effect in the United States require disclosure of a reason only if it falls into certain areas. Otherwise, companies can remain mum.“It’s a pretty big deal when a company changes its auditors,” said Mark Grothe, an analyst at Glass Lewis who wrote the report with Jonathan Weil, a managing director of the firm. “But most of the time it is standard boilerplate, and you do not know why.”Sometimes, of course, it may be polite to not say why. Perhaps a partner has a personality conflict with a company official. Perhaps the company has concluded that the auditor is simply not up to the job, or that another firm is more experienced in a particular industry. And because there is a requirement for disclosure if something really bad is happening, isn’t that enough?Unfortunately, it may not be. Mr. Grothe pointed to the case of Computer Associates, now known as CA. In 1999, when Computer Associates dismissed Ernst & Young as its auditor, it told investors there was no disagreement on accounting, and no “reportable event.”A few years later, when the S.E.C. and the Justice Department went after company officials, they told a different story, claiming that Computer Associates fired Ernst in retaliation for the firm’s requiring the company to disclose things that it did not want to disclose regarding compensation of top executives.And yet, the disclosure, or lack of it, may have complied with the rules. Was there an accounting disagreement? Not when the firm was fired. Computer Associates had made the required disclosure, and so there was no continuing dispute. And how could anyone be sure it was retaliation?Glass Lewis thinks the S.E.C. should add to the list of reportable events, including “significant difficulties” faced by the audit firm in doing its job over the previous three years, or whether the company had sought a change in audit partners.In any case, Mr. Grothe said, “The S.E.C. should require all companies to give a reason in all cases.”Such a rule could go a long way toward fixing the problem. The company would, of course, be free to explain what had happened, and to put its spin on it, as would the audit firm. Investors would learn that in auditor splits, as in divorces, sometimes two sides can have different perceptions of what went wrong.Because the rules now require that auditors be hired and fired by boards, not managements, it should be harder to fire an auditor in retaliation without leaving a paper trail.Once those rules were in effect, auditors would still be tempted to go along with face-saving explanations. No one wants to be known as a troublesome business associate.

"'06-07-29,'0','And Senate Democratic leaders, who have repeatedly thwarted the push to cut the estate tax, said they would do so again even if the proposal included the first increase in the minimum wage since 1997.“The Senate has rejected fiscally irresponsible estate tax giveaways before and will reject them again,” said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, who added that the Republican approach amounted to legislative blackmail.“If the Republicans were serious about raising the minimum wage for the first time in nearly 10 years and extending tax relief for working Americans,” Mr. Reid said, “they would not hold them hostage in their effort to give the wealthiest Americans hundreds of billions more in additional tax giveaways.”Senior Republican lawmakers in the House and the Senate said they believed the plan could thread its way through the Senate, however, and they packed the measure with tax breaks to attract House and Senate support. They said the estate tax plan, which would set the individual estate tax exemption at $5 million in 2015, would offset the economic cost to small businesses of paying higher minimum wages.“Unlike some of my colleagues, I see this tax relief and minimum wage bill as complementary,” said Representative Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, one of the Republicans who has joined Democrats in pressing for a wage increase. “The sustaining of small businesses by keeping their vital assets will allow those making the minimum wage to continue working. This is a jobs bill.”Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee, said Democrats were upset with the legislation because Republicans had found a clever way to link the two. “You have seen us outfox you on this issue tonight,” Mr. Wamp told Democrats in the floor debate.Under the minimum wage proposal, the current $5.15 rate would rise by $2.10 over three years in three increments, reaching $5.85 in January 2007, $6.55 on June 1, 2008, and $7.25 on June 1, 2009. The change would also allow tips to be counted toward minimum wage increases in states where that is not now allowed.The fate of the pension overhaul, approved on a 279 to 131 vote, was also unclear. Contentious negotiations over a final House-Senate bill broke down late Thursday in an angry exchange among Republicans over whether the pension measure should contain the new tax breaks for business and education costs.As a result, House and Senate leaders decided to move ahead with a pension bill that included the major elements agreed upon in the talks. But that measure, unlike a bill that would have come out of the negotiations, is open to amendment in the Senate, and any changes there could force a new round of negotiations and hold up final approval of the measure.The frantic legislative brinkmanship, occurring mainly behind closed doors as Republicans sought to round up votes, reflected the leadership’s desire to put some accomplishments on the board before lawmakers head home for what was looming as five weeks of intense campaigning. Each party is urging lawmakers to push the competing party’s messages in hundreds of events during the next five weeks.Legislators have been trying to amend the 32-year-old pension law for several years, spurred by a string of huge pension fund collapses. The biggest failures have been mainly in the airline and steel sectors.The federal government guarantees pensions, much as it guarantees bank deposits, and the failures have threatened to swamp the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation if allowed to continue. Many analysts have pointed to troubling similarities between the pension agency and the agency that once guaranteed savings and loan deposits, which collapsed in 1989 and required a $200 billion taxpayer bailout. The desire to prevent another such bailout was a force driving the pension bill forward.The bill, if enacted, would require companies with pension funds to close any shortfalls within seven years. It also has tests that companies would have to use to determine whether their pension plans posed a risk to the federal insurance system. Companies with such risky plans would then have to calculate how much it would cost if all qualifying employees were to take early retirement immediately, and then put that amount into their pension funds.The bill was also intended to close loopholes that made it easy for companies to avoid paying their full premiums to the pension insurance system. As it inched through the House and the Senate this year, legislators added other provisions that were only loosely connected with the goal of strengthening the pension system.'"

"'06-07-29,'0','An additional $10,100, according to the report, went to Father Fay’s frequent traveling companion, Cliff Fantini, and a company controlled by Mr. Fantini for what the priest described as “video filming and decorations for the church.”A spokesman for the diocese, Joseph McAleer, did not respond to several messages seeking comment. Lawyers who had earlier indicated that they were representing Father Fay did not return phone calls seeking comment, and efforts to obtain a comment directly from him were unsuccessful.The diocese announced its inquiry after private investigators hired by the Rev. Michael J. Madden, the parish’s parochial vicar, and the church’s bookkeeper, Bethany D’Erario, turned up $200,000 in questionable spending by Father Fay. The private investigators spent a few days looking at two years’ worth of data, while the diocese’s report covered just over six years, from January 2000 to last April.“What we’re hearing now totally validates their suspicions and their actions,” said Mickey Sherman, a lawyer who represents Ms. D’Erario. “They obviously weren’t chasing ghosts here.”The $1.4 million estimate cited in the report includes $829,000 in credit card charges of a personal nature and $515,000 withdrawn from church accounts by Father Fay through checks to cash or himself. He has told the diocese, according to the report, that much of the $515,000 was used to provide financial assistance to needy people who do not wish to be identified. But the auditors said they had traced at least $380,000 of the $515,000 back to his personal bank account. The report says that for practical reasons, it concentrated on the last six years even though there was “evidence that the conduct noted in this report also occurred prior to 2000.”The review also could not determine the origin of an additional $350,000 found in Father Fay’s personal bank account, which could increase the estimated loss. The report notes that some of the expenditures may have been legitimate and could reduce the loss, but Father Fay has so far failed to document them properly. According to the report, the “most significant spending occurred” in the last six years, after Father Fay set up a secret bank account in October 2000 called the Don Bosco fund that was not reflected on the parish’s books. The priest told the bookkeeper that all correspondence from that bank was for his eyes only, the report noted.In the days leading up to the report, parishioners have said that the questionable expenses took a heavy toll on the church’s ability to fulfill its mission. According to one parishioner, Regina Damanti, the church’s ability to pay bills promptly became so strained that trucks bearing essential goods like toilet paper would not unload until the drivers received a check in advance in the parking lot.“I’m surprised the figure is not bigger,” she said when told of the auditors’ estimate. Ms. Damanti, a former church employee, said she had questioned Father Fay’s management style. His response, she said, was that she might prefer worshiping elsewhere.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','“I don’t see them bringing in their legal and corporate affairs person,” Scott Henry, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Company, said of Mr. Kindler shortly before the company made the announcement.His appointment comes only a few days after someone claiming to be a senior Pfizer employee sent an anonymous letter to directors imploring them not to choose Mr. Kindler.But a person close to the company said yesterday that Mr. Kindler impressed Pfizer’s directors with his strategic vision and leadership skills. Now he will run a behemoth with 110,000 employees, $51 billion in sales, $8 billion in profits, and a $7 billion research budget.Pfizer’s news release announcing the move hinted at the sensitivity of yesterday’s decision. The release did not describe Mr. McKinnell as resigning or mention that he had quit his post more than a year ahead of schedule, instead merely saying that Mr. Kindler “succeeds Hank McKinnell.”The other contenders for chief executive were David L. Shedlarz, the chief financial officer, who was a favorite of investors, and Karen L. Katen, the president of the Human Health division, by far Pfizer’s largest unit. Mr. Kindler, Ms. Katen, and Mr. Shedlarz were all named vice chairs in February 2005, setting up the three-person race for the top job.In its announcement yesterday, Pfizer did not mention Ms. Katen and Mr. Shedlarz or discuss whether they planned to remain at Pfizer. A spokesman yesterday would only say that they were still working for the company.The announcement came after an all-day board meeting, beginning at 9 a.m., at the offices of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, a New York law firm that represents Pfizer.The candidates, who had spoken to the board at a meeting last month, were not present, according to a person close to Pfizer. The person spoke on condition that he not be identified because of the sensitivity of the meeting.The board discussed the three candidates for several hours, the person said, then concluded with a unanimous vote supporting Mr. Kindler.Pfizer declined to make Mr. Kindler, Mr. McKinnell, or the other executives available for comment.The announcement comes at a precarious time for Pfizer, which is based in Midtown Manhattan.While Pfizer remains among the most profitable and influential companies in the world, it is suffering through a difficult transition period. Some of its best-selling drugs, including the antibiotic Zithromax and the antidepressant Zoloft, have lost patent protection in the last two years, and Pfizer’s scientists have struggled to find replacements.In the last several years, Pfizer has repeatedly faced delays in winning approval for new medicines. And several of its drugs have fizzled after being released, including Caduet, a heart medicine that combines two older Pfizer drugs, and Relpax, an arthritis medicine.In the most recent setback, Pfizer said earlier this month that it would postpone the release of Exubera, its inhaled insulin, from July to September. While the delay is only two months, Exubera was approved in January, after years of delays from regulators, leading analysts to wonder why Pfizer appears so unprepared to release the drug.Mr. McKinnell, who took over Pfizer in 2001, has been viewed by many analysts and investors as arrogant and out of touch with Pfizer’s problems, at least publicly. His pay package fueled further anger both inside and outside the company.While Pfizer’s stock has declined 40 percent since Mr. McKinnell took over, and it has laid off thousands of employees, Mr. McKinnell has received $60 million in salary and other compensation. He is also eligible to receive an $83 million pension.Pfizer shares rose 2 percent yesterday, after The New York Times reported that Pfizer’s board would be meeting and might replace Mr. McKinnell.In a report yesterday morning, before the announcement, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, David Risinger, wrote that Pfizer “stock could react positively to the prospect of a change in management.”“Investors have been frustrated,” Mr. Risinger wrote, “that McKinnell has run the company in somewhat of an autocratic fashion and has denied some of the company’s problems. A new C.E.O. should be perceived positively.”Until this year, Pfizer has rarely reached out to investors or analysts, an analyst at Miller Tabak, Les Funtleyder, said.“I would hope that whoever’s running the place would be more willing to get out in the field and talk to investors,” he said. “If there is a lesson, at least one, be more accessible to Wall Street.”Mr. Kindler, however, takes his job under a minor cloud. Earlier this week, a person claiming to be a senior Pfizer employee sent a letter to Pfizer’s board critical of Mr. Kindler. The letter offered no evidence to support its claims, and they cannot be independently verified. But the letter’s author correctly predicted on Wednesday that Mr. McKinnell would resign after Friday’s board meeting.Mr. Kindler, who is married and has two children, joined Pfizer in 2002 as senior vice president and general counsel after six years at McDonald’s. Previously, he worked at General Electric and the law firm of Williams & Connolly. He graduated from Harvard Law, where he worked on the Harvard Law Review with John G. Roberts Jr., now the chief justice of the Supreme Court.Mr. McKinnell becomes the second chief executive of a big pharmaceutical company to leave his post ahead of schedule in the last 15 months. In May 2005, Merck, the third-largest American drug company, forced Raymond V. Gilmartin, its chairman and chief executive, to resign. Mr. Gilmartin was forced out in part because of Merck’s problems with Vioxx, a painkiller that Merck stopped selling in 2004 after it was linked to heart attacks and strokes.Vioxx has also played a part in Pfizer’s woes. In 2003, Pfizer bought Pharmacia & Upjohn for $60 billion, in part to get full control of the painkillers Celebrex and Bextra, which are similar to Vioxx. Since Merck withdrew Vioxx, sales of Celebrex have plunged, and Pfizer has stopped selling Bextra under pressure from regulators.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','GENEVA, July 28 — The United States should immediately shut any secret detention facilities and grant the Red Cross prompt access to any person detained in connection with an armed conflict, a United Nations rights panel said in a report on Friday.The Bush administration should also allow detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to seek review of their treatment or conditions of detention before a court, it added.“The committee is concerned by credible and uncontested information that the state party has seen fit to engage in the practice of detaining people secretly and in secret places for months and years on end,” according to the 12-page Human Rights Committee report.The committee, which held a two-day hearing last week on United States compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a 1966 treaty, said such practices also violated the rights of detainees’ families.The United States “should only detain persons in places in which they can enjoy the full protection of the law,” the report said. “It should also grant prompt access by the International Committee of the Red Cross to any person detained in connection with an armed conflict.”In Washington, the State Department responded that the treaty applied only in the national territory of signatories and that it did not apply to the United States military or its installations abroad, which are governed by other domestic and international laws.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','Nimble was probably never a word associated with Cheyenne Mountain.Twenty-five-ton steel doors guard a windowless and secret world that would be, its designers said, impregnable to the worst thing imaginable. And the mountain in turn created a place and a setting — if only in the public imagination — where the worst might well play out.A teenager played by Matthew Broderick hacked into the mountain’s computers and brought the world to the brink of destruction in the movie “WarGames.’’ Science-fiction writers imagined post-apocalyptic societies inherited by Cheyenne-Mountain-like warrior-survivors. Dr. Strangelove haunted a similar war room at the fevered brink of disaster.The cold war threat, and the philosophy that arose around it, were premised on the idea of a centralized, command-down enemy — the Soviet Union — and a centralized, command-down national defense to counter that enemy, historians and military experts said.The technology of the time dovetailed with the goals of “hardening,” as it was called, and burrowing down — in Cheyenne Mountain’s case under 2,000 feet of granite. The centralized mainframe computer was the model then, too. And just as the old Soviet threat has been supplanted by the shadow world of global terrorism, so too has the mainframe been thrust aside by the modern notion of decentralized networks that can be better defended by being dispersed.“Cheyenne represented the idea that there would be this one single nerve center where man and machines are meshed together to fight the apocalypse,” said W. Patrick McCray, a professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who teaches a course on the history of the atomic age.“It indicates how much fear, but also nuclear weapons in general, infiltrated all aspects of American society during that time,” Professor McCray said. “Here’s this very physical representation of the determination to fight and win a nuclear war.”The Northern Command, which was created in 2002 to monitor newer kinds of terrorist-era threats to the nation — from land and sea to cyberspace — is already based at Peterson, Mr. Kucharek said, and its role has grown rapidly. The consolidation adds Norad’s focus on missile defense to Peterson’s broader portfolio.About 230 people involved in day-to-day Norad operations will transfer to Peterson, Mr. Kucharek said, with no net loss of jobs, but with an undetermined cost-saving over time. Two other military units connected to Norad, employing about 200 people, are also considering moves out of the mountain, consolidating their functions at other bases around the country, he said.Cheyenne Mountain was never designed as a place to wage war, but rather as one for warning and defense — to coordinate the net of sensors, satellites and spies that would send the alarm, said Gen. William E. Odom, who was director of the National Security Agency from 1981 to 1985 and is now a professor of political science at Yale University.Decisions to launch or counterstrike missiles were concentrated at Strategic Air Command near Omaha, General Odom said.“Their job was to assemble the data that would wake up the president at 3 a.m. and say the country is under nuclear attack,” he said of Cheyenne Mountain.General Odom said he had visited the mountain many times in his career and that it was a fairly unglamorous place of charts and maps. According to the Norad Web site, four-and-a-half acres of connected chambers and tunnels were dug out for the complex. Fifteen free-standing buildings, each two or three stories tall, were built underground as offices. Metal walls and tunnels were designed to withstand an electromagnetic pulse from a nuclear ignition, or an earthquake.The pop culture imagery that came to be associated with Cheyenne Mountain, General Odom said, became for many people much more powerful and real than the workaday national defense activities that actually happened there.Of the changes announced Friday, he said, “People producing movies will have to come up with a new image — I think that’s really the significance.”As for defense and warning against surprise attack, the need is just as crucial today, General Odom said, but different.“This is just rearranging the furniture, this is not closing the house down,” he said.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','PARIS, July 28 — The French constitutional council, the country’s highest judicial body, has declared major aspects of the so-called iPod law unconstitutional, undermining some controversial aspects of the legislation.“Apple’s lawyers might want to drink a glass of French Champagne today, but not a whole bottle,” said Dominique Menard, partner at the Lovells law firm and a specialist in intellectual property. “The constitutional council has highlighted fundamental protections for intellectual property in such a way as to put iTunes a little further from risk of the French law.”Released late Thursday, the council’s 12-page legal finding made frequent reference to the 1789 Declaration on Human Rights and concluded that the law violated the constitutional protections of property.The decision affects Apple’s market-dominant iTunes Music Store by undermining the government’s original intention, which was to force Apple and others to sell music online that would be playable on any device. Apple’s iPod is the only portable music device that can play music purchased on iTunes, which lead rivals to complain about anti-competitive practices.Although the ruling could still require companies like Apple to make music sold online to be compatible with other hand-held devices, it said that the companies could not be forced to do so without receiving compensation. The council also eliminated reduced fines for file sharing.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','In Hudson County, N.J., prosecutors also said they had arrested Krystal Riordan, a prostitute and friend of Mr. Coleman’s, and charged her with evidence tampering and hindering in Mr. Coleman’s arrest. Gaetano Gregory, the first assistant Hudson County prosecutor, said that Ms. Riordan, 20, had helped dispose of the body.The saga will, of course, play out as well in the hearts and homes of two families — families separated by far more than the Hudson River. In Harrington Park, Ms. Moore’s father, Hugh Moore, spoke to reporters yesterday, saying that her 27-year-old brother and 21-year-old sister were “absolutely crushed” by the death and that Ms. Moore herself had made “a terrible mistake” by walking away from an impound lot on the West Side of Manhattan where her friend’s car had been towed, and into the night alone.Meanwhile, on the Upper West Side, Mr. Coleman’s mother, Griselda Wright, did not defend her son, saying she had no idea what he was up to in his life, mostly because he was never at home. “He’s 35 years old, he’s never here, I don’t see him much,” she said.By all accounts, Jennifer Moore, dark-haired and athletic, was a typical suburban girl, whose life revolved around her friends, her cellphone and the soccer field, where she was a star. She was co-captain of the team at Saddle River Day School in Saddle River, N.J., where the honors English class has been asked to read “Pygmalion” this summer and earlier this year two students picked up silver medals in the National Latin Exam.She was headed to the University of Hartford in the fall to study nursing, her father said, a vocation she had picked up from a close family friend. She had a boyfriend, Kofi Boakye, of Alpine, N.J., the kind of man, Mr. Moore went on, that any father would be proud to have his daughter date.Pretty and petite — she was only 5-foot-2 — Ms. Moore was born small, Mr. Moore said, and came into her own only after she had entered Saddle River Day, where the challenges of soccer helped mature her. As a girl, she played with toys long after other girls were already fussing with their hair, but eventually she bought a ring, her father said: it read “carpe diem,” Latin for “seize the day.”With college nearing, Ms. Moore was looking forward to a life of study, friends and independence. “She was somebody who was trying to carve out her own personality as a strong, independent woman,” he said. Given what happened on Tuesday, he added, “maybe too strong, maybe a little too independent.”Mr. Moore acknowledged that it may have been a fear of arrest — she had been probably been drinking, despite being under the legal drinking age — that led his daughter to flee the impound lot on West 38th Street and 12th Avenue and wander toward the Hudson River, where she eventually crossed paths with Mr. Coleman. At some point, he placed her in a taxi and took her to the Park Avenue Motel, a $300-a-week joint in Weehawken, N.J.It was Ms. Moore’s misfortune to have run into Mr. Coleman, a man with nine misdemeanors and a five-year prison term for selling crack cocaine in his past.Released last year from prison, he had stayed with Ms. Riordan for the last month or so at the motel in Weehawken, where Antonio Hernandez, a resident, said Mr. Coleman was constantly asking others if they had drugs or knew women who might have sex with Ms. Riordan while he watched.Mr. Coleman had a taste for cocaine, alcohol and prostitutes, Mr. Hernandez said, and sometimes earned money as a pimp or by playing online gambling games. “He did a lot of coke, drank a lot of beer and liked girls who went both ways.”In the Bronx, neighbors of Mr. Coleman’s former girlfriend — not the woman charged in Ms. Moore’s case — said they often heard him beating her.“You could tell what he was doing to her in there,” said Everton Thompson, who lived next door. “The sound of a body hitting the wall, that’s a terrible sound.”Mr. Coleman’s seeming propensity for violence was demonstrated again yesterday, according to a correction official, who said that while getting into a courthouse elevator, Mr. Coleman head-butted another inmate, knocking out some of the inmate’s teeth.What seems so troubling about Ms. Moore’s death is that, at least four times that night, she had encounters with people who might have altered the course that ended in her death.There were the bouncers and bartenders at the Guest House, a Chelsea nightclub, where she and her friend, Talia Kenan, were allowed inside to drink even though they were under age. There were the employees at the impound lot, where the police had towed Ms. Kenan’s car.There was the taxi driver who took Ms. Moore and Mr. Coleman across the river to the Park Avenue Motel. And there was the motel’s desk clerk or one of its residents, who may have seen the pair walk in — Ms. Moore slumped over Mr. Coleman’s arm, apparently drugged or drunk.The police have said that Ms. Moore also called her boyfriend about 4 a.m. and told him that someone was following her.There was even a moment, early Tuesday morning, when Ms. Kenan called Ms. Moore from the ambulance, which impound workers had requested after Ms. Kenan passed out. Naomi Kenan, Ms. Kenan’s mother, said Ms. Moore had told her daughter that she was lost, but that a “nice man” was helping her out.All of which was cold comfort for Hugh Moore.“If someone had done something, it may have made a huge difference, but it’s 20-20 hindsight,” he said. “I don’t think anybody did anything they shouldn’t have done.”He refused to fix blame on anyone tangentially involved in his daughter’s death.“It’s just a million variables that led to this tragedy,” he said.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','Of course, Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton are a long way from facing off for the presidency. Neither has even officially announced a candidacy, and both would still have to endure a primary season that is shaping up to be intense. Neither would probably be the other’s first choice as a rival; both would no doubt prefer to run against someone less skilled in blurring ideological lines.Still, members of both parties are already speculating about what a McCain-Clinton race would be like.“If they get through a primary election, they would be polar opposites on policy,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and a close ally of Mr. McCain who has traveled with both senators. “On the major issues, it’d be a fairly clear choice. But I believe that the personal relationship hopefully could survive the political process.”Harking to the days when a Republican president and a Democratic speaker of the House were friends, Mr. Graham said, “Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill, at the end of the day, would go down to the White House and knock one back, and the country was no worse off for that.”Rarely is it the case that likely presidential contenders are able to play off each other so much. Two modern races, in 1992 and 2000, pitted governors against Washington insiders, the candidates barely acquaintances. George W. Bush, then the governor of Texas, recalled having met Vice President Al Gore only a few times before they debated onstage in 2000.Four years later, despite their overlapping years at Yale and their work just down Pennsylvania Avenue from each other, President Bush and Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, made contact almost entirely over the airwaves.This time, with so many senators thinking about running, the primaries and potentially the general election could find the candidates squaring off against colleagues who are operating in close proximity. Mr. Kerry served in Vietnam around the same time as Mr. McCain, who defended him against Republican attacks during the 2004 race. Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, devised a landmark campaign-finance bill with Mr. McCain (and has since traveled with him and with Mrs. Clinton).Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain, however, share not just a title, but also a general approach to politics. Both strive to be seen as willing to break with ideological orthodoxy from time to time and to work across the aisle. Both emerged from nasty political battles — Whitewater and her husband’s impeachment in her case, the 2000 Republican primaries in his — declaring their hatred of the “politics of personal destruction,” as former President Bill Clinton called it.“They would run a completely different campaign than we’ve seen in recent memory,” said Marshall Wittman, a former aide to Mr. McCain who has worked with Mrs. Clinton.“Both of them realize there is a desire in the country for a different politics of national unity that transcends the current polarization,” Mr. Wittman said.At the same time, both have endured serious presidential campaigns before and market themselves as independent power brokers within their parties.“That’s their great commonality,” Mr. Wittman said. “Obviously, if they faced each other in a general, they would emphasize their differences.”A friendly relationship, or just the appearance of one, brings risks and advantages to both, although political strategists agreed it was wise for Mr. McCain to distance himself from Mrs. Clinton. (One reason is that Republicans said they could imagine a photograph of Mr. McCain with Mrs. Clinton, considered one of the most polarizing Democrats in politics, being used in a negative ad during a Republican primary.) Mr. McCain is also weakest among conservative Republicans, who dislike his willingness to take independent stands and work with Democrats.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, has been working to convince moderate voters that she is a centrist who can work across the aisle, a claim bolstered by Mr. McCain’s tacit approval of her.Both senators are accustomed to being sought out by other politicians hoping to burnish their own images. What makes their rapport different, advisers said, is that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain are essentially of equal stature.During their Estonia trip — also attended by Mr. Graham and Senators John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, and Susan Collins, Republican of Maine — Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton were the ones recognized as they walked through the streets of the capital, Tallinn.It was during their joint trip to Iraq in late February 2005 that Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton appeared via satellite on “Meet the Press,” an appearance that put their civility on display. When Mr. Russert asked Mr. McCain at the end of the interview whether he thought Mrs. Clinton would make a good president, Mrs. Clinton came to his rescue, saying: “Oh, we can’t hear you, Tim!”“Yeah, you’re breaking up,” Mr. McCain added, laughing. But then he said: “I happen to be a Republican and would support, obviously, a Republican nominee, but I have no doubt that Senator Clinton would make a good president.”Asked the same question about him, Mrs. Clinton replied without skipping a beat: “Absolutely.”Mr. McCain’s advisers played down their relationship, saying he was friendly with a number of Democrats. “They underscore their differences every day,” John Weaver, a political adviser to the senator, said of Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton. “That doesn’t mean you treat each other less civilly.”Philippe Reines, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said: “They are colleagues who have worked and traveled together on issues of interest to both, such as support for our military and global warming, and they agree to disagree on issues such as requiring greater scrutiny of foreign government ownership of our ports.”But Mr. Reines said Mrs. Clinton’s advisers had not noticed any recent changes in her relationship with Mr. McCain, and he declined to elaborate on the rounds of vodka.“What happens in Estonia stays in Estonia,” Mr. Reines said.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','The company’s profits would have been larger had it not been for a $300 million charge for uninsured costs for damages to equipment caused by last year’s hurricanes.Shares of Chevron fell 2.5 percent, to $66.03, in New York Stock Exchange trading. Analysts said that investors were disappointed that Chevron did not meet their expectations for even higher profits and were concerned over company warnings that its production would decrease in Venezuela because of greater control over oil fields exercised by the government of President Hugo Chávez. In a conference call, Chevron executives told analysts yesterday that the conversion of their Venezuelan subcontracting agreements to joint ventures with the Pdvsa state oil company would reduce company production by 90,000 barrels of oil a day in the second half of the year.“The financial impact of that is immaterial to Chevron,” Chevron chairman and chief executive officer, David J. O’Reilly, said, “because we’re going to a higher margin but lower volume amount of crude there.” Mr. O’Reilly added that the company was shifting its international operations to more stable areas, like Asia, the Caribbean and the West Coast of the United States.Nevertheless, the loss of Venezuelan production will contribute to a slight decrease in forecasted total company production to 2.6 million barrels of oil a day in the second half.Market jitters over Chevron’s results reflected a troubling trend shared by virtually all the major international oil companies: increasing exposure in politically unstable countries, where nationalistic governments like Venezuela’s are tightening terms of contracts, and guerrilla attacks on oil facilities are mounting in places like Nigeria.“Their dependency on unstable areas is increasing,” said Antoine Halff, an oil analyst at Fimat USA, a brokerage firm, speaking about Chevron but also other companies. “The share of their production that used to come from stable economies like the U.S. or the North Sea is declining because those areas are mature and face production decline.”The week of big oil profits reached a crescendo Thursday when both Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported a 36 percent gain in second-quarter earnings.But Shell reported that its oil and gas production actually fell by 8 percent for the quarter, due largely to the loss of 177,000 barrels a day in Nigeria because of political unrest and production contracts under which output is obliged to drop as oil prices rise.Exxon, which reported a stunning $10.36 billion net income for the quarter, was the only one of the big three producers to increase output in the quarter. Much of that growth was produced by the recent start-up of the Erha project 60 miles off the Nigerian shore.ConocoPhillips reported a 65 percent increase in profit on Wednesday for the second quarter. But there were soft spots in its performance. Production in its Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, field was off by 20,000 barrels a day, and repairs cut output in the North Sea.Those shortcomings were more than compensated for by its large investments in Libya, the Timor Sea and Russia’s Lukoil. Net income from the company’s noncontrolling stake in the Russian oil company soared 55 percent to $387 million in the quarter.Analysts have warned that ConocoPhillips made a risky move by purchasing the stake in Lukoil in 2004, but the bet significantly increased the company’s reserves at a bargain price.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','I HAVE paid extra for a fair number of organic products, believing that they are healthier for me, my family and the environment.And now it turns out that in some cases I should have saved my hard-earned money.Sure, some items that are called organic are probably worth the extra cost because they are produced according to strict standards. But the labels on quite a few of them are not worth an extra cent, according to a study of organic food by Consumer Reports, a publication of the nonprofit Consumers Union.An uninformed consumer can end up paying 50 to 100 percent more for products that are no healthier and a lot harder on the wallet. Recently, for example, I paid a higher price for “organic” salmon. Consumer Reports says there are no standards establishing which seafood really deserves the organic label. “It is misleading,” said Urvashi Rangan, a senior scientist and policy analyst with Consumers Union.In most states, wild or farmed fish can be labeled organic even though there is no guarantee that it is free from mercury or other industrial chemicals like PCB’s, Ms. Rangan said. (A consumer Web site maintained by the Monterey Aquarium Foundation has more information about which fish are safe to eat at www.seafoodwatch.org.)Labeling has been a matter of dispute in the organic food sector. In 2002, the Department of Agriculture established standards that foods must meet to be called organic, but last year an amendment was passed to allow 38 synthetic ingredients — including baking powder, pectin, ascorbic acid and carbon dioxide — in some organic products.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','It was Thursday night at the nightclub Cielo in the meatpacking district, and a team named We Are Robots was giving a dance party. We Are Robots promotes what its members call “minimal house, techno and electro,” and the word “minimal” is crucial.To cultish listeners around the world, “minimal” describes a constellation of electronic tracks that tend toward the sleek, the empty, the meticulous, the abstract. Instead of a wailing diva or a barrage of samples or a hummable tune, you get clicks and gurgles and smudges, slowly decaying or mutating. There’s a hint of snobbery, too: if a D.J. is playing this stuff, that means the club probably won’t be full of cheap cologne and sugary cocktails.But at this We Are Robots party, the sound rattling out from the speakers could hardly be described as minimalist. The culprit was Dominik Eulberg, a D.J. and producer from Bonn who takes a mischievous pleasure in toying with minimalist conventions. He began his set around 1:30 a.m., with a furious selection of frenetic techno tracks, using cross-cut rhythms to reach a series of blaring, rhythmless peaks.The crowd, which included both music geeks (who knew what they were in for) and casual clubbers (who couldn’t possibly have known), responded by alternately dancing and staring at the booth. Up above the dance floor, a shaggy blond guy was fiddling with his equipment and, from time to time, swigging Champagne.Mr. Eulberg’s debut album, “Flora & Fauna” (Traum Schallplatten), was released in 2004, but it was his 2005 double-CD mix, “Kreucht & Fleucht” (Mischwald), that helped win him a following, albeit a tiny one, in the United States. In a review for the indie Web site Pitchfork, Philip Sherburne called it “a guide to the Now Sound of clattery, post-minimalist German techno.” Throughout the two discs, Mr. Eulberg delights in emphasizing sounds that might once have seemed off-limits: snarling bass lines borrowed from acid house and triumphal keyboard lines that evoke progressive house, the populist genre that minimalists once loved to hate.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','Congress does need a new approach to illegal immigration, but raising the minimum wage is not the answer.Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell write, “Before we had mass illegal immigration in this country, hotel beds were made, dishes washed, office floors were cleaned, restaurant dishes were washed and crops picked — by Americans.”True. But now, many of those same Americans have gone on to do bigger and better things. The same class of citizens who used to do the “dirty jobs” in this country now do things like earn college degrees or own their own businesses.This country as a whole has gotten wealthier over the years. As lifestyles improve, the supply of workers to do the “dirty jobs” decreases.Illegal immigrants have been more than willing to step in and fill these low-paying jobs. If they were not there to fill in, this country’s overall wealth would not be what it is now. Bob BilokonskyRaising the minimum wage would make more jobs attractive to American workers. The history of past increases belies opponents’ arguments that an increase would destroy low-wage jobs.But to the extent that a higher minimum wage might squeeze low-wage employers, it would squeeze them to be more efficient, which would be a boon to the American economy.A higher minimum wage would cause employers to improve the productivity of their higher-paid workers, in an effort to extract the same value out of the wages they pay.A higher minimum wage would not decrease the amount of work that needs to be done. Because a vast majority of minimum wage jobs are service or agricultural jobs, they simply cannot be exported. Ultimately, a fair minimum wage would benefit everyone. Anthony BolzanThe writer was a strategic and legal adviser to one of the co-sponsors of a 2005 minimum wage bill in New Hampshire.Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell say that increasing the minimum wage and then strictly enforcing the labor laws would boost the employment of Americans and discourage illegal immigration.But if we’re willing to enforce laws, let’s simply enforce the ones we already have against employing illegal immigrants. This would automatically drive wages higher for the jobs still worth doing that are now done primarily by illegal immigrants. Paul NachmanIllegal immigrants typically take low-paying jobs, often “off the books” and at less than the minimum wage. So Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell propose raising the minimum wage to deal with this problem?Raising the minimum wage would make it more likely that employers would use illegal immigrants for their labor needs, because the price of employing legal citizens and residents would be increased. Instead of decreasing the demand for illegal immigrants, a higher minimum wage would increase it.Mr. Dukakis and Mr. Mitchell are right that increasing the minimum wage could lead to the destruction of some low-paying jobs. Their proposal should not be considered as the answer to anything other than how best to damage the opportunities of young, inexperienced and unskilled workers looking for their first job.Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell have finally said what no one else seems willing to say: that a living wage and decent working conditions and benefits would fill tough jobs with American workers and reduce America’s magnetic attraction for illegal immigrants.Low wages pose a very real problem for Americans that is not faced by many illegal immigrants. An illegal immigrant with no family here, who is able to work two or three jobs and share sleeping quarters with others, can get by on wages that someone whose family is in this country can’t get by on.A further step in the right direction would be a well-advertised anonymous hot line where Americans and illegal immigrants could report employer infractions. Rather than having to inspect every employer, enforcement officers could investigate only those accused of exploiting people. The possibility of being reported would keep employers honest.Michael S. Dukakis and Daniel J. B. Mitchell concede that “millions of illegal immigrants work for minimum and even sub-minimum wages.”Wouldn’t raising the minimum wage create an even bigger divide between naturalized Americans and immigrants, and thus exacerbate the immigration issue rather than resolve it?

"'06-07-29,'0','Re “NASA’s Goals Delete Mention of Home Planet’’ (front page, July 22): You declare that NASA deleted mention of the home planet in setting its goals for the future. The strategic plan states that one of our strategic goals is to “study Earth from space to advance scientific understanding and meet societal needs.”It goes on to discuss the importance of our current Earth science missions and those we intend to conduct over the next decade.A mission statement that calls upon NASA to pioneer the future in scientific discovery — as ours does — includes Earth science within the realm of scientific discovery.Deletion of the phrase “protect our home planet” from the 2006 strategic plan brought it into alignment with our statutory responsibilities and actual capabilities. Indeed, it was not clear that inclusion of the phrase made sense in the first place, since it raised questions that NASA is not able to address.NASA has a proud history of pioneering scientific discovery, a history to which the president and Congress have rededicated the agency in their vision for the agency’s future.'"
"'06-07-29,'0','“The industry is clearly more competitive than it has ever been,” said Faith Weiner, director of public affairs for Stop & Shop. “Lots of different channels are selling what would be traditionally grocery items. You have pharmacies, you have club stores, you have super centers all vying for a piece of the grocery business. For us to remain competitive, we need to differentiate ourselves.”The chain’s latest superstore prototype, from 2002, she said, continues to evolve.To appeal to the busy customer, the newest Super Stop & Shop markets — in Carle Place on Long Island and Port Chester in Westchester — have added gadgets and gizmos to encourage a one-stop shopping experience. The center aisle beckons like a movie marquee, stocked with DVD’s, video games and books. Customers can buy toilet seats and towels, Play-Doh and Barbies as easily as toilet paper, paper towels and detergent. As part of the chain’s store-within-a-store concept, there is a Staples office-supply section in one aisle, a Boston Chicken outlet in the prepared foods section and a small dining area equipped with wireless Internet service.FOR those in a hurry, Stop & Shop offers self-checkout and a “shopping buddy,” a computer tablet that goes on the cart, identifies specials and navigates the store at the swipe of a store card.“It will tell you where things are you normally buy, and it will allow you to order your deli when you are walking around the store and ring you when your deli is ready,” Ms. Weiner said. The chain is also introducing shopping carts with coffee cup holders, and in response to increasing consumer interest in natural and organic foods, it started a private label called Nature’s Promise.“It’s your mother’s dream supermarket of all the things she couldn’t find in the supermarket when she shopped it,” Ms. Weiner said, “or many things she didn’t even dream of that she can now find in a supermarket.”One person’s dream, though, can be another’s headache. At Stew Leonard’s in Yonkers, N.Y., and Norwalk and Danbury, Conn., the country-fair atmosphere, costumed characters and free nibbles keep the children entertained while their parents shop. But Nina Rodriguez, racing through the Norwalk branch on a recent afternoon, preferred to bypass what can seem as much tourist attraction as supermarket.“Its selection of produce and dairy products is fabulous, but you have to brave animatronic-singing vegetables, a petting zoo, large crowds and a theme-parklike atmosphere to get to it,” Ms. Rodriguez said. “I sometimes wish I could turn off the Chiquita Banana singing her catchy jingle and get my milk in peace.”Traditionalists like Ms. Rodriguez may do well shopping in the older, more crowded suburbs in Westchester and on Long Island, where real estate is at a premium and retail spaces are smaller.“Where real estate constraints exist, obviously we can’t expand the store,” said Ms. Weiner, “but we can renovate from the inside out and make sure every shopper has the opportunity for the most up-to-date experience.”While several superstores have opened in some of Westchester’s newer shopping areas, people like Louise Danzig, a retired nurse practitioner from Chappaqua, does not shop in them. “They take too long to go through for me,” she said. Instead, she prefers a smaller specialty store in town for already prepared gourmet items and a cramped A & P in Millwood for everything else. She would have appreciated the bigger markets, she said, when her three sons were young enough to live at home.Laurie Bershad, the mother of a 5- and a 10-year-old from West Windsor, N.J., likes to shop in her local Wegmans, the Rochester-based chain. “The produce can’t be beat and their prepared food, albeit pricey, is really delicious,” Ms. Bershad said. But the real draw is that “the kids love to go to the baby-sitting room, which makes shopping for me a much more tolerable experience.” And it’s possible to combine shopping with lunch by dining in the in-store cafe.INDUSTRY insiders call the trend toward turning food shopping into an engaging, interactive experience “retail-tainment.”“Supermarkets are learning they need to create more excitement for the consumer, better services,” Mr. Taft, the consultant, said. “They need to convince customers that it’s fun to come into a particular store to do their shopping.”Otto Leuschel, vice president of operations for the Northeast region for Whole Food Markets, which includes 13 of the natural and organic food purveyor’s 184 stores, said that all of the chain’s new stores had been built with cafes to help take “the drudgery out of shopping.”“It’s what we call the ‘linger longer effect,’ ” Mr. Leuschel said. “Seating areas give people an option to make it a lunch or dinner destination. They are not just supermarkets; they are someplace you can sit down and enjoy a meal and a nice ambience and a sense of place in the community that you can go hang out.”Some patrons fill up their carts before stopping at the prepared foods counter and dine before they head out the door. Others eat first — to stem the cravings that cause impulse buying or to make it easier to cruise the supermarket aisles with children in tow. Some families, like the McDowells, do their food shopping at other times, and come back for dinner. Afterward, they buy a cantaloupe or a melon to take home for dessert, cups of organic tea in hand.The new 50,000-square-foot Whole Foods Market scheduled to open this fall in West Orange, N.J., will have a mini-seafood restaurant near the seafood department with a grill or a fish fry. Other Whole Food Markets in Texas and Ohio have trattorias and barbecue sections with small seating areas in the middle of the store.Providing places to eat is one strategy store managers are adopting to compete with restaurants, especially those that serve takeout. “Applebee’s, Chili’s, Outback all have curbside takeaways,” Mr. Taft said. “That is taking money out of the supermarket operations.” To keep a share of those dollars, supermarkets are tempting shoppers with freshly prepared and ready-to-eat meals.Food stations inside Whole Foods overflow with sushi, salad, soup or precooked vegetarian dishes, which can be eaten in the store’s cafe for a quick lunch or dinner. Marshmallows, flatbreads and dried fruits can be dipped in a fountain at the chocolate station; a dessert bar beckons with slices of almond cream cake, crème caramel and thick, sugary Belgian waffles.Joseph Brown, vice president of sales and merchandising for the King Kullen chain of 46 traditional supermarkets, is also co-president of three Wild by Nature markets, which are billed as natural food and organic produce stores. Because of heightened consumer interest in healthier lifestyles and the role food can play, Mr. Brown said, King Kullen added an in-house nutritionist, a nutrition hot line and a nutrition club for shoppers.At the seminar center at the Wild by Nature market that opened in Hampton Bays, N.Y., in May, shoppers can attend free health lectures. And across from a juice bar, a salad station and a sandwich kiosk is a cafe.“The cafe was a hit right off the bat,” Mr. Brown said. “It’s becoming a town meeting area; it’s a comfortable place for customers to sit and eat lunch or breakfast or dinner and chat with other neighbors.”In the last 5 to 10 years, Mr. Brown said, supermarkets have also placed a greater emphasis on freshness and convenience, increasing the size of their produce, deli and prepared foods departments.It’s not just the new sushi bar that has shoppers driving out of their way for a food adventure at the Fairway in Plainview, N.Y., where a towering stack of plums and heaps of fresh corn are set up like an open-air market outside the door and customers are encouraged to husk on the spot. “People expect more from their markets now, and they should get it,” said David Sneddon, a co-owner of Fairway’s four stores, noting that the gourmet specialty items and prepared food departments were growing. One of the chain’s Manhattan branches has a self-service cafe and a full-service steakhouse.ON a recent evening Liora and Arthur Kahn of West Babylon, N.Y., traveled 25 minutes to Plainview to fill their cart with Fairway’s organic fruits and vegetables; choose from an assortment of grains and nuts; sample some of the 300 to 400 cheeses at the specialty counter; and scoop into giant buckets of olives (French niçoise, Greek pitted calamata and a Tunisian mix, with cinnamon sticks and bay leaves).At Fairway, the aisles are wide, and nuts and sparkling waters instead of candy are displayed near the checkout counter. Ninety-one varieties of coffee can be roasted in a jet-engine-style roaster.To entice hungry shoppers, showcases around the edge of the store are stocked with ready-to-cook rosemary mint lamb kebabs, tuna burgers and steakhouse-style prime aged beef. Freshly baked cookies and 12-grain breads lure consumers to the bakery; countermen meticulously slice the smoked salmon to order.“There is nothing like it around us,” Ms. Kahn said, sampling a Pont L’Evêque, a creamy, full-bodied cheese made on the coast of Normandy with origins dating to the 13th century. “They have really good produce, great prices.”For items like toilet paper, tissues and shampoo, though, the Kahns head for Costco. “We definitely don’t go to the local supermarket,” Ms. Kahn said.Harvey Hartman, chief executive of the Hartman Group, a consulting firm in Seattle, said that shoppers looked for different experiences at different stores, cutting the plain vanilla supermarket out of the loop. “The grocery store doesn’t understand that the whole culture of food is changing,” he said.But many consumers do; some have even developed a multilateral approach. “People talk a lot about one-stop shopping,” said Mr. Taft, the consultant. “But actually today consumers are shopping in more outlets than they did 10 years ago.”Barbara Breslow, a preschool director from Old Bethpage, N.Y., used to do all her food shopping at a local ShopRite. These days she loads her shopping wagon at Trader Joe’s, a California-based chain where the “crew members” wear Hawaiian shirts, the snacks are free of trans fats and cleaning products are environmentally friendly. She frequents Fairway for the produce, specialty cheeses, cooked barbecued chickens and shish kebabs that are spiced and ready to toss on the grill, and sends her husband, Allen, to the store’s cafe for dinner on the nights she is not home. Once a month, and for parties, she buys staples and platters at Costco. And on a recent evening she tried the free samples of sweet chili chicken skewers at Whole Foods and picked up Cajun salmon burgers for dinner.“Now I only go to ShopRite for milk, cereal, and, if the grandchildren are coming, for juice,” Ms. Breslow said.At the Whole Foods in Jericho, as the guitarist and singer perform by the microwave, Karen Renna of Westbury, N.Y., and Beth Williams of Oyster Bay, shopping carts pushed to the side, share a dessert as part of their weekly Thursday night date. For the last four months, their pattern hasn’t varied: first they shop, then the two teacher-artists meet in the supermarket cafe for dinner.“A long time ago people used to talk over the back fence,” Ms. Williams said, as the performers struck up a new tune. “It’s like that here.”'"

"'06-07-30,'0','DARIEN, Conn., July 29 — Besides providing the first public accounting of how much money turned up missing while the Rev. Michael Jude Fay ran St. John Roman Catholic Church — an estimated $1.4 million — an audit released Friday also gave parishioners the first explanation from Father Fay himself:¶ Father Fay told auditors he transferred $34,000 of church funds into his own bank account in March, the report said, because he was worried that the church would not be able to meet payroll, and he wanted to safeguard the money. Then, when he needed to pay a deposit on a condominium in Philadelphia, he said he panicked and borrowed the $34,000. Ultimately, as the outflows were being questioned, a check from Father Fay’s mother arrived that let him replace the money, the report noted.¶ Father Fay acknowledged secretly using $1,500 a month in church money to lease an Upper East Side pied-à-terre, saying it was because he was getting cancer treatments in New York. But auditors discovered that the lease began in August 2000, nine months before he got the cancer diagnosis. All told, he spent $87,000 to rent the Madison Avenue apartment and about $71,000 on limousines, mostly to and from Manhattan.¶ Father Fay spent $140,000 of church money eating out during the roughly six-year audit period, on top of what the church paid local restaurants to feed the priests living at its rectory. He called it a job entitlement, even when he was on vacation.“Father Fay stated that he believes he was entitled to dine at any restaurant of his choosing, and as frequently as he desired, regardless of cost,” the report said.¶ The report also said the priest asserted that $515,000 he withdrew from parish bank accounts went to “parishioners in need” whose names he could not divulge. However, auditors traced $380,000 of the money back to Father Fay’s personal accounts.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','SULLIVAN, Mo., July 29 (AP) — A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff on Saturday, killing six people on board and injuring two others, the authorities and witnesses said.Early reports indicated the plane might have struck a telephone pole before hitting a tree, said Gary F. Toelke, the Franklin County sheriff. It crashed about 10 feet from a house.Four people were dead at the scene and two more died at St. John’s Mercy Hospital in Creve Coeur, said David Downs, a hospital spokesman. One of the injured was in critical condition, and one was in serious condition, Mr. Downs said.No one on the ground was injured, Sheriff Toelke said.“People on the ground said they saw something happen to the engine,” the sheriff said, “and the plane sort of entered into a nosedive.”The victims were not identified, but some were believed to have been from the St. Louis area.The plane, a DeHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter, left the Sullivan Regional Airport in eastern Missouri a short time before the crash, said Ken Tretter, a patrol operator.The plane was making a skydiving flight for Quantum Leap Skydiving Inc., said Mark Lacy, safety and training adviser for the company, which is located in Sullivan. There were eight people aboard, he said.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','The United States Embassy in Baghdad referred questions about the audit to the State Department in Washington, where a spokesman, Justin Higgins, said Saturday, “We have not yet had a chance to fully review this report, but certainly will consider it carefully, as we do all the findings of the inspector general.”Bechtel has said that because of the deteriorating security in Basra, the hospital project could not be completed as envisioned. But Mr. Higgins said: “Despite the challenges, we are committed to completing this project so that sick children in Basra can receive the medical help they need. The necessary funding is now in place to ensure that will happen.”In March 2005, A.I.D. asked the Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office at the United States Embassy in Baghdad for permission to downsize some projects to ease widespread financing problems. In its request, it said that it had to “absorb greatly increased construction costs” at the Basra hospital and that it would make a modest shift of priorities and reduce “contractor overhead” on the project.The embassy office approved the request. But the audit found that the agency interpreted the document as permission to change reporting of costs across its program.Referring to the embassy office’s approval, the inspector general wrote, “The memorandum was not intended to give U.S.A.I.D. blanket permission to change the reporting of all indirect costs.”The hospital’s construction budget was $50 million. By April of this year, Bechtel had told the aid agency that because of escalating costs for security and other problems, the project would actually cost $98 million to complete. But in an official report to Congress that month, the agency “was reporting the hospital project cost as $50 million,” the inspector general wrote in his report.The rest was reclassified as overhead, or “indirect costs.” According to a contracting officer at the agency who was cited in the report, the agency “did not report these costs so it could stay within the $50 million authorization.”“We find the entire agreement unclear,” the inspector general wrote of the A.I.D. request approved by the embassy. “The document states that hospital project cost increases would be offset by reducing contractor overhead allocated to the project, but project reports for the period show no effort to reduce overhead.”The report said it suspected that other unreported costs on the hospital could drive the tab even higher. In another case cited in the report, a power station project in Musayyib, the direct construction cost cited by the development agency was $6.6 million, while the overhead cost was $27.6 million.One result is that the project’s overhead, a figure that normally runs to a maximum of 30 percent, was a stunning 418 percent.The figures were even adjusted in the opposite direction when that helped the agency balance its books, the inspector general found. On an electricity project at the Baghdad South power station, direct construction costs were reported by the agency as $164.3 million and indirect or overhead costs as $1.4 million.That is just 0.8 percent overhead in a country where security costs are often staggering. A contracting officer told the inspector general that the agency adjusted the figures “to stay within the authorization for each project.”The overall effect, the report said, was a “serious misstatement of hospital project costs.” The true cost could rise as high as $169.5 million, even after accounting for at least $30 million pledged for medical equipment by a charitable organization.The inspector general also found that the agency had not reported known schedule delays to Congress. On March 26, 2006, Bechtel informed the agency that the hospital project was 273 days behind, the inspector general wrote. But in its April report to Congress on the status of all projects, “U.S.A.I.D. reported no problems with the project schedule.”In a letter responding to the inspector general’s findings, Joseph A. Saloom, the newly appointed director of the reconstruction office at the United States Embassy, said he would take steps to improve the reporting of the costs of reconstruction projects in Iraq. Mr. Saloom took little exception to the main findings.In the letter, Mr. Saloom said his office had been given new powers by the American ambassador in Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, to request clear financing information on American reconstruction projects. Mr. Saloom wrote that he agreed with the inspector general’s conclusion that this shift would help “preclude surprises such as occurred on the Basra hospital project.”“The U.S. Mission agrees that accurate monitoring of projects requires allocating indirect costs in a systematic way that reflects accurately the true indirect costs attributable to specific activities and projects, such as a Basra children’s hospital,” Mr. Saloom wrote.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','Senate Democrats, who have successfully blocked past Republican efforts to slash the estate tax, suggested they would try to do so again despite the inclusion of the minimum wage increase they had been clamoring for in recent years.Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Saturday that he did not expect the Senate to approve the plan when it reaches the floor next week, which, he said, was just what the House Republican leadership wanted.“Last night the House Republicans played a cynical game of politics with the lives of millions of hard-working American families,” Mr. Kennedy said. “I am confident the Senate will reject this political blackmail, as the House leadership is banking on.”But 34 House Democrats joined 196 Republicans in sending the measure to the Senate, while 158 Democrats, 21 Republicans and one independent opposed it.Under the minimum wage proposal, the rate would increase from the current $5.15 per hour in three increments, reaching $7.25 in June 2009. It would also allow tips to be counted toward minimum wage increases in some states where that is now prohibited, a provision Democrats said would cut wages for thousands of workers in those states.House Republican leaders said their Senate counterparts had argued that the only way the wage increase would survive in the Senate was if it was coupled with the estate tax reductions. To sweeten the pot even more, Republicans moved $38 billion in a wide array of tax breaks to the estate tax bill from a pension overhaul that was approved Friday.“What we have done is try to package this to succeed in getting the minimum wage through the other body,” said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.But critics said voters would see through the ploy. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, called the legislation “an insult to the intelligence of the American people.”The tax provisions restored and extended such popular breaks as a maximum $4,000 income tax deduction for higher-education expenses and a variety of benefits for industry and communities.Under the estate tax provisions, estimated to cost $268 billion in federal revenue over 10 years, $5 million of an individual’s estate would be fully exempt by 2015. Estates up to $25 million would be taxed at the rate for capital gains, now 15 percent. The bill also phases in a reduced tax rate on amounts in excess of $25 million, eventually setting it at 30 percent.With no changes, the current estate tax exemptions would revert in 2011 to $1 million per person with a maximum estate tax rate of 55 percent.The minimum wage vote came after House Republican leaders scrambled to respond to appeals from Republicans in the Northeast and the Midwest who said they needed to dilute Democratic attacks and were worried they would be pounded in the August recess by labor groups.Some Republicans said they would have preferred that the wage increase be tied to legislation other than the estate tax cut, with a health initiative for small businesses one popular alternative.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','At a time when the price of gold has risen sharply — it has more than doubled in less than five years, and is now at $635 an ounce — the stakes for Barrick are enormous. In a 2004 legal filing in Canada, the company says that Pascua-Lama, which also contains silver deposits worth an estimated $7.5 billion and some copper, represents “approximately 25 percent of Barrick’s worldwide gold reserves.”But the stakes are just as high for local people, who will be here long after the mine closes and who depend on agriculture and runoff from the highlands for drinking water and irrigation in an otherwise parched region.Home to 70,000 people, the Huasco Valley is a narrow ribbon of green that flows from the Andes west to the Pacific Ocean, just south of the world’s driest desert, the Atacama. Thanks to skillful irrigation, local farmers, including some who belong to the Diaguita indigenous group, have become successful exporters of grapes, avocados, olives, guavas and even mangoes to the United States, Japan and Europe.What Barrick proposes is to carve a huge canyon, about a mile wide and about 2,000 feet deep, at the Pascua-Lama mine, which stretches over the border into Argentina. The ore would then be crushed and milled and the gold extracted using chemicals that include cyanide. Environmental groups and farmers have expressed concerns that the operations will end up tainting and diverting the local water supply.“What the government is doing doesn’t make any sense,” said David Martínez Campillay, who has a small grape farm in the community of Chinguito near here. “Chile used to be known only as a mining country,” he added, “and so we were encouraged to branch into new areas of agriculture so that our country could export different products, like fruit. We did that, and now what does the government do? It favors a project that is only going to be here 20 years.”Barrick complains that its opponents are using scare tactics to mobilize the local population. It says the project will include safety measures like channels to divert water away from acidic waste rock and the construction of 34 stations to monitor water quality.“Cyanide is used in all kinds of industrial applications worldwide and needs to be transported, handled and managed in a safe and responsible manner,” Vincent Borg, a Barrick spokesman, said in a telephone interview from the company’s headquarters in Toronto. “Barrick has an exemplary record and has never had any major incidents involving cyanide.”In an earlier version of its plan, Barrick proposed moving three glaciers near the mine by chopping them up and hauling the ice and snow to another site. Environmental and civic groups kicked up a storm, arguing that moving the glaciers would deprive the region of a source of drinking water and otherwise damage the environment.The government acceded to their request to let the glaciers alone. But the mine’s opponents still say they fear that dust from blasting, excavation and other work at the pit will land on the glaciers and speed their melting.Barrick officials question whether the ice can be called glaciers at all. “These ice fields — or glaciers or glaciarets or ice reservoirs, or whatever you choose to call them — are naturally dusty and because of global warming have been receding for years,” Mr. Borg said. He said the company’s studies showed that the mine would have “minimal impact on any acceleration” of the melting.Environmental concerns are not the only issues, however. Under regulations that date to the last days of the Pinochet dictatorship and were liberalized after the return of democracy in 1990, gold, silver and copper mines in Chile are effectively exempted from most taxes and royalties. That enrages many of the project’s opponents and has recently become the subject of a heated national debate.“As Chilean farmers, we are subsidizing a multinational mining company that makes billions of dollars,” said Natanael Vivanco, who was a miner before becoming a grape grower in Chinguito. “We pay taxes, a lot of them, and our government uses that money to make things easier for a foreign company that doesn’t pay a dollar to Chile.”The Ministry of Mines and Energy declined a request for an interview to discuss Pascua-Lama and tax and royalty policy for foreign-owned mines, as did the government’s Foreign Investment Commission. But Julián Alcayaga, an economist and former congressional aide who specializes in mining issues, said that over the last decade, fewer than five foreign-owned mining projects have paid any taxes or royalties to the Chilean government.And even with the government approval it obtained in February, Barrick still faces legal obstacles. In June, a Chilean court ruled that a contract in which Rodolfo Villar, a Chilean mining engineer, ceded his claims to 21,000 acres surrounding Pascua-Lama was invalid because Barrick paid Mr. Villar only $10 while giving his lawyer $650,000 for a much smaller area.Mr. Borg said the company viewed the Villar case as “a nuisance suit” that will be resolved in Barrick’s favor on appeal. But Mr. Villar’s lawyer, Hernán Montealegre, described the case as “a David versus Goliath” struggle in which a corporate giant has been caught cheating.“For having deceived this man, Barrick is going to have to pay a high price,” Mr. Montealegre said in an interview in Santiago. “They are going to have to negotiate with us, and our floor price is at least $100 million.”Barrick has sought to blunt complaints about its windfall strike here by establishing itself as a good corporate citizen, donating ambulances and other equipment to local governments and community groups in the Huasco Valley.The company has also set up a job training program that more than 3,000 people have attended, and it says the project will purchase $250 million in goods and services from local merchants.But the steps seem to merely irritate the project’s opponents even further. “You know how you give a piece of candy to a noisy child to shut it up?” asked Enrique Gaytán Arcos, a municipal council member here. “Well, that’s what they are trying to do to us.”'"
"'06-07-30,'0','His wife, who says she “doesn’t want to quit her other job too soon,” echoes his caution. “I recommend people start planning before they retire,” Ms. Ferguson said, “especially in today’s world, where pensions are no longer a guaranteed thing, when companies are taking them away right and left.”For some experts, this uncertainty makes the Fergusons’ way of doing things — hanging on to their old jobs and self-financing C & G — a wise strategy.Most people do not succeed with their small businesses because they do not have enough capital or they have too much debt, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics and director of the Higgins Labor Research Center at the University of Notre Dame and editor of “What You Need to Know About the Economics of Growing Old (but Were Afraid to Ask)” (University of Notre Dame Press, 2004). “It’s better to have other sources of income, have your medical insurance taken care of, have no debt and accumulate a pension.”Referring to Mr. Ferguson’s situation, she said: “He has a good pension and security. That makes a lot of sense. He’s beating the odds.”Herb Greenberg, founder, president and chief executive of Caliper, an international human resources consulting firm based in Princeton, N.J., calls the Fergusons’ strategy brilliant. “They’re not dependent on their enterprise for money, so they are able to build at their pace and still have substantial income,” said Mr. Greenberg, who was a co-author of “Succeed on Your Own Terms: Lessons From Top Achievers Around the World on Developing Your Unique Potential” (McGraw-Hill, 2006).The ability to “try out options,” while other work provides a secure financial situation, is important, he said, because if the new project does not work out, there is still time to pursue other avenues. Starting a business after one has officially retired provides less flexibility. “The downside of doing it sequentially is the loss of years,” he said.How do middle-aged people find the stamina to keep both their secure jobs and their entrepreneurial ventures afloat?Lisa Haneberg, a management and leadership consultant who also coaches people in the process of becoming business owners, says the answer is focus, which she defines as “the coming together of all parts of my life for a common goal.”The greatest liability in setting up one’s own company is the unwillingness to work at it every day, said Ms. Haneberg, whose new book is titled “Focus Like a Laser Beam: 10 Ways to Do What Matters Most” (Jossey-Bass, 2006). “A lot of people think they can do it for an hour on a Saturday,” she said. “They don’t add a new habit into their habitual life.”A person is most focused when “you’re willing to play with what gives you energy and passion,” Ms. Haneberg said. “Disciplined resoluteness is fed from passion; it doesn’t happen by magic.”But for many baby boomers, what’s even scarier than having to dig deep within themselves to arrive at a suitable postretirement career is the prospect of juggling the new venture, sometimes stealthily, while still working at their primary jobs.“While you need to be responsible, it’s well worth the risk to create something special,” said Daniel J. Kadlec, a financial writer and co-author of “The Power Years: A User’s Guide to the Rest of Your Life” (Wiley, 2005), who points to the “deterioration of safety nets — such as pensions and Social Security benefits, which people are coming to realize may not be there for them down the line — as a reason to create a bridge to full retirement.”“Employer loyalty isn’t what it used to be,’’ he said. “They’re taking care of the C.E.O., but certainly not the line worker anymore. You’ve got to take care of you.”Many agree, however, that treading lightly is advisable. As Rick Miners, a consultant and the co-author of “Don’t Retire, Rewire!” (Alpha/Penguin Putnam, 2002), said, “There’s delicacy here.”The worker may be overly tired or spending too much time away from work, and “if your primary employer feels they’re being taken advantage of, it may create a problem,” he said.And, he added, while working on the new company with one’s spouse provides predictability, not everyone has the inclination to do so. With work stressful enough as it is, he said, the absence of emotional downtime just adds pressure.Mr. Ferguson, however, has always seen C & G Salsa as a win-win situation for him and his employer. “It doesn’t have to be negative,” he said, adding that a number of people where he works have developed entrepreneurial interests. He says he believes that his outside business benefits his employer. “Here you’ve got someone learning new things,” he said. “You’re getting a better employee.”'"
"'06-07-30,'0','Stocks rallied this week on hopes that the economy has been slowing just enough to convince Federal Reserve policy makers that it is time to stop raising short-term interest rates.The Commerce Department on Friday said that the gross domestic product, or the sum of the nation’s output of goods and services, rose by an annual rate of only 2.5 percent in the second quarter. That was a much lower rate than Wall Street had expected. Still, it was robust enough for many investors to believe that the economic expansion will continue — albeit at a pace slow enough to dampen inflation and to persuade the Fed that there is no need for an interest rate increase at its August meeting.General Motors gained 12.2 percent for the week, best among the Dow industrials. Nvidia, the computer graphics chip maker, gained 27.1 percent, leading the stocks in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 351.32 points, or 3.2 percent, to close at 11,219.70. The S.& P. 500 rose 38.26 points, or 3.1 percent, to 1,278.55. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 73.75 points, or 3.7 percent, to close at 2,094.14.

"'06-07-30,'0','WHEN policymakers think about electricity, they usually focus on generating more of it. But building power plants is the easier part of assuring reliability. As the Queens blackout shows, the harder part is ensuring that transmission and distribution lines, like the distribution networks that Con Edison manages in New York, are adequate to carry electricity to homes and businesses.Independent generators like Astoria Energy build plants to meet demand because they face competitive pressure: if one company doesn’t build a plant, another will. But Con Ed, a monopoly, has no competitive pressure to distribute power more efficiently.Since Con Ed is a monopoly, state regulators supervise it: the company depends on regulators to allow it to pass the cost of network upgrades to customers. But regulators aren’t solely interested in performance during peak usage; they’re also interested in keeping rates low.It thus falls to Mayor Michael Bloomberg to see that Con Ed’s planned investments in upgrading its system — $5.3 billion over three years — are enough and that equipment isn’t too old or inadequate, as it was in Queens this year and in Washington Heights seven summers ago. When Con Ed and the state fail, New York City suffers.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','For a former home of possibly the country’s most notorious mobster, the three-story building with beige siding at 21 Garfield Place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, is totally unremarkable. Of course, the young Al Capone and his family moved there in the early 1900’s, long before he made his name as a murderous bootlegger in Roaring Twenties Chicago.The house, one of at least two on Garfield Place where the Capone family lived after their move from Vinegar Hill, just east of the Manhattan Bridge in Brooklyn, is for sale. The broker handling it, Peggy Aguayo of Aguayo & Huebener, said recently that a buyer was about to go into contract, for a little more than $1 million.Ms. Aguayo, who lives in Park Slope, said she was unaware that the Capones had lived in the building, though she knew they had lived at 38 Garfield Place. At any rate, she said, she doubted that the building’s infamous former resident affected its value one way or the other for the buyers, who plan to maintain it in its current state, as a three-family house.Capone stories still abound among old-timers in the neighborhoods where he spent his formative years. For example, Carroll Gardens residents will be happy to tell you that he was married at St. Mary Star of the Sea church on Court Street. But Laurence Bergreen, author of the 1994 biography “Capone: The Man and the Era,” said there was little at the time to distinguish the future Public Enemy No. 1 from his young compatriots in Brooklyn’s street gangs, which had names like the South Brooklyn Rippers and the Forty Thieves Juniors.“Other people were doing those same things and went on to become mechanics or dentists, or nothing,” Mr. Bergreen said. “He did not come from a criminal background. His father was a barber, his mother was a seamstress, and those weren’t mob trades.”Still, Mr. Bergreen said, the Al Capone of Garfield Place was no angel. He was often truant from Public School 133 on Butler Street, and he was finally kicked out of school for hitting a teacher (as the story goes, she hit him first). He also picked up a case of syphilis that incapacitated him later in life, probably while hanging out by the Brooklyn docks.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','No one can say precisely how many more cornflakes are served in American kitchens each morning because there’s a picture of a race car on the box. But the Nascar connection constitutes the entire strategy of this mutual fund. Mr. Carter said he did not evaluate the stocks but acted like the passive manager of an index fund, strictly eliminating companies that end their race-car sponsorships and adding companies that take them on.The fund, which has less than $6 million in assets, has had average annual returns of 4.3 percent over the five years through Thursday, about 1.6 percentage points higher than the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. It has lagged the S.& P. by 1.7 percentage points this year.Roy Weitz, the publisher of FundAlarm.com, said he was not surprised that it had outperformed the S.& P. index over long stretches. “The idea that these stocks should be arranged in a portfolio because they support Nascar is sort of an absurd concept, but it appears to be working,” he said. “But that doesn’t validate the idea of the gimmick or niche funds.“There’s always going to be some outliers that outperform the market, and that’s what keeps them going. That’s why people keep going to Vegas. In the end, the house always wins, but once in a while someone hits big.”Nascar fans have certainly been loyal — both to their sport and to their fund, which Mr. Carter has managed since its inception in 1998. A themed fund aimed at golfing enthusiasts folded in less than a year. The short-lived Golf Associated fund returned about 3 percent from January to December of 1999. It held Callaway Golf, a golf club and golf ball maker based in Carlsbad, Calif. But the manager had to search past the 18th hole for investments. According to a fund report from 1999, 70 percent of the portfolio consisted of golfing-related stocks, and the rest of other stocks.Mutual funds like these are similar to affinity credit cards, said Russel Kinnel, Morningstar’s head of mutual fund research. But even if the first three letters of the word “fund” spell “fun,” Mr. Kinnel said he did not think it made sense to invest that way.Rather than purchasing shares of the golf fund, Mr. Kinnel suggested investors might have been happier buying a good diversified fund and putting the money saved on expenses into a new set of golf clubs, or a round of golf at Pebble Beach.“I think you’ll enjoy that a lot more than getting an annual investor report with a picture of a golf club,” he said. The fund industry has had a trendy element practically from the start. There was at least one television stock fund in the 1950’s, and an oceanographic fund in the 1960’s. While there’s no denying television’s influence, the premise behind the Steadman Oceanographic fund was a bit more obscure.“I think the idea was that we were going to live in the sea, and farm under the sea,” Mr. Kinnel said.Often these novelty funds were inspired by current events. For example, Kinetics Mutual Funds — which started the first Internet fund in 1996 — created the Middle East Growth fund in 2000. The idea was to cash in on the economic boom that would result from peace in the Middle East.Kinetics liquidated that fund in December 2001, after slightly less than two years. Anyone who had invested from the start would have lost more than 38 percent.But even when the fund industry has been right about a trend, the narrowly sliced funds that it has inspired have not always been sure bets. The dizzy rollout of Internet funds in 1999 is a case in point. The Amerindo B2B fund was liquidated in 2003, after less than three years. Investors who were in from the start would have lost 65 percent. The Westcott Technology Nothing but Net fund was liquidated in 2002. After less than three years, the fund had lost more than 85 percent.Meanwhile, stocks of Internet giants like Google and Yahoo are now part of basic stock index funds. The fund industry is giving investors a chance to place bets on other trends — on nanotech, genomics and water. On Dec. 6, for example, PowerShares Capital Management, an exchange-traded fund company based in Wheaton, Ill., started the PowerShares Water Resources Portfolio.“We had recently filed or introduced E.T.F.’s along many of the different natural resources categories, including oil and gas, and we began to look at water as one of these natural resources that investors didn’t have good access to,” said Bruce Bond, president of PowerShares.Of course, barrels of water are not traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, so the fund holds a basket of stocks, mostly of American water utilities.Mr. Bond called water “a vital commodity,” which undoubtedly it is. “Historically, water hasn’t been as volatile as oil,” Mr. Bond said, but he predicted that in the future, “water has the potential to be a very good investment for people.”APPARENTLY many investors agree. Since it began trading, the exchange-traded fund has garnered $1 billion in assets. The shares closed at $16.23 on Friday, not very far from their first-day opening price of $15.24. But it has been a wild ride. The fund is down about 16 percent from its peak in early May.The fund is not the only one ever to focus on water. Pictet & Compagnie, a Swiss financial services company, liquidated the Pictet Global Water fund in 2003. Any investors who had purchased shares when the fund began trading less than two years earlier would have lost 10.6 percent.PowerShares does not limit itself to commodities. Other additions to its lineup last year included the PowerShares Dynamic Biotechnology & Genome Portfolio and the Lux Nanotech Portfolio.Investors already had another option if they were convinced that genomics would outperform broader health sector funds. The Genomics Fund was created in 2000, during the first burst of enthusiasm after scientists finished sequencing the human genome.Money rolled into the fund that year, with assets peaking at more than $35 million after just six months. Its assets have steadily dwindled ever since, and now hover around $5 million, according to AMG Data Services.The Genomics Fund, which closed at $2.97 on Thursday, has lost more than 8 percent a year on average over the last five years; although it has risen about 70 percent since Satuit Capital Management, which is based in Richmond, Va., started managing it in January 2003.The fund has an annual expense ratio of 1.9 percent, while the average expense ratio for actively managed domestic stock funds is 1.5 percent.Robert J. Sullivan of Satuit said that when he took over the portfolio he was “resolved to look at more than just this straight science stuff. It’s more than Genentech.” He said there were many ways to play genomics — including investments in companies that make lab coats and test tubes — while still keeping the fund’s genomics flavor.In other words, in the future, this fund could look a lot more like a health sector fund.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','COMPANIES seeking to innovate by devising new products must also create new business models, says Adrian J. Slywotzky, a director at Mercer Management Consulting and co-author most recently of “How to Grow When Markets Don’t” (Warner Business Books, 2003). Here are excerpts from a conversation:Q. What do companies get wrong when they try to innovate?A. The central issue is that 90 percent of the energy goes into the technology and the engineering and very little is left over for designing the business as carefully and as shrewdly as they designed the product. If you look at the natural history of great new product failures, it’s often because they went with the standard business model, or the first feasible business model, instead of doing what good companies do, which is challenge themselves and ask, “What are three very different business designs that we can use to take this product to market?”Q. What’s an example of a company that got a new business model right?A. One of the most striking examples is the contrast between the Toyota hybrid and the Honda hybrid. If you think of designing a business, there are four questions: Who is the key customer? What’s the unique benefit? What’s the profit model? And how do we protect our strategic control? Toyota focused on customers who are not just eco-conscious but also are wealthier. But Honda, with the Civic and the Accord, focused on more moderate-income customers. The unique benefit for Toyota was not just energy efficiency, but also the style, the electronics and the smoother ride.Q. What about Apple and its iPod?A. Apple is an even better example. There have been lots of very good MP3 music players. But Apple came up with a business design that is unique in that field. Think about all the elements. Think about iPod without the iTunes music store. Think of it without the growing array of TV shows and, in the future, movies. The important customer for the iPod is the consumer but in a lot of ways the even more important customers are the music industry and Hollywood. Apple went to great lengths to create a very strong relationship there by providing antipiracy technology. So Apple was good at engineering and product design but it also had an outstanding design of the business. It’s quite a unique profit model: “We sell music cheaply so that we can sell high-margin iPods.”Q. Many people don’t think that General Motors is an innovator, but hasn’t it innovated with its OnStar service?A. OnStar is a great example of the notion that you have to force yourself to come up with three business design alternatives to take a new technology to market. The first iteration of their business design was to sell OnStar through dealers as an accessory. But the company challenged itself: “If we did just that, what strategic control would we have? How would we protect that position?” The second variation was to say, “Instead of having it installed at the dealership at a cost of $1,000, let’s have it preinstalled at the factory at a much lower cost, and begin building a brand.” The third iteration of the business model was to say, “To really develop the volume that we need and to create a standard in the industry, we ought to offer it through other auto manufacturers.” That was a tough decision, but they made it and it contributed to their success.Q. There are signs that Dell’s famous “direct” business model is not working as well as it would like. What’s your analysis?'"
"'06-07-30,'0','New Jersey’s pension system has been an underfunded disaster waiting to happen. The $72 billion fund is at least $18 billion short of what is needed to pay public employee pensions over the next 30 years, according to Orin Kramer, chairman of the State Investment Council.Gov. Jon Corzine, the former co-chair of Goldman Sachs, has decided that waiting for disaster is not a productive strategy. He plans to bring in new, private managers to oversee and diversify a portion of the fund’s holdings. The new managers, yet to be selected, will earn about $220 million in annual fees from the state in return for managing about $18 billion in pension fund investments.The change in strategy, while not without risks, seems like the prudent course. New Jersey’s pension fund lost a third of its value when technology stocks collapsed six years ago. Other states lost money, too, but experts noted that New Jersey stood out because its pension fund was managed by career civil servants, not by outside professionals.Public employee unions are understandably wary of the change in strategy. It is, after all, their money at stake. Then again, the unions could hardly be happy with the status quo. The state was staring at a huge long-term shortfall, and while this change may not balance the books, it at least offers the possibility of better returns and a more stable fund.'"

"'06-07-30,'0','ADMIT it. You really would like to ace every one of your courses this semester. “Grades are the currency of college,” write Jeremy S. Hyman and Lynn F. Jacobs, co-authors of “Professors’ Guide to Getting Good Grades in College,” published this month by Collins. Mr. Hyman, who has taught philosophy at the University of Arkansas, M.I.T. and Princeton, agreed to demystify the grading process.A. There’s not as much grade inflation as you think. It is less of an issue at state schools and more of a problem at top schools, where about 50 percent of grades are A’s and B’s, especially in upper-division classes. But that’s changing. Princeton, for example, now limits the number of A’s in undergraduate courses to fewer than 35 percent.Q. How is grading in college different than in high school?A. In high school, the grade mill is running all the time. In college, professors aren’t giving much thought to grades until the sixth or seventh week of the semester. Grading is clustered into a few moments — when the grader is occupied with your tests or papers. That’s the time to sweat.Q. You write that the end of the semester is critical. Can you explain why?A. The last month of the semester is when students are stressed and losing momentum. Usually a research paper or presentation is due, and the final is given. What you do in the last month could add up to 60 percent of your grade. Students should shed commitments. Triage your courses. Some are not as important as others; some you may be doing better in than others.Use course resources. When the learning is done, professors often focus students on how to get the best grade. That’s a good time to meet with him. Go to review sessions. You could save 5 to 10 hours of studying. Professors often give out sample questions for the final. If you’re a minimally rational person, you will spend three or four hours on each. They synthesize the course.Q.What about an E for effort? That always worked in high school.A.You have the students who don’t hand in good work but think that because they went to all the reviews, hired a tutor and did the extension problems, they should earn a good grade. They probably won’t.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','In the first few months, parents can expect a litany of such complaints from the “dumping monster,” as Linda Walter, chairwoman of family orientation at Seton Hall, puts it. “The student calls home and dumps all their problems on their parents,” she says. “They say, ‘This place is awful and terrible and I can’t stand the food and I can’t do anything,’ and then Mom and Dad stay up all night worrying and the kid goes out to party.” Seton Hall’s orientation for parents reviews common freshman-year problems like time management, setting limits and the October slump.Parents are especially urged to stay out of roommate issues. More than any other generation, today’s children are used to having their own room, TV, DVD player and phone. Sharing a cramped space, compromising about music, noise and study hours is not something most have experience with. “If at the first sign of conflict parents call Residential Life and say, ‘I want the other one to move out,’ students don’t learn about negotiating conflict,” says Mark Thompson, director of counseling and psychological services at Colgate.“This is the most protected generation in the history of our country,” he says. “Think about bicycle helmets, wood chips underneath the swings in the playground, and car seats. We want to keep them from experiencing pain and discomfort, but we have to be willing to let them venture out and get that symbolic skinned knee if they are going to be prepared to take on the world after they graduate.”Parent orientations can be emotional. After learning about support services for his daughter, one Colgate father asked what kind of support was available to him when he was badly missing his daughter.“One conversation we do want parents to have with their son and daughter is about alcohol and drugs, what we call the ugly side of college,” says Beverly Low, dean of first-year students at Colgate. Parents should discuss their expectations with their children, about attending classes, drinking and driving, and study time versus social time.Many colleges have online alcohol education programs with reading material for parents. One popular handout, “Parents, You’re Not Done Yet,” by the Century Council (centurycouncil.org), outlines conversation starters to help students make responsible decisions about alcohol: “What will you do if your roommate only wants to drink and party?” or “What will you do if you find a student passed out in the bathroom?”Congress, too, wants parents involved in this problem. In 1988, recognizing the rampant binge drinking on campuses, the Legislature amended the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to allow colleges to notify parents of alcohol or drug violations.WHY THE REPORT CARD NEVER COMESThough educators see grades as the great motivator, parents are not entitled to see them without the child’s consent. The federal privacy law “isn’t a parent-friendly act,” says Kent M. Weeks, a Nashville lawyer who is an expert on the law. Until the late 1960’s, colleges acted in loco parentis, enforcing dress codes, curfews and other curbs on student behavior in place of parents.But the privacy act of 1974 gave the child control of health, disciplinary and educational records on reaching 18 or entering college.Grades weren’t really an issue until colleges started communicating electronically. Before then, they were sent to the student’s home, and parents could intercept the envelope. No longer. Still, there is a way for determined parents to see how their offspring are doing. Colleges may share grades with parents who submit proof that the student is a dependent for tax purposes or if the student signs a release form. Some universities distribute forms to parents before the school year starts. But, Mr. Weeks notes, “many institutions don’t want to utilize this option.”At Columbia, a spokesman says, “the preference is that the student write a letter requesting parental access.” At the University of Minnesota, even if parents have been given access, they have to send a letter each semester to get a look at grades or financial statements. Its Web site warns that “the quickest, easiest way” to those grades is to ask your child to just print them out and give them to you.Though colleges strongly discourage it, parents can also ask their children for the password to their online records.Marianne Glauberg, who has two sons at Penn State, got the younger one’s password so she could monitor his on-campus dining and modify his meal plan accordingly. “If you have extra money in the plan at the end of the year, you lose it,” she says. She wanted to shift money out of the plan but “I couldn’t do it without the password and he wouldn’t ever look at it.” In theory, that gives her access to his e-mail, but she doesn’t go there: “Too much information.”THE TIME TO JUMP INIn a closely watched case, the parents of Elizabeth Shin sued the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2002 for $27 million, charging that the college had failed to prevent their daughter’s apparent suicide. M.I.T. did not inform them of her deteriorating psychological state. The suit was settled in April, but the terms were not disclosed.The case left unsettled the question of liability concerns of students with mental health problems. Some colleges have begun to suspend students who require intensive psychological support. But this, too, has led to a backlash. In March, a student at George Washington University sued after he was suspended for seeking treatment for depression at the university hospital, contending that his suspension violated the Americans With Disabilities Act. The case is pending.Over the last five years, colleges have become more inclined to notify parents earlier when they perceive a student to be in trouble, says Gary Pavela, director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland at College Park and author of “Questions and Answers on College Student Suicide: A Law and Policy Perspective,” published in June. But parents need not wait for that emergency to develop. If a child seems headed for danger — academic, emotional or physical — it is important to intervene.“The goal for parents is in finding the right balance,” Mr. Pavela says. “One extreme is hovering over them and micromanaging their life, and the other extreme is assuming that a student, particularly on a large campus, is going to find a mentor or guide or even counselor who is somehow going to see them as a whole person and understand the dynamics of their personality.”“There is a role for parents,” he says, “to approach a dean or resident hall director not as a nuisance but in a team approach to working with a student who may be going through a crisis.”'"
"'06-07-30,'0','STUDENTS working late hours in the Cyber Cafe, at Columbia’s student union, apparently needed iTunes and document protection along with a soda and Snickers. In the spring, the university installed a vending machine that delivers aspirin, batteries, burnable CD’s, iTunes gift cards and iPod’s at the slide of a Flex card and push of a button.“This is where they hang out all night, so we thought we would stock the machines with more convenient items,” said Larry Levitas, director of dining services last term. Students pay a little more for convenience: iPod Shuffles cost $80, compared with the usual $69.Over the last year “automatic electronics stores” have popped up at hotels, malls and airports. California State University at Hayward peddles iPod’s as well as skin care products.So far at Columbia, four iPod’s have been bought and four have been stolen.“Isn’t the first thing they teach in vending-machine school supposed to be locking the door?” Mr. Levitas asked.'"
"'06-07-30,'0','When it comes to the National Football League, you will rarely see the words important and preseason in the same sentence. Although the N.F.L. tries to promote the significance of the preseason, only the most casual fan believes that those games have any impact on the regular season.Last year, the Indianapolis Colts were 0-5 in the preseason, then won the first 13 games of the regular season. Kansas City, which went 0-4, just missed the playoffs with a 10-6 record. Of the nine teams that finished the preseason 3-1 or 4-1, seven did not reach the playoffs, including four that were coming off playoff seasons (St. Louis, Minnesota, Atlanta and the Jets).Despite those results, the preseason can be an indicator of how well teams will do in the regular season, if the sample is limited.The key, according to research by the Web site TwoMinuteWarning.com, is to look only at average teams — that is, those with seven to nine victories in the previous season. From the 1996 to the 2004 seasons, 96 teams fit that description. The next year, 29 of these teams won fewer than two preseason games, and they went on to average 6.7 wins in the regular season. The 23 of those teams that won three preseason games followed with an average of 8.8 wins in the regular season, and the 11 that went undefeated in the preseason finished with an average of 9.9 wins.When TwoMinuteWarning.com published this research before the 2003 season, it drew attention to two teams that went undefeated in the preseason after average won-lost records in 2002. Those teams, New England and Carolina, went on to meet in the Super Bowl.'"

The pipeline resumed pumping oil this afternoon, as prices for benchmark Brent oil rose to $74 per barrel.A relatively small amount of oil — 39 tons, or roughly 11,000 gallons — leaked from the pipe onto flat ground far from any rivers or streams, according to Ludmila K. Komogortseva, chairwoman of the ecology committee of the regional parliament. In a telephone interview, she said 32 tons had been recovered by today.A spokesman for the Ministry of Natural resources, Oleg L.

For the most part, he had done just that, competing only in the occasional contest.Last year, though, he returned to Huntington Beach and the nation’s longest-running surf contest, reaching the final of the Open. With mere seconds left, his title was snatched away by the three-time world champion Andy Irons. Machado is known for his grace and unflinching coolness under pressure, so it was hard to tell if his ambition this year was to avenge that loss, or to simply “go for a surf.”Heat after heat, round after round, riding a peak alone at the far end of the contest area, Machado advanced.'"
"'06-07-31,'0','On a recent evening, a group of men, all but one of them of Yemeni descent, stood on a sidewalk in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, and discussed benefits ascribed to the drug.“Some people chew seven days a week,” said one man, explaining that frequent chewers were not addicts, but usually shopkeepers or other merchants who work 12-hour days.Khat, which is also associated with sexual stamina, is meant to power them through these long shifts. Students also find that it enhances concentration, the men said.Last week, 30 people who the authorities said were members of the country’s largest khat distribution network were arrested in New York and elsewhere.The plant, though it is legal in some European countries, is classified as a controlled substance in the United States, in the same class of drugs as heroin and marijuana.The suspects were charged not only with smuggling, distributing and selling khat but also with laundering money, through the use of informal money remitters.That charge has raised fears that khat-chewing, a practice that in parts of East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula is considered as normal as sipping a cup of coffee, will be associated with terrorism.“It used to be just a social issue,” said one Yemeni man, who refused to give his name. “Now, it’s a political issue,” he said.A spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, John P. Gilbride, said the suspects had not been connected to terrorism or violence, though the investigation continued.And he said the authorities had focused on khat primarily because it was considered harmful and had not yet found a mainstream audience. While primarily a euphoric stimulant, khat can have side effects, including hypertension, hallucinations, impotence and bouts of violence, prosecutors said.Khat has been connected to at least one murder, in 2004, when a man shot and killed a woman while trying to steal khat from a house in Minneapolis, Mr. Gilbride said.The plant, which is chewed by people in a swath of land stretching from Tanzania to Yemen, became more widely known to Americans during the military intervention in Somalia in 1992.The debate over khat in Africa and Yemen, broadly speaking, focuses on economic and social impacts, including claims that it drains resources that would be better used to grow other crops.Seizures of khat coming to the United States peaked in 2003, when federal authorities confiscated about 90,000 pounds in New York alone. Since then, Mr. Gilbride said, the amount of khat seized has declined slightly.Arrests and seizures of khat in several Cobble Hill cafes six years ago put an end to the leaves’ ready accessibility, said the men on the sidewalk.Efforts to eradicate the drug have also made it more expensive. In New York, the price of khat has perhaps doubled in the last five years, buyers and sellers said.“I work for a day, and then I can buy it,” said Adeel Abdul, 24, an employee of a deli in Harlem. Even then, he said, “it’s expensive, and it’s not good.”A bunch of fresh leaves — usually 10 to 12 stems — costs about $50. But fresh leaves are the hardest to come by. Far more common are the dried leaves, some of which are imported not from East Africa or Yemen but from Guyana, in South America. The dried variety, considered inferior, is dampened with water or tea and then chewed.A writer, Kevin Rushby, described the effects of khat in his book “Eating the Flowers of Paradise” (Palgrave Macmillan, 1999). “No rush,” he wrote, “just a silky transition, scarcely noticed, and then the room casts loose its moorings.”But Hamud Alsilwi, the principal of an Islamic school in Yonkers, said that it was an ugly habit — “like animals chewing grass” — and an unwelcome diversion. “It’s illegal,” he said, “and they waste time, and they waste money.”'"
"'06-07-31,'0','Part of that observation, which is not wholly unexpected, can probably be explained by simple human nature. Before turning to politics, Mr. Corzine worked at Goldman Sachs for nearly a quarter-century, working his way up to co-chairman, and his managerial compass could almost certainly be expected to point toward lessons learned there.But perhaps some of Mr. Corzine’s comfort with business concepts can also be traced to a mistrust of the largely ineffective techniques that have been used by politicians in Trenton for years to deal with issues like high property taxes.Mr. Corzine succinctly referred to his disdain for those techniques near the start of his speech when he spoke of the importance of changing the way the state subsidizes municipalities and schools.“Our business model for delivering and paying for government and school services is broken,” he said, striking a decidedly corporate tone at the beginning of his 30-minute address on Friday. “If we were a business, we’d be bankrupt.”From there, he described an ambitious program in which he proposed that the state use $250 million to create incentives for municipalities to consolidate services, study whether to sell or lease state assets like the New Jersey Turnpike and impose a 4 percent limit on year-to-year increases in property tax bills that are, on average, the highest in the nation.Those changes, especially the proposal to encourage more efficiency through consolidation, are the kind of practices generally favored by business leaders.“I think the government adopting methods and methodologies that have been used by corporate America makes some good sense,” said Assemblyman Gary S. Schaer, a Democrat of Bergen County.Mr. Schaer, who is an investment consultant and a vice president at Ryan Beck & Co., said that he heard distinct echoes of Mr. Corzine’s business background in the address.“I hear Wall Street throughout,” he said. “And I’ve got to tell you: I work on Wall Street, and I think it’s refreshing. I think it’s something we need to hear more of.”Others noted that Mr. Corzine painted a compelling portrait of how fixing property taxes could lead to improvements in other areas of the state’s fiscal policy.“There’s a businesslike characteristic that is very thoughtful, understated and logical and rational in drawing a picture that everything is connected to everything,” said former Gov. Jim Florio. “And, if you sign on to the proposition that our budgetary problems are severe and they won’t get easier, then you have to appreciate the fact the governor is correct that property tax is related to that.”Other observers were struck by the way Mr. Corzine incorporated many ideas that have been put forth by Republicans in Trenton like overhauling the pension system, changing the formula used to calculate school financing and scaling back benefits for state employees.“I joked to myself that this is Jon Corzine going to China,” said David P. Rebovich, managing director of the Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. “A guy who, at the federal level, has always been called a very liberal Democrat that here is really speaking the language of public administration and applying corporate management principles to the public sector to free up dollars.”Mr. Rebovich said Mr. Corzine also made it clear that like any business leader, he would hold lawmakers accountable should they not make what he feels is sufficient progress in fixing the tax problem.Mr. Corzine warned that if the Legislature did not move forward on substantial improvements to the tax system, he would ask that a measure calling for a constitutional convention be placed on a ballot in November 2007.Left unspoken, however, was the suggestion that if lawmakers failed to address the tax dilemma, the makeup of the Legislature would almost certainly undergo a drastic change in that same election.Mr. Rebovich said he was struck by a line in Mr. Corzine’s speech that prefaced the constitutional convention scenario with the words, “If we fail ...”“If we fail — what does that say?” Mr. Rebovich asked. “It says: ‘Guys, if we don’t follow through on what I’ve laid out here today, that’s going to be a failure. I’m going to regard it as that, I’m going to call it that and the public will call it that.’ So he really has put the onus on the Legislature to get moving.”'"
"'06-07-31,'0','The United States has the worst record in the free world when it comes to stripping convicted felons of the right to vote. In contrast, most European countries hold that right so dear that they bring ballot boxes into prisons.This point was underscored last week in a scalding report from the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which held hearings earlier this month to determine how well the United States was complying with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which this country ratified in 1992. The hearings heard testimony about secret detentions, kidnappings and accusations of torture.But they also dealt with how the United States treats its prison inmates, particularly the disenfranchisement laws that bar more than five million convicted felons from the polls. The American representative weakly defended the practice’s legality, but dodged explaining its rationale, saying the rules come from the states, not the federal government.In a common-sense report made public Friday, the committee said that blanket disenfranchisement was inconsistent with the covenant and served no rehabilitative purpose. Noting that disenfranchisement disproportionately affects minorities, the report urged the United States to restore voting rights to citizens who have served their sentences or who are released on parole. The report is not legally binding. But it reminds us how poorly we treat ex-offenders compared with democracies abroad.'"
"'06-07-31,'0','Roger Goodell, the N.F.L.’s chief operating officer and the candidate considered the favorite to succeed Paul Tagliabue as commissioner, is one of five finalists for the job, and the only one who works for the league. The new commissioner will be selected at a three-day meeting of the 32 team owners beginning next Monday in Chicago.In addition to Goodell, the finalists are:¶Gregg H. Levy, 53, a partner at Covington & Burling and the league’s chief outside lawyer, the same job Tagliabue held before becoming commissioner in 1989. Levy was the lead lawyer when the N.F.L. won, on appeal, the Maurice Clarett eligibility case in 2004.¶Frederick R. Nance, 52, a managing partner of the Cleveland office of Squire Sanders & Dempsey who, while representing the city of Cleveland, negotiated with the N.F.L. for the return of the Browns in 1999. He was also the project counsel on the development of Cleveland Browns Stadium. Nance, who is African-American, is the only minority candidate.¶Robert L. Reynolds, 52, the vice chairman and chief operating officer of Fidelity Investments, the mutual funds company. He was a college football referee for 15 years.¶Mayo A. Shattuck III, 51, the chairman, president and chief executive of Constellation Energy, which is based in Baltimore and is ranked No. 125 on the Fortune 500 list. Shattuck was a finalist to help run the Salt Lake Olympics in 2002, and his family gained an additional measure of fame when his wife, Molly, at age 38, became a cheerleader for the Baltimore Ravens.'"
"'06-07-31,'0','This was no small feat. Congo is a country the size of Western Europe with impressive mineral riches and 60 million people but only 300 miles of paved roads. Much of it is impenetrable jungle that can be reached only by helicopter or boat.Because of the number of candidates — approximately 9,700 running for 500 national assembly seats and 33 for president — the ballots were huge. There were 50,000 polling places. It was no wonder that the election cost $458 million and was the biggest and most complicated the United Nations has ever run.Because of all the logistical challenges, the official election results are not expected for weeks. If no presidential candidate gets a majority, a runoff is scheduled for this fall.The leading presidential contender is the incumbent, Joseph Kabila, a relaxed 35-year-old who inherited the office from his father and is now trying to legitimize his rule.He calls himself an “artisan of peace” and many people said Sunday that they voted for him because they said they thought he was the only person powerful enough to unite Congo and prevent another relapse into war.But several of the largest opposition parties boycotted the vote. They contended that the election was rigged from the beginning by top politicians, including Mr. Kabila, saying that these politicians used their militias to intimidate voters and scooped from state coffers to finance their campaigns.“This is a masquerade,” said Norbert Luyeye, an opposition leader. “Criminals are running our country. They know if there’s a free election, they will be pushed aside and prosecuted.”In Congo, these complaints are nothing new. This vast territory has been plundered shamelessly since King Leopold of Belgium colonized it in the late 19th century to extract as much rubber and ivory as possible. The Belgian overseers who followed were not much better, notorious for their use of the chicotte, a hippo-hide whip they cracked over Congolese backs.That all ended in 1960, when Belgium abruptly granted Congo independence and Patrice Lumumba was elected prime minister. He was assassinated a few months later, paving the way for Mobutu Sese Seko, an athletic young army colonel who soon metastasized into the caricature of a dictator, building palaces and guzzling pink Champagne while his people starved. Once the cold war ended and Western support dried up, his power faded.Rwanda and Uganda teamed up with a rebel movement lead by a former Marxist, Laurent Kabila, and deposed Mr. Mobutu in 1997.Mr. Kabila became as autocratic as Mr. Mobutu, and eventually Rwanda and Uganda turned on him. Mr. Kabila called for help from Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and soon Congo was full of foreign armies fighting over its spoils. When Mr. Kabila was assassinated in 2001, his eldest son, Joseph, took over, again a leadership change without any input from the people.Joseph Kabila made peace with his enemies, agreed to hold elections and welcomed warlords into the interim government. Several are running for president, including Azarias Ruberwa, who is popular in eastern Congo, and Jean-Pierre Bemba, who has been accused of serious human rights abuses and even cannibalism.Many people on Kinshasa’s garbage-strewn streets cynically refer to the whole group as “the belligerents.”On Sunday morning, Vemba Kumbu, a watchman, ran his thumb down the ballot and shook his head.“I’d like to vote,” he said. “But I don’t really see anyone I want to vote for.”In Bunia, in the east, Besisa Mbaguna walked two and a half hours barefoot to cast his vote for Mr. Kabila.“It was not a difficult walk,” he said. “It was for a good reason.”Western diplomats said peace in the Congo was especially important because Congo’s rebellions had destabilized the entire region.“In Central Africa, there is no center of political gravity and there won’t be one until this country can come right,” said William Lacy Swing, the top United Nations official in Congo.The biggest worry is how the potential losers could react, especially Mr. Bemba, whose followers have already clashed with the police.Some people within Mr. Kabila’s government admitted that it might be better if Mr. Kabila did not win outright and instead would win in a runoff because that would avoid giving the impression that the election was fixed, which could spell trouble.Mr. Mabuisi, the 80-year-old voter who has lived through it all, said he voted for Mr. Bemba because he was worried what would happen if Mr. Bemba lost.“This is democracy,” he said, as he slipped his precious voting card in his pocket and walked away.'"
"'06-07-31,'0','Both Nascar racing and feature films are notorious for their high levels of product placement. Now, a new film about a Nascar driver has achieved its own prominent placement in both the advertising and the editorial pages of The Sporting News magazine.Subscriber copies of the Aug. 4 issue of The Sporting News are covered by a fake wraparound cover promoting “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” from Columbia Pictures, which stars Will Ferrell as a champion Nascar driver.What is perhaps more confusing is that the real cover, found underneath the wraparound, also has a small picture of Mr. Ferrell, with the line “Ricky Bobby tells all!” Four pages of editorial content mention the movie, including a two-page article by the associate editor, Matt Crossman, about his experience of being an extra in the film, and a “week ahead in sports” item that notes the film’s Aug. 4 debut.The most unusual crossover, however, comes next to the magazine’s masthead. The “My Turn” column, which often features celebrities or other pop-culture figures, is attributed to the character of Ricky Bobby, and appears with two photographs of Mr. Ferrell in character.The column, which never refers to the film’s full title, is presented as straight editorial content, without any disclaimers or additional bylines.'"
"'06-07-31,'0','It was quite a night on Saturday at the New York State Theater, when the San Francisco Ballet presented the final program in its Lincoln Center Festival engagement. About three different ballets were tucked into Christopher Wheeldon’s “Quaternary,” set to music by Bach, John Cage, Arvo Pärt and Steven Mackey. William Forsythe weighed in with two in “Artifact Suite,” set to Bach and Eva Crossman-Hecht. Helgi Tomasson, who has directed the San Francisco company since 1985, was his dependably classical, well-mannered self in “7 for Eight,” set to the music of Bach alone. Each piece unfolded in space defined to varying extents more by scenic elements than by the dancing within it.Mr. Tomasson’s ballet opened the nearly three-hour program, serving as a fine introduction to his performers’ pristine classicism. A suite that included a solo, three duets, a trio and group dances, “7 for Eight” began with a duet for Yuan Yuan Tan and Yuri Possokhov that was notable for what it said about one facet of the company’s style. Ms. Tan is an obedient-looking dancer, but a great pleasure of “7 for Eight” was the luxurious look of each extension of her long limbs, a tendency in the dancing of the other company ballerinas as well.The suite offered a palette of qualities, from decorous to a look of skewed flight. A duet in the fourth movement stood out for the way the dancers seemed to move on billowing air. Joan Boada stood out for his supple, simple virtuosity in the fifth-movement solo, in a lead cast completed by Tina LeBlanc, Gonzalo Garcia, Elizabeth Miner and Rachel Viselli.Each dance in “Quaternary,” which means a set of four, is named for a season but does not discernibly refer to it. Created last year, the ballet looks as if it needs to settle into itself a little more, or at least be seen more than once by hapless reviewers. At its best, in the opening “Winter” and “Spring” dances, “Quaternary” is yet more evidence of Mr. Wheeldon’s profligate way with small, imaginative surprises in the ways he sends his dancers out through space and what he gives them to do there. Bobbing to the surface in “Summer” is a mystifying duet for Muriel Maffre and Mr. Possokhov that looks like “Daughter of ‘After the Rain.’ ” The eye and the brain have begun to shut down by the time the full cast surges out for the closing “Autumn” section, which looks a little like outtakes from the first two sections.The irreverent “Artifact Suite” is described in a press-kit crib sheet for reviewers as representing Mr. Forsythe’s continuous, groundbreaking revising of his work. Well, what choreographer doesn’t? What happens onstage is mostly good, dramatic fun, with ranks of dancers shifting in brisk formation, conducted by an arm-waving Elana Altman. Two sneakily vibrant duets, danced by Ms. Maffre with Pierre-François Vilanoba and Lorena Feijoo with Pascal Molat, emerged from the orderly charge. The thudding falls of a front curtain, greeted each time with applause, seemed to be Mr. Forsythe’s reworking of a blackout. Michael McGraw was the solo pianist.'"

"'06-07-31,'0','In the first few months, parents can expect a litany of such complaints from the “dumping monster,” as Linda Walter, chairwoman of family orientation at Seton Hall, puts it. “The student calls home and dumps all their problems on their parents,” she says. “They say, ‘This place is awful and terrible and I can’t stand the food and I can’t do anything,’ and then Mom and Dad stay up all night worrying and the kid goes out to party.” Seton Hall’s orientation for parents reviews common freshman-year problems like time management, setting limits and the October slump.Parents are especially urged to stay out of roommate issues. More than any other generation, today’s children are used to having their own room, TV, DVD player and phone. Sharing a cramped space, compromising about music, noise and study hours is not something most have experience with. “If at the first sign of conflict parents call Residential Life and say, ‘I want the other one to move out,’ students don’t learn about negotiating conflict,” says Mark Thompson, director of counseling and psychological services at Colgate.“This is the most protected generation in the history of our country,” he says. “Think about bicycle helmets, wood chips underneath the swings in the playground, and car seats. We want to keep them from experiencing pain and discomfort, but we have to be willing to let them venture out and get that symbolic skinned knee if they are going to be prepared to take on the world after they graduate.”Parent orientations can be emotional. After learning about support services for his daughter, one Colgate father asked what kind of support was available to him when he was badly missing his daughter.“One conversation we do want parents to have with their son and daughter is about alcohol and drugs, what we call the ugly side of college,” says Beverly Low, dean of first-year students at Colgate. Parents should discuss their expectations with their children, about attending classes, drinking and driving, and study time versus social time.Many colleges have online alcohol education programs with reading material for parents. One popular handout, “Parents, You’re Not Done Yet,” by the Century Council (centurycouncil.org), outlines conversation starters to help students make responsible decisions about alcohol: “What will you do if your roommate only wants to drink and party?” or “What will you do if you find a student passed out in the bathroom?”Congress, too, wants parents involved in this problem. In 1988, recognizing the rampant binge drinking on campuses, the Legislature amended the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act to allow colleges to notify parents of alcohol or drug violations.WHY THE REPORT CARD NEVER COMESThough educators see grades as the great motivator, parents are not entitled to see them without the child’s consent. The federal privacy law “isn’t a parent-friendly act,” says Kent M. Weeks, a Nashville lawyer who is an expert on the law. Until the late 1960’s, colleges acted in loco parentis, enforcing dress codes, curfews and other curbs on student behavior in place of parents.But the privacy act of 1974 gave the child control of health, disciplinary and educational records on reaching 18 or entering college.Grades weren’t really an issue until colleges started communicating electronically. Before then, they were sent to the student’s home, and parents could intercept the envelope. No longer. Still, there is a way for determined parents to see how their offspring are doing. Colleges may share grades with parents who submit proof that the student is a dependent for tax purposes or if the student signs a release form. Some universities distribute forms to parents before the school year starts. But, Mr. Weeks notes, “many institutions don’t want to utilize this option.”At Columbia, a spokesman says, “the preference is that the student write a letter requesting parental access.” At the University of Minnesota, even if parents have been given access, they have to send a letter each semester to get a look at grades or financial statements. Its Web site warns that “the quickest, easiest way” to those grades is to ask your child to just print them out and give them to you.Though colleges strongly discourage it, parents can also ask their children for the password to their online records.Marianne Glauberg, who has two sons at Penn State, got the younger one’s password so she could monitor his on-campus dining and modify his meal plan accordingly. “If you have extra money in the plan at the end of the year, you lose it,” she says. She wanted to shift money out of the plan but “I couldn’t do it without the password and he wouldn’t ever look at it.” In theory, that gives her access to his e-mail, but she doesn’t go there: “Too much information.”THE TIME TO JUMP INIn a closely watched case, the parents of Elizabeth Shin sued the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2002 for $27 million, charging that the college had failed to prevent their daughter’s apparent suicide. M.I.T. did not inform them of her deteriorating psychological state. The suit was settled in April, but the terms were not disclosed.The case left unsettled the question of liability concerns of students with mental health problems. Some colleges have begun to suspend students who require intensive psychological support. But this, too, has led to a backlash. In March, a student at George Washington University sued after he was suspended for seeking treatment for depression at the university hospital, contending that his suspension violated the Americans With Disabilities Act. The case is pending.Over the last five years, colleges have become more inclined to notify parents earlier when they perceive a student to be in trouble, says Gary Pavela, director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland at College Park and author of “Questions and Answers on College Student Suicide: A Law and Policy Perspective,” published in June. But parents need not wait for that emergency to develop. If a child seems headed for danger — academic, emotional or physical — it is important to intervene.“The goal for parents is in finding the right balance,” Mr. Pavela says. “One extreme is hovering over them and micromanaging their life, and the other extreme is assuming that a student, particularly on a large campus, is going to find a mentor or guide or even counselor who is somehow going to see them as a whole person and understand the dynamics of their personality.”“There is a role for parents,” he says, “to approach a dean or resident hall director not as a nuisance but in a team approach to working with a student who may be going through a crisis.”Published in the Education Life section on July 30, 2006.'"
