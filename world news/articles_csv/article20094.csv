"'09-04-01,'1','Inspired to make a documentary about yoga, the filmmaker Kate Churchill came up with a shrewd idea. Rather than focus on her own experience with the discipline, which she has practiced to great physical and spiritual benefit for many years, she enlisted a yoga novice to devote himself to it and report on its effects.So she recruited Nick Rosen, 29, a physically fit, intellectually skeptical journalist from New York, to plunge into the world of yoga in search of a style that suited him. Approaching the subject through Mr. Rosen is a doubly smart strategy: it allows the uninitiated viewer to explore yoga through a surrogate, and it marginalizes Ms. Churchill’s blatant agenda and rather grating personality.Yoga appeals to Mr. Rosen as a superb workout more than as a route to enlightenment, and he tours the various studios and methods of the international yoga scene (from New York to Los Angeles and Hawaii before an extended, and fascinating, trip to India) with both an open mind and a dubious eye for its more metaphysical trappings. This clearly frustrates a filmmaker eager to acclaim the “transformative” aspects of the discipline.As the title indicates, “Enlighten Up!” explores its subject with a light touch and welcome sense of humor. That it ends with a lack of resolution about yoga’s ultimate goal suggests that Mr. Rosen wasn’t the only one to gain some self-knowledge along the way.Produced and directed by Kate Churchill; written by Ms. Churchill and Jonathon Hexner, based on a story by Ms. Churchill, Mr. Hexner and Khari Streeter; director of photography, Mr. Hexner; edited by Mr. Streeter and Jonathan Sahula; music by Krishna Venkatesh; animation by Mr. Hexner; released by Balcony Releasing.

"'09-04-01,'1','I don’t expect much from the meeting this week, but if I had my wish, the leaders of the world’s 20 top economies would commit themselves to a new standard of accounting — call it “Market to Mother Nature” accounting. Why? Because it’s now obvious that the reason we’re experiencing a simultaneous meltdown in the financial system and the climate system is because we have been mispricing risk in both arenas — producing a huge excess of both toxic assets and toxic air that now threatens the stability of the whole planet.Just as sold derivatives at prices that did not reflect the real costs and the real risks of massive defaults (for which we the taxpayers ended up paying the difference), oil companies, companies and electric utilities today are selling energy products at prices that do not reflect the real costs to the environment and real risks of disruptive (so future taxpayers will end up paying the difference).Whenever products are mispriced and do not reflect the real costs and risks associated with their usage, people go to excess. And that is exactly what happened in the financial marketplace and in the energy/environmental marketplace during the bubble.Our biggest financial-services companies, some of which came to be seen as too big to fail, engaged in complex financial trading schemes that did not adequately price in the costs and risks of a market reversal. A.I.G., for instance, was selling insurance for all kinds of financial instruments and did not have anywhere near adequate reserves to cover claims if things went badly wrong, as they did. And our biggest energy companies, utilities and auto companies became dependent on cheap hydrocarbons that spin off climate-changing greenhouse gases, and we clearly have not forced them, through a carbon , to price in the true risks and costs to society from these climate-changing fuels.“When the balance sheet of a company does not capture the true costs and risks of its business activities,” and when that company is too big to fail, “you end up with them privatizing their gains and socializing their losses,” Nandan Nilekani, the co-chairman of the Indian technology company Infosys, remarked to me. That is, everyone gets to rack up their private profits today and pay them out in current bonuses and dividends. But any catastrophic losses — if the company is too big to fail — “get socialized and paid off by taxpayers.”This is why we need new banking regulation that reins in the leverage and speculative trading that big and insurance companies can undertake so they never again become simultaneously too reckless to regulate but too big fail and taxpayers are forced to pay off the toxic assets they accumulate. And this is also why we need a tax on carbon — so we and our power utilities don’t become permanently addicted to cheap coal that makes for lower electricity prices today but spits out toxic greenhouse gases that have to be paid for by future generations tomorrow.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','Despite all of the talk of shared sacrifice and of not filling in long-term gaps with short-term federal stimulus dollars, Gov. David Paterson of New York and other Democratic leaders have produced a budget that is now up to $131 billion — a whopping $10 billion more than last year’s. This budget also is as crammed full of favors as anything written in Albany for many years.Republicans who are now in the minority and had almost no voice in the secretive budget negotiations are calling it simply: “The Big Ugly.”Democrats, who control all three branches of government, appear to have the votes to get their way. So the only hope here is that the few reforms tucked into this document — which, when stacked, is more than a foot high — will actually take root and save money, as promised, in the years ahead. It is a fragile hope, of course. Future reforms in Albany too often remain forever in the future, like a fiscal mirage that is always two or three years away.Democratic leaders did manage to do some good. The draconian and counterproductive Rockefeller drug laws are being reformed to give judges more leeway in sentencing drug users. Empty or underused upstate prisons are going to be closed, and the scandalously mismanaged Empire Zone program — which cost the state $600 million last year and was meant to develop businesses in needy areas — is being revamped (again mostly in the future). The budget also imposes a 5-cent redemption fee on water bottles — good for revenue and the environment — and requires bottlers to pay the state for all bottles that are not redeemed.New York has long needed a fairer tax system. Suburban property taxes are astronomical, and the income-tax rate is the same percentage for anyone making more than $40,000 a year. Some gradual increase in the income tax rate is necessary, and these new tax increases for households earning $300,000 a year and up will help deal with a $17 billion deficit.We would feel a lot better if the Democratic lawmakers also showed a willingness to control their spending. They haven’t. A large part of the deficit will be filled with $6.2 billion in federal stimulus money — the very definition of a short-term fix for a long-term problem.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','But the attacks on the nomination of Ms. Johnsen, who is married to Judge Hamilton’s brother, have been more severe. Ms. Johnsen, a law professor at Indiana University, was an unsparing critic of memorandums, written by lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel in the Bush administration, that said the president could largely ignore international treaties and Congress in fighting terrorists and that critics have portrayed as allowing torture in interrogation.The broad reading of presidential authority was “outlandish,” and the constitutional arguments were “shockingly flawed,” Ms. Johnsen has written. While her language was harsh, the memos have largely been withdrawn, and among lawyers a consensus agreeing with her views has emerged.Nonetheless, Republicans have denounced her comments. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the committee’s minority, said Ms. Johnsen lacked the “requisite seriousness” to head the Office of Legal Counsel.A committee Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, said he was astonished by the attacks. After the “long, dark days of degradation” of the office, Mr. Whitehouse said, it is hypocritical of Republicans who were then silent to complain now about partisanship.“Now suddenly they come forward with concerns,” he said. “Where were you when those incompetent, ideological opinions were being issued?”Ms. Johnsen was also criticized, initially by conservative commentators, for a footnote in a brief she filed 20 years ago when she was a lawyer with the National Abortion Rights Action League. The footnote said forcing a woman to bear a child when she had no desire to do so was “disturbingly suggestive of involuntary servitude.”Conservative blogs asserted that she had equated pregnancy with slavery, and the argument was taken up by Republicans at her confirmation hearing on Feb. 25. Mr. Specter suggested that she had said abortion rights should be protected by the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery. Ms. Johnsen replied that the footnote had made a suggestion of an analogy and that it had mentioned the amendment, but that she had never “believed the 13th Amendment had any role” in the abortion issue.The migration of accusations from political blogs to Senate hearing rooms is a frequent pattern in the nomination wars. Advocacy groups on both sides like to have their views amplified and echoed in the hope that they are taken up by sympathetic senators.Republicans senators and aides, granted anonymity to discuss their strategy, said they might consider a filibuster in an effort to block Ms. Johnsen’s confirmation. They will first gauge whether they can attract some support from conservative Democrats, they said, in order to help defeat any motion that would cut off debate.Democrats, who currently control 56 seats, in addition to two held by independents who generally caucus with them, would need 60 votes to end debate.The combat over the current nominations is widely viewed as spring training for confirmation battles to come. Many see a likelihood of a resignation from the Supreme Court at the end of its term, which would give Mr. Obama his first opportunity to fill a vacancy there.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','The government may seek to ease General Motors into what it calls a “controlled” bankruptcy, somewhere between a prepackaged bankruptcy and court chaos, by persuading at least some creditors to agree to a plan that would cleave the company into two pieces, according to people briefed on the matter.Instead of signing on every creditor as is typically required in prepackaged deals, administration officials are using as leverage the promise of taxpayer financing. Many regard the government as the only lender willing to step up with money  in bankruptcy or out.“They’re going to have tremendous power,” said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “They can call off the money and the whole thing fails.”G.M.’s new chief, Fritz Henderson, also said that the pressure from the government pushed the automaker closer to bankruptcy.“By no later than June 1, if we’re not able to accomplish this outside bankruptcy, we’ll be in bankruptcy,” he said at a news conference in Detroit on Tuesday. “It’s pretty clear. The government was unequivocal.”The effort is a new role for the government, which has not pushed companies into bankruptcy in the past as much as it has stepped in when all else fails.“As lawyers would say, it’s sui generis, at least in my experience,” said Joel B. Zweibel, the retired co-head of restructuring at the law firm O’Melveny & Myers. He worked on big bankruptcy cases like those of Eastern Airlines and LTV Steel.The administration appears to be drawing in part from a playbook used with troubled banks, with the goal of creating a new, healthier G.M., but leaving behind its liabilities and less valuable assets, perhaps for liquidation. More often referred as the “good bank-bad bank” model, the approach can infuriate those with claims against the bad bank.Under a plan being worked out by the administration, G.M. would file for prearranged bankruptcy, according to these people. It would then use a sale authorized under Section 363 of the bankruptcy code to quickly sell off the desirable assets to a new company financed by the government. These good pieces might include Cadillac and Chevrolet, as well as assets the company needs to run the business.Less desirable assets, brands like Hummer and underperforming factories, would be left in the old company. Proceeds from the sales, including stock in the new company, would be given to the old G.M., helping to settle claims.The plans are still being discussed, and the details are subject to change, people familiar with the talks said.G.M. joins a long list of companies in industries like airlines, railroads and steelmakers that have faced the prospect of being remade in bankruptcy. Typically, a troubled company usually seeks to line up creditors, employees and other stakeholders for a plan of reorganization before a bankruptcy filing. Failure to achieve this agreement can create a prolonged and messy court process as the company battles its creditors while its business and financing rapidly deteriorate.Elements of the government’s plans for G.M. are in some ways similar to the demise of Lehman Brothers last fall. A day after filing for Chapter 11 protection, the securities firm agreed to sell the bulk of its North American business to Barclays Capital, the British bank. The sale was completed in a little more than three days.The administration hopes to win support from some of G.M.’s creditors, notably the United Automobile Workers, which would be forced to pare its health care benefits and whose pension obligations would probably remain in the old company. But the bankruptcy code allows a judge to approve a sale even over creditor objections in an emergency under Section 363, legal experts say. Such was the case with the Lehman sale.While the automaker would not be the biggest company ever to file for bankruptcy protection  Lehman holds that dubious distinction  it is woven into a complex international web of suppliers and subsidiaries. One goal of any reorganization plan would be to minimize disruption to other businesses.“This would rank as one of the most, if not the most complex bankruptcy in history,” said Stephen F. Cooper, founder and former chairman of Zolfo Cooper, a turnaround firm. Mr. Cooper, who ran Enron during its bankruptcy, added that politics would influence any plan.There will be pressure to keep plants open, to keep employment in communities high, he said, “because typically G.M. or Ford or Chrysler are very substantial contributors to the local tax receipt flow.”History offers almost no precedent for a G.M. bankruptcy filing. Companies like Continental Airlines and the Delphi Corporation, the auto parts maker, have used the courts to transform their businesses and reduce their costs. But none matched the size and interconnectedness of G.M.Delphi used a bankruptcy judge’s threat to void union contracts to wring concessions out of its workers, said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.“That’s a very potent threat, to withdraw from the collective agreement in bankruptcy,” Mr. Chaison said.Several airlines also used bankruptcy proceedings to force unions to modify agreements. Continental Airlines took that step before its rivals, to its advantage, Mr. LoPucki said. But much of Continental’s work took place before changes in bankruptcy laws made it more difficult to void worker contracts.There are critical differences between the airlines and G.M. There was no question of the demand for air travel in the United States, while critics of American automakers have questioned whether there is demand for their products and whether reducing costs will produce viable businesses.The government’s plan to dictate terms as the provider of G.M.’s bankruptcy financing  known as a debtor-in-possession loan  is not without risk.“You’re introducing politics into the process,” said David A. Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.The administration may still encounter surprises in its efforts, Mr. Skeel said.“The hope is that if we call it a controlled bankruptcy, that’s what it will be,” he said.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','UNITED NATIONS — The Obama administration will seek a seat on the United Nations’ Human Rights Council, announcing Tuesday that it believed working from within was the most effective means of altering the council’s habit of ignoring poor human rights records of member states.The policy reverses the stance of the Bush administration, which viewed the Geneva-based council as irredeemable for its almost exclusive focus on human rights violations by Israel.Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador to the United Nations, said the Obama administration believed that by working within the council, the United States could influence members of regional groups.In recent years, regional blocs in the 47-member organization, particularly Asia and Africa, which together have 26 votes, acted en masse to minimize scrutiny of countries like Zimbabwe.“We do not see any inherent benefit as demonstrated by recent history in being outside the tent and simply being critical without having significant influence,” Ms. Rice said in a conference call with reporters after the State Department made the announcement.'"

"'09-04-01,'1','LAS VEGAS — The Motion Picture Association of America released a sharply stripped-down annual snapshot of the film industry on Tuesday, abandoning its decades-long practice of compiling information about movie production and marketing costs.The organization’s “state of the business” report outlined routine box office and attendance statistics, but omitted the most heavily scrutinized section of the annual briefing: costs and whether they have gone up or down. The reports have typically been more than 20 pages long and contained detailed (and rare) statistics on spending by the major studios and their specialty divisions; the new report is eight pages.Dan Glickman, the organization’s chief executive, said he decided to scrap the financial component because of the growing complexity of gathering the data. Rapid changes in financing and distribution have made the old way of compiling the information misleading, he said.“There is nothing conspiratorial about this,” Mr. Glickman said in an interview. “We don’t have the numbers. We didn’t do them. I’ve been concerned about the validity of those numbers for years.”The organization said it was looking for a more meaningful way to report financial data.Studios are notorious for keeping details of their finances private — or generously rounding the numbers up or down — and the association’s accounting has long been considered squishy given the difficulty in gathering such granular information across the globe. But moviedom typically pays close attention to the report because there are so few official sources of information about the industry.To the exasperation of some studio executives, last year’s report depicted a sharp rise in spending by specialty labels, which make and distribute films intended for the annual awards races and others aimed at genres like horror. Such divisions’ investment in production rose 6 percent, to an average $42.9 million a movie, in 2007, while marketing costs jumped 44 percent, to $25.7 million.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','Facebook, the fast-growing online social network, said Tuesday its chief financial officer, Gideon Yu, was leaving the company.Mr. Yu is a well-regarded Silicon Valley veteran with experience at Google, YouTube and Yahoo. Facebook, which is privately held, did not offer an explanation for his departure but said it had hired an executive search firm to find a successor with experience in running a public company.Mr. Yu raised Facebook’s last round of financing in 2007, which included an investment from Microsoft valuing it at $15 billion. But Mr. Yu had trouble raising more money at an equivalent valuation — money the company needs to cover escalating technology costs. Facebook has also been trying to build an advertising business in a tough economy.“Gideon has played an important role in helping us achieve our financial success, building a strong finance team and establishing the core financial operations of our company,” a Facebook spokeswoman, Brandee Barker, said in a statement. “We are grateful to Gideon for his contributions to Facebook and what we are trying to accomplish.”Mr. Yu declined to comment on his departure.Perhaps seeking to avoid further conjecture about its finances, Facebook took the opportunity to release limited information about its business. The company said that it beat internal projections in the latest quarter, and that it was on track to increase revenue by 70 percent this year. It also said it had just completed its fifth quarter in a row of profitability in terms of Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Larry Yu, a Facebook spokesman who is not related to Gideon Yu, said the company did not need to raise more cash to get to profitability but would entertain the idea. “It’s all going to be a function of valuation and a valuation we are happy with,” he said. Mr. Yu said Facebook had no immediate plans for an initial offering.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','“There is extreme danger in counting on a dividend strategy right now,” said Joel Framson, a financial adviser in Los Angeles. “In fact, too many of the decimated portfolios we are seeing in our new clients were caused by people thinking they could capture high dividend yields without taking risk.”Of course, in these unpredictable times, there are no easy answers. Even the most diversified portfolios have taken devastating hits. But there are ways to structure your retirement portfolio so that you won’t be forced to sell investments at the most inopportune moments, as well as ways to create a paycheck, of sorts, in retirement.TOTAL RETURN First, instead of focusing solely on dividend-paying investments, financial planners said that retirees should look at a retirement portfolio holistically. In financial adviser speak, this is known as a total return strategy, which includes drawing upon a collection of dividends, interest and capital gains (when they eventually return). You should devise an asset allocation based on your time horizon and tolerance for risk, among other factors. And all diversified portfolios will see the benefits of dividends — historically, they’ve accounted for more than 40 percent of stock market returns over the long haul.In retirement, you withdraw a set amount of money from your portfolio each year, typically around 4 percent, and increase the dollar amount withdrawn each year to adjust for inflation. To ride out these tough economic times, many planners advise forgoing the inflation adjustment, or even withdrawing less. This is especially true for people who are still in the early years of their retirement and worried about outliving their savings.FIVE-YEAR PLAN In the current environment, this strategy stands out. In the 1980s, Harold Evensky, president of Evensky & Katz Wealth Management, came up with what he calls a five-year mantra. Mr. Evensky believes you should not invest any of the money you’ll need in the next five years — whether it’s for living expenses or a large purchase or another anticipated expense.Take a couple with a $750,000 retirement portfolio who needs $30,000 a year. Using Mr. Evensky’s strategy, they would set up three separate accounts. The first account would hold two years of expenses, or $60,000. About half of that money would be in a money-market account, while the balance would be in a short-term, high-quality bond fund (like the Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index). Each month, $2,500 ($30,000 divided by 12 months) would be automatically transferred from the money market fund into a second account — a local checking account — to pay their expenses.“Knowing where their grocery money is coming from makes it a little easier,” Mr. Evensky said. “When things get bad, they will know they can look at it, they can touch it and they know they haven’t lost a penny.”The third account, the investment portfolio, would hold the remaining $690,000. This money would be diversified among stocks, bonds and other asset classes based on the couple’s stomach for risk, age and overall goals. But part of the allocation would include at least three years of expenses in short-term bonds. If there isn’t a good time to replenish the cash account, the couple can tap the short-term bonds (that way, they don’t have to sell their investments when the markets are down). Otherwise, the cash account can be replenished through rebalancing the investment portfolio.Mr. Evensky said he tested how this method might work during a period similar to the 1970s, when both stocks and bonds were decimated and inflation was rampant. His portfolio lasted 24 years, whereas a portfolio invested in 50 percent stocks and 50 percent bonds ran out of money after 20 years, and an all-bond portfolio ran dry after 12 years.IMMEDIATE ANNUITIES With this type of annuity, you give a pile of money to an insurance company, and it provides you with a paycheck until you die. For a 65-year-old male, the payout rate is about 8 percent. So for every $100,000 that man purchases, he will receive $8,000 annually, according to New York Life. Women receive slightly less because they live longer. The payout will be less if you choose to adjust your payments for inflation. Of course, you need to choose an insurer carefully — especially now.“The promise to pay lifetime income is only as good as the insurance company can deliver,” said Karin Maloney Stifler, a certified financial planner in Hudson, Ohio. “Investors must realize that annuities entail credit or default risk by the insurer.”You can spread your risk by buying a few annuities from a few top-rated insurers and only buy up to the amount that the state regulator will insure in the event of a default. Ms. Stifler said that $100,000 is typical. The big downside with annuities, of course, is that you cannot get your money back. And if you die shortly after you buy the annuity, your heirs will get nothing.How much annuity do you need? Generally, you shouldn’t put all your nest egg into an annuity. One approach is to tally up your essential living expenses (housing, health care, groceries, etc). Then, figure out how much reliable income you have from Social Security, for instance, or a pension. If there’s a gap between the two, it may make sense to purchase an annuity to fund the difference, Ms. Stifler said.PAYOUT FUNDS These mutual funds, which are intended to provide retirees with an income stream during retirement, have only hit the market in the past 18 months or so. There are generally two types of funds, though they’re all generally funds that invest in other funds. The first type operates much like a university endowment: it aims to generate a stable income stream — say, 3 or 5 percent — while either preserving or increasing the initial investment. Vanguard and Schwab offer funds in this mold. The second type of payout fund also aims to generate income, but only until a specified date in the future, when the remaining money, if any, is completely distributed. The Fidelity Income Replacement Funds use this methodology.But when a fund performs poorly, the income generated will also fall. In some cases, the funds will begin to return your principal. That’s why some experts say these funds will more likely be used to cover discretionary expenses. Given the complexity of these funds, you really need to understand them fully — and the supporting role they should play in your portfolio — before jumping in.“They are all interesting approaches, but they are unproven,” said Dan Culloton, associate director of fund analysis at Morningstar Inc. “You can lose money, and people have thus far. But they are an interesting proposal for someone who wants to turn their nest eggs into a stream of payments and have some control over the assets and the ability to take money out.”'"
"'09-04-01,'1','Asked if umpires had such concern about the new arrangement that they might consider going on strike — as early as opening day, which is Sunday — McMorris again declined comment. Jerry Layne, a veteran umpire, also declined to discuss the subject when reached by telephone.Although a strike is unlikely, their silence suggested that the situation could hurt the relationship between Major League Baseball and its umpires, which had been improving.The concept of monitoring umpires by camera and computer has been debated since QuesTec made its debut as part of baseball’s taking more control over umpires. In 2003, the umpires union filed a grievance concerning baseball’s use of QuesTec. It was finally resolved in late 2004, when the union and Major League Baseball completed negotiations on a new labor agreement.Most baseball officials say that umpires have become more consistent in calling balls and strikes by the rulebook definition as years have passed. Analysis of 2008 data by the Elias Sports Bureau showed only a small difference in how the strike zone was called depending on whether QuesTec was being used: umpires in QuesTec parks called a pitch a strike 31.5 percent of the time, compared with 31.2 percent without QuesTec, a difference of about three pitches a game.“A lot of people are of the impression that a particular umpire not in a QuesTec park would run wild and become an outlaw,” Port said. “But there is virtually no difference. And that was the purpose of the system.”Port added that Zone Evaluation was more accurate in collecting data, which will triple with cameras in every park. The software that refines and distributes the information to umpires over the Web was developed by Major League Baseball Advanced Media and Sportvision. Since 2006, they have partnered in developing the MLB.com pitch-tracking application. That system records the ball’s position in flight more than 20 times before it reaches home plate.But, umpires have pointed out, the accuracy of the system suffers once a pitch enters the strike zone — because the zone hovers above the five-sided plate as more of a three-dimensional prism, not the rectangle that television viewers see. They have maintained that although QuesTec (like Zone Evaluation) collects data in three dimensions, a hitter’s position in the batter’s box or distractions like bat movement can cloud the information, making it unfit for evaluative decisions about umpires.“I don’t think it’s positive or negative,” Bruce Froemming, a veteran umpire, said before his retirement in 2007. “It’s something we live with.”During spring training, players generally said that they did not expect pitch-monitoring in all 30 parks to make much difference, either to the game or to outside observers. The Phillies left-hander Cole Hamels said that umpires were already consistent enough. Another Phillies left-hander, Jamie Moyer, said he preferred no monitoring system, to preserve the human element of umpiring.Two top hitters, Mark Teixeira of the Yankees and Carl Crawford of the Tampa Bay Rays, said they did not care because they had never paid attention to whether a park was outfitted with QuesTec anyway.The only way fans may notice the new Zone Evaluation system, it appears, is if umpires make a public issue of it.“I don’t think it will be that noticeable because the aspiration of the umpires, as I have come to know it, is they want to do their jobs well,” Port said. “This is a tool. Hopefully, it will show just how good they are.”'"
"'09-04-01,'1','OTTAWA — In an unexpected move, Air Canada removed its president and chief executive Monday night.The decision to replace the executive, Monte Brewer, with Calin Rovinescu, who earlier led a restructuring operation at the company, has fueled speculation that Air Canada might seek bankruptcy protection for the second time in six years.Air Canada is facing a cash shortfall and increasing competition on crucial routes from its smaller domestic rival, WestJet. It also has pension problems and is facing contract talks with its unions.Those factors led some analysts to speculate that another bankruptcy filing was likely even before the change in management. Last week, Ben Cherniavsky, an airline analyst with Raymond James, wrote in a note to investors that the odds of Air Canada getting through its current problems without another reorganization were “about 50/50 at best.”In recent interviews with the Canadian news media, Mr. Brewer, an American who had led the airline since 2004, indicated that he planned to lead the airline out of its financial straits.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','PARIS — Workers at a Caterpillar plant in the French Alps briefly held five of their bosses in a dispute over their severance packages, workers and union officials said Tuesday.“There is no violence or sequestration, but simply pressure so they restart negotiations,” Pierre Piccarreta, a representative from the C.G.T. union, told The Associated Press. Workers had detained the director of the plant and his associates.“At a time when the company is making a profit and distributing dividends to shareholders,” Mr. Piccarreta said, “we want to find a favorable outcome for all the workers and know as quickly as possible where we are going.”A member of the worker’s council, who refused to identify himself, said “the employees just want a fair deal.” The move at Caterpillar was at least the third time in the last few weeks that French workers had detained their bosses to protest job losses.Caterpillar, which in January and February announced 22,000 job cuts worldwide, is seeking to lay off 733 workers — about a quarter of the work force — at its factories in the towns of Grenoble and Échirolles. Combined with those already laid off and those whose short-term contracts will not be renewed, a total of about 1,000 workers at the French factories are losing their jobs.Caterpillar France has said the job cuts were necessary because its order book had been cut in half.Jim Dugan, a spokesman for Caterpillar at the company’s headquarters in Peoria, Ill., said he could not immediately comment.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','Here is what passes for good news in the latest report: in a handful of cities, including Minneapolis, New York and Charlotte, N.C., the rate of decline in January slowed a little from the rate of decline in December.The index is now at 146.40, its lowest point since September 2003. The peak was 206.52 in July 2006. The prices are calibrated to a January 2000 level of 100.Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said in a research note that “it is unlikely that we are anywhere near a bottom in nationwide home prices.” He estimated the index was perhaps two-thirds of the way through its ultimate total decline.That would take big-city prices back to where they were in late 2001 or early 2002 and would probably encourage another round of owners to surrender their underwater homes to lenders.The monthly Case-Shiller report, widely considered one of the most authoritative gauges of home prices, focuses on major cities, which happen to be the places where the boom was most frenzied. Even in those communities, realty agents argue that the report does not give a full picture of a market that can vary by neighborhood and price level.Changes in housing prices traditionally lag behind changes in sales volume, and volume has been showing an uptick lately in some places. Much of the sales activity in the Sun Belt is coming from foreclosure sales by banks, not traditional sales by homeowners. Prices in these areas will not begin to recover until the foreclosures end.Jim Klinge, a prominent San Diego agent, said the collapse in prices had greatly increased sales volume. “There’s a group of buyers that need housing more than they need to pay attention to the doom-and-gloom headlines we see every single day,” he said.One of them is Larry Salzman, a lawyer turned Internet entrepreneur who is seeking to buy a townhouse in El Cajon, Calif., after renting for several years. He is paying $240,000, which will shrink his monthly housing costs by a few hundred dollars.Mr. Salzman would have liked a bigger, nicer place, but higher-end houses have not declined as much as cheaper ones.Mr. Klinge said his client was not unique. Above $500,000, the market is still dead. “All the higher-end sellers are holding out for top prices, thinking things are going to get better sooner or later,” the agent said.For a brief time during the last few weeks, it seemed that moment might be sooner.The National Association of Realtors said sales of previously owned homes rose 5.1 percent in February, while the Census Bureau said sales of new one-family homes in the month increased 4.7 percent above the revised January rate. The Realtors association also said that the median home price in February was $165,400, slightly better than January’s $164,800.Since the Case-Shiller numbers cover an earlier period, “it is possible that the market hit bottom in January and is starting to improve,” an IHS Global Insight analyst, Patrick Newport, wrote in a report.Possible but not likely, he decided, concluding that the bottom would not come until next year.'"
"'09-04-01,'1','The owner of The Chicago Sun-Times filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, saying that it expects advertising revenue to plummet 30 percent this year and joining a growing list of newspaper companies that have taken that step.Sun-Times Media Group is in a different position from the other publishers that have filed for bankruptcy  companies that made money on operations last year, but cannot make payments on the large sums they owe to banks and bondholders. Sun-Times has no such debt, but it has enormous operating losses and faces a major bill for back taxes.In December, the Tribune Company, which owns The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times and several other major papers, filed for bankruptcy. Since then, Star Tribune Holdings of Minneapolis; Philadelphia Newspapers, publisher of that city’s two major papers; and the Journal Register Company, owner of The New Haven Register and many smaller papers, have done the same.In its filing with the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware, Sun-Times, formerly called Hollinger International, disclosed that it had a $344 million operating loss in 2008, on revenue of $324 million, compared with operating losses of $140 million in 2007 and $30 million in 2006. The company said that a restructuring would eliminate the jobs of some of its 2,171 employees. In addition to the flagship newspaper, with weekday circulation of 313,000, it owns a chain of smaller papers in the Chicago region.The Internal Revenue Service has told the company that it owes $510 million and possible penalties for underpaid taxes from 1996 to 2003, when Hollinger International was controlled by Conrad M. Black, who was convicted of fraud and obstruction of justice charges in 2007.The company said a year ago that it would entertain offers for any of its assets, or for the entire company, but no major deals have emerged. Its biggest shareholder is Hollinger Inc., a Canadian company. Sun-Times stock, which traded above $6 in early 2007, closed on Tuesday at 2 cents.The company is being advised by the investment bank Rothschild and the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.Also on Tuesday, Craig A. Moon, president and publisher of USA Today, which has the largest circulation in the country at nearly 2.3 million, announced that he would retire from the paper’s parent, Gannett, on April 17.Mr. Moon is leaving at a time of crucial transitions. USA Today has not yet named a replacement for its top editor, Kenneth A. Paulson, who stepped down in early February. And on Monday, Gannett’s Detroit Free Press and a competing paper, The Detroit News, halted home delivery on four days of the week, a project that Mr. Moon oversaw.“The media business has never been more challenged,” Mr. Moon, 59, said in an interview, but he played down his importance to Gannett. “I have full confidence that they really aren’t going to miss a beat.”'"

"'09-04-02,'1','In February, as part of the economic stimulus legislation, Congress added conditions for H-1B visas for banks that received assistance from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. The banks must show that they will not displace an American from a job to be filled by an immigrant for three months before and after the immigrant is hired.Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, among others, said that provision led them to rescind small numbers of job offers to graduating foreign students and financial technology engineers.In 2008, according to figures from Citizenship and Immigration Services, the top four companies seeking H-1B visas were from India. By far the most visas — 4,559 —went to Infosys Technologies, a $4 billion company in Bangalore, which used them to place Indian information technology workers in American companies. Microsoft, the first American company on the list, received 1,037 visas last year.One of the biggest Indian companies using H-1B visas last year was Satyam Computer Services, based in Hyderabad. Its founder and chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, is facing criminal charges in India, accused of inflating his employee rolls by more than 10,000 workers and falsifying accounts by more than $1 billion. The company is up for auction.Indian companies’ heavy use of the visas has drawn accusations of fraud from some lawmakers. Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said they intended to introduce a bill this week that would impose stricter hiring terms for all H-1B visas and increase enforcement. The senators said they would not consider raising the numerical limits on the visas until loopholes they had identified were closed.“With unemployment at rates higher than we’ve seen in decades, there is no shortage of people looking for work,” Mr. Grassley said Wednesday, “so companies should need less H-1B visas than last year.”In January, in a move that unsettled the outsourcing industry, federal prosecutors in Iowa brought criminal charges against the Vision Systems Group, a New Jersey company that provides temporary information technology workers to companies in several states. The company is accused of seeking H-1B visas for workers for an office in Iowa that did not exist, and of paying the workers based on the prevailing wage in Iowa, which is lower than in many states where the immigrants actually worked.Lawyers for Vision Systems asked the Iowa court on Wednesday to dismiss the case. “We don’t believe that bringing highly trained and highly productive people to work in the U.S. in an industry that is underserved by our own population is or should be a crime,” a lawyer for the company, Mark Weinhardt, said.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','“I enjoyed playing at Yankee Stadium,” Derek Jeter said. “I really did.”But there was only so much the Yankees could do. Rob Cucuzza, the clubhouse manager, stored equipment in whatever crannies he could find. It might take 20 minutes, Cucuzza said, to retrieve an extra batting helmet for a player.There was one batting cage and one weight room, and the Yankees had to split time with the visitors. Some players did not mind the casual pregame interaction with opponents, but to others, it was awkward.“There’s certain people you don’t want to see,” Jorge Posada said. “It’s kind of fun not having to be around those guys. They have their weight room, we have ours.”The old weight room was not attached to the clubhouse, so players would lift and sweat, then retreat to their lockers through a hall that might be drafty. This weight room will not have that problem, but more important than temperature is supervision. The new weight room is adjacent to the trainers’ room.“Before, if the strength coach had to go and stretch somebody, the weight room would kind of be unsupervised,” General Manager Brian Cashman said. “Now, a trainer’s always able to look in through a window. You leave players to their own devices, they may wind up doing something that’s not that smart.”Pettitte, who turns 37 in June, said he was excited about the SwimEx aquatic therapy pools the Yankees will have near the weight room.“That’s just going to be awesome,” Pettitte said. “We had that in Houston and I loved it. Gets the soreness out the day after your start.”As a pitcher, Pettitte has less use for the batting cage. But its ideal spot — a few steps from the clubhouse door at the entrance to the dugout — is important for hitters. The old cage sat near right field, down a long hallway from the clubhouse. The walk made it tough to sneak in extra swings between at-bats.“It’s good that it’s right next to the dugout,” Johnny Damon said. “You can have an at-bat where you just feel totally lost, but I feel like if I hit the ball off the tee or get some flips, I can get back to where I need to be. I think it’s a huge difference.”Video will also be much easier to access. There were just three video monitors last season, Damon said, and the players sometimes fought over who could use them. Now, each locker has its own computer console, so players can freely analyze swings and study opponents.The room for players’ families has also gone high-tech, with PlayStation and Xbox machines. If children still want to watch the game from the stands, players can handle ticket arrangements from their clubhouse computers, which will also receive text messages from Yankees staffers.“It’s a better way to communicate than a Post-it note,” Cashman said. “Their locker is essentially their office, so we tried to set up a situation where their locker is more functional.”Cashman’s office definitely is. At the old stadium, it had a door that opened to the press box. If the curtains on his window were open, Cashman could not work in privacy. If they were drawn, reporters wondered why.“I’ll definitely have more privacy,” Cashman said. “If I have a meeting with an agent or ownership, I won’t have people watching that stuff taking place.”Before, Cashman watched games from a box half the size of the broadcast booths surrounding it. There was no bathroom, no food, no couch. As amenities go, it was Gilligan’s Island — as primitive as can be.Now, Cashman will watch from a suite behind home plate, a level above the press box, away from prying eyes. He will have nicer furniture and a refrigerator and a bathroom, all the comforts unavailable before.But Cashman celebrated championships from his old vantage point. It was cramped, but it was his perch for a lot of winning seasons. He would rather win in tight quarters than lose in luxury.“All that matters is what the team does,” Cashman said, sounding a bit like Rivera. “It’s nicer, but it’ll only be as nice as the team plays.”Joba Chamberlain pleaded guilty to drunken driving in Lincoln, Neb., and was given probation and a $400 fine. He was pulled over Oct. 18 outside Lincoln. ... Mark Teixeira went 3 for 3 with a homer in the Yankees’ 8-5 victory over the Phillies.

"'09-04-02,'1','The Major League Baseball Players Association on Friday will open its first retail outlet devoted to selling player-only merchandise.The store, which will be inside Citi Field and be operated by Aramark, is an attempt to boost licensing revenue for the union and to promote star players, much as the N.B.A. and other leagues have done.The outlet will be called The Players Clubhouse: A Players Choice Store and is being billed by the union as a prototype for future retail stores.

"'09-04-02,'1','LONDON — Finally, an answer to the question consuming protocol watchers and tabloid reporters here: What did the Obamas give Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday when they arrived at Buckingham Palace?An Obama aide reported the queen was given an iPod loaded with video and photos of her 2007 trip to the United States, as well as songs and accessories. She also received a rare songbook signed by the composer Richard Rodgers.The gift issue had come up after Prime Minister Gordon Brown visited the White House last month. Mr. Brown gave Mr. Obama a pen holder carved from the timber of an anti-slave ship, receiving in return a DVD box set of American movies, igniting a torrent of criticism in the British press.According to news reports here, the queen gave the Obamas a silver-framed signed photograph — a gift she gives to all visiting dignitaries.There was no word on whether the songbook included the “Sound of Music” classic, “My Favorite Things.”But one thing is certain: that iPod better have some good songs, because if past is prologue, the British papers will be examining this gift for a while.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama issued a policy statement that faulted the rules as having “unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry” and cost the nation billions of dollars. As president, he said, he would push for change.Now the administration is tapping a leading proponent of export revisions, Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, a California Democrat who is chairwoman of the centrist, 67-member New Democrat Coalition. Ms. Tauscher recently announced that she would give up her House seat to become under secretary of state for arms control and international security — a key post overseeing the export bureaucracy.Before her nomination, Ms. Tauscher said the issue was one of her top priorities. “It’s an enormously big deal,” she said in an interview.But some lawmakers still have jitters about putting satellites into the hands of Washington’s adversaries, and in particular those of Beijing.“In the political environment we operate in, China is the third rail,” Thomas C. Moore, a satellite export specialist for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told a Washington conference in November. “We have members who know China tests weapons in space, and they don’t want to be accused of giving them any assistance.”Advocates of easing the export rules say they have damaged rather than enhanced national security and hobbled a field that was once a proud symbol of American innovation.The first communications satellite to soar into stationary orbit was invented by Harold A. Rosen, then an engineer at Hughes Space and Communications. It flew in 1964.Once as small as wash tubs, the satellites now can rival a truck in size, weigh tons and cost $200 million. In space, their solar panels can unfurl to half the length of a football field. Each year, 10 to 30 are sold.From a height of 22,300 miles, the spacecraft beam signals over vast distances, relaying trillions of phone calls and linking ships to shore and soldiers to families. They send electronic school lessons to rural Africa, the Olympic Games live around the globe and convey TV shows to broadcasters, cable operators and homes equipped with dish antennas.The spacecraft have been honored as quiet forces promoting development and democratic values.Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks satellites, said the United States had built 428 of the craft launched successfully into orbit — the vast majority. It sold one-third to other nations, which typically used the satellites as stepping stones to development.In 1984, a European rocket lofted one of the American craft, starting a trend to launcher globalization.The strict export controls arose from a political fight over how far to open the field to China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. A main issue was whether Beijing could be trusted, like a letter carrier, to make deliveries without peeking inside.President Ronald Reagan approved three satellite transfers to China. The first President Bush permitted nine more.President Bill Clinton sought to regularize such exports. In early 1996, he directed that the licensing shift from the State Department to the Commerce Department, signaling the importance of economics.Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt.Two American satellite makers — Hughes and Loral — were accused of illegally giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.As a federal grand jury investigated, the Republicans, who controlled Congress, held hearings. They warned that satellite exports threatened a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might have already stolen encryption secrets.“It’s critical that safeguards are in place,” Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate commerce committee, said at a hearing in September 1998.A month later, the Republicans attached to a defense bill a rider that sought to license commercial satellites as weapons and give Congress authority to supervise the exports.Mr. Clinton, weakened by calls for his impeachment, signed the bill into law. But he called the move unnecessary, saying it threatened to “hamper the U.S. satellite industry.”“They were out to get Clinton,” said James A. Lewis, a former Commerce Department official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “It really didn’t have anything to do with export controls or national security.”The new regulations quickly hurt American satellite makers. Boeing lost a $450 million order. Canadian firms pulled out of at least four projects.In June 2000, William A. Reinsch, then an under secretary of commerce, told the Senate that, from 1998 to 1999, satellite export sales had fallen by 40 percent. The drop, Mr. Reinsch said, harms “the high-tech industries upon which our military and intelligence agencies depend.”The decline accelerated as other countries, driven by pride and the allure of profits, joined the business. Around 2002, Alcatel Space, based in France, started building communication satellites free of American parts and thus free of American export restrictions. It soon landed a $145 million order from China. Other satellite makers joined the de-Americanizing trend.The “anachronistic restrictions,” Manmohan Singh, India’s prime minister, told his nation’s space scientists, have “spurred you to greater heights.” India now has many communications satellites in orbit, and a science probe circling the Moon.In 2003 — as American satellite exports fell to $215 million from $1.05 billion in 1998 — the Commerce Department reported that the nation’s annual balance of trade in high technology goods had declined for the first time. Hughes, the satellite pioneer (now a unit of Boeing), had 11 commercial satellite orders in 1998 and none in 2007, according to Futron, an aerospace consulting firm in Washington.“The United States invented this industry,” said Peggy Slye, director for space and telecommunications at Futron. “To see that lead eroded because of regulatory policy is very regrettable.”The losses are even potentially risky. Congressional investigators examined the military’s growing reliance on foreign communication satellites and warned that technical and political upheaval “could affect the availability.” Some commercial satellites had already suffered intentional disruption, the report said.In January, the National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, called relaxation of the export policies a matter of urgency. The rules, it said in a report, weaken national security and discourage innovation, isolating domestic industries in “a self-destructive strategy of obsolescence and declining economic competitiveness.”Mr. Scowcroft, the former national security adviser who is the report’s co-chairman, said the government should reverse itself and assume that technology and information are harmless unless proven otherwise.“Instead of saying, ‘Is it all right to let this bit of information out?’ we should say, ‘Is there any compelling reason why we should not?’ ” he said in an interview. “Our default position ought to be openness.”Some analysts still urge extreme caution. Baker Spring, a national security analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, advocates a country-by-country approach in which close allies could buy or launch satellites but not nations like China.The hearing on Thursday, before the House Foreign Affairs trade subcommittee, features supporters and critics. But its chairman, Representative Brad J. Sherman, a California Democrat, told a satellite conference in Washington last week that the hope of new jobs could spur regulatory change.Dr. Rosen, the technology’s inventor, who at 83 still consults for Boeing, said he believed that the policy would shift and that the industry would rebound.“I’m an optimist,” he said. “The reason I keep consulting is that I enjoy interacting with the young engineers, and they’re as good as ever.”'"

(AP) — Thornburg Mortgage, the jumbo-mortgage lender, said on Wednesday that it expected to file for Chapter 11 protection and sell or liquidate its assets.The company, which is based in Santa Fe, reported a loss of $2.75 billion in the nine months that ended last Sept. 30, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Thornburg said some of its creditors would take over collateral instead of loan payments.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','CONVERT TO A ROTH When you do the conversion, you must pay income tax on the amount you are converting, which may be the whole account or just a portion of it. But converting now is a bargain in two respects, said Barry C. Picker, an accountant and financial planner with Picker, Weinberg & Auerbach in Brooklyn. If the investments subsequently increase in value, that appreciation will be free from income tax. And if tax rates increase later, you will have converted it at today’s lower rates.Once you have made the conversion, no tax is assessed when the money is withdrawn, subject to certain restrictions. You also avoid the requirement to take yearly minimum distributions beginning at age 70 1/2, which can leave more for your heirs if you don’t use the money yourself.Starting in 2010, you can do a conversion regardless of your income. For now, you can convert the I.R.A. only if you are single or married filing jointly and your modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $100,000.ROLL OVER YOUR 401(K) Consider this if you are about to change jobs or are approaching retirement. When you leave a company, you can roll the assets from a company plan directly into a Roth I.R.A. Here, too, you must pay income tax on the account balance, and the $100,000 income limitation applies until 2010.UNDO A ROTH CONVERSION Let’s say that in December you converted a $100,000 I.R.A., but its value has declined to $70,000. You owe tax on April 15 on $100,000, unless you reverse the transaction — a process called recharacterization. You’re allowed this do-over any time until Oct. 15 of the year after you do the conversion. If you recharacterize after you have filed your return and paid the tax, submit an amended return and claim a refund.After you have recharacterized, you are not permitted to do another conversion with the same assets until the next year or 30 days after the first conversion — whichever is longer.If you do another conversion and the market declines further, you can recharacterize again, subject to the waiting period. “It’s like getting to bet on a horse after the race is over,” said Ed Slott, a C.P.A. in Rockville Centre, N.Y.Each time you do a conversion, create another Roth I.R.A., rather than mixing funds in an existing Roth account, Mr. Slott advised. That makes it much easier to monitor asset performance, and to recharacterize later if necessary.STOP AUTOMATIC DISTRIBUTIONS If you have been relying on the financial institution holding your account to calculate and pay the required distribution (for instance, monthly or annually), notify it if you want the distribution suspended. Should you receive an I.R.A. distribution in error, you can roll it back into the account within 60 days and not have to pay taxes, said Natalie B. Choate, a lawyer with Nutter McClennen & Fish in Boston. But you can restore the funds only once within a 12-month period, so you will be stuck with any additional payments.TAKE THE DISTRIBUTION This approach might appeal to wealthy people who prefer to pay the tax now because they expect rates to go up, Ms. Choate said. By taking distributions of low-value stock, you benefit if the stock increases in value and is held for more than a year. Then, if you sell it, that appreciation will be taxed at a 15 percent capital gains rate. In contrast, all withdrawals from a retirement account are taxed at the less favorable ordinary income rates.'"

"'09-04-02,'1','Take-Two Interactive Software, the maker of the Grand Theft Auto video games, agreed to pay $3 million to settle a lawsuit in which the Securities and Exchange Commission had accused the company of backdating stock options.The settlement needs approval in federal court in New York, the company said on Wednesday in a statement. The company’s former chief executive, Ryan Brant, pleaded guilty in 2007 in a related criminal case.“Take-Two’s seven-year backdating scheme was egregious and pervasive, and caused the company to materially misrepresent its financial condition to investors,” Christopher Conte, an S.E.C. attorney in Washington overseeing the case, said in a statement.The S.E.C. contended Mr. Brant and other former senior executives had “fraudulently enriched” key employees by granting them stock options backdated to days of historically low closing prices. Mr. Brant pleaded guilty to falsifying records and was sentenced to five years’ probation.Take-Two, based in New York, also reached a settlement with Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. The company admitted that some of its former directors and officers had “engaged in certain illegal behaviors.” Take-Two will pay $300,000 to Mr. Morgenthau’s office to cover the cost of his investigation. The district agreed not to prosecute the company or its subsidiaries.The S.E.C. accused Take-Two of granting backdated stock options more than 100 times from April 1997 to September 2003. The options were granted without approval from the board and generated “millions of dollars in illicit compensation,” according to the complaint.The backdating resulted in Take-Two overstating income or understating losses from 1997 through 2005. The company restated its financial statements for those years, leading to $42.1 million in new noncash charges related to the compensation, according to the complaint.'"

"'09-04-02,'1','“Are you comfortable with the ups and downs of the stock market?” he asked.“Yes,” she said, adding, “otherwise I’d take all the money out.” (She, several other callers and Ernst & Young agreed to let a reporter listen in on the calls, on the condition that they and their employers not be identified.)Half of this caller’s 401(k) assets were in the stock of her employer, a consumer goods’ manufacturer, and she expressed reluctance to sell any of it — even though planners advise against such reliance on one company.“Let’s carve that out” and consider moving other assets to get to a desirable mix, Mr. Cherry suggested. She agreed. In the end, Mr. Cherry suggested a portfolio with fixed-interest investments as well as stocks — one of the 12 mixes of stocks and fixed-income investments that Ernst & Young has compiled. The planners do not recommend specific stocks or mutual funds, and they do not sell anything.What Mr. Cherry had provided was not just advice but reassurance, said Robert Porter, national director of the Ernst & Young planner line, who supervises the planners in Secaucus and another 20 in San Diego. Ernst & Young declined to say what it charges companies for the service.Most clients are not calling in response to one day’s ups or downs in the stock market. Rather, they are seeking broader advice, broader perspective and hand-holding, Mr. Porter said.Another major provider of telephone financial-planning advice is Ayco, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. (for which this reporter worked briefly a decade ago). Tom MacLaughlin, vice president of the Ayco AnswerLine, said calls had spiked in the last quarter of 2008. “There was a marked increase in the number of calls focused on asset allocation and 401(k)’s,” he said.Mr. MacLaughlin said some clients last fall were very concerned about market gyrations, “and often uncertainty can lead to fear, but most of our clients were not panicked.”Some callers needed “a guiding hand, and others wanted reassurance,” he added, and Ayco “tried to focus people on diversification and asset allocation and line up the asset allocation with the tolerance for risk.”About 3.6 million other workers are eligible for planning advice without a fee from TIAA-CREF, the financial-services company for employees of colleges and other nonprofit organizations.James Nichols, TIAA’s vice president of advice strategy, said calls to that line had leapt since October.“The initial call back in October and November was much more of a panic, and more recently, I’d say a month ago, a couple of months ago, we’ve seen a turn toward almost paralysis,” he said, adding, “People initially wanted to take some rash action to prevent further loss.” He said his staff worked with callers “to make sure they understand the implications of their choices.”The broad advice was to “make sure you have some sort of plan to plot your actions against” before taking drastic steps, he said.The company’s telephone services deal largely with people earning less than $200,000 a year.Patricia Pearsall-Ramey, an Ernst & Young planner, was on the phone with a single man about to retire from a major petrochemical company who needed to decide whether to take a lump-sum payment from his pension plan and invest it on his own or opt for guaranteed monthly pension payments for life.The man, a Floridian in his late 50s, had been thinking of taking the lump sum and using it to buy an annuity, which would also give him a lifetime income stream. Ms. Pearsall-Ramey gave him a homework assignment: find out about the annuity’s inflation protection, if any, and its various fees and charges.Another Ernst & Young planner, Andrew M. Clarke, was talking with a first-time caller, a state employee who was 61 and planned to work a few more years. She wanted to discuss whether to choose a defined-contribution pension — in which the employee can direct how the money is invested and bear the risks — or a defined-benefit one, in which the employee is guaranteed a specified payment.The caller said she thought she had only a week to make the decision. But Mr. Clarke and other planners had studied the state pension program, and, in a soothing voice, he advised her that she had a year to decide.And so it went. Vince E. Villanueva, a planner at Ernst & Young, had a call from a man in his 50s planning to retire in a few years; he sought assurance that he was “O.K.”“For the most part, his planning was intact,” Mr. Villanueva said, largely because he had made some asset-allocation changes in recent years that were helping him ride out the bear market.Advice is caller-specific. “The conversation starts first with what’s appropriate for that individual,” said Mr. Nichols of TIAA-CREF. After assessing a caller’s financial situation and goals, a planner can say “here are some options” to rebalance a portfolio, he said.Ernst & Young planners follow “generally accepted planning principles” but customize them — and also try to answer unasked questions, Ms. Finkelstein said.If, for instance, she said, the caller asks, can I take a 401(k) loan? The answer may be yes, depending on plan rules, but the bigger question is whether there are better alternatives.Or, as Ms. Finkelstein put it, “It’s incumbent upon us as planners to go through the caller’s thought process.”'"
"'09-04-02,'1','In a case of piracy that some analysts called unprecedented, untold thousands of people watched a version of “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” online Wednesday, a full month before its scheduled theater release.The film’s distributor, 20th Century Fox, said it did not know how the unfinished copy of the comic book adaptation was leaked onto the Internet. The copy was missing many special effects and included temporary sound and music. Nonetheless, it circulated widely online beginning late Tuesday, even prompting some viewers to publish reviews, favorable and unfavorable, of the hotly anticipated film. “Wolverine” stars Hugh Jackman in the title role and is set to open on May 1.The troubling leak  which some people initially dismissed as an April Fool’s Day prank  occurred at a time when media companies are working harder than ever to curtail digital piracy of content. Illicit recordings of films usually appear on the Internet shortly after their theater debuts, but leaks before the premiere dates are rare. Hollywood studios spend millions of dollars to track every step of the film production process to avoid such potentially costly leaks.Eric Garland, the chief executive of the file-sharing monitoring firm BigChampagne, called the widespread downloading of “Wolverine” a “one-of-a-kind case.” “We’ve never seen a high-profile film  a film of this budget, a tentpole movie with this box office potential  leak in any form this early,” he said.The studio, a unit of the News Corporation, spent the day demanding that copies of the film be removed from the largely anonymous swath of Web sites that swap movie files. But the copies propagated at such a swift rate that the digital cops could not keep up. BigChampagne estimated the digital film copy had been downloaded in the low hundreds of thousands of times in its first 24 hours on the Internet.The studio said the F.B.I. and the Motion Picture Association of America were both investigating the film’s premature distribution.“The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the company said, adding “the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past.”Media companies use watermarks and other technological strategies to identify the sources of leaks.“Wolverine” is not the first film to receive an unintended preview on the Internet. Another superhero film, 2003’s “Hulk,” showed up as a download about two weeks before its release. But the major studios hoped they had learned enough since then to keep it from happening again.Mr. Garland said the existence of the illicit file could theoretically depress the box-office receipts for the film, but he emphasized that the online viewers would be only a tiny percentage of the total audience. The “other fear is bad word of mouth,” he said. As twisted as it may seem, “you would rather have a very high-quality version of the film leak than a premature working version of the film leak, because it’s not your best work.”In the case of “Wolverine,” some of the computer-generated scenes were missing and other parts were unedited. The studio noted that some fan Web sites condemned the leak. But other Internet users downloaded the file and weighed in with reviews.“This is bad bad news for Fox,” a movie blog called In GOB We Trust said on Wednesday, asserting that negative comments about the film would reduce its box-office prospects. But the blog reviewed the film anyway, saying that the creators decided to “dumb it down and essentially make a cartoon.”'"
"'09-04-02,'1','“It’s a baby that will grow,” said Abdullah Dardari, the deputy prime minister and chief architect of Syria’s economic reform program.It was not born easily. Some members of the Syrian leadership still resist the move to a market economy. Economic sanctions applied by the Bush administration in 2004 forced the firm chosen to operate the exchange to withdraw, delaying the project by a year. Many international investors say pervasive corruption and the lack of financial regulations here are keeping them away.But socialist self-sufficiency is no longer an option for Syria. The oil reserves that once provided the mainstay of state revenues are running out. Exports have tumbled in recent months, as have remittances sent home by Syrian expatriate workers.Over the next decade, Syria will need $45 billion to $50 billion of public investment to continue its move “from a centrally planned, low-efficiency economy to high-efficiency investment-based economy,” Mr. Dardari said. It is not clear where that money will come from.One way to draw in more foreign capital would be to make a political deal with the West — cutting off Syria’s support for groups like Hamas and Hezbollah in exchange for, among other things, the removal of American economic sanctions.Some analysts have even suggested that Syria’s economic challenges will force it to make such a deal. But interviews with Syrian officials here make clear they do not see it that way.“Syria, no matter how bad the economy, will not bargain,” Mr. Dardari said. “In the 1980s we used to have to queue for Kleenex, but we did not bargain.”Mr. Dardari and others say the American sanctions have had only a minor effect on Syria, which has little direct trade with the United States. Europe is far more significant, and Syria is eagerly pursuing a trade agreement with the European Union that is likely to be signed this year. Trade with Turkey — perhaps Syria’s closest ally — is also growing, to almost $2 billion in 2008 from less than $500 million in 2004.Still, the new stock exchange represents the aspirations of a younger, business-oriented generation for whom economic prosperity may ultimately trump Syria’s longstanding support for militant groups. Many young entrepreneurs are descendants of the old Sunni Muslim mercantile elite of this city, who still tend to dominate in business.In recent years, this younger generation has helped transform the face of Damascus, with new restaurants, bars, nightclubs and boutique hotels. The economy has grown despite the American sanctions, and private banks, first reintroduced in 2004, are becoming more prevalent.Syria’s isolation has had one salutary effect: The financial crisis has hardly been felt, because there is so little financial activity and the banks are so highly regulated.“We are happy to launch at a low point,” said Bassel S. Hamwi, a deputy chairman at Bank Audi who sits on the board of the new exchange. “Stocks have only one direction to go.”On a recent day at the exchange, a crowd of well-dressed young people stood on a red carpet in the front hall, gazing excitedly down at the trading floor. Behind glass partitions, five traders who looked bored were sitting at their desks, waiting for calls. A huge digital screen showed the six available stocks and the volume traded up to that point: 10 shares of Bemo Bank, at 950 Syrian pounds (just under $20) per share.One broker, Faisal Qusibati, stared at the screen, waiting for his phone to ring.“Everything in the beginning is hard,” he said.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','It’s not that Allegra Huston name-drops. Really, it isn’t. But her maternal grandfather believed he was descended from Napoleon. Her mother, who died when Allegra was 4, posed with Jean Cocteau in a famous Philippe Halsman photograph. Her older sister, Anjelica, brought the schoolgirl Allegra with her when she lived with Jack Nicholson and then Ryan O’Neal. The sisters’ Dad, John Huston, was one of the lordliest of Hollywood’s great filmmakers, though he was not much of a domestic presence. He was busy directing “The African Queen” and reachable only by tom-tom when Anjelica was born.Then there is Allegra Huston’s father: a person other than the Dad she had known. That fact, kept secret until she was in her teens, led Ms. Huston to write a magazine article titled “Daddies’ Girl,” which became the basis for “Love Child,” her dramatic and inevitably star-studded new memoir. Few autobiographical writers have such dizzying tales to tell.Her biological father is John Julius Norwich, the viscount and historian, with whom her mother, the ballerina Ricki Soma, had an affair while married to but separated from Mr. Huston. (“I brought her and her nurse to live with me in Ireland after her mother died,” Mr. Huston wrote, making his only mention of Allegra on the next to last page of his 1980 memoir, “An Open Book.”)Viscount Norwich’s mother was the celebrated Lady Diana Cooper. His possible grandfather (“illegitimacy ran in the family, evidently,” Ms. Huston writes) may also have been the grandfather of Margaret Thatcher, with whom Ms. Huston shares piercing blue eyes. Cisco Guevara, Ms. Huston’s “husband that I’m not married to, as they say in Taos,” has family connections to Che Guevara and Pancho Villa.So where, amid all these outsize personalities, does Ms. Huston fit? That’s the question she has asked herself for a lifetime. After all, she has never had a straight answer for even the simplest questions. (“Where are you from?” “What does your father do?” “How many brothers and sisters do you have?”)She grew up with a sense of privilege but without a permanent home (“I was an inconvenience  not unloved, but a problem that required constant solving”) and was shunted summarily from place to place. She had a passport that gave her address as that of Mr. Huston’s business manager’s office. She once figured out that any of her possessions that bore an “A. H.” monogram had been Anjelica’s first.In “Love Child” Ms. Huston paints herself as the most stolid, “bog-ordinary” member of the endlessly creative Huston clan. While the others (including two brothers, Tony and Danny) expressed themselves imaginatively, little Allegra felt terribly literal minded: among her favorite childhood pursuits were painting by numbers and playing connect the dots. But she had gifts of her own, and one is a flair for passive aggression. It’s fascinating to read her book verbatim. It’s even more so to read it between the lines.“Love Child” purports to be the tale of a polite little girl ricocheting through life, never quite recovering from the loss of her beloved mother. Time and again she finds herself a minor planet in the orbit of some powerful man. When she describes the much-married Mr. Huston as a difficult husband  “unfaithful, egocentric, impatient, judgmental, cuttingly sarcastic and a gambler”  she is describing this book’s archetypal bogeyman. Like all the women in her book Ms. Huston loved and feared such men. But she protected herself by developing a carefully selective memory, a vengeful intelligence and a talent for holding herself aloof.She was a small child, Ms. Huston recalls, when she was ushered into a hotel room at Claridge’s, presented to the pointy-kneed Mr. Huston, whom others treated worshipfully, and told, “This is your father.” But not having known that father did not seem so odd to little Allegra; she had friends, like Kate O’Toole, whose fathers were also princely and distant film celebrities. One of the affectations of “Love Child” is referring to Mr. Huston’s professional life only glancingly, as in, “We stayed in the house Richard Burton had built after making ‘The Night of the Iguana’ there with Daddy, 10 years before.”In shaping her story Ms. Huston imposes a retroactive innocence on her memories. So it’s possible for her, in a fond depiction of Mr. Nicholson, to mention a little girl’s alarm at the fake stitches on his nose for the making of “Chinatown” without acknowledging that her Daddy, in that film, played one of the worst daddies who ever walked the earth. It’s also possible for her to cordon off the unpleasantness involving Roman Polanski’s bringing a 13-year-old girl to the Nicholson place and the arrest of Anjelica  whom Mr. Nicholson nicknamed Toot, Allegra says  on charges of cocaine possession at that time. “I was 12, but the whole thing seemed remote from anything that might happen to me,” she writes.Those kid gloves come off when she writes about Mr. O’Neal, whom she found vulgar, violent and frightening. (The word “toot” becomes cocaine-related to her when Mr. O’Neal starts snorting.) Suddenly she is astute enough to notice that a man who puts his hand on her thigh when he drives her to school might be trouble. (“You don’t mind, do you?” he asked. “I can’t drive any other way.”) And she turns snobbish enough to mind the color (magenta) and model (Corniche) of the O’Neal Rolls-Royce.She is a whole different kind of coy in describing the harmless fun she had roller skating with a Hollywood crowd on school nights when she was about 15. Here as elsewhere the book’s manipulated text and flamboyant pictures tell different stories.“Love Child” is more or less bookended by the deaths of Ms. Soma and Mr. Huston. (A coda describes the Rio Grande christening ceremony for Ms. Huston’s son.) And she winds up with clear opinions about all three of her parents. But this book also bristles with sentiments left half-expressed or unsaid, especially where the loving yet competitive Huston sisters are concerned. By the time Mr. Huston settled in Mexico for the last time, Allegra was old enough to be good company for him; she visited a number of times and was pleased to see that a boat, the Allegrita, had been named in her honor.Then her princess of a big sister showed up  and the vessel became the Anjelica, just like that. Allegra tells the boat story with only minimal rancor, but she’s got a long-overdue point to make: Still waters run deep.'"

Starting Monday Julie McCarthy, a longtime NPR foreign correspondent most recently based in Rio de Janeiro, will be reporting from Islamabad.

"'09-04-02,'1','Last week in New York Mr. Gates met with Philippe P. Dauman, the chief executive of Viacom, to go over a long-in-the-works initiative that would give Mr. Gates’s philanthropic organization something any nonprofit would cherish: an enormous megaphone. The new partnership, titled Get Schooled, involves consultation between Gates Foundation experts and executives at all Viacom networks that make programming decisions. Their goal is to weave education-theme story lines into existing shows or to create new shows centered on education.“We are committing the entire creative power of our organization,” Mr. Dauman said. “The whole company is really engaged behind this.”While Viacom is donating on-air time for public-service announcements, and foundation officials are consulting with programming executives, the foundation is also putting up money for production — not just to make public-service announcements but also to indirectly subsidize Viacom’s programming.“We’re open to all of that, and we’ll figure out how best to use our resources once we get deeper in to it,” said Allan C. Golston, president for United States programs at the foundation. He said the organization would provide funds to third parties that “create content” for Viacom.The efforts of philanthropies to influence entertainment programming is not new, although viewers are probably less aware of it then obvious marketing tie-ins in which, for example, a can of Coca-Cola shows up in a character’s hands. The Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on health issues, has been doing such work for a dozen years. It has worked story lines about H.I.V. and AIDS into programs on CBS and UPN (now known as the CWnetwork), including the reality show “America’s Next Top Model.”“We’ve been doing this for a long time, but it’s only more recently that we’ve begun to see more foundations and nonprofits work with this approach,” said Tina Hoff, vice president and director for entertainment media partnerships at the Kaiser Foundation.James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media, which promotes family-oriented entertainment, said foundations typically seek to mold television programs with just advice and prodding.“The difference here is the Gates Foundation is paying for this, that they are actually willing to pay for programming,” Mr. Steyer said.Last year, for example, the foundation awarded a $1.37 million, three-year grant to the Norman Lear Center at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School of Communication, where academics have organized meetings between writers and producers of those shows and experts in H.I.V. and surgical practices.The foundation’s relationship with Viacom goes back about five years and has centered on efforts to promote education. To start this next phase of the partnership formally, Viacom plans a promotional roadblock — with the same programming showing across all its cable channels — for a half-hour on Sept. 8, pegged to the beginning of the school year. Mr. Golston spoke of Viacom’s ability to reach a mass youth audience, and said, “This is a real opportunity for us to do something powerful.”He added that working with television in this vein was essential because the foundation could reach more people than through direct support of education.“Scholarships are not enough,” he said. “There are not enough resources to give scholarships to everyone.”The foundation, for example, paid for a 22-minute film called “Bring Your ‘A’ Game,” about the perils of dropping out of high school, produced by Mario Van Peebles. It is scheduled to run on BET in September. Ms. Hoff, who said Gates Foundation officials had sought her out for advice, said the main reason for such efforts was to combat inaccurate information about health issues that crop up in popular culture. “It’s not about planting a message,” she said. “We start from the vantage point of ensuring accuracy.”Officials who have used these methods said they had been effective in influencing public views and behavior.“There’s a lot of research that shows that when a character in a series says, ‘I’m going to be an organ donor,’ it’s effective, more effective than giving out a pamphlet,” said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center. The center’s Hollywood, Health and Society program received its Gates Foundation grant last year.It was Mr. Kaplan’s effort that succeeded in influencing the plot of Mr. Clooney’s return to “ER.” The Lear Center organized a meeting between the show’s writers and Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and writer for The New Yorker, who briefed the group on the World Health Organization’s checklist for safe surgery. That subject wound up in one of the main plotlines of “ER”: the kidney transplant of Noah Wyle’s character, Dr. Carter.Last fall the plot of an episode of “Law & Order: SVU,” about mother-to-child transmission of H.I.V., stemmed from a meeting that Mr. Kaplan set up between an AIDS expert and writers from the show.“Our view is you don’t have to sacrifice entertainment value to be accurate,” Mr. Kaplan said.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','Reqall transcribes your utterances into text and collates them at . You can also have them sent to you by e-mail or as to your cellphone.If your reminder included a date or time, Reqall recognizes it as a calendar event. It can shoot a reminder to your cellphone 30 minutes in advance.Or, at your option, it can add these appointments to your calendar, your calendar in Outlook, or any calendar program that can subscribe to Web calendars (like ’s iCal or Now Up-to-Date).But wait, there’s more. If your utterance contains the word “buy,” then Reqall adds the transcript to a master shopping list.The Help screen wryly urges you to be careful. “I don’t buy your argument” also lands on the shopping list. At any time, you can call in to hear your shopping list read back to you, or request to have it text-messaged to your cellphone — a great feature when you’re out on errands.If your utterance begins with “remind,” “tell” or “ask,” Reqall can send the transcription to other people’s e-mail addresses or (if they’re Reqall members) cellphones. Great way to remind your spouse to do something so you can quit worrying about it.Almost everything else you dictate winds up on a general to-do list. At any time, Reqall can play back your list over the phone, send it to your phone as a text message, or display it as a message in your chat program. or you can just check it online. These to-do items also show up in your Outlook task list.You also get a daily summary, a beautifully formatted agenda and to-do list for the day (and the next few days), sent by e-mail. It looks like something a fancy executive secretary may have waiting on your desk each morning.There are even free Reqall programs for the and BlackBerry. They make it simple to dictate new items and reminders; you just tap to record (instead of making a phone call). They continually display your up-to-date shopping lists and to-do lists, too.Finally, they unlock a potentially amazing new feature of Reqall: location-based reminders. If your iPhone or BlackBerry has GPS, the Reqall program displays, at the top of the reminder list, items pertaining to your current location .For example, your phone knows that you’re at the mall, so it displays all of the errands you’re supposed to take care of there. Similarly, you could be reminded to visit a client when you’re in the neighborhood, or to hand in a form to the teacher when you’re picking up your offspring after school.In theory, this feature could be an astonishing time- and money-saver. In practice, it involves a fair amount of upfront work. For example, you have to begin by defining the Places in question, like Mall, Downtown, School and so on. Then you manually assign each to-do item to one of these Places. Finally, the Reqall program must be open and running on your smartphone.So why does the new Reqall represent positive economic news? Because it gives you so much utility at so low a price.Consider, for example, what happened to a rival service, . It, too, transcribes to-do items that you dictate by phone. It, too, got a lot of people very excited, especially because it was free.Then, last August, Jott gutted the free version, leaving the real goodies to the Pro service. Unhappy customers fled in droves. Last month, Jott closed down the free version altogether.Reqall waited to see how this all played out and avoided making the same mistakes. Happily, the huge majority of its features remain free to everyone — including, importantly, unlimited voice transcriptions.There is a Pro version, at $25 a year (or $3 a month). Some of its exclusive features aren’t deal-breakers: place-based (GPS) reminders; the ability to add new items (or mark them as done) by e-mail; the freedom to create new categories for your to-do items; and the ability to recall all Google Calendar appointments, not just those you’ve added in Reqall.You might really miss getting your reminders as text messages on your cellphone, however; the free version provides them only by e-mail, iPhone, BlackBerry and Web page.Thing is, those cellphone alerts are incredibly useful. Last weekend, for example, my wife was away, so I was operating solo with our three children. They had a particularly crammed schedule — four birthday parties, three classes, two playdates and a partridge in a pear tree — but Reqall’s text-message reminders, 30 minutes before each pickup or drop-off, kept me on schedule all weekend.Even so, the free version still offers enormous value. Just being able to dictate appointments into your phone, and have them pop up on your calendar automatically, is a magic wand for corralling the chaos of your life.There is room for improvement. There’s too much pausing in the various voice prompts and phone playback of lists. The transcriptions, provided by a combination of software and human typists, are good, but not 100 percent accurate; “Buy floor mats” turned into “Buy formats.” (Fortunately, the Web, iPhone, BlackBerry and e-mail reminders always offer a Play button so you can listen to the recorded audio of your original utterance.)Above all, as you’ve probably concluded already, Reqall’s sprawl can get confusing. The features differ depending on how you’re accessing the service — iPhone, Web, whatever. Different calendars (Google Calendar, Outlook and so on) offer different degrees of integration. Three different features — Memory Boost, Memory Jogger and EureQa — are all intended to make Reqall more than a to-do list; they supposedly use artificial intelligence to display just what you need to know, when you need to know it. But good luck trying to tell them apart.So what’s that positive economic news? First, that it’s still possible to find some truly useful, professional free tools on the Internet. (Even Reqall Pro is free for the first 45 days. And if you don’t explicitly state that you want to stick with the paid version, Reqall does the right thing and switches you to the free version at the end of that period.) And second, even the paid version is priced well: $25 a year.Reqall is great for capturing brainstorms, reminding yourself of birthdays and anniversaries, recording appointments, creating to-do lists on the go, checking your calendar from the road and issuing written instructions to your spouse or other overlords.The last time somebody offered so much value for so little money — well, I can’t reqall.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','Lee Konitz played his first line for laughs at the Village Vanguard on Tuesday night. The band had just conferred backstage, he said, sidling up to the microphone, “and we decided we weren’t going to play anything we know.” Of course that wasn’t really the case — the set ended up consisting mainly of familiar standards — but as he lifted his alto saxophone to his lips, the promise buried in the joke felt tangible enough. His unaccompanied prelude gave the impression of an interior monologue full of open-ended questions.For reasons that no one seems able to explain precisely, Mr. Konitz is headlining at the Vanguard this week for the first time since 1983. (Both he and the club’s owner, Lorraine Gordon, tried to account for the lapse with deflective humor.) Mr. Konitz, 81, is taking the opportunity to present two ensembles, each composed of responsive younger players.During the first half of the run, through Thursday, his cohort includes the German pianist Florian Weber, the American bassist Jeff Denson and the Israeli drummer Ziv Ravitz. As a trio these musicians perform under the name Minsarah. As a rhythm section they have recent experience with Mr. Konitz, appearing throughout his album “Deep Lee,” which was released last year on Enja.Mr. Konitz worked contentedly with the group in Tuesday’s first set, often answering to a scrap of suggestion from Mr. Weber. This interaction was most obvious in “Body and Soul,” which began as a saxophone and piano duet. After a languid bass solo Mr. Weber re-entered with an odd chord, venturing out on a harmonic limb. Without missing a beat Mr. Konitz joined him there, expanding on the idea before bringing the song home.The rhythmic fallback for Minsarah is a fluid eighth-note cadence, more streamlined than conventional swing. This led to some mild tensions in the set, as when Mr. Konitz, who has his own dry variation of swing, tackled “Invitation,” backed by Mr. Denson and Mr. Ravitz. Later, on “Alone Together,” Mr. Ravitz led several bright experiments with boppish propulsion, and the flashes of ebullience were tantalizing.Mr. Konitz gave Minsarah its own brief showcase: the trio played what sounded like “As the Smoke Clears,” a sparkling post-bop waltz by Mr. Denson. Here all three musicians gave in to effusiveness, with Mr. Weber exerting some classical technique. But their impact was diminished without Mr. Konitz, its outside conscience.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','There was nothing thrown away. We’d make soup out of the feet that was delicious. The gizzard, oh, man, that was choice meat, everybody loved the gizzard. We used to make featherbeds out of chicken feathers and geese, but we’d pick the goose without killing him: all you do is pick him up, yank the feathers off when he was still alive. He don’t mind it. It grows back in two or three months.In the summer, I took a washtub and put it on a little scaffold out near the chicken house and put burlap sacks around it to make it private. You’d fill that tub full of water in the morning, the sun would heat the water. I found a valve somewhere and I had a valve in the bottom of the tub, and that’s where we got the warm water. It held about 20 gallons. We might take one shower a week.When you got hungry, you could take a walk out in the mountains. There was always something to eat — all kinds of berries — and in the winter you got pecans, hickory nuts, walnuts. We used to eat bullfrog; that’s a delicacy. And we used to eat squirrels and rabbits.And possums. Ever eat a possum? Don’t try it. I’ll never forget the first possum I ate.My grandfather and his son invited me to have a possum dinner. You know how a possum looks at you with his teeth open?When they opened the oven door, the possum’s mouth was wide open. I took one bite out of that possum, that was the end of my possum career.Annie Pezzillo Moon, Mr. Moon’s wife, who has been a homemaker for more than 65 years, grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, one of 12 children — nine of whom survived — of Italian immigrants. Her father was a self-employed truck driver, she says, delivering fruits and vegetables in an operation controlled by the Mafia. (“If you didn’t pay off the Mafia, they shot you,” she says. “I guess my father paid.”) As a 13-year-old during the Depression, she sometimes sold shopping bags in the street. A few years later, she dropped out of high school to make 50 cents an hour working at Woolworth’s. She met her husband when she was 21 and he was a sailor on leave in New York.Our house wasn’t nice. All we had was three bedrooms and a kitchen. We never had a living room, we never had pictures on the walls. My sister slept at the foot of the bed, and I slept at the head of the bed.I went to the Madonna House on Cherry Street, where the nuns were; my father didn’t know this, but we needed food. The nuns gave me a ticket where I would get stale bread and stale cake.For Christmas we got fruit — maybe a case would break and my father gave us a piece of it. We never, ever got a present.At the Madonna House, they would put us on a bus and take us uptown to what we called the Rich Lady’s House. I don’t think it was a house, maybe it was a club house. They would have toys on tables, and you could take a toy from every table. And at the end, they would give us a coupon and there was an Endicott Johnson factory and we would get a new pair of shoes.My sister wanted to go roller skating one Christmas Eve. I wasn’t doing nothing. I said, Oh, heck, I’ll go. My sister met these two sailors and brought my husband over to me. He didn’t pick me up, I’ll make that clear. That was Dec. 24. We got married March 11.He was never on a pair of roller skates in his life. He fell down, they ran over his fingers. He said he was in love, so there was no pain.Merlin Nelson, a retired executive of American Machine and Foundry, lives in Manhattan. He grew up in San Bernardino, Calif., where his father, a onetime North Dakota farmer, worked in real estate. In 1933, when Mr. Nelson was 11, the real estate market had collapsed and his father bartered property in San Bernardino for an old house and some land in Salem, Ore., where he eventually started a chicken farm.We spent the Christmas of 1933 in this modest house there. Dad drove the 1930 Chevrolet out in the foothills toward the Cascade range, found a tree, put it on top of the car, found some mistletoe and picked some sprigs of that and some holly and then some white berries. They popped corn and then you got a needle and thread, and that combination of fruit and popcorn basically was our decoration.The next summer, we all went out every day helping restore this derelict house. We did things like lift the house up and put a basement underneath.You got the neighbors to help you. There was a team of Belgian horses nearby; they helped pull the barn closer to the house. Farmers in those days knew how to do all kinds of things. You didn’t need much cash — you did everything on a swap.My dad got the idea of having Rhode Island Red chickens, and they built a big coop for 200 or 300 chickens. He put in a trap nest system, with a board in front. If it laid an egg, I’d mark a plus on the board; if not, a minus, and after a while the poor ones were sold or eaten.The male chickens we wouldn’t keep, we’d sell them. I’d have to go and get one and chop its head off and pluck it. No big deal.Gladys Cole, a retired teacher and insurance investigator in Nokomis, Fla., was born in the middle of the Depression and grew up in Hartford. Her father was a mechanical engineer at a dairy there; her mother ran the boarding house where they lived. That meant keeping the tenants in linens and trying to make the house attractive when buying new things was not a good option.My mother never threw anything away. If a sheet got worn, she would cut it up and put it together with another sheet for the people who lived in the rooms — they didn’t care, they weren’t fussy about linens the way people are today. She mended towels, and when they frayed around the edges, she cut them up to make washcloths.The sheets that got old and were worn out in the middle, they cut strips from the sides, narrow strips, and tied the ends together and put it on the loom and wove blankets. If they wanted color, they added narrow strips of fabric from old dresses.You didn’t go to the store and buy clothing; you went to the 5-and-10-cent store, where you could buy fabric very inexpensively. You darned socks — you had a special little wooden ball you put inside the sock; you had cotton yarn. You could actually weave it so it didn’t show. You can’t do that today because the socks are synthetic; it doesn’t hold. My mother would make picture frames out of papier-mâché, and she cut pictures from the Sears catalog and then would make the frames to go around the pictures.They recycled everything, I tell you, everything.Anna Jane Nicholas, a retired arts and antiques appraiser in Oakmont, Pa., was luckier than many: While by her estimate, the families of 40 percent of her schoolmates could not afford to buy them shoes, her own father, who worked for United States Steel in Gary, Ind., kept his job through the Depression. Still, her family was always very careful with money, and her mother made the family’s clothing and curtains herself, and even re-covered the dining room chairs. She would also line a wooden box on the back porch with burlap and leave dinner in it for migrants searching for work.My mother would put food out there if she had an extra helping, then she would pull the blinds in the kitchen, because she didn’t want my brother and I to be watching. We discovered later there was a mark in the alley that indicated there was something on the back porch.My mother was a big-hearted woman. If she had a dessert, she always put a dessert out there. Sometimes they’d leave little notes: ‘Thank you, Ma’am.’One woman came along — I was surprised, it was usually men — she said, ‘Your gingerbread was lovely.’ She had some sort of piece of paper, it looked like a piece of a bag, just a few words, she said, ‘I always liked to bake gingerbread and your gingerbread was lovely.’Peter Holden worked for the New York City parks department for 35 years and still lives in Manhattan. He grew up in Raleigh, N.C., where his mother took a job as a cleaning woman for North Carolina State University when he was 7, after the death of his father, a brick mason. Mr. Holden’s home had electricity, but no water; water had to be drawn from a neighbor’s well or hauled from a stream several houses away.We lived high up on a hill above the southwestern campus, and we just worked together and shared. There was a great feeling of cooperation and help, even among the poor whites and the poor blacks. My grandfather had a farm and most any time he would come in, he would bring enough for two or three days — corn or tomatoes, whatever the season was — and we would share.We ate beans maybe four times a week, boiled in salt pork. On Saturday or Sunday somehow or other we would have a nice meal. My mother would bring back a steak, that might have been 25 cents a pound. She was paid $8 or $9 a week, but at that time you could have more than a whole week’s groceries with that and have a little money left over.She got laid off from the N.C. State job and there was just no jobs around Raleigh, so she went to Stamford — she had a sister living up there — and took my younger sister with her. I finished high school in 1934.My mother always told us you can be anything you want, don’t come here telling me you can’t be this and they won’t let me be that.That first year, I didn’t think I would be able to go to college, but my mother sent $10 from Stamford. She said, ‘Boy, you take this to St. Augustine’s and see if they don’t take this as a down payment, and if they don’t take it, you send my money back to me or I’ll come back to Raleigh and beat you all over.’So I went out and tried to discourage St. Augustine’s, but they took me. I graduated college in 1938.Like my mother said, if you really want to do something you can.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','New-music festivals are often nomadic, but the MATA Festival has wandered more widely than most, having started at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village and moved to Chelsea and Brooklyn in recent years. Now it has settled in at Le Poisson Rouge, the Greenwich Village club that in the last year has become an important part of the new-music circuit. It is a perfect home for the festival: the club’s programming philosophy overlaps with MATA’s mission of presenting young composers who write in any style that suits them.As a prelude to each of the festival’s four concerts, the first of which was on Tuesday evening, MATA is playing “The Hidden,” a 10-minute multimedia piece with a brash electronic score by Mike Vernusky and amusingly quirky quick-cut video images by Daniel Maldonado. The work was played twice; the second time Mr. Maldonado’s faded, stressed images imposed an almost narrative structure on it.The concert proper was performed by the Knights, a flexible chamber orchestra conducted by Eric Jacobsen. Its opening and closing pieces, though worlds apart in texture and other surface details, were propelled by similar Minimalist engines.Francesco Antonioni’s “Macchine Inutili” (2007) begins with a Minimalist keyboard ostinato, around which strings and winds weave increasingly assertive themes. A drummer playing a trap set periodically leaps in with syncopations, but between these episodes the ostinato remains.Andrew Hamilton’s “Product No. 1” (2009) is also driven by repetition. It begins as a chorale, sung and played by the orchestra, then repeated, again and again, each repetition introducing subtle changes. Instrumental flourishes are added. Words are dropped, syllable by syllable. By the end of the score the chorale has morphed into a vigorous ensemble movement in the style of a Baroque concerto grosso, with a couple of comic false endings.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','The impact of delaying or completely derailing medical innovations is hotly debated. While technology advocates talk of millions of premature deaths, some experts argue that the United States has been overspending on drugs and procedures using expensive medical devices with little to show for it. Most products are approved for sale long before the completion of thorough studies of their value in everyday use. “Our ability to model and predict the future of medical innovations is improving very slowly,” said Edward Tenner, a history of technology expert who is currently a visiting scholar at Princeton University.But Mr. Tenner, Wall Street analysts and venture capitalists agree that small health care companies are crucial sources of innovation for the industry’s larger players and one of the nation’s most likely sources of new employment as the economy recovers — if they survive the recession, that is. “Right now, access to capital is the story,” said Steven Rogers, an expert on innovation and entrepreneurship at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.Large companies are also feeling the downturn, of course. Hologic, a publicly traded leader in devices for women’s health care (from which InfraReDx recruited Steven L. Nakashige as president and chief operating officer last summer), cut sales projections for 2009 in January as hospitals put off purchases of its newest mammography systems. Intuitive Surgical and Hansen Medical, makers of expensive robotic surgery systems, have also slashed projections for sales of new equipment.But smaller companies like InfraReDx often face tougher choices when cash flow dries up. InfraReDx’s layoffs included the lead designer of the software that makes sense of the data the scanner acquires. Dr. Muller wants to refine that software, but the designer’s success had made him less vital than members of the team working on another project — development of a new scanner that takes ultrasound images at the same time it acquires the infrared scans. That scanner will be tested in human patients for the first time in April by Patrick Serruys, an internationally renowned cardiologist in Rotterdam.InfraReDx’s current scanner is the first approved by federal regulators for locating pools of mushy plaque that many researchers believe account for a high percentage of the 1.2 million heart attacks Americans suffer annually despite having no previous symptoms of heart disease. But researchers have yet to prove the safety and effectiveness of any of the possible methods for containing or removing such pools once they have been located. So far, neither Medicare nor private insurers compensate hospitals for using the scanner.Only five hospitals had acquired the big-ticket part of the technology — a $155,000 control and data display console — when the recession hit. Those early adapters soon cut way back on the single-use piece inserted in patients — a $2,400 catheter with a rotating tip that shoots infrared laser light into the wall of the artery and senses how much is reflected back. The system looks for a light pattern indicating the presence of mushy plaque behind a thin cap of fiber. Such formations, which have been called vulnerable plaque, can rupture and leak plaque into the artery. That, in turn, may quickly lead to a lethal clot.After selling no catheters for some weeks last fall, InfraReDx is now up to an average of more than one a day but is spending $30,000 a day, Dr Muller said. He added that four more hospitals had bought the console in recent months. Still, with $87 million already invested and no expectation of profits before 2011 at the earliest, the company anticipates the need to raise $10 million more this year.Robert McNeil, managing director of Sanderling Ventures, the investment firm that is the company’s largest shareholder and which organized the recent cash infusion, said he foresaw the economic bubble that burst last year. But, he said, there was no way to raise more money in advance to cushion companies like InfraReDx without granting new investors such favorable rates that the valuations of the companies would be drastically reduced.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','Mr. Lieberman is part of the new government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and his conservative Likud Party, which was sworn in late Tuesday. Mr. Lieberman leads the ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu, an important partner in the governing coalition and the third largest party in Parliament.As the new prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu has tried to strike a more conciliatory tone, promising to hold negotiations with the Palestinian Authority toward a permanent accord. But he has also stopped short of endorsing the two-state solution, putting the new government at odds with the United States and the European Union.Tony Blair, the special envoy of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers, which consists of the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia, said Wednesday that the peace process was in “very great jeopardy.” Speaking after talks at European Union headquarters in Brussels, Mr. Blair said, “We need a combination of strong political negotiations toward a two-state solution and major change on the ground,” according to The Associated Press.Palestinian officials reacted with alarm to Mr. Lieberman’s statements. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said by telephone that Mr. Lieberman had “closed the door on Annapolis and closed the door in the face of the international community.”Mr. Netanyahu’s office did not address Mr. Lieberman’s remarks but issued a statement saying that President Obama and Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had telephoned to congratulate the new prime minister, and that the conversations were “friendly.”The choice of Mr. Lieberman, an unsubtle and often unpredictable politician, as foreign minister had already aroused trepidation in Israel and abroad.Not known for diplomacy, he ran a contentious election campaign demanding loyalty as a condition for Israeli citizenship. Seen by many as racist, it was widely viewed as a broadside against Israel’s Arab citizens, a sense bolstered by the campaign slogan “Only Lieberman understands Arabic.”He once advocated bombing the Aswan dam in the event of a war with Egypt, and last year he suggested that Egypt’s president should “go to hell” if he did not want to visit Israel.Mr. Lieberman now seems to have moderated his stance toward Egypt, an important strategic ally of Israel’s. He said on Wednesday that “Egypt is an important element in the Arab world and in the world in general.” He added that he would “certainly be happy to visit Egypt, but I’ll also be happy to see Egypt’s leaders visit here.”Often contradictory and contrary in his positions, Mr. Lieberman, a resident of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, has said that he advocates the creation of a viable Palestinian state. Yet in January 2008 he pulled his party out of the last governing coalition, led by Ehud Olmert and the centrist Kadima Party, in protest against the Annapolis-inspired talks.Mr. Lieberman said on Wednesday that instead of Annapolis, Israel was committed to the “road map,” a 2003 American-backed performance-based peace plan that made the creation of a Palestinian state contingent on the Palestinians ending all violence and dismantling terrorist networks.Mr. Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, noted that the plan also called for Israel to freeze all settlement construction. “I’d really like to know, are we going to see a settlement freeze?” Mr. Erekat said.At an official ceremony welcoming the new Israeli leadership on Wednesday, the president of Israel, Shimon Peres, urged Mr. Netanyahu’s government to “invest great effort in advancing the peace process on every front.”“The outgoing government espoused the vision of two states for two peoples, which was initiated by the American government and accepted by the majority of countries in the world,” Mr. Peres said. “It is up to your government to decide the shape of the reality to come.”'"
"'09-04-02,'1','On Threadneedle Street, a narrow roadway normally plied by financiers and central bankers, cries of “Our streets!” and “Kill the bankers!” rang out, and protesters waved revolutionary flags and hanged bankers in effigy.But the throng began dispersing after the police and protesters clashed. At least 26 arrests were reported, although the BBC put the number at 63.Police officials said that more than 5,000 officers were deployed across London for the summit meeting; many of the officers seemed to have been assigned to the financial district. There were few glimpses of bankers there on Wednesday, save for the many men and women looking down at the march from the enclosed safety of their buildings.One who did venture out was Damien McElvanna, an emerging markets analyst at Citigroup who was laid off last week. Mr. McElvanna held high a handmade sign which read “Mark to Market,” in support of his view that banks must write down the full amount of their toxic assets.He was not ready to write off capitalism, though. “The system needs reform,” he said. “But there are few better options.”Most of the demonstrators intended their protest to remain peaceful. “We are not here to cause trouble,” said Kim Winter, 24, a student from Tottenham, in north London. “I am against any money-grabbers and capitalists who are not prepared to fight for the little people; we are the backbone of this country.”The march was largely the brainchild of Chris Knight, a self-described anarchist and an anthropologist at the University of East London, who has been the galvanizing public voice of a loose umbrella group of radical environmentalists, academics and left-wing activists known as the G20 Meltdown that spearheaded the protests.In his mid-60s, Mr. Knight comes across as a bit of a carnival barker, savvy enough to play to an audience brimming with anger at job losses and the excesses of capitalism. Wearing white makeup and a top hat and sunglasses, he led a crowd that began with about 10 students at the London Bridge train station and quickly became a rambunctious gathering of thousands that he addressed from the steps of the Royal Exchange.“I hereby announce that the money that they print in that building over there no longer exists,” he shouted as he threw fake April Fool’s banknotes into the air. “The revolution has begun.”'"
"'09-04-02,'1','PARIS — Workers at a Caterpillar plant in the French Alps let their bosses go Wednesday after holding them overnight in a dispute over their severance packages.The Caterpillar executives, jeered by union members, were escorted from the plant by police and union security, after being detained for more than 24 hours, according to an Associated Press reporter at the scene.The standoff ended after President Nicolas Sarkozy said in an interview with Europe 1 radio Wednesday that he would “save the site,” and that he would meet with union members. “We won’t abandon them,” he said.On Tuesday, striking workers at the plant detained five managers in a dispute over benefits to departing employees. They later let one manager go out of concern for his health.A Caterpillar spokesman, Jim Dugan, said Wednesday that no one had been hurt.“At a time when the company is making a profit and distributing dividends to shareholders,” Pierre Piccarreta, a representative from the C.G.T. union, on Tuesday told The Associated Press, “we want to find a favorable outcome for all the workers and know as quickly as possible where we are going.”'"
"'09-04-02,'1','MOSCOW — The leader of a prominent Russian human rights group was beaten by a group of men outside his Moscow home late on Tuesday night, in an attack that the police and colleagues say was very likely linked to his professional activities.Lev A. Ponomaryov, the director of the Moscow-based organization For Human Rights and a leader in the new political opposition movement, Solidarity, was the latest victim of violence in Russia against well-known people involved in human rights issues. Like the others, Mr. Ponomaryov was a frequent critic of the Kremlin.Mr. Ponomaryov was attacked by a group of men who were waiting for him when he arrived at his home, according to his organization’s Web site. He was hospitalized, then released, but he returned Wednesday for medical tests, said his daughter, Elena Liptser. “It is difficult to say who did this,” she said, “because he was involved in a number of human rights issues.”The day before the attack, the tires on Mr. Ponomaryov’s car were slashed.

"'09-04-02,'1','PESHAWAR, Pakistan — Missiles fired from what was believed to be an American drone struck a militant training camp in northwest Pakistan on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people in an attack apparently aimed at one of the area’s most important Taliban leaders, Hakimullah Mehsud, according to news reports, militants and an intelligence official.Mr. Mehsud escaped unhurt, the intelligence official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The attack was the first of its kind in the Orakzai region, which lies southwest of Peshawar and close to the border with Afghanistan, residents said.The region is strategically important because it borders other areas in Pakistan known for widespread Taliban activity.Mr. Mehsud is a prominent lieutenant of Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, who claimed responsibility for an assault this week on police cadets in Lahore, Pakistan.“We wholeheartedly take responsibility for this attack and will carry out more such attacks in the future,” Baitullah Mehsud said Tuesday, according to Reuters.“It’s revenge for the drone attacks on Pakistan,” he said. Without elaborating, he also claimed to be planning an attack on Washington.'"
"'09-04-02,'1','Mr. Sarkozy added that tougher regulation — he has called for a “global regulator” that would be able to reach inside the borders of the United States and other large nations to deal with international financial firms — is “nonnegotiable.”“The compromise has to come from all countries around the world,” he said. Saying he trusted Mr. Obama, Mr. Sarkozy said he did not want to point fingers about the crisis. But then, in a verbal jab he has used before, he added, “The crisis didn’t actually spontaneously erupt in Europe.”Chancellor of Germany rejected Mr. Obama’s plea for other nations to follow America’s lead and pledge greater fiscal spending to stimulate their economies. She said more spending was not worth debating. “That is not a bargaining chip,” she said, adding, by contrast, “Regulation is something that is in everyone’s interest.”By the time Mr. Obama ended his evening at Buckingham Palace and a working dinner for the leaders assembling here — representing a group as diverse as the established European powers and to , , and the — it appeared likely that countries would divide into two or three camps.The United States, and Japan will push for more immediate stimulus and “systemic risk” regulators that mostly operate within national borders; Germany and France will push the opposite position, probably with some support from the .That leaves and , among others, to exploit the division to play a significant role, though if tradition holds the major differences are likely to be smoothed out in wording in a final communiqué that each country interprets differently.Mr. Obama and Mr. Brown used a joint news conference earlier in the day to emphasize that differences with France and Germany were “vastly overstated.”Mr. Brown argued that the world had learned the hard lessons of a similar summit meeting here in 1933, which ended in failure. That outcome will not be repeated, Mr. Brown argued.Mr. Obama also met for the first time with President of China, the nation that is essentially being asked to bankroll much of the upward of $2 trillion in deficits the United States will run up this year to finance its recovery package, bailouts for Wall Street and , and two wars.But in a meeting that American officials described as “businesslike” Mr. Hu apparently said nothing about previous Chinese cautions that the country would have to be convinced that the United States had a long-term plan to bring down its deficits before it invested more heavily in American securities.In essence, the United States is pressing Europe and other nations to spend more now — when a coordinated stimulus could do the most good. But over the long term, Mr. Obama appeared to be preparing the world for a reshaped global economy in which the United States no longer was the ultimate export market for the world’s established and emerging powers.Speaking alongside Mr. Brown after the two men met, Mr. Obama warned against returning the United States to the habits of the past decade, and the twin trade and budget deficits they created.“The United States will do its share,” he said, “but I think that one of the things that Gordon and I spoke about is the fact that in some ways the world has become accustomed to the United States being a voracious consumer market and the engine that drives a lot of economic growth worldwide. And I think that in the wake of this crisis, even as we’re doing stimulus, we have to take into account our own deficits.”He said he and fellow leaders had an “enormous consensus” on the need to take bold steps to revive growth, and urged them to focus on what they can achieve at home. “If there is going to be renewed growth it can’t just be the United States as the engine, everybody is going to have to pick up the pace,” he said.But Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy laid out a different argument: that the United States had only now begun to understand the cost of poorly regulated free-market capitalism, and must now bow to the European model. “The foundation for this new financial must be laid now,” Mrs. Merkel said. “That is why we seem to be so tough.”The German chancellor, who is scheduled to met Mr. Obama one-on-one this weekend, rejected attempts to link the American and British demands for fiscal stimulus programs to the French and German agenda on regulations. Although Germany did carry out a reasonably large this year, it has not agreed to one for 2010.Mr. Sarkozy said France had made a gesture to the United States by rejoining the command structure of the alliance, and he implied that the United States needed to make a similar gesture in the regulatory arena.'"

Carefully remove the skins and seeds from the peppers and discard, holding the peppers over the bowl so you don’t lose any of the liquid. Cut into strips, place in another bowl and toss with salt, pepper and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Strain in the juice. If desired, mince or puree one of the garlic cloves and add to the peppers.2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Toast the bread, and rub with the cut clove of garlic. Brush with the remaining olive oil. Spoon on the peppers, and top with the goat cheese. Place on a baking sheet, and warm in the oven until the cheese has softened, about eight minutes.

"'09-04-03,'1','When the Yankees broke ground on their new stadium, the economy was in the middle of a hiccup. But that was then. Now, in the middle of a full-blown recession, some of the team’s ticket prices for 2009 look a little steep, the man in charge of the Yankees acknowledged on Thursday.“I think if anybody in any business had known where the economy was going to go, they would have done things differently,” Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s general managing partner, told reporters. “There’s no doubt that small amounts of our tickets might be overpriced.”Tickets for the premium Legends Suites run as high as $2,500. Some of those seats remain unsold, and the Yankees have been forced to market them aggressively.Still, Steinbrenner maintained that the vast majority of tickets remained affordable.“We understand that a lot of our fans are struggling,” he said. “But at the same time, I think baseball has always been an escape for people, and I think what we’re going to provide here is an unbelievable experience for thousands and thousands of fans.”For what it is worth, tickets for the Yankee and Mets games on Friday and Saturday will be far cheaper than regular-season prices. At Citi Field, prices will top out at $50, and net proceeds will go to charity. At Yankee Stadium, bleacher seats are 25 cents and grandstand seats $1.10, mimicking the prices when the original Yankee Stadium opened in 1923.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','“All in all, not a bad day’s work,” Mr. Prasad added.Mr. Obama’s own assessment? “Well, I think I did O.K.,” he said, when asked by a reporter during a news conference to rate his performance.In a premiere diplomatic tour that has already been scrutinized for every blemish, Mr. Obama has, thus far, gotten some not-so-good reviews — several European news outlets complained that he seemed aloof — and some raves. (President of called him “very helpful.”)Mr. Sarkozy was referring to Mr. Obama the mediator. For a tense hour on Thursday, Mr. Sarkozy and President of China were going back and forth about havens. In a large conference room at the Excel Center, surrounded by 18 other world leaders, the two men sniped at each other, according to officials in the room.Mr. Sarkozy wanted the big communiqué produced by the Group of 20 to endorse naming and shaming global tax havens, maybe even including and , which are under China’s sovereignty. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Hu was having none of it. He appeared angry that Mr. Sarkozy was effectively accusing China of lax regulation, and that the French leader was asking China to endorse sanctions issued by the , a club of wealthy nations that has yet to join.According to accounts provided by White House officials and corroborated by European and other officials also in the room, Mr. Obama escorted both men, one at a time, to a corner of the room, to judge the dispute. How about replacing the word “recognize,” Mr. Obama suggested, with the word “note?”The result: “The era of banking secrecy is over,” the final communiqué said. “We note that the O.E.C.D. has today published a list of countries assessed by the Global Forum against the international standard for exchange of tax information.” Hong Kong and Macao did not appear on the list.It was not a peace accord. But Mr. Obama had his first moment as a statesman.For the news conference that followed, Mr. Obama took pains to project a cheerful, humble image to a world still alternately enraged and befuddled by a financial crisis that originated with American subprime . He called on reporters from other countries — “foreign,” he said, before adding with a grin that they were foreign only to him. He bantered, dispensing with his propensity to and lecture.Answering a question from a reporter from China, Mr. Obama managed to acknowledge that he had to care most about how American workers and companies were affected by globalization, while still making the argument for why globalization was in America’s best interest.“Look, I’m the president of the United States. I’m not the president of China,” Mr. Obama said. Then he added, “It is also my responsibility to lead America into recognizing that its interests, its fate, is tied up with the larger world.”Mr. Obama said that if America neglected or abandoned poor countries, “not only are we depriving ourselves of potential opportunities for markets and economic growth, but ultimately that despair may turn to violence that turns on us.”“Unless we are concerned about the education of all children and not just our children, not only may we be depriving ourselves of the next great scientist who’s going to find the next new energy source that saves the planet, but we also may make people around the world much more vulnerable to anti-American propaganda.”In a rare show of emotion from the international press, many in the room stood up and cheered after Mr. Obama was done.If Mr. Obama gauged that crowd just right, he also had a few gaffes. The Obamas gave Queen Elizabeth II an loaded with songs and videos — this after weeks of grief from the British press over the 25 DVDs that the couple gave Prime Minister of Britain when he visited . (The Browns gave the Obamas an ornate penholder made from the timber of a Victorian antislave ship.)And , during the meeting with the queen, touched her, raising already high-brows over on this side of the pond. Buckingham Palace protocol says that commoners must not touch the queen, a dictate that foreign leaders in the past have ignored at their own peril. When Prime Minister Paul Keating of did the same thing back in 1992 the newspapers here called him the “Lizard of Oz.”But so high is the adulation that has been heaped on the Obamas from the normally caustic British press since their arrival that newspapers here said it was a sign of how well Mrs. Obama got along with the queen. In Mrs. Obama’s defense, the queen did touch her first, putting her arm around her as the two looked down at their feet, presumably talking about shoes.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','“They are the most active participants right now because they don’t have the burden of having to sell their old homes,” said James Diffley, a managing director at IHS Global Insight, a research firm. “You have a bunch of young people who were forced to sit on the sidelines because houses were so darn expensive, and now they’re starting to come in.”Real estate agents in Arizona, Florida, Nevada and other states hit hard by the bust say they began to notice rising interest among first-time buyers a few months ago, as prices dropped by more than a third.The addition of a tax credit of up to $8,000, part of the federal housing rescue plan passed in February, appears to be sweetening the pot for some of those buyers, while banks eager to unload foreclosed properties have also begun to offer incentives, like money for closing costs.“A lot of the banks have adjusted their thinking,” said John Ahlbrand, a real estate agent who with his wife, Ruth, owns ReMax Central in Las Vegas. “If they show they have the ability to repay — imagine that — then the bank helps.”In some areas, several families have pooled enough money to pay cash for homes. There are others, like Ms. Goldman, who saved enough to afford a traditional down payment and mortgage.But in many cases, agents and loan officers say, first-time buyers are receiving loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration, which allow for lower credit scores and a down payment of only 3.5 percent.Unlike the subprime mortgages doled out a few years ago to nearly anyone who asked, F.H.A. loans include strict income requirements. Buyers must document two years of employment history with pay stubs and W-2 forms that are verified by the underwriter, and they can typically borrow only around 31 percent of their income, or 43 percent when other debt is included.Andrea Heuson, a finance professor at the University of Miami, said the tighter restrictions should help ensure that people who buy can afford to pay what they owe — as long as they keep their jobs.A second risk is that these new buyers will walk away if property values continue to drop.Jennifer Vaughn’s development in Homestead is one of many where prices seem to fall by the day.A 26-year-old first-time buyer, Ms. Vaughn closed on a three-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse in November, paying $87,000 for the foreclosed property with an F.H.A. loan. The price was far below the $261,000 the house sold for in October 2006, but a few weeks ago, a townhouse with the same layout and fancier features sold for $75,000. And a third is about to close for $65,000, said Andy Lopez, a real estate agent at Keyes Company Realtors who found Ms. Vaughn her townhouse. So already, she appears to owe more than her home is worth. Not that she minds.“I’m going to stay for five or six years at least,” Ms. Vaughn said, “and I’m sure prices will go up somewhat by then.”She also has one of the recession’s safest job: she works for a collection agency. Ms. Vaughn said she could afford her $1,100 monthly payment, which includes taxes and insurance, and had already settled in.“It’s like the best feeling,” she said, admiring the arches in her doorways. “I never thought I could own.”Many other buyers are equally giddy.Julio Cesar Memeses, 45, a construction worker who is about to close on a three-bedroom home in West Phoenix for $50,000, said he and his family were thrilled to own “a piece of the American dream.” He said they were not worried about making their mortgage payments because the price was so low.Ms. Goldman, too, said she felt pleased. “It’s like, wow, I accomplished something,” she said.She said she had visited 200 properties before finding her current home late one night and deciding she had to have it. Sliding open the glass door to the pool on a sunny afternoon, she said: “I love the light. That’s what captured me.”Her daughter, Tiffany Munro, 14, stood beside her. “I’m, like, this is my house,” Tiffany said, looking skyward, and smiling. “I get to live here.”The house, a foreclosure in the Kendall neighborhood, needed a little work. Some lights had been removed, and the fence had been painted the colors of a rainbow. Tiffany insisted that the fence be repainted white (“like white picket fences in the old movies,” she said).Tiffany also asked permission to paint her bedroom wall with a mural of her own design — a drawing with dozens of small hearts.In all, Ms. Goldman said she spent about $6,000 fixing up the house. Like Ms. Vaughn, Ms. Goldman said she did not worry about declining prices because she had no plans to leave.Asked if she felt vindicated — rewarded for saving when so many others spent — she said no. “It’s sad that for me to buy a house, the economy had to be like it is,” she said.Sitting on her couch, overlooking the pool, Ms. Goldman said she feared that the drop in prices would draw back the same investors who created the housing bubble in the first place. Real estate agents said this was already happening, even as the wave of foreclosures and evicted families would most likely continue.“It’s not worth it in the end,” Ms. Goldman said, adding, “It’s unfortunate that I have to build my happiness on top of tears.”'"
"'09-04-03,'1','Once the Denver Broncos decided to get rid of the disgruntled quarterback Jay Cutler, they did not waste any time shipping him out of town. On Thursday, less than 48 hours after announcing that he was on the trading block, the Broncos traded Cutler to the Chicago Bears in a blockbuster deal, leaving the Jets and a host of other suitors empty-handed.The Bears were a surprise winner in the Cutler sweepstakes, but they paid an enormous price for a quarterback entering only his fourth year in the N.F.L. Chicago acquired Cutler and a fifth-round draft pick this year for quarterback Kyle Orton, the Bears’ starter at the end of last season; the Bears’ first-round draft pick in 2009 — No. 18 over all; their first-round pick in 2010; and a third-round pick this year.The Bears see Cutler, who played in last season’s Pro Bowl, as the answer to their longstanding offensive woes. They have not had a star quarterback since Jim McMahon, and apparently tired of a rotation of Orton and Rex Grossman that provided occasional flashes of promise — including a Super Bowl appearance in 2007 — but rarely produced an offense that could help the Bears’ defense. To protect Cutler, the Bears agreed to terms with tackle Orlando Pace, a seven-time Pro Bowl player for the St. Louis Rams.Still, the Bears are thought of as a conservative franchise, not given to headline-making deals. Therefore, the bounty paid for Cutler represents a significant risk for Bears General Manager Jerry Angelo. The Broncos now have two picks in the first round — the 12th and the 18th — and they could use one of those picks to select a quarterback or they could go into the season with Orton as the starter.For the Jets, the deal most likely means a training camp battle between Kellen Clemens and Brett Ratliff for the starting job, a prospect that the new coach Rex Ryan insisted last week that he was happy with. A Jets team spokesman said Thursday night that the team would not comment on the Cutler trade.'"

The extension was included as part of a $132 billion budget that Gov. David A. Paterson presented to legislators this week; the state has set aside $350 million for the program. Responding to similar incentives in neighboring states, New York first offered a 10 percent tax discount to local productions in 2004, and increased that rate to 30 percent last year.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','In its revitalization plan filed with the Treasury Department on Feb. 17, G.M. insisted that the risks of a Chapter 11 filing “outweigh the benefits of a bankruptcy based approach” to a restructuring.But on Monday, President Obama said the Feb. 17 plan was not sufficient, and said G.M. would have to seek bankruptcy protection if it did not take rapid steps to significantly reduce its $63 billion in debt. The government set a June 1 deadline for G.M. to complete its work.Mr. Henderson said Tuesday that a Chapter 11 filing was “certainly more probable” unless G.M. can reach agreements with bondholders and the United Automobile Workers union.“The change in language reflects the changed situation,” said a G.M. spokesman, Tom Wilkinson. “We still prefer to do this out of court, but if we can’t, we will do it in court.”In the progress report, G.M. outlined the savings it would obtain if it can complete a deal with the U.A.W. In February, it said the union had agreed to grant a series of concessions to lower its labor costs by up to $1.1 billion.But those steps have not been taken because the two sides have not agreed on a way to reduce the $20.4 billion that G.M. is required to pay into a health care fund for its blue-collar retirees.The U.A.W. has resisted completing a deal on that matter unless G.M. received concessions from its bondholders.Once a union agreement is reached, G.M., which spent $7.6 billion on hourly employee costs in 2008, forecast that its costs would drop to $6.5 billion this year and $5.4 billion in 2010.By contrast, G.M. spent $18.4 billion on hourly employee costs in 2003, before it began a series of restructuring moves. That figure included $5.7 billion in legacy costs, like pension contributions and retiree health care.By 2010, G.M. estimated that its legacy costs would be less than $1 billion, and could drop to as little as $100 million in 2014, when it expects its total hourly employee costs to be $4.8 billion.The company stressed the need to reach agreements with the union and its bondholders.“General Motors recognizes that its overall debt levels, especially given the current economic outlook, present significant risk to the success of its overall restructuring effort,” the automaker said in the progress report.G.M. also made another revision in the economic forecast it made to Congress in December, when it initially sought federal assistance. Back then, G.M. forecast that the nation’s gross domestic product would drop by 1 percent this year. It revised that to 2 percent in its February report, and said it now believed G.D.P. would drop by 2.6 percent.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','G.E. and Intel are pursuing what they expect to be a new multibillion-dollar market for using technology to automate and streamline the management of chronic conditions as populations age, both in the United States and in other nations.A handful of chronic ailments, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, account for up to 80 percent of health care costs, according to medical experts, and 7 of 10 deaths in the United States.Such chronic conditions, unless aggressively managed, worsen as people grow older. By 2030, about 71.5 million Americans will be 65 or older, the federal government estimates, up from 37 million in 2006.The current market for telehealth and home health monitoring in North America and Europe is $3 billion, according to Data Monitor, a research firm, and is projected to rise to $7.7 billion by 2012. But much of remote monitoring today is done by nurses and physician assistants, who call patients with reminders and advice.“Today’s systems just won’t scale,” said Louis J. Burns, general manager of Intel’s digital health group. “Health care has to go efficiently into the home, to enable elders to age in place with dignity.”The early market for their high-tech remote monitoring systems, the companies’ executives say, will be integrated health providers in the United States and abroad, insurers and specialized disease-management companies.Intel has sold systems to Advanced Warning Systems, a disease management company, and has pilot projects under way with several institutions ranging from the American insurer Aetna to a Scottish region of Britain’s National Health Service.Managing chronic conditions is typically not reimbursed in America’s fee-for-service system of health care, which pays for procedures, treatments and office visits but often not preventive care.But there have been some Medicare pilot projects to pay providers based on improved health outcomes for patients, mainly those with chronic conditions. And the Obama administration has pledged to accelerate that drive, promoting electronic health records, for example, as a way to measure the quality of care and health outcomes.Analysts and industry executives say the market for personal health care technology, like remote monitoring, could benefit considerably if reimbursement moves toward a pay-for-performance system.“If nothing changes, this is going to be a big business because of the demographics,” said Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive of G.E. “But the only way to really change health care is to have some metrics about outcomes and quality. And you need technology to do that.”'"
"'09-04-03,'1','Mr. Greenberg immediately found himself in a bitter long-distance fight with A.I.G.’s current, government-installed management. Even as he was testifying, A.I.G. accused him of playing a central role in A.I.G. Financial Products, the unit that caused the company’s collapse last year.“Hank Greenberg continues to deny his role in allowing F.P. to write the multisector credit-default swaps which sowed the seeds for A.I.G.’s troubles,” the company said, referring to the financial products unit. It went on to denounce Mr. Greenberg as evading questions and lacking credibility as a business strategist.“He refuses to acknowledge that he approved entry into the credit-default swap business, approved more than $40 billion of swaps written on C.D.O.’s containing subprime loans, and didn’t hedge or put up reserves against them,” the company said. Collateralized debt obligations are securities made from pools of loans and other forms of debt.“We don’t understand how he can be viewed as having any credibility on any A.I.G. issue.”The 83-year-old Mr. Greenberg has been locked in a bitter feud with his former company for months. A.I.G. is suing a company controlled by Mr. Greenberg, Starr International, seeking the return of 290 million shares of A.I.G. stock, as well as $4 billion that Starr received from selling other A.I.G. shares. The trial in that suit is scheduled for June.But the mutual recriminations on Thursday were the most vitriolic and expansive yet.Testifying for more than three hours, the former A.I.G. chairman cast himself as a rescuer rather than a villain. He attacked the strategy of both the current Treasury secretary, Mr. Geithner, and his predecessor in the Bush administration, Henry M. Paulson Jr.“The failed plan ignored the key value driver of A.I.G.: its people,” Mr. Greenberg said in his prepared remarks. “Since the day the Treasury announced its plan to liquidate A.I.G., value has been destroyed because A.I.G.’s people and their relationships — A.I.G.’s business — are leaving.”Mr. Greenberg also said that Edward M. Liddy, whom the government recruited as A.I.G.’s chief executive when the company was being bailed out last fall, “doesn’t have the background for what needs to be done.”Mr. Greenberg asserted that he would have reduced or at least hedged A.I.G.’s exposure to credit-default swaps in 2005, when A.I.G.’s credit rating was reduced.“A.I.G.’s business model did not fail; its management did,” he asserted. That provoked another scornful counterattack from his former company, saying that Mr. Greenberg’s assertions were “implausible,” “not grounded in reality” and at odds with his track record of not hedging A.I.G.’s bets on credit-default swaps.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','Bread and circuses. Shrimp and pennant races. Luxury boxes and follies. Laugh and cry.And yet, like salmon swimming upstream or birds migrating on ancient flyways, real fans will find a way to the ballparks, pulled by the life-affirming force of baseball coming around again in the spring.Fans will make their pilgrimage Friday night and Saturday, harking back to the old days when they spent a few dollars for a couple of hours of baseball.Once upon a time, from 1923 through 1957, New York actually had three ballparks, where fans not only learned about baseball but about life, and sometimes even about architecture.“There was a grandeur to the original Yankee Stadium that had a profound impact on a young boy from Queens,” recalled Alan Taxerman, a lawyer who saw his first game in Ebbets Field in Brooklyn. Built in 1913, with an Italianate rotunda behind home plate, Ebbets Field had a concave wall in right field that produced odd ricochets.In Harlem sat the Polo Grounds, rebuilt in 1911 after a fire. It was tucked by necessity into the side of Coogan’s Bluff, built in a horseshoe contour, with very short foul lines in right and left field. The upper deck protruded over the playing field, with 250-foot pop-fly home runs sometimes hitting the notorious overhang.Taxerman’s dad soon took him to the House That Ruth Built, later called (by Red Barber) the Big Ballpark in the Bronx.“The Stadium seemed impossibly high, like a Greek temple or the Colosseum in ancient Rome,” Taxerman recently recalled via e-mail.It was the first time he had ever heard the word facade, in reference to the 15-foot copper arches on the third deck of the majestic Stadium.“To any normal 8-year-old boy, these esoteric terms would have seemed strange and foreign,” Taxerman wrote. Mickey Mantle, not familiar with the word, famously mispronounced it “fa-KARD,” but he surely could rattle the ramparts with missiles off his bat.“Below the facade and the lower stands lay the pitch, the most beautifully manicured lawn I have ever seen, and in center field, in front of the 461 sign, stood three monuments, Ruth, Gehrig and Miller Huggins, right on the field,” Taxerman wrote. “These were innocent times, and I really asked my dad if they were buried there.”He added: “And outside the field on River Avenue stood the El and a series of stores, bars, restaurants, bowling alley, which to a youngster seemed to strongly suggest that this was Yankee Town. This was a city devoted to the most famous team in all of sports. We knew what that meant, and if we seemed arrogant about it, surely, it was an arrogance based upon fact. It made us proud.”The ballpark as source of wonder. The ballpark as the center of the agora, the marketplace. Ballparks had nothing to do with oval stadiums that housed football games. Cookie-cutter stadiums for football and baseball were a phase, a trend, now discredited. Ballparks were for 77, now 81, home games a season, a gathering place for hopes and fears.“I hate to go — but I hate to stay,” a fan muttered late one night in the rickety old Polo Grounds in 1962. The Giants and the Dodgers had split for California after the 1957 season, and the Polo Grounds was briefly resurrected for the raffish Mets. When Shea opened in 1964, female ushers wore fancy outfits, as if they were BOAC stewardesses flying to London. That touch did not last long. Not in Queens.Shea was a dump the day it was built. But at the moment, some Mets patrons are screaming about the thousands of dollars they have spent for outfield seats from which they cannot see the warning track. And prices are even more grotesque at the new Yankee Stadium, with tickets costing a minimum of $350 downstairs, along the infield.Have the Steinbrenners of the Bronx and the Wilpons of Queens succumbed to hubris in building smaller palaces catering to the rich, with luxury boxes and waiter service? When Fred Wilpon sat on his father’s lap in Ebbets Field, to save the price of a ticket, one did not order a hot dog from a waiter.Both new stadiums retain a note of reality from the mundane clatter of elevated trains, a reminder that real people go to work on the 4 train in the Bronx and the 7 train in Queens.At least both teams remained in their neighborhoods. The Yankees never followed through on their threats to escape to the West Side of Manhattan or, gasp, New Jersey. But the price was putting the new stadium on a sweet little park that used to house joggers and tennis players. Mayor Bloomberg’s administration keeps saying it will replace the vanished parkland with vest-pocket parks on tops of garages. The children are waiting.The Yankees have done the right thing in recognizing that the name Yankee Stadium outweighs the income from some transient corporation. The Mets’ new playpen is, for the moment, named Citi Field, after a bank that hustled its way into insolvency and has been bailed out by you and me.The Mets’ stadium has been criticized by Paul Goldberger in The New Yorker as being too pretentious for the tacky auto-repair shops of this outer-borough locale. As a Queens boy, I respond with the immortal words of Steve Martin: “Well, excuuuuse me.”Ballparks are supposed to be out there with the people. In Flatbush, Brooklyn, you emerged from the subway into a rabbit warren of hot dog stands and candy stores and other utilitarian outlets. Real life.Now we have these swanky new joints. The Mets and the Yankees have made their deals with the devil, the luxury-box trade. And for an opening attraction, they bring in teams from the two grand old ballparks of America. Play ball.'"
"'09-04-03,'1','Hopes that the worst days of the financial crisis are retreating lifted stock markets on Thursday after government leaders pledged huge new financial rescues and a regulatory group moved to rewrite financial regulations and accounting rules.A broad rally washed from Asia to Europe and finally to Wall Street, and the major indexes rose close to 3 percent. Global leaders at the Group of 20 meeting in London pledged $1.1 trillion in loans and guarantees to shore up struggling nations, a move that helped lead the rally overseas.The Dow Jones industrial average, which was nearing 6,500 points less than a month ago, briefly traded above 8,000. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended at its highest point since mid-February.Giving the market momentum was a change to accounting rules that could make some banks look more profitable on paper. The Financial Accounting Standards Board voted to ease mark-to-market standards, giving companies more leeway in valuing mortgage-backed securities.Although the rule change was widely expected, the decision helped sustain a rally that has raised the major averages more than 20 percent from their low points of March 9. Over the last month, investors have pinned their hopes on faint signs of improvement in retail spending, home sales, consumer spending and orders for durable goods.'"

"'09-04-04,'0','AMERICAN taxpayers today own a significant chunk of Citigroup, American International Group and other financial institutions, thanks to the Troubled Assets Relief Program. Therefore, they also own, indirectly, a slice of the toxic assets that reside on the balance sheets of those institutions. And now taxpayers will end up owning even more of these troubled assets, thanks to the Public-Private Investment Program recently announced by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. The question, though, is will they have the chance to benefit from these investments on the same terms as Wall Street? Probably not. Unless we take certain steps.The new Treasury plan is intended to encourage “private money” to buy toxic financial assets. Investors will have to put up relatively little of their own money, because most of the purchase price will be covered by government loans at low interest rates. The private money will come mainly from companies like the one I work for, sophisticated institutional investors like pension funds, university endowments and hedge funds, which rightly sense a potentially profitable investment opportunity.Treasury’s announcement was primarily aimed at these institutions, with only passing reference to “retail” investors — that is, individual investors who own shares in mutual funds and the like. But individual investors should be allowed to buy toxic assets for exactly the price that will be paid by big institutions. In fact, robust retail participation is critical to the success of the program. The A.I.G. bonus controversy shows how angry Americans are at the idea that the financial elite are profiting from taxpayer money. Letting the average investor play on the same terms as the professionals could alleviate some of that anger.The attractiveness of the investment opportunity in the Treasury program depends entirely on the purchase price. Buyers and sellers are playing a zero-sum game. If the investors buy cheap, they make money, but the financial institutions, including their taxpayer shareholders, take big losses. If the investors buy dear, they lose money but the financial institutions do much better.Nobody knows how the game will turn out, but it is plausible to assume that some smart investors will make a lot of money. That is what happened in the 1990s, when private investors bought distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created to clean up the savings and loan crisis. This time around, it would be wise to see to it that the profits are spread more widely.Enabling effective participation by retail investors will require ingenuity. First, these investments carry big risks, and it will be imperative to ensure that those risks are understood by all investors. Second, it’s not readily apparent how we could get individual investors involved. Most mutual funds, for example, probably couldn’t buy toxic assets, because their regulations say that their customers must be able to sell their shares quickly — and selling a toxic asset is not a quick process. Private investment partnerships, like hedge funds, can buy the toxic assets, but they cannot be offered to the general public. Exchange-traded closed-end funds also are no panacea since investing in these toxic assets requires a long-term commitment of capital and doesn’t lend itself to daily valuations and daily trading.'"
"'09-04-04,'0','When Congress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, it gave older Americans a broad right to sue for discrimination. But the Supreme Court has narrowed that right with a 5-to-4 ruling that union members cannot file lawsuits when their contracts call for arbitration of age-discrimination claims. The decision, which reversed the court’s precedents, sets back antidiscrimination law significantly.A group of New York City building-services workers sued after they were moved from positions like night lobby watchman to less desirable assignments, including cleaning jobs. The workers charged, among other claims, that they had been reassigned based on age.The contract negotiated by the workers’ union required employees to submit claims of discrimination to binding arbitration. The workers sued in federal court, asserting that their job reassignments violated the federal age-discrimination statute and other laws. The employer moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that the union contract required that the claims be arbitrated.The Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied the motion, citing a 1974 Supreme Court case, Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Company. It held that collective bargaining agreements cannot waive workers’ rights to sue under federal antidiscrimination laws.The Supreme Court reversed, in an opinion by Justice Clarence Thomas. In the majority’s view, the union agreed to the arbitration clause, and it was binding on all of its members.The four dissenters, in an opinion by Justice David Souter, had by far the better argument. Rights that Congress grants, they argued, cannot be waived in a collective-bargaining contract. Union contracts represent group rights — and unions often sacrifice the interests of a minority of their members for the good of the whole.'"

"'09-04-04,'0','Mr. Summers, a former president of Harvard University, was Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. He appeared before large Wall Street companies like Citigroup ($45,000), J. P. Morgan ($67,500) and the now defunct Lehman Brothers ($67,500), according to his disclosure report. He reported being paid $10,000 for a speaking date at Yale and $90,000 to address an organization of Mexican banks.While Mr. Obama campaigned on a pledge to restrict lobbyists from working in the White House, a step intended to reduce any influence between the administration and corporations, the ban did not apply to former executives like Mr. Summers, who was not a registered lobbyist. In 2006, he became a managing director of D. E. Shaw, a firm that manages about $30 billion in assets, making it one of the biggest hedge funds in the world.“Dr. Summers was not an adviser to or an employee of the firms that paid him to speak,” Mr. LaBolt said.He added, “Of course, since joining the White House, he has complied with the strictest ethics rules ever required of appointees and will not work on specific matters to which D. E. Shaw is a party for two years.”A review of hundreds of pages of financial disclosure forms on Friday evening offered an extensive portrait of the wealth of top officials in the Obama administration. The forms detail the salaries, bonuses and investments of the president’s circle of advisers, many of whom took deep pay cuts from the private sector and sold their companies to work at the White House.David Axelrod, who was the chief campaign strategist to Mr. Obama and now serves as a senior adviser to the president, reported a salary of $1 million last year from his two consulting firms. Over the next five years, according to his disclosure form, he will get $3 million from the sale of the two firms, which provide media and strategic advice to political clients. He listed assets of about $7 million to $10 million, and reported a long list of Democratic clients and a few corporate concerns, including AT&T and the Exelon Corporation, a nuclear energy company.The disclosure forms also shed further light on the compensation received by a top Obama aide who previously worked for Citigroup, one of the largest recipients of taxpayer bailout money. The aide, Michael Froman, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, received more than $7.4 million from the company from January 2008 to when he joined the White House this year.That money included a year-end bonus of $2.25 million for work in 2008, which Citigroup paid him in January. Such bonuses have prompted political controversy in recent months, including sharp criticism from Mr. Obama, who in January branded them as “shameful.”The White House had previously acknowledged that Mr. Froman received such a year-end bonus and said he had decided to give it to charity, but would not say what it was.The administration said Friday that Mr. Froman was working on giving the $2.25 million to a combination of charities related to homelessness and cancer, which took the life of his son this year.The remainder of Mr. Froman’s earnings from Citigroup included deferred compensation and bonuses for work performed in prior years, as well as a $2 million payment for waiving his carried-interest stake in several private equity funds.The White House said Mr. Froman decided to take the buyouts to avoid having to recuse himself from foreign-policy issues related to the funds’ investments, like India infrastructure, which means he would be taxed at ordinary income rates on the money.Millionaires work in a variety of positions across the administration, and they include Desirée Rogers, the White House social secretary. Ms. Rogers, a close Chicago friend of the Obama family, reported income of $2.3 million last year. She earned a salary of $1.8 million from People’s Gas & North Shore Gas, along with three other sources of income from serving on insurance company boards.Thomas E. Donilon, the deputy national security adviser, reported earning $3.9 million as a partner at the Washington law firm O’Melveny & Myers. His disclosure form says major clients included Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Apollo Management, a private equity firm in New York that specializes in distressed assets and corporate restructuring.Mr. Donilon is also entitled to future pension payments from Fannie Mae, where he worked from 1999 to 2005.'"
"'09-04-04,'0','After another game against the Cubs on Saturday, the Yankees head to Baltimore to open the regular season at Camden Yards. After last year’s letdown, there is no need for Girardi to look further ahead.The Yankees closed the old Stadium — still standing next door, with an oddly blank marquee up top — by failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1993. While other teams scrimped last winter, the Yankees splurged, dishing the three richest contracts of baseball’s off-season to Mark Teixeira, C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett.The stately new park is designed to evoke the grandeur of its predecessor, starting with the bronze eagle medallions high above the main entrance. The Yankees’ mandate, then, is unchanged. They expect their home to be booked for October.“This franchise wants to win,” Jorge Posada said. “We want to win now.”The team will go about it in extreme comfort. The clubhouse is cavernous, and the fresh start allowed the players to realign their lockers, which sit beneath a replica of the famous facade, back-lit in blue. Mariano Rivera has a stall in the middle of the room, on the left, and his setup men fan out toward the back — the closer and his court.Across the oval-shaped room are the lockers of the five starting pitchers, all in a row. Burnett is first, followed by Andy Pettitte, Chien-Ming Wang, Joba Chamberlain and Sabathia.“I’ve got all my fellas around me,” Chamberlain said. “All the starters. Mo copied us.”On the right side of every locker is a mounted ThinkPad laptop with the screen facing out, the choice of background wallpaper reflecting a slice of personality. José Veras has a snapshot of himself with Rivera, Burnett a scene from the action movie “300,” Sabathia a Michael Jordan logo. Wang’s home page is the Chinese site for Yahoo.com.Teixeira said he had not even tested his machine, which displayed only practice times for a sample game in June. He spoke excitedly about the size of the clubhouse, where two plush couches flank a giant interlocking N.Y. on the carpet. But other factors are more important.“No. 1, I want to be able to see the ball well; that’s the most important thing in any stadium, especially if it’s going to be your home for a long time,” Teixeira said. “And No. 2 would be playing surface.”Teixeira and Posada approved of the dirt, which stayed firm despite the rain. And while there is much less foul territory behind the plate — the screen is 20 feet closer than it was in the old Stadium — there was an unmistakable similarity with the outfield dimensions the same.“It seemed like we were in the old Stadium, to tell you the truth,” Posada said. “All the surroundings are different, but to me it was still the same.”Teixeira joked that he swings and misses a lot more here than he did across 161st Street. His first at-bat was deflating, a strikeout with Derek Jeter on third and one out. Some fans booed.Jeter was the Yankees’ leadoff batter Friday, and he doubled down the left-field line in the bottom of the first. He was less successful in the field, where Jeter, who turns 35 in June, will face increasing scrutiny this season.The Cubs’ first hitter, Aaron Miles, rolled a grounder just past Jeter’s right. With two outs in the second, Joey Gathright bounced one past Jeter’s left and into center field. Miles promptly doubled home two runs.But Jeter had another hit in his next at-bat, a reminder of his track record in the Bronx. At the time, the vivid and enormous center-field video board cited Jeter’s record for hits at the original Yankee Stadium.More than any other Yankee, Jeter seemed to cherish that stage, where the lights, he often said, made him feel as if he were performing on Broadway. That spoke to a certain intimacy that might be lost at the new Stadium, which Jeter said would be the best in the world for a different reason.“It’s just huge,” he said. “I mean, it’s got everything you could think of. I don’t know what else you’d put in a stadium.”'"
"'09-04-04,'0','While Mr. Obama’s Democratic allies on Capitol Hill adopted much of his budget template, the farm subsidy limits never got off the ground.In the House, farm-state lawmakers told the Budget Committee chairman, Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, that they would not support any budget plan that tinkered with hard-fought agreements they struck in passing last year’s omnibus farm bill.And in the Senate, Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, chairman of the Budget Committee and an ardent defender of agricultural interests in his state, quickly discarded the president’s proposal.Even some of the toughest critics of farm subsidies would not endorse the president’s approach.Representative Ron Kind, a Wisconsin Democrat and a major advocate of cutting subsidies, has been working with the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, to revamp Mr. Obama’s plans.“There’s more that we can do to tighten up these programs,” said Mr. Kind, who is urging an eligibility cap of $250,000 in income.Other critics of farm subsidies said that the initial White House proposal, while bold, missed the mark.“It cast a cloud over the whole gesture to have something like that,” said Ken Cook, the president of Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that has energetically lobbied to reduce farm subsidies.Mr. Cook suggested that the administration had done a more careful job in laying the groundwork for initiatives on climate change and health care. “In this case,” he said, “it was thrown out there and those of us on the reform side of the agenda really found ourselves in an awkward position.”Amendments to adopt some of Mr. Obama’s limits were defeated by the Budget Committees in both chambers.Congressional Democrats and the Obama administration said that the budget resolutions adopted Thursday protected Mr. Obama’s top priorities, on health care, energy and education, while also reducing the deficit.But administration officials also conceded that the president’s farm proposal was far more ambitious than lawmakers were willing to endorse. The officials said they had not given up on the idea of ending government subsidies for the wealthiest farmers just as they plan to end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.“We look forward to continuing the conversation with the leadership and the relevant committees and the stakeholders in finding the best way to support rural America and get some savings and efficiencies out of agricultural programs,” said Kenneth S. Baer, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.In the Senate, Mr. Conrad did help with approval of a budget provision that would save $350 million over five years by making modest cuts to crop insurance programs, but it was far short of the $2 billion in cuts to insurance programs that Mr. Obama had proposed.As part of his budget plan, Mr. Conrad also expressed a willingness to consider “targeted savings in agriculture” down the line.As usual, party lines in the debate over farm subsidies were blurred in some cases by geographic interests.In the House, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, joined Representative Earl Blumenauer, Democrat of Oregon, in offering an amendment to cap eligibility for farm subsidies at $250,000 in family income. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, offered a similar amendment in the Senate. Both were defeated.In last year’s farm bill, the income eligibility cap was reduced to $750,000 in farm income or $500,000 in non-farm income, from $2.5 million.But even if the Obama administration succeeds in getting a $250,000 cap enacted, it is unclear that it will save much money.In 2007, when the Bush administration proposed a $200,000 income cap, a study by the Agriculture Department found that fewer than 2 percent, roughly 38,000 of more than 2.6 million farm proprietors or landlords of farm properties, reported gross income of more than $200,000 and received subsidy payments.One of those who studied the plan was Keith Collins, then the department’s chief economist and now an industry consultant. “There’s just not going to be a lot of savings on a $250,000 hard cap,” Mr. Collins said.'"
"'09-04-04,'0','That led Bob Gale, a local gas station owner, to resign as the head of a commission committee. His subsequent complaint to Ontario’s integrity commissioner resulted in a recommendation last month that the parks commission review its decision.That so much money could go to one company in an noncompetitive process has led many here to question the coziness of the parks commission with local businesses.“I had one guy from the outside say to me: ‘Thank God, you’re breaking up the old boy’s club,’ ” Mr. Gale said. The Maid of the Mist owes its unusually longstanding lock on Niagara Falls’ tourist boat trade partly to topography. The fierce rapids to the north and the falls to the south make conventional boat navigation in or out of the base of the falls virtually impossible. A small area of land on the Canadian side is the only location suitable to dock boats overnight and store them in the winter.That land belongs to the Niagara Parks Commission, which was set up in 1885 by the Province of Ontario to clean up the freak shows and garish attractions that were encroaching on the falls.From the beginning, the commission has not financed its operations with taxpayer dollars. Instead it relies on revenue from the Maid of the Mist lease payments and several attractions the commission operates directly.Jim Williams, chairman of the commission and a former senior federal official, said that Maid of the Mist asked to start lease renewal talks in late 2004. (The current agreement expires in November.) By April 2008, the commission approved a 25-year renewal.During an interview just before the release of the integrity commissioner’s report, Mr. Williams emphasized that because Maid of the Mist holds only a lease, the commission did not have to request bids — as is required for service or procurement contracts.The integrity commissioner’s report recommended that the parks commission review its decision, but concluded the commission did not act improperly.“There’s been a partnership with the Maid of the Mist, its current owner-operators and its predecessor for well over 100 years,” Mr. Williams said in a commission restaurant, its windows icing over with spray from the falls. “There’s no other model. You’re asking for someone to say, ‘We want you to build the space station.’ Well, there’s only one of a kind.”Another deciding factor in granting the renewal, he said, was a provision in the current contract — though neither Mr. Williams nor the Maid of the Mist would disclose what the clause stipulated, or any other aspect of the lease. Mr. Williams said the clause meant the commission would have run the risk of a lawsuit and “significant financial liability” if it had selected another operator.Two letters from Ripley Entertainment transformed a routine lease renewal into a controversy.Ripley, owned by the Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison, who has other tourist holdings in Niagara Falls, asked for a copy of the Maid of the Mist lease under freedom of information laws. It also asked about submitting its own offer.Those letters reached the commissioners only shortly before the final vote on the new lease last year. Mr. Gale, whose term on the commission expired in February, said the letters made him realize that the renewal might not have been handled properly. He asked the commission to delay its decision.Mr. Gale, whose wholesale diesel fuel customers include Maid of the Mist, said that his objections were not directed at that company or the family that owns it.“This is about process,” Mr. Gale said in a cluttered office far from Niagara Falls’ tourist zones. “This process has been dirty for the people of Ontario.”After the commission approved the lease anyway, Mr. Gale resigned in protest as chairman of the marketing and events committee and subsequently filed the complaint with the integrity commissioner. His appointment as a commissioner expired in February.The complaint soon caught the attention of William M. Windsor, a former trade magazine publisher. Mr. Windsor had clashed in federal court in Atlanta with the Maid of the Mist in 2005: the boat operator won an injunction prohibiting Mr. Windsor’s son’s company from selling tickets to the Maid of the Mist through its online ticket brokerage.Although Mr. Windsor has no experience in tour boat operations, he soon filed a request with an Ontario court for a judicial review of the lease renewal. If successful, he hopes to bid on the business, perhaps with a partner.“I love the idea of getting that business because I don’t like, don’t trust Maid of the Mist,” Mr. Windsor said from his home in Georgia.Christopher M. Glynn, the president of Maid of the Mist and son of its owner, James Glynn of Niagara Falls, N.Y., said he was confident the lease renewal would stand. But he is disturbed by suggestions that his family owes its lease to connections or influence.“Nothing went on,” he said of his company’s dealing with the commission, sitting in the company’s Canadian office, decorated with photos of royalty from Europe and Hollywood stars aboard Maid of the Mist boats. “Everybody wants to own the Maid of the Mist. Who wouldn’t? But they don’t. I’d like to own the New York Yankees.”A confidential briefing document prepared for the commissioners and leaked to several reporters shows that Maid of the Mist currently pays the parks commission 15 percent of its gross revenue and other fees.In 2006, according to the document, Maid of the Mist had gross revenue in Canada of 17.6 million Canadian dollars and returned 4.9 million Canadian dollars in rent and other charges. The new lease, the document indicates, has a sliding rate of up to 17.5 percent depending on revenue. Mr. Glynn declined to specify revenue but said that the American branch of the company accounted for another 25 percent of its business.Exactly what will happen next is unclear. Ontario’s ministry of tourism, which oversees the Niagara Parks Commission, has started an audit and a review of the commission’s tender practices. In a statement, the parks commission promised to take the integrity office’s advice and review its earlier decision, without committing to any change.“N.P.C. will comply fully with this recommendation, and will continue to apply the principles of good faith actions and sound business judgment as it undertakes these deliberations,” the statement said.'"
"'09-04-04,'0','“It shows you that a lot more people are hurting,” Mr. Bickford said. “Even with the more restrictive law in place, the filings are back up to the prelaw level.”The law, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, made it more difficult for consumers to erase their debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Those who earn more than their state’s median income are now required to first pass a means test — based on income, living expenses and other factors. If they are deemed able to repay some debts, they are then forced to pursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which sets up a three- or five-year repayment plan and makes it more difficult to get a fresh start.“In a nutshell, bankruptcies happen because financial distress happens,” said Jack Williams, resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute and a bankruptcy professor at the Georgia State University College of Law. “It is hubris to think that we can manage such a complex system by inserting a means test here, a credit counseling requirement there.”Keith and Leola Gladney of St. Charles, Mo., filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy last summer. Their problems began to unfold in September 2007, when Mrs. Gladney, who was pregnant, was put on bed rest and could no longer work as a marketing assistant. They lost her income, though she did receive short-term disability payments. In January 2008, Mr. Gladney, 38, lost his job as a manager of an auto parts store. Within months, the couple had fallen behind on the mortgage payments on their home, which they bought for $130,000 in 2004.They lost the house around the time their son was born in March 2008, and the couple had to move into a hotel with their newborn. Though they eventually found an apartment to rent, the Gladneys decided to file for bankruptcy. Adding to their troubles, Mrs. Gladney, 37, found out last November that she did not have a job to return to.“It is really stressful for me because I thought I would find another job,” she said.Mr. Gladney said he was hopeful that he was close to receiving a job offer on one of the 30 or so résumés he sends out daily. “We are trying to keep our heads up and keep a positive attitude and hope things will get better,” he said. “We go to church every Sunday. We haven’t changed our routine.”If history is any guide, the number of bankruptcy filings will increase through this year, but will not jump as much as they did from February to March because that tends to be a popular time for filing, Professor Lawless said. But if legislation is passed that would allow bankruptcy judges to modify some primary mortgages, filings could rise significantly.The House has approved a version of that so-called cramdown legislation, but the Senate did not have enough votes to overcome a filibuster by Republicans, who want the modifications to apply to a much smaller pool of loans. The Senate Democrats are working on a compromise, and say they hope they can bring the bill to the floor after Congress returns from recess on April 20.The power to modify home mortgages would probably lead many more people to pursue bankruptcy to save their homes. If the legislation were to pass, Mr. Lawless said, 1.6 million would be a conservative estimate of the number of bankruptcy filings this year.“We have to remember that prebankruptcy negotiations take place in the shadow of the bankruptcy law,” he added. “We would expect that banks would be more likely to come to the negotiation table.”Regardless of what happens, the number of consumers filing for bankruptcy is expected to continue to climb even after the economy begins to recover.“What is sobering about these numbers is that bankruptcy is generally a lagging economic indicator,” Professor Williams said. “So even as the economy starts to turn around down the road, we will still continue to see bankruptcy filings increase even past that turning point, and that trend will continue anywhere from three to five quarters.”'"
"'09-04-04,'0','While acknowledging that the Federal Reserve was “extremely uncomfortable” about last year’s bailouts of big financial companies, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, said Friday that the central bank’s strategy to ease the financial crisis was working.Mr. Bernanke was referring to the Fed’s unprecedented decisions last year to step in and financially back JPMorgan Chase’s takeover of the troubled investment house Bear Stearns and throw the first of four financial lifelines to the insurance giant American International Group.In remarks prepared for a Fed conference in Charlotte, N.C., Mr. Bernanke said the central bank was forced to take action because the collapse of those companies would have dealt a serious blow to the financial system and the national economy.The situation underscores the need for new powers to allow the government to safely wind down such huge companies, he said. Mr. Bernanke and the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, recently asked Congress for such powers.Credit provided under those company bailout accounts for only 5 percent of the Fed’s $2 trillion balance sheet. Still, “these operations have been extremely uncomfortable for the Federal Reserve to undertake and were carried out only because no reasonable alternative was available,” Mr. Bernanke said.'"

"'09-04-04,'0','“It shows you that a lot more people are hurting,” Mr. Bickford said. “Even with the more restrictive law in place, the filings are back up to the prelaw level.”The law, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, made it more difficult for consumers to erase their debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcies. Those who earn more than their state’s median income are now required to first pass a means test — based on income, living expenses and other factors. If they are deemed able to repay some debts, they are then forced to pursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which sets up a three- or five-year repayment plan and makes it more difficult to get a fresh start.“In a nutshell, bankruptcies happen because financial distress happens,” said Jack Williams, resident scholar at the American Bankruptcy Institute and a bankruptcy professor at the Georgia State University College of Law. “It is hubris to think that we can manage such a complex system by inserting a means test here, a credit counseling requirement there.”Keith and Leola Gladney of St. Charles, Mo., filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy last summer. Their problems began to unfold in September 2007, when Mrs. Gladney, who was pregnant, was put on bed rest and could no longer work as a marketing assistant. They lost her income, though she did receive short-term disability payments. In January 2008, Mr. Gladney, 38, lost his job as a manager of an auto parts store. Within months, the couple had fallen behind on the mortgage payments on their home, which they bought for $130,000 in 2004.They lost the house around the time their son was born in March 2008, and the couple had to move into a hotel with their newborn. Though they eventually found an apartment to rent, the Gladneys decided to file for bankruptcy. Adding to their troubles, Mrs. Gladney, 37, found out last November that she did not have a job to return to.“It is really stressful for me because I thought I would find another job,” she said.Mr. Gladney said he was hopeful that he was close to receiving a job offer on one of the 30 or so résumés he sends out daily. “We are trying to keep our heads up and keep a positive attitude and hope things will get better,” he said. “We go to church every Sunday. We haven’t changed our routine.”If history is any guide, the number of bankruptcy filings will increase through this year, but will not jump as much as they did from February to March because that tends to be a popular time for filing, Professor Lawless said.

"'09-04-05,'0','On his second day in office, President Obama repudiated George W. Bush’s obsessive and destructive secrecy by ordering his government to obey the Freedom of Information Act. He said it should not withhold documents because they are embarrassing, or reveal failures and errors, or “because of speculative or abstract fears.”He was right.And yet last week, the Justice Department was in federal court, asking for another delay in releasing three legal opinions written by Steven Bradbury when he was acting head of the department’s Office of Legal Counsel. The memos provided a legal pretext for interrogations that ranged from merely illegal to outright torture.Scott Shane reported in The Times that the Central Intelligence Agency, hoping to avoid embarrassment, was fighting the release. That is exactly the sort of obstructionism that Mr. Obama ordered stopped.The administration, which now has until April 16 to decide about the Bradbury memos, has agreed “to review” for release yet another memo that has been kept secret far too long. Written by Jay Bybee, a former Justice Department lawyer who is now a federal judge, it redefined torture in a way that almost anything, short of murder, would be legal.But so far, the Obama team has not actually agreed to release those memos. It should do so — and in full.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','“Everything we do is about the brand,” said Gary Chetkof, who with Richard Fusco runs Woodstock Broadcasting Network, the enterprise that is one part local radio station, one part concert promoter and one part fledgling new-media conglomerate. “It’s about programming to the Woodstock brand, connecting music from the late ’60s to today, the alternative, holistic lifestyle and products that cater to it. We’re not just tied to this piece of earth we’re sitting on any more.”Of course, lots of people have their own ties to the Woodstock experience, from the guys with stringy ponytails who came in 1969 and never left to tie-dyed high school kids. Locally they include sundry big-time musicians who still call the place home, merchants at places like Ye Olde Hippie Shoppe of Woodstock or the people driving old Volvos with bumper stickers reading: “Welcome to Woodstock: We’re All Here Because We’re Not All There.”AS it is everywhere, the economy here is sagging, but people are hoping for a boost from the anniversary, few more so than Radio Woodstock. Mr. Fusco, who once ran a beloved local club, the Joyous Lake, was part of the original programming team when WDST began in 1980. When Mr. Chetkof bought it in 1993, he and Mr. Fusco focused on the broadcast and online possibilities and began trademarking names and Web addresses.“I specialized in trademarks, and I realized, ‘Wow, I could own the radio station and one day it could be beamed all over the world,’ ” Mr. Chetkof said in his office, a riot of old guitars and music memorabilia. “Usually you create a product and establish the brand. This is the opposite. We’re trying to fit things programming-wise and commerce-wise into this existing global brand.”Their plans include music Web sites, a Woodstock social network and perhaps a cable station where Woodstock TV reporters could report from concerts the way the Weather Channel descends on hurricanes.There will, of course, be much more this year, including many books, an Ang Lee film and a four-hour director’s cut of the Woodstock concert movie with previously unreleased footage.Mr. Lang and Bethel Woods are trying to complete separate concert plans, but Mr. Lang says all signs are propitious for a major celebration.“There seems like a big appetite for it, and a lot may have to do with what’s going on around us,” he said. “The election of Barack Obama seems like a Woodstock moment in a way. And there are a lot of similarities between the late 1960s and where we are now. That was sort of an out-of-the-blue moment of hope when people saw a better path, and I think people are looking for something like that now.”On the other hand, maybe the 40th will be a big moment simply because who knows who will be alive, sensate and ambulatory by the 50th.As Barry Samuels, who owns the Golden Notebook bookstore, said, “We might as well celebrate the 40th like it’s the 50th, because who knows who’s going to be around in 10 years?”'"

"'09-04-05,'0','Like James and Wade, Bosh is too savvy to reveal much about his intentions for 2010. But unlike James and Wade, Bosh perhapss has good reasons to look around. The Raptors were supposed to be a middle-of-the-pack playoff team in the Eastern Conference, but are instead jockeying with the Knicks (29-47) for lottery position.Bosh never meshed with Jermaine O’Neal, who arrived in a trade last summer and was later shipped to Miami for Shawn Marion. Bosh has also been limited for the last two months by a sprained right knee.But the stoic Bosh dismissed any notion that the season had been a grind, then offered a healthy sense of perspective that could serve him well wherever he lands.“Who said we were going through frustration?” Bosh said. “Not at all. You learn from everything, no matter good or bad. You take your lessons in stride. There’s no good or bad things that happen. They just happen.“It’s on the person to take it as good or bad,” he continued. “I take it as a good thing. Because I’ve been places that I don’t want to be anymore. So in order to get more wins, you have to become more wise of a basketball player. And to get through that, we’ve been through a lot of situations, and I’ll know how to better handle them later on.”With that in mind, Bosh said Toronto’s poor season would not necessarily affect his future plans.“Things can turn around and things can change very quickly,” he said.Bosh struggled early in Saturday’s game but came on strong in the second half to finish with 17 points and 13 rebounds. Andrea Bargnani led Toronto with 23 points. The Knicks and the Raptors play again Sunday night in Toronto.While he gushed about New York and called D’Antoni “an offensive genius,” Bosh may fairly wonder what sort of team he would be joining here. Most of the current Knicks are not under contract in 2010. Their best prospect, Danilo Gallinari, is heading for back surgery. And their most talented guard, Nate Robinson, is a restricted free agent who showed up Saturday with orange and blue stripes on his head.Robinson, ever straddling the line between competitor and entertainer, spray-painted the stripes to highlight his mohawk haircut. At a distance, he looked like a stray member of the Knicks City Kids dance team. As it turns out, the kids lent Robinson the spray paint and goaded him into the new look.“They kept asking me for the last, like, three or four years, so I was like, ‘All right,’ ” Robinson said. “Just trying to put a smile on everybody’s face.”Teammates jokingly referred to him as “the new Dennis Rodman.” D’Antoni had a different impression.“The circus is in town,” he said with a smirk. “I thought it was a tribute to it.”The notion of Bosh in a Knicks jersey may seem like a stretch, but at the Garden anything is possible. On Saturday, the Raptors’ bus was delayed by a pack of elephants marching down 33rd Street.Eddy Curry’s injury-marred season is probably over. He did not dress for Saturday’s game, and Mike D’Antoni said he did not expect to see Curry in the final six games either. “I don’t see how,” D’Antoni said, citing the lack of practice days before the April 15 season finale. Curry has missed most of the season because of soreness in his left knee. He tried to come back last week but played just nine minutes over two games before it swelled up again. Team officials will probably set specific weight and conditioning goals this summer for Curry. D’Antoni said he would also encourage Curry to play in the N.B.A. Summer League, although that seems unlikely.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','PHOENIX — The federal government has opened a criminal investigation into the capture and death of the last known jaguar in the United States, amid accusations that a biologist working for the state illegally baited a trap to attract the cat.The 118-pound male jaguar, known as Macho B, was captured on Feb. 18 in a leg-hold snare placed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department in a rugged mountainous area southwest of Tucson. The animal, which was described in field reports as healthy and robust, was tranquilized, equipped with a radio-tracking collar and released from the trap.The jaguar, which was estimated to be 16 years old, was recaptured with tranquilizing darts on March 2 after wildlife personnel feared that it might be in poor health. It was flown by helicopter to the Phoenix Zoo, where a veterinarian said it had irreversible kidney failure. It was euthanized the same day.Arizona fish and game officials have repeatedly maintained that the snare that first caught the jaguar had been intended for a mountain lion or a black bear. Wildlife conservationists had argued against using a snare to catch the jaguar because of the high risk it posed to the animal, especially considering its age.The department and its oversight body, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, “did not authorize or condone intentional initial capture of this jaguar,” it said in a statement on Thursday.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','So I wrote a book about a kid who worked in a big investment bank. The opening scene was the bonus dinner. I had a friend who told me about them. The partners have envelopes in front of them with the bonuses. But they don’t know how much they are. You have to sit there and stare all through all evening at this envelope with your bonus in it. And in this scene, one guy opens his envelope and gets nothing and he goes crazy. The book, called “The Takeover,” goes on to describe a secret society that tries to bring down the banking system.I sent the start of the book to Steve. This time he said, “I kind of like this one.” He knew Barbara Hall, a novelist and television producer, who introduced me to her agent, Cynthia Manson.When I met with Cynthia, she asked, “What else have you written?” and I said, “I haven’t written anything.”And she said: “Did you major in English? And I said: “No, economics.” I think she was a little taken aback.She called me up three nights later, after reading the first half of “The Takeover,” and said: “I think you ought to finish this. I love this book. I was shocked. I don’t like business and I don’t like finance.”If I were selling a company, I would interview 9 or 10 banks, but I just threw myself at this woman because you always hear how hard it is to get an agent.I finished the book in April 1994. When it was done, Cynthia said she was going to auction it. That surprised me, because I had heard that agents usually just send a book to one editor. But she sent it to five or six editors at the same time.In late May that year, I was fly-fishing in Montana on the Bighorn River. You get up at 6 a.m., travel down the river and you come back at 9 at night.When I came in that night, the owner of the property had a big grin on her face and told me that a woman from New York had been calling all day. “She left a message but I am not going to give it to you until I tell you how annoyed I am,” she said. “She called at 12, she called at 2 and at 4 and she finally said: ‘Well why can’t you get a helicopter to find him or something?’ “And I said: ‘This is Montana.’”It was Cynthia. When I called back, she said we had gotten a two-book deal for a couple of hundred thousand dollars. (Six weeks later, she had sold movie rights to “The Takeover,” but a movie was never made.) When the book sold to Penguin, everybody at the bank and the trading desk thought it was great.Since then, I have written 15 more books. I quit banking in 1995 to write full time. I would take people in finance out for drinks at the end of the day, once a week, and say “Tell me some stories.” That lasted four years, and led to lots of ideas, and then I started to get stale.One day in Penn Station I ran into Scott Andrews, a fraternity brother of mine at the University of Virginia. He and Marvin Bush (George W.’s brother), were the founding partners of Winston Partners, a private equity firm in northern Virginia.Scott asked me if I had an interest in joining. I was ready to leave New York, and Virginia seemed perfect. I was responsible for several companies in the portfolio and was able to continue writing.During that time, I created the character of Christian Gillette, the head of a much bigger private equity firm based in New York who became the protagonist for four of my books.I RESIGNED from Winston in 2005, moved to Florida with my wife, Diana, and continue to write. I earn mid-six figures writing novels and still do some financial consulting.“Forced Out,” a baseball novel that is out now, and “Hell’s Gate,” a novel that will be out in August (about the forest fires in the Western United States), are departures from my first 14 books.These books aren’t set on Wall Street and in Washington, and I think that’s a good thing. I’m not sure people want to read books that are heavy on finance and national politics when every time they look at their I.R.A. or 401(k) statements they’ve lost more money and every time they watch the news they get mad.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','LOS ANGELES — Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has appointed an inspector general to act as watchdog over the estimated $50 billion in federal stimulus money to be disbursed to cities and organizations in California. Mr. Schwarzenegger is the first state leader to create such a position.His choice for the job, the Los Angeles controller, Laura Chick, is a Democrat who has caused headaches for city officials and agencies by exposing waste and incompetence and extending her reach across government.Ms. Chick was once threatened with a lawsuit by the Los Angeles city attorney, Rocky Delgadillo, over her decision to audit the work of elected officials, including his, and she caused embarrassment at the Los Angeles Police Department over a backlog of 7,000 rape-kits awaiting testing.The potential for fraud as billions of dollars in stimulus money is distributed has been an immediate concern among federal and local officials. Robert S. Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, told Congress that the large amount of money spread around the nation would “lead to an inevitable increase in economic crime and public corruption cases.” More than 40 states have set up Web sites to track stimulus spending publicly.“I think this is one of the most important things we can do to help the Obama administration disburse this money in the most efficient way,” Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, said in a telephone interview.The governor, who made the appointment on Friday, said Ms. Chick had been “known to be not just a watchdog but a bulldog.”'"
"'09-04-05,'0','Equal rights advocates said Friday that while the Midwest in general was culturally and politically different from the Northeast, Iowa shared New England’s independent streak and so was a logical place to file another court challenge.“We picked Iowa because many of us who don’t live in the Midwest might think of it as being a conservative monolith,” said Jennifer C. Pizer, marriage project director for Lambda Legal, which argued the Iowa case. “But people who know Iowa have been saying for some time that it is different from its neighbors. There’s a tradition of independence and willingness to stand up on issues of fairness.”As in most New England states, voters in Iowa cannot initiate constitutional amendments, a common strategy for blocking same-sex marriage elsewhere. In California, voters last fall amended the State Constitution to ban such marriages after a court decision made it legal. The California Supreme Court is considering a petition to overturn the ban, but many legal scholars have predicted that it will be upheld.Proponents of same-sex marriage in California are building support among voters in hopes of making it legal there, probably through another ballot measure in the next few years. And at least six states outside New England (Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Washington) have same-sex marriage bills before their legislatures this year, but none are expected to pass.Critics say the success of the movement in New England is largely because courts and legislatures, not voters, are making the decisions. Voters have approved constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in 26 states since the Massachusetts law, a landmark, took effect; the constitutions of four other states also limit marriage to heterosexuals.“Activists have targeted these states because they think it’s going to be easier to convince legislators than the populace,” said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight same-sex marriage. “They’re doing everything they can to keep the public from having a part in this process.”But Prof. David H. Watters, director of the Center for New England Culture at the University of New Hampshire, said there were also deep-rooted cultural reasons for the momentum here.Same-sex couples have found acceptance in New England for over a century, he said, especially among its large intellectual class. In the late 1800s, marriage-like relationships between upper-class women in and around Boston were so common that a phrase — “Boston marriage” — emerged to describe them.The region’s strong libertarian bent also helps explain why same-sex marriage has found support here, Professor Watters said. “The New England states really emphasize individual liberties,” he said, pointing out that the abolition and women’s suffrage movements also started here. “There’s a strong regional tradition that if somebody has rights, everybody ought to have them.”New England is also the least religious region of the country, according to a recent survey by Trinity College in Hartford. Evangelistic churches, often among the most adamant opponents of same-sex marriage, are especially rare, and Catholicism is waning.Moreover, the Northeast is home to two of the three states — New Hampshire, New Jersey and Vermont — that allow civil unions for same-sex couples, an intermediate step that supporters say has made same-sex marriage seem less threatening.“People can see that the sky hasn’t fallen,” said Betsy Smith, executive director of EqualityMaine, a group pushing for passage of the marriage bill.Ms. Smith’s group has spent three years building public support in Maine, where a legislative committee is scheduled to hold a hearing on same-sex marriage on April 24. In November, the group got more than 31,000 voters at the polls to sign postcards in support of same-sex marriage. The cards went to state lawmakers, 64 of whom are listed as sponsors of the bill.“We have a very methodical way of going out and training folks in the communities on this as their own personal issue,” said Ms. Smith, who has a staff of 10 full-time field organizers. “They talk to their family and neighbors and co-workers, whether they are gay or straight, about how important it is for everyone to have access to marriage.”Rather than follow the strategy adopted in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Vermont — seeking legislative approval of civil unions before same-sex marriage — organizers in Maine and Rhode Island are going directly for marriage laws. Civil unions, they say, relegate same-sex couples to a separate and unequal category.Advocates of same-sex marriage in Rhode Island said they were aiming for legislative approval in 2011. That is when Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican who is against same-sex marriage, will leave office because of term limits. The leaders of the State Senate and House of Representatives, both Democrats, have also expressed opposition.But the same-sex marriage bill in the House has 31 sponsors out of 75 House members; a similar bill in 2003 had only 4.In Vermont, Governor Douglas is poised to veto a same-sex marriage bill that recently passed both houses of the Legislature; supporters of the bill are scrambling to gather the five additional votes needed for an override. Gov. John Lynch of New Hampshire and Gov. John Baldacci of Maine, both Democrats, are also opposed to same-sex marriage, though they have not said whether they would veto the bills moving through their legislatures.“Every time we talk about this issue we break down barriers,” said State Representative James Splaine of New Hampshire, an openly gay Democrat who sponsored the bill that will now move to the State Senate. “And if we are not successful this year, we will be eventually.”Meanwhile, equal-rights advocates said, the Iowa ruling was an important reminder that New England is not the only place where same-sex marriage has a future. New England is “probably considered nutty by a lot of the country,” said Gary Buseck, legal director for Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, and so the Iowa decision could have more national resonance.“We still think that New England is poised to certainly set an example,” Mr. Buseck said. “But this Iowa decision will be a real boost.”'"
"'09-04-05,'0','In short, Mr. Beattie writes, countries choose their own economic destinies. That is worth considering as we try to extricate ourselves from the wreckage of the subprime mortgage debacle.“We created this mess and we can get ourselves out of it,” the author says. “To do so involves confronting a false economy of thought — namely that our economic future is predestined and we are helplessly borne along by huge, uncontrollable, impersonal forces.”“False Economy” isn’t really a history book; instead, each chapter is an attempt by the author to debunk what he considers to be “fatalistic myths” about the economies of different counties and societies.He devotes a chapter titled “Religion: Why Don’t Islamic Countries Get Rich?” to skewering some people’s post-9/11 view that Islam is the reason that so many Arab countries have high rates of unemployment. If that were true, Mr. Beattie argues, why is a Muslim country like Malaysia outperforming the Christian Philippines and the largely Buddhist Thailand? Good question.In another chapter, “Natural Resources: Why Are Oil and Diamonds More Trouble Than They Are Worth?,” Mr. Beattie challenges the notion that countries with large deposits of these items beneath their soil are doomed to poverty.“The corrupting power of mineral wealth has been shown graphically in movies like ‘Blood Diamond,’ set in the civil war that raged in Sierra Leone in the 1990s and turned it into one of the most deprived nations on earth,” he writes. “When the Saddam Hussein regime fell in Baghdad, one of the first lines of public questioning was how the newly liberated Iraq could avoid the mismanagement of its oil that had characterized so many other Middle Eastern counties.”But that’s not always the case. Mr. Beattie writes that Botswana, rich with diamonds, has managed its resources so skillfully that it now has one of world’s fastest-growing economies. We will never see a Leonardo DiCaprio movie about that. But it’s important to remember that not every African country needs a handout.These are the more persuasive parts of “False Economy.” Then there are chapters, about urban planning or how the past haunts present decision making, that leave you scratching your head.It would be fun to talk with Mr. Beattie at a dinner party. He’s witty. He’s well read and well traveled. But in his book, he has a tendency to dart from topic to topic. He jumps from continent to continent and from the dawn of history to the present.At one point, he casually mentions that he spent “10 of the most extraordinary days of my life” traveling around Africa in 2002 with the rock star Bono and Paul H. O’Neill, then the Treasury secretary. Soon he is recounting a visit to a cotton-spinning factory in Mali. Was that the same trip? Hard to say, because Bono and Mr. O’Neill never surface again.A bigger problem with “False Economy” is that Mr. Beattie talks about choice, but also stresses the role that history plays in economic success or failure. Remember those economically stunted Arab nations? Mr. Beattie makes a convincing case that Islam is not to blame.What is the real reason? The author writes that Syria, Iran and prewar Iraq have closed, dysfunctional economies because they were invaded in the 13th century by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan. In other words, they are supposedly still traumatized eight centuries later. This sounds a lot like the kind of historical fatalism that the book is trying so hard to discredit. It’s almost as if he cannot make up his mind.It’s probably more useful to stick with the thrust of “False Economy.” There is much riding on the choices we will make as a nation in the coming months. Will we take the politically painful steps necessary to rescue the American economy? Or will we be distracted by those who rage about side issues like bonuses on Wall Street? Mr. Beattie is optimistic, and that’s refreshing. Like so many things, optimism has been in short supply lately.'"

AdventNet, privately held, says its I.T. software is profitable but doesn’t claim the same for Zoho, which AdventNet created in 2005.At Microsoft, Chris Capossela, senior vice president in Microsoft’s Business Division who manages its Office product line, explained to me how the company was preparing for “the future of computing — a combination of the best of software and the best of Internet services.” The next version of Office — being prepared for release in 2010 or after, he said — will have three incarnations, beginning with what Microsoft calls the “rich client” (“rich” refers to features) and installed on the user’s PC, and the mobile version for smartphones. Both of those exist today. The third, and new, form will be the Web-based service.Mr. Capossela sees the Web version of Office as only a stopgap for users who are away from home or office and, in a pinch, must use a machine that isn’t their own. With Office on the Web, “users can do a little bit of work, between classes, or at the airport,” he said.Asked whether Microsoft was interested in making the Web version as fully featured as the desktop version, he scoffed at the notion that a “browser experience” could be equivalent to a “rich client,” at least without the graphical help of an add-in like Adobe’s Flash.Adobe’s Web site offers its own free Flash-equipped online word processor, Buzzword. But to my taste, Flash is visual overkill for word processing. Zoho Writer manages perfectly well without Flash.Mr. Capossela sounded confident when he described the lead that Microsoft enjoys over online challengers like Zoho. “A lot of our competitors have to spend a huge amount of energy copying features that we already have in the Office suite,” he said. “We don’t have that burden to bear.”Zoho, however, doesn’t seem burdened at all. It has moved well ahead of Word in some areas, such as offering multiple users the ability to edit the same document simultaneously.Zoho Writer is not completely polished — I lose double-spacing when exporting to Word, and there’s an irksome extra step required to print a clean copy of a final draft, without the browser’s header. In all, though, these are small irritations, balanced by gaining the ability to edit and share documents online effortlessly, in many different ways.Microsoft estimates that 500 million copies of Office are running on the world’s one billion Windows machines. Those were the easy wins, before the Web was ready to compete against installed software. The next 500 million copies, if won, will require staying ahead of what rivals can accomplish within the unassuming frame of the Web browser.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','“I was looking for a plan for how we were going to start doing this for Army football,” Athletic Director Kevin Anderson said. “The reason why the change was made was because there wasn’t a plan developed. We went out and did the search and found the person who has the plan.“He has not only me but the leadership at West Point believing that we’re going to see progression and we’re going to stop this losing.”Ellerson, in coaching for 32 seasons, knows about winning. He has been a head coach for nine seasons, the last eight at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. His teams there posted winning records seven times, going 48-22 over his final 70 games, with two playoff berths in the Football Championship Subdivision.People who know him, though, say that he always spoke of the Army job since becoming a graduate assistant in 1977 at his alma mater, the University of Hawaii, where he played center and linebacker.“I didn’t realize I was always talking about that,” Ellerson said. “I was always interested in Army football. It was something to dream about.”Ellerson, the son of an Army colonel, Geoffrey Ellerson, was born in Japan and lived in places like Germany, France and Virginia before spending his high school years in Tucson.Like their father, Ellerson’s two brothers are West Point graduates and retired Army officers. One brother, John, played football and was a team captain for the Black Knights in 1962.“So this is ground zero for the game in my world,” Ellerson said.But since Bob Sutton guided Army to a 10-2 record and an Independence Bowl berth in 1996, the program has declined.A foray from independent status to Conference USA from 1998 to 2004 did not work out. Nor did straying from an option-oriented offense when Todd Berry replaced Sutton. Brock finally brought the triple option back last season.Linebacker Stephen Anderson, a starter last season as a sophomore, said there generally was support at the academy and from the alumni. But he has also heard comments that strike a nerve.“There are jokes,” Anderson said. “I mean, I’m not a joke. Our team is not a joke.“I’m not making any guarantees. But I strongly believe in our potential as a team, our potential as a coaching staff, these guys coming in here, being winners, knowing how to win. They’re going to teach us how to win. They’re going to teach us to feel that fire. I expect to win this year. I expect to go to a bowl game.”The independent schedule includes more comparable teams now. But the academic rigors, the military training and the five-year active-duty commitment are factors that recruits have to consider.Kevin Anderson said a winning football team affected everything: morale, donations, television deals, recruiting for other sports.“We don’t fool ourselves,” he said. “We know we’re not going to compete for a national championship. But the one thing we firmly believe is we can win more games than we lose. And if we do that, that will put us in line to go to a bowl game. And we’re definitely on a mission to beat Air Force and Navy.”Ellerson could have the blueprints. He is considered a whiz on both sides of the ball, having helped install the acclaimed Desert Swarm defense as an assistant at Arizona in the early 1990s and having put together a productive triple-option offense at Cal Poly. The Black Knights are counting on his expertise with that type of offense.“We might not be the biggest guys, we might not be the fastest, but it’s assignment football,” said quarterback Chip Bowden, who will be a junior and is one of 14 returning starters. “We know what to do, and we’ll do it well. As long as we do that, we’ll win some ballgames.”Dick Tomey, now San Jose State’s coach, hired Ellerson for his staff four times: twice at Hawaii and twice at Arizona. The players, Tomey said, will find Ellerson is wise and intense as well as approachable and compassionate.“I don’t think I’m demeaning anybody when I say he’s the smartest football coach I’ve ever worked with,” Tomey said. “I’m not talking about football smart. I’m just talking about generally because he’s always reading a ton of books. He’s up to date on world issues, political issues.“I think he’s going to do a phenomenal job. As far as being a football person, he’s very knowledgeable about every phase of the game, as much so as anybody I’ve known.”Ellerson has a vision for his program: “Consistently good, occasionally great.”“We’ve gone through some tough times, but we’ve also had some great times,” he said. “It’s time for those times to come back.”'"
"'09-04-05,'0','Grant-date values represent an estimate of the value of new stock and option awards. Although companies disclose these values, there is no guarantee that executives will actually realize these amounts. They may earn more or less, depending on the movement of stock prices.Also, Equilar’s analysis reports equity awards in the fiscal year they were granted. In some cases, especially in the financial sector, companies grant equity awards at the beginning of each fiscal year based on performance in the previous fiscal year. As such, equity awards granted in a fiscal year should not necessarily be viewed as indicative of performance in that same year.Change in pay percentages for each executive are calculated by using compensation data from the previous fiscal year. Pay data for the previous year, although not shown, is collected in the same way described above. For executives who were not the C.E.O. for at least two years, the change in pay is not calculated and an “n/a” symbol is used. Their compensation, however, is included in averages and medians for other columns.The accumulated-wealth section of the analysis provides supplemental information on equity gains, stock holdings and retirement plan accounts. These amounts are not necessarily exclusive of one another.Following are definitions for the terms atop each column in the table:BASE SALARY Annual pay that does not depend on the company’s results.CASH BONUS The sum of discretionary and performance-based cash payments made in addition to base salary.PERKS/OTHER Miscellaneous pay, not linked to performance, that includes such disparate items as moving expenses, personal use of corporate aircraft, and the value of assorted other benefits, including contributions to 401(k) plans and company-paid premiums for supplemental life insurance.CASH PAY The sum of the base salary, cash bonus and perks/other categories.STOCK AWARDS The aggregate grant-date value of incentive plan or service-based stock and/or unit awards, as reported by the company. Incentive plan stock awards are earned for attaining predetermined goals. Service-based stock awards vest if the executive stays with the company for a set period of time.OPTION AWARDS The aggregate grant-date value of incentive plan or service-based awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights, as reported by the company. Incentive plan option awards are earned for attaining predetermined goals. Service-based option awards vest if the executive stays with the company for a set period.TOTAL COMPENSATION AMOUNT The sum of the cash pay, stock awards and option awards categories.TOTAL COMPENSATION CHANGE The percentage change in total compensation from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. This figure is calculated only for companies where the chief executive held the position for two full years. For executives who were not the C.E.O. for at least two years, change in pay is not calculated and an “n/a” symbol is used.REVENUE The percentage change in company revenue from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. The figures are not adjusted to reflect spinoffs or restatements. For most financial institutions, only interest income is taken into account.NET INCOME The percentage change in the company’s net income from continuing operations, before accounting changes and extraordinary items, from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008. The figures are not adjusted to reflect spinoffs or restatements. The symbol “-/+” designates companies that reported a loss in 2007 and showed a profit in 2008. The symbol “+/-” indicates companies that posted a profit in 2007 but reported a loss in 2008. A company with losses in both years is designated as “-/-.”TOTAL RETURN The percentage change in shareholder value from the beginning to the end of fiscal 2008, assuming that dividends were reinvested.STOCK OPTION GAINS The pretax gain received during fiscal 2008 by exercising vested options granted in previous years. This gain is the difference between the stock price on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option. It does not take into account whether the executive sold the shares that were gained when the option was exercised.STOCK AWARD GAINS The pretax gain received during fiscal 2008 from the vesting of previously granted stock awards. It does not take into account whether the executive sold the shares that were gained upon vesting.TOTAL VALUE OF EQUITY HOLDINGS The value of shares owned plus the value of previously awarded options that have not yet been exercised. Both values are based on the stock price at the end of the company’s fiscal year.LUMP-SUM PENSION The present value, at fiscal year-end, of an executive’s accumulated pension benefits.DEFERRED COMP.

In cases where deferred compensation is invested in company stock, amounts listed here may also be included in the total value of equity holdings.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','Despite several top sponsors like ING, Credit Suisse and RBS announcing that they would not renew their contracts after they expired, the 2009 season is set for all the teams. Problems could begin in 2010, said Mario Theissen, the director of the BMW Sauber team.Much will depend on where the economy goes and how successfully the series cuts costs. But many people inside and outside the sport say it remains a value for advertisers.“It is still the best bang for buck spent in advertising anywhere in the world, and I would argue one of the best sporting opportunities because you’re in so many parts of the world, televised to so many different countries,” said Paul Stoddart, an Australian airline business entrepreneur and former Formula One team owner, who has long criticized the sport’s escalating costs.Adam Parr, the chief executive of the Williams team, said the sponsorship problem was not with Formula One, but that companies were waiting to see which way the financial crisis would move.“We are talking with people now who get Formula One, they get the match with their brand,” Parr said. “They get the global marketing potential and they see that there’s nothing else that they could do that will give them the same return on investment than this. But they are sitting on their hands because they are saying, ‘Making a decision now, it’s just so difficult.’ ”Despite this, Parr said that in the final quarter of last year, Williams re-signed or renewed nine sponsors, and a 10th renewed in July. Of those, four at least doubled their investment from the previous year. He said the team already had a budget for 2010 that was 90 percent of this year’s budget.Since sponsorship began in Formula One with the Gold Leaf cigarette logo appearing on Lotus cars in 1968, sponsorship trends have often shifted. As tobacco sponsorship ended, technology companies like Hewlett-Packard and Intel joined. After the technology bubble burst, many of those companies left, and the financial services trend began with companies like Allianz, ING and RBS joining.Virgin is part of a new trend, an influx of airline companies, which includes Kingfisher Airlines and Air Asia.Teams owned by car manufacturers is a trend in itself, and therein lies a danger: the sudden withdrawal of a manufacturer. In December, Honda quit Formula One, but the team was acquired by Ross Brawn, a former Ferrari technical director, and is racing under his name.“There are a number of teams on this grid who are funded by effectively one shareholder,” Parr said. “As long as that shareholder is happy to continue funding, you’ve got a budget.”That is why Brawn’s results are encouraging for the future of the sport. Last month, the International Automobile Federation, the sport’s governing body, announced that it would institute an optional budget cap of $42 million for 2010. Teams could opt for the budget cap in return for more technical freedom in building a car, or spend all they want, but with technical restrictions.The budget cap represents a tenth of the highest team budgets in recent years. But Stoddart, who owned and operated Minardi from 2001 to 2005, said it was not impossible to be competitive with a lower budget.“Our average over five years was $27 million a year,” he said. “We were two seconds off the pace, but I’ll tell you what, we were there. So it can be done.”In fact, he said something had to be done.“We’ve seen Honda go,” Stoddart said. “There are at least two others that I know that have got serious budget shortfalls at the end of this year. So serious that their masters — who may not be seeing Formula One as their greatest priority in life, given the global economic recession — may just quite ruthlessly turn the tap off, turn the money supply off and say we’re out. That would be catastrophic for Formula One.”'"
"'09-04-05,'0','“They want to see, are you getting the big card, are you getting the rookie?”Video seemed to be the logical next step. And soon, the practice grew some personality. At one end of the spectrum, teenagers open packs in front of a Webcam as they stammer through names — Jarrod Saltalamacchia was particularly troublesome for one fan who went by the YouTube handle balOs1234. At the other are people like Dalesandro, who created an Internet alter ego for his site, thebackstop.net.Wearing a frizzy black wig, shades and zany tie-dye costumes, Dalesandro has branded himself as Dr. Wax Battle and invented a universe of characters and plotlines around him. He has more than 450 videos on YouTube, with several reaching 20,000 views, and each involves a box break.The manufacturers are well aware of Dalesandro and others like him. Clay Luraschi, the director for product development at Topps, said the company embraced the trend.“It’s free exposure,” Luraschi said. “Some people may be on the fence and then they make their decisions based on what they see. There’s some mystery with baseball cards — it’s the only product I can think of where you don’t know what you’re buying — and that translates very well to video.”For Chris Palmieri in Minneapolis, YouTube radically changed what he called “group breaks,” in which several collectors pool their money to buy higher-end products and divide up the cards based on various team allegiances. Until video became an option, Palmieri went through the same time-consuming motions as thousands of other collectors, opening boxes and scanning the cards into his computer one by one.But in the past year and a half, he has been able to record the breaks and involve collectors from as far as Japan and Sweden. Broadcasting from the “card room” in his house last week, he conducted a three-day break in which he opened 38 boxes of cards worth more than $9,000, while the dealings occurred on a parallel message board on his Boxbreakers Web site.“It’s the same thing as a lottery ticket or a casino,” said Palmieri, 42, who works at an airline call center. “Everybody gets something, and more times than not, they won’t make their money back. But that’s not the point of it. It’s the possibility of what might be in there.”Most of the regulars in Palmieri’s group are men between 30 and 60, and one woman. Although serious collecting has been priced out of reach of the children and teenagers who typically buy baseball cards, YouTube has allowed them to show some enthusiasm for the hobby, if only by sharing their collections and the thrill of opening a pack.With cracking voices and blurry cameras, they take viewers through the entire experience of tearing open a pack, flipping over the cards and figuring out which ones belong in frames and how many will end up in a shoebox.Those videos certainly have none of the production values of the Dr. Wax Battle show or, indeed, Robert Fourriel’s informational Rip and Pull show. Based in Los Angeles, Fourriel has produced 36 videos in the 10-minute range with the most popular episodes drawing more than 8,000 views. Each takes him as long as a week to make because of editing.But his philosophy is neither about collecting nor sharing. He calls his videos a “product review show” in which he opens boxes, flashes the cards and discusses their merits to collectors. At one time, he owned more than a million cards.“I just like to give back to the hobby that gave to me all these years,” Fourriel said.Originally, he had to buy the cards with his own money, but with some boxes costing several hundred dollars — and only so many Robin Ventura cards for his personal collection — Fourriel had to reach out to sponsors. Now, with the help of a few charitable individuals and a couple of manufacturers, he is able to keep the show going.As for the potential conflict of interest that comes with reviewing products supplied directly by the manufacturers, Fourriel said he had never suspected anyone of sending him a box loaded with better cards than normal.“If you watch the show, you’ll see,” he said. “I get some serious bum boxes. But it’s like gambling. You put the money down and you see what you get out of it.”Actually, everyone can see what you get out of it.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','“I get the new reality,” Pandit told lawmakers in February.Citigroup is not alone in toning down its involvement in sporting events. Wells Fargo, another big bank, deactivated a golf tournament sponsorship deal that Wachovia had signed. Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia last fall, must still pay fees for the naming rights over the next five years.Bank of America, which has also received billions of dollars in taxpayer money, ended talks to be the elite sponsor of the new Yankee Stadium rather than be denigrated in Congress and the news media. The decision cost the Yankees about $10 million a year.The banks’ trepidation is in contrast to the giddiness that financial companies enjoyed a few years ago before their fortunes turned. When PNC Park opened in Pittsburgh in 2001, PNC Financial’s chief executive, James Rohr, did game-day interviews in the park to promote the bank’s services and community involvement. At the 2006 All-Star Game at PNC Park, Rohr discussed the bank’s performance on CNBC while sitting in the stadium. The 20-year, $30 million naming-rights deal with the Pirates is “a really great investment for us,” he said.Arthur F. Ryan, the former chairman of Prudential Financial, was on hand when the Prudential Center opened in October 2007 in Newark. Sitting in the company’s corporate suite, Ryan enjoyed a Bon Jovi concert with several associates before socializing with state and local dignitaries at a reception. Prudential paid $105.3 million in a 20-year deal for the naming rights to the arena.Prudential, a big life insurer, has applied for federal bailout money but is still awaiting approval.Inside Citigroup, officials have worried that if the bank takes too prominent a role at the Mets’ first game, lawmakers might hijack the opening-day festivities. In late January, Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, and Rep. Ted Poe, a Texas Republican, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner demanding that Citigroup cancel its deal with the Mets. The ensuing publicity turned into a nightmare for the bank.To avoid another controversy, executives in Citigroup’s community affairs and government relations divisions have spent the past few months discussing their plans for opening day. They vetted their guest list, ruled out having executives throw out the first pitch and settled on a low-key approach, given the political climate.Citigroup has also cracked down on baseball-related expenses. Company managers have been told to be vigilant about dispensing free tickets.After Citigroup took money from the federal government, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority realized it would be unable to approach the bank to ask it to pay to have its name on signs at the Willets Point subway station near Citi Field. (The Mets also balked at the offer.)But the Citigroup employees who attend games at Citi Field will sit in style. The bank has two luxury boxes and about eight tickets in the stands, the same as the other “signature sponsors,” which include Anheuser-Busch, Delta Airlines, Geico, Harrah’s, Pepsi, Verizon and Xerox.Empire suites include three high-definition flat-panel televisions, bar stools and sofas, quartz countertops, and carpeted and terrazzo flooring, as well as air-conditioning. Suite-holders receive four V.I.P. parking passes per game.Besides hosting community groups on opening day, Citigroup plans to fill its corporate boxes with members of several other groups, including the Harlem Children Zone and the United Way, at other games this season.The bank will invite 200 underprivileged youngsters from the New York area to the April 15 game to kick off a new program called Citi Field Kids. During the season, the bank plans to join with United Neighborhood Houses, a federation of community centers and settlement houses in New York, to take 1,000 children to the ballpark to learn about Jackie Robinson’s career, meet former Mets players and take in a game, although not in the bank’s corporate suites.Citigroup and the Mets are also continuing a financial education program that takes players into the schools to discuss the importance of savings. Each youngster is rewarded with a ticket to the ballpark.'"

"'09-04-05,'0','“Before you start dealing with anybody who could be interpreted as an agent, you better be sure you know what you’re doing,” he said.Unlike in the N.F.L. and the N.B.A., in which athletes must declare their intention to enter the draft, college baseball players are selected by Major League Baseball before their eligibility has expired. N.C.A.A. rules permit these players to have advisers, but the advisers are not permitted to negotiate with teams — a distinction that agents, coaches and others say is routinely ignored and rarely enforced.In his broadly worded decision, Tone appeared to extend his ruling beyond Oliver’s case, writing that the N.C.A.A.’s ban on lawyers for athletes was “against the public policy of the State of Ohio as well as all states within this Union.”The impact of Tone’s decision appeared to stump lawyers for the N.C.A.A., who in appealing the ruling wrote that it theoretically prevents “the N.C.A.A. from enforcing its rules not only with respect to the Plaintiff, but also with respect to the 380,000 other student-athletes engaged in college athletics.”Erik Christianson, an N.C.A.A. spokesman, said in a statement, however, that “we are telling students the ruling is a very narrow one, which is still subject to appellate review.He added, “We’re also telling them that the membership’s views on the agent rules have not changed.”Christianson said the Oliver case had generated calls from parents, students and university officials seeking clarification.Because Tone is a trial-level judge and the appeals court has not ruled on the merits of the case, some lawyers said the decision was unlikely to extend beyond Oliver’s situation. Oliver, a junior, is expected to be a first-round pick this spring.“I think the long-term impact of this, at least at the moment, is pretty minimal,” said Gary Roberts, a sports-law expert and dean of the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis. Even if the ruling is upheld on appeal, he said, it would probably only apply to athletes who, like Oliver, are from Ohio or attend college there. “I think that we have a long way to go before this book is closed,” he said.Others said the affect could be more far-reaching. If Oliver prevails on appeal and the rule is invalidated in Ohio, the universities that make up the N.C.A.A.’s membership may choose to eliminate the rule in the interest of fairness to students in other states.Tone’s decision could also set an example for judges who hear similar lawsuits elsewhere, said Richard Karcher, the director of the Center for Law and Sports at the Florida Coastal School of Law.“It is beginning to establish precedent,” said Karcher, a former professional baseball player for the Atlanta Braves who was hired by Oliver’s lawyer as an expert witness in the case. “If this issue were to arise again in a different state court other than Ohio, that court could very well look to this particular opinion.”Compliance officers at universities like Ohio State are advising caution. Dan Wallenberg, a university spokesman, said officials there were reminding athletes of the plight of Mike Williams. Williams declared for the draft as a sophomore at Southern California in 2003, soon after a Federal District Court judge ruled in a separate case that the league had violated antitrust law by requiring players to be out of high school for three years before being eligible for the draft.Williams signed with an agent, took endorsement money and stopped attending class. An appeals court later overturned the judge’s decision, and the N.C.A.A. denied Williams’s request to return to U.S.C.'"

"'09-04-05,'0','Q. On brick buildings in old industrial areas of the city, I see metal stars placed at intervals on the outside. What are they for?A. They keep the building from falling apart.Called star anchors, and common in the 19th century, they’re more than decorations. They are end pieces of wrought-iron bars that run through the wall and are bolted to interior masonry walls or wooden crossbeams. The bars, known as tie rods, literally tied the walls to the interior and prevented the walls from buckling.To keep the tie rods from being pulled through the brick walls, they were connected to star anchors, rosettes or “S” anchors on the outside.“As a precaution, tie rods and anchors were sometimes included in original construction, but their more normal use was their addition when an outer brick wall began to lean or buckle,” David Look wrote in the 1992 book “Metals in America’s Historic Buildings.” The damage was already done, and adding a tie rod couldn’t pull the wall straight again, but it kept the wall from moving farther.In Lower Manhattan, buildings with star anchors can be seen around Coenties Slip, Peck Slip and Pearl Street.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','Though the area has its troubles, the low-cost beachfront property has kept the curious coming. “I started out as a ‘cidiot’ — that’s what we call the weekenders” from the city, said Pamela Gurman, a Mastic Beach resident who runs Fat Cat Paperie in nearby Center Moriches. “It got so depressing being around after 9/11, we just ended up staying out here.”Maureen Getchell, who used to live in , bought a house in Mastic Beach with her husband, Shawn, in 2000 and moved in permanently in 2005. A little over a year ago, she started a Web site called , to draw positive attention to the area. “We picked the name because everyone remembers it,” she said. “We’re not against them, really, but we’re not , and we’re proud of it.”Local civic groups support the idea of incorporating as a way to improve services. Keith Romaine, a councilman for the town of Brookhaven from the Sixth Council District, which covers the Mastics and Shirley, said he knew of at least three such groups. The incorporation process involves proposing boundaries, petitioning locally and submitting to an official review that culminates in a public referendum. “Some people think we’re trying to add another layer of government here,” said Paul Breschard, chairman of the Mastic Beach Village Exploratory Committee. “I try and explain that we’re not; we’re trying to become the foundation.”Mr. Breschard says he has no bone to pick with the town, but thinks that issues like the policing of illegal renters would be handled more effectively at the local level. “Obviously, we realize people will rent,” he said. “It’s just, you see these single-family houses that are clearly rented to too many people. Or you get stuff like this,” he said, gesturing to a large boarded-up building off Neighborhood Road. “We need to do something about it. I grew up here. This place was paradise. I lived a Huck Finn existence.”The Tri-Hamlet area, as it is known, is a 26-square-mile peninsular knob of ’s South Shore, bounded roughly on the north by the Long Island Expressway, on the west by Carmans River and Bellport Bay, on the south by Narrow Bay, and the east by the Forge River. About 55,000 people live there, 86 percent white and 13 percent Hispanic, according to census data.The landscape is one of sharp juxtapositions. William Floyd Parkway, a commercial branch off the Long Island Expressway, is dominated by chain stores, fast food and strip malls. Ten minutes down William Floyd is Neighborhood Road, dotted with business and empty commercial buildings.Modest streets in Mastic and Mastic Beach give way to roads through beach grass and unbroken views over the water. Shores feel unspoiled, almost desolate.“It sounds crazy,” said Maura Spery, 49, a painting contractor who bought in the area in 2002, “but I try and make it home by 3:30 every day — that’s the golden hour, way before sunset. A friend and I just spent a whole evening talking about the light here.”But inland blocks are in obvious decline — boarded-up houses, four cars crowded onto one lawn. Residents see a vicious circle: Absentee landlords and careless tenants drive values down, making the area inhospitable. “How can you sell one house,” said Mr. Bonilla, motioning to an abandoned ranch, “when the two across the street are already boarded up?”Shirley appears more stable. Streets like Grandview Drive are as placid as anything further east, which keeps prices slightly higher than in Mastic or Mastic Beach.With the exception of a couple of 55-and-over communities, properties are modest single-family Capes, ranches, and bungalows, according to Michael Morris, the owner of Coldwell Banker M & D Good Life. There were 738 properties listed on the Web site for the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island ( ) in late March.Over the six months ended in mid-March, the median price in Mastic was about $191,800; that was a drop of nearly $70,000 from the corresponding period a year earlier, Mr. Morris said. Homes in Shirley tend to cost about $30,000 more than in Mastic, and homes in Mastic Beach about $30,000 less, but there are plenty of anomalies — handyman specials on the low end and waterfront properties on the high one.According to MLSLI.com, there were 64 rentals on the market as of March 23, most two- to four-bedroom single-family houses, or apartments within single-family houses. Monthly rents mostly ranged from $1,300 to $2,100.and foreclosures are common. According to , new foreclosures nearly quadrupled from December to February. In total, the site reports 117 properties in various states of foreclosure in Shirley, 177 in Mastic, and 241 in Mastic Beach.“The ironic thing about the short sales is that they take a long time,” said Barbara M. Prestia, the owner of Prestige Realty 2000.Mr. Morris said development in the area had slowed to a crawl by 2006. “About 25 percent of what I’m working on right now is in short sales,” he said.WHAT TO DONearly every resident mentions nature. Smith Point County Park, which has a wide ocean beach, is on the eastern end of but is accessible by car. There are several smaller strips of waterfront to cycle or walk along. The Wertheim National Wildlife Refuge in Shirley, one of the last undeveloped estuaries on the island, offers along Carmans River. There is also a course, the Links at Shirley, off William Floyd Parkway.“In the summer this place is amazing,” said Mr. Bonilla, who also runs a blog called Mastically Shirleycious, ( ) dedicated to local news and events. “In the winter, though ...”Ms. Gurman, the Center Moriches merchant, acknowledged that the hard part “about being out here is that there aren’t great places for the community to meet.” The Floyd Parkway is designed for cars, and Neighborhood Road, though touted as a town center, is sparsely populated.But Ms. Spery sees promise. “I’ve been in contracting and real estate forever,” she said. “I was in Washington Heights, Fort Greene and Park Slope before they got groovy. There are always upturns and downturns.”It takes about an hour and 45 minutes from Mastic-Shirley to Pennsylvania Station on the , but because no trains run from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., many commuters end up driving 25 minutes west to Ronkonkoma, where trains are more frequent.The William Floyd Union Free School District covers Mastic, Mastic Beach, Shirley and Moriches. It has four elementary schools, a middle school and a high school, William Floyd.In 2008, the average SAT scores were 473 in reading, 486 in math and 460 in writing, versus 502, 515 and 494 statewide. Last academic year, for the third consecutive year, the state designated the school as “requiring academic progress.”The area provided farming, fishing and hunting for Native Americans. At the start of the 18th century, English landowners set up estates along Moriches Bay. The Manor of St. George, owned by the Smith family, was taken over by the British for use as a fort during the Revolution. Their neighbor across the peninsula, William Floyd, signed the Declaration of Independence.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','Angelo Vayas and his wife, Mary, opened their 52-seat restaurant 17 years ago and have since opened two more, in Summit and South Orange. In a telephone interview Mr. Vayas credited the food and a loyal customer base for allowing the restaurant to escape the effects of the economic downturn.The menu is a straightforward laminated affair that showcases the restaurant’s pizzeria origins. One page is given over to pizzas, both classic (the plain cheese and the tomato-basil were good standards), and not (a Tex-Mex with Monterey jack, green peppers, hot peppers and tomatoes).A wall-mounted blackboard holds specials of the day, and for satisfying, home-style meals, this is the place to turn. A starter one night was a light yet well-flavored cream of asparagus soup; on another, there was a portobello that had been marinated in balsamic vinaigrette and sautéed. One night, on a tip from a friend, we asked for an appetizer that wasn’t listed — a platter of garlicky sautéed artichoke hearts — and they were delicious.From the menu, the appetizer of fried calamari with house-made marinara sauce was a table favorite, as was the antipasto with its juicy slabs of roasted red peppers and artichokes, translucent slices of ruby-red prosciutto and wedges of provolone. The Greek salad was ordinary except for the chubby stuffed grape leaves, which seemed to contain the essence of summer. A dish of sautéed broccoli rabe, listed under the appetizers, was tender-crisp and almost sweet; it disappeared within moments of its arrival.Main courses come with a house salad and the aforementioned house-made rolls. Blackboard favorites were a light shrimp ravioli in a summery tomato-basil sauce, a balanced flounder piccata and a slightly overbroiled chunk of mahi-mahi over arugula, wilted by a hot sautéed shrimp sauce dotted with capers and far too many cloves of garlic.Pasta primavera, a special one night, was a standout, with its al dente strands around bright green broccoli florets, bits of sun-dried tomatoes and fresh spinach, all lightly dressed in garlic-imbued olive oil. In another blackboard special, gnocchi were surprisingly light, but the Alfredo sauce overwhelmed delicate leaves of spinach. Pasta marinara was a fine basic, but spinach manicotti was unremarkable, as was another pasta-based “Mediterranean” special that included shrimp and feta and seemed more like a kitchen-sink special than something created with forethought.And desserts? There are none — “there’s no time for desserts,” Mr. Vayas said. The restaurant has been thriving without them for a long time, he said, “so I don’t want to change it.”THE SPACE Two utilitarian storefronts, one for waiting and takeout, and the other for dining. Complete wheelchair access.THE CROWD Noisy and very casual; friendly, efficient servers; many children.THE BAR No liquor license; bring your own.THE BILL Pasta and main dishes, $7 to $16, with specials up to $20. All major credit cards accepted.WHAT WE LIKE Sautéed artichoke hearts, sautéed portobello, sautéed broccoli rabe, fried calamari, antipasto, pasta with marinara, mahi-mahi over arugula, flounder piccata, shrimp ravioli in tomato-basil sauce.IF YOU GO Lunch, Monday to Saturday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Dinner, 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 4 p.m. to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

"'09-04-05,'0','THANKS to the busy folks at Warner Home Video, Warner Brothers’ street-level view of the Great Depression has become quite familiar. The studio’s Depression landscape  empathetic views of the working-class unemployed hustling in dingy urban environments or trudging through the ruined countryside  can be explored in considerable depth in boxed sets like the “Tough Guys” collection or the in six William Wellman films in the latest volume of the “Forbidden Hollywood” series.Over at Paramount, though, production executives saw things differently. From that studio’s more urbane perspective, the Depression seemed to have its greatest effect not on switchboard operators and taxi drivers, but on Park Avenue socialites, Broadway stars and well-heeled bootleggers. Paramount’s uptown Depression has been underrepresented on home video, but with the “Pre-Code Hollywood Collection,” a superbly assembled six-film set coming out this week, Universal (which owns most of Paramount’s pre-1948 sound catalog) has gone some way toward correcting that situation.Universal has shown both courage and discrimination in moving away from the risqué romantic comedies and Continental musicals that make up the best-known part of the pre-Code Paramount library. Instead here are some fascinating, oddball choices in less familiar genres, mainly the “women’s picture” that was a Paramount strength and a relative Warner weakness.“The Cheat” (1931) was the second remake of the 1915 Cecil B. DeMille film that was one of Paramount’s earliest hits, largely because of DeMille’s feverish depiction of a sadomasochistic relationship between a feckless society woman (Fannie Ward) and the exotic Japanese art dealer (Sessue Hayakawa, in the role that made him Hollywood’s only male Asian star) who has covered her gambling debts. Pre-Code or not, the sound version backs away from the more provocative aspects of the original story, substituting a hulking Caucasian (Irving Pichel) for the dangerously attractive Hayakawa. Filmed at Paramount’s East Coast studios in Astoria, Queens, this “Cheat” is mainly interesting as a hermetically sealed slice of vintage Broadway ham, offering the extravagant Tallulah Bankhead under the indulgent direction of George Abbott, a leading theater director of the day.At Paramount women’s pictures were sometimes actually directed by a woman: Dorothy Arzner, who rose from the female-friendly ranks of the editing department to supervise several films for the studio before going freelance in 1932. Her last film for Paramount, “Merrily We Go to Hell” (1932), is a relentlessly downbeat story of a canned-food heiress (Sylvia Sidney) who marries a hopelessly alcoholic playwright (Fredric March) and stands by him even as he carries on a public affair with his leading lady (Adrianne Allen). Humorless and visually claustrophobic, the film seems to offer no way out for its heroine, refusing her even the dramatically convenient comfort of dying in childbirth.Probably the most artistically successful film in the collection, William A. Seiter’s “Hot Saturday” (1932), is set in a curdled version of the small-town America that was being enthusiastically celebrated down the road at Fox. Nancy Carroll, a spicier, red-headed analogue to Fox’s Janet Gaynor, stars as Ruth, a bank clerk in the hamlet of Marysville, where the local youths spend their leisure time chugging bootleg liquor and groping each other on the dance floor at a lakeside roadhouse.Between a townie boyfriend (Edward Woods) who is not above a little attempted date rape and a visiting playboy (Cary Grant, in an early leading role) who seduces her crowd with an offer of bottled-in-bond “good stuff,” Ruth seems to have no virtuous options in life. A childhood beau (Randolph Scott) turns up, offering her the symbolic redemption of nature (he’s a geologist) but at the price of a prudishness that isn’t easy for her to accept.Forced to give up her baby girl to a Catholic orphanage, the unwed mother (Claudette Colbert) who is the heroine of the 1933 “Torch Singer,” offers her cooing infant this bit of sage maternal advice: “Don’t ever let a man make a sucker out of you.” Colbert’s character goes on to become a hard-bitten nightclub performer (“the most notorious torch singer in town”) while somehow maintaining an unlikely job as the storytelling host of a children’s radio program, duties she performs with cocktail in hand. Directed by Alexander Hall and George Somnes, “Torch Singer” anticipates the Susan Hayward melodramas of the 1950s with its notion of show business as the public enactment of private miseries.“Murder at the Vanities” (1934) is an ingeniously constructed backstage murder mystery, played out during an opening-night performance of Earl Carroll’s Vanities, a Broadway revue that offered a fleshier variant on the Ziegfeld Follies. Kitty Carlisle, displaying talents that remained cloaked later on “To Tell the Truth,” is the show’s minimally clad leading lady, though it is Gertrude Michael who performs the show-stopping (and jaw-dropping) number “Sweet Marihuana.” (“Soothe me with your caress. ... Help me in my distress.”) Mitchell Leisen’s seductively composed visuals neglect few opportunities for erotic display, with chorus girls who seem even more objectified than the members of Busby Berkeley’s competing kick lines at Warner Brothers. Still, everyone looks glad to be working.The final film in the set, Erle C. Kenton’s 1934 “Search for Beauty,” is also the most difficult to classify. It begins as a stinging topical satire, with Robert Armstrong as the happily hypocritical publisher of a health magazine that shades into soft-core pornography (a figure probably inspired by the health cultist and tabloid magnate Bernarr Macfadden). But the movie soon becomes a bizarre, proto-fascistic call for the moral domination of a new order of superior physical specimens, embodied by Larry (Buster) Crabbe and a blond Ida Lupino (in her first American film), who play a pair of Olympic athletes recruited by Armstrong as a front.The centerpiece of “Search for Beauty” is a production number called “Symphony of Health” in which the real-life winners of a Paramount promotional contest  an international search for the “ideal” man and woman  strike poses that eerily anticipate Leni Riefenstahl’s “Olympia.” The multiplication of these perfect bodies (needless to say, all of them white) is no less disturbing than the grotesquely deformed figures that crowd Kenton’s 1932 horror classic “Island of Lost Souls” (a prime candidate for DVD release).The presentation of all six films is first class, with transfers that preserve the distinctive Paramount house style of deep, dominant blacks and sparkling silver highlights. There are, of course, a lot more titles like these in the vaults; here’s hoping Universal continues to rescue them.

"'09-04-05,'0','The lieutenant bent into the next blast of wind. ""I'm with you there. I can't throw bales far enough to farm.""""How many days till we get to France?""""The colonel says three more, the captain, two, the pilot, four.""Sam nodded. ""Nobody knows what's goin' on, like usual.""""Well, it's a big war,"" the lieutenant said. They watched a huge swell climb the side of the rusty ship and engulf a machine-gun crew hunkered down below them in a makeshift nest of sandbags, the deluge flushing men out on deck, where they slid on their bellies in the foam.The next few days were a lurching penance of bad ocean, flinttopped rollers breaking against the bows and spray blowing by the portholes like broken glass. Inside the ship, Sam slept among the thousands of complaining, groaning, and heaving men, but spent his waking hours at the rails, sometimes with his friend Melvin Robicheaux, a tough little fellow from outside of Baton Rouge. On November 11, 1918, their steamer escaped the mountainous Atlantic and landed at Saint-Nazaire, where the wharves were jammed with people cheering, some dancing together, others running in wild rings.Robicheaux pointed down over the rusty side of the ship. ""How come everybody's dancin'? They all got a bottle of wine. You think they glad to see us?""Tugboats and dock locomotives were blowing their whistles through a hanging gauze of coal smoke. As he watched the celebration, Sam felt happy that he'd shown up with his rifle. The French looked like desperate people ecstatic about an approaching rescue. However, as the tugboats whistled and pushed the ship against the dock, he sensed the festival wasn't for this boatload of soldiers but for some more important event. Hardly anybody was waving at the ship.Four thousand troops unloaded onto the dock, and when all the men were lined up under the freight sheds and out of the wind, a colonel climbed onto a pile of ammunition crates and announced through a megaphone that an armistice had just been signed and the war was over.Many cheered, but a portion of the young recruits seemed disappointed that they wouldn't get to shoot at anybody. The weapons hanging on them, the ammunition stacked around in wooden crates, the cannons still being unloaded by the puffing dock cranes were suddenly redundant. Sam wondered what he would tell his friends back home of his war experience. The most valuable trophies of war were the stories, and this one was good only for a derisive laugh.Robicheaux poked him in the back with the tip of his bayonet scabbard. ""This like that time you tried workin' at Stein's?""""Oh. I guess so."" He had tried for two weeks to get a job at Stein's Shoe Emporium on Canal Street, but the morning after the old man had finally decided to take him on, Sam showed up for work only to find a wreath on the door and a typed note announcing the death of Solomon Stein and the permanent closure of his shop.He stood in his ranks for an hour feeling awkward and unnecessary while the officers tried to figure what to do with all these soldiers and their tons of gear. Sam's long suit was patience, or at least an ability to wait for something good to happen, so he stood there, watching the civilians cheer as the men around him grumbled that they might have to file onto the ship for a lurching voyage back to New Orleans. It was cold, and he was hungry. After a long while, boys pushing carts of food came up and fed each man a miniature loaf of hard bread with a slice of cheese hanging out like a pale tongue. Then they were marched five miles to the edge of the city, where they pitched camp in a bald field that, judging by the stumps and posturing bronze statues, must once have been a landscaped park. An icy breeze flowed down a boulevard feeding into the camp, and Sam fastened the top button on his tunic and closed his coat. He had never felt a wind that cold in his life.That night he was sure he would freeze to death. Robicheaux, his tent mate, lay on his cot talking nonstop.""Hey, Simoneaux, I'm thinkin' of a warm fire, me. Hot potatoes in each pocket. How about you?""""I'm thinkin' about those recruiting posters. They made joining up look like a good idea,"" he said glumly.""I liked the one with the Hun molesting them Belgian women.""Sam raised his head from his cot and looked at him. ""You liked it?""""I mean it made me mad. Made me want to come over and help 'em out.""""You wanted to make them Belgian women grateful, huh?""Sam covered his head. ""Sometimes I think about the music. I was sales clerk at Gruenwald's when I joined up, and we got in all this sheet music full of sunshine, like 'Over There,' 'Somewhere in France Is Daddy,' 'Keep Your Head Down, Fritzie Boy.'""Robicheaux sniffed. ""You didn't think you'd need to keep your head down between your legs to keep your ears from freezin' off.""""So far,"" Sam said dreamily, ""it's not a happy song."" At home, the war had seemed a colorful musical production, a gay fox-trot in the key of C, but the voyage on the Alex Denkman changed all that. The Denkman was a round-bottom, coal-burning nausea machine, its hull so fouled with giant streamers of rust that the government decided painting a camouflage pattern on it was unnecessary. A boy who'd grown up in Sam's hometown had died en route of a burst appendix and was buried at sea after a perfunctory prayer. Sam and several other Louisiana men had stood in snow flurries on the fantail and watched the shrouded figure bob in the ship's rolling wake, refusing to sink, as though the corpse itself didn't feel right about the lead-cold sea and was trying to drift back toward the warm soil of a Louisiana graveyard. He was a Duplechen boy, his father a wiry little farmer who was good with mules. Sam knew the man and could imagine his sorrow, the vacant place at his table, the forever-broken link. This cold camp seemed a minor inconvenience next to that, and he turned over and went to sleep.One morning, after a week of camping among the statues, he watched a group of officers drive up in an open motorcar and choose squads of ten to travel to Paris and work in hospitals. Sam drew this duty and was put in charge of guarding a narcotics dispensary.Sometimes he was sent through the pungent wards to deliver a dose of morphine to a nurse, and the things he saw on these errands aged him. The amputations, the groaning, the smell of infection and illness were proof of how little he knew about the meanness of warfare. At the end of each day, he felt humbled and simple. Sometimes he and his contingent would walk to a café where there was a very bad piano, and Sam would practice for an hour straight. The men didn't talk about the things they had seen in the wards, because all of it was beyond words. Sam was afraid that talking about it would make pictures stick in his head forever. They all worked in the ward for those too sick to move, and it was so huge that the ten of them combined had never seen half of it, much less the satellite buildings and compounds. There were French hospitals. English hospitals. American hospitals. Nothing in the patriotic posters or sheet music hinted at the blown-away jawbones, the baked eyeballs, or the trembling black rubber tubes dripping pus.Eventually, because he could speak Cajun French, which to the Parisians sounded like a very bad seventeenth-century patois from the south of France, he was asked to perform some rudimentary interpreting. But every Frenchman he talked to raised his eyebrows in alarm, studied his pleasant face, and asked which colony he came from.In January he was pulled off hospital duty and teamed up with eight fellow Louisianans under the Indiana lieutenant, for battlefield cleanup in the Argonne. They were told they were going to a forest, and Robicheaux picked up his rifle and said, ""Hot damn, maybe we can shoot us a deer and get some good meat."" But days later, when they jumped off the muddy, open truck, they saw a dead and ice-glazed countryside convulsed with shell craters and stippled with exploded trees, a vast, botched junkscape of shot-apart wagons, upended tanks, and frost-etched ordnance of every description. They were given a map and told to police two square miles of it.Sam stepped off the frozen track and his boot broke through a crust of ice, sinking deep into a foul-smelling brook. He pulled free and looked back at his lieutenant, tall, pale-eyed, barely there, his boyish midwestern face full of obedience and confusion.""Sir, what exactly do they want us to do?""The lieutenant put a foot up on an abandoned water-cooled machine gun. ""I think it's pretty simple. We should look for the most dangerous ordnance and detonate it."" His voice was thin, and Sam remembered hearing that he was highly educated and had never seen combat. They all looked over the immense battlefield, unable to comprehend any of it. Even in the cold, a stink rose out of the earth, and bristling everywhere were rusted hummocks of barbed wire.They set up a camp of sorts, erecting a small tent for their supplies, and two hours after they'd arrived, a plodding noise came from the west, and they turned to see the head of an infantryman rise up from a steep swale and then the rest of him, his right hand towing the reins of five saddled horses over the remnant of a road. He plodded on deliberately — like a horse himself, and stopped next to the truck. ""I have orders to let you have these here animals,"" he drawled.""What on earth for?"" the lieutenant asked.The soldier shrugged. ""Each demolition group gets a team.""Sam pointed over the chaos of no-man's-land. ""They don't expect us to ride these out there, do they?""""Good idea!"" the lieutenant exclaimed, his face brightening. He dismissed the soldier and took the reins, tying them to the truck's side rails. ""From horseback you'll be able to find the shells much better. That's the first thing to go after. The big projectiles. We can stack them and blow them up."" He gestured toward the truck bed. ""We've been sent out with a detonator, electrical wire, and cases of dynamite."" Sam had been issued a pair of field glasses and was studying a hill to the north, his stomach heavy with foreboding. ""What about the grenades? They're out there like gravel."" He put down the glasses and looked over at the lieutenant.""I know enough not to handle them. Some might go off with just a nudge. I think we should try shooting them with our Springfields.""Melvin Robicheaux took off his helmet. ""Will that set them things off ?""The lieutenant raised his shoulders and turned up his hands. ""Pick one and shoot at it. Sort of an experiment.""Sam again peered through his field glasses. ""I wouldn't do it.""The lieutenant rose up on the balls of his feet. ""We'll give it a try.""Robicheaux got his rifle from the rear of the truck and worked the bolt. He glanced over his shoulder. ""Them horses, they been in the fightin' or they like us?""The lieutenant turned toward the animals. ""I'd guess the gimpy pair and that one with the scarred rump are veterans. The others, I don't know. Maybe they just came up from a transport."" He turned, put his hands behind his back, and looked up the hill. ""Go ahead and shoot one.""Robicheaux adjusted the sights of the rifle, aimed at a grenade on the lip of a shell crater seventy yards away, and fired. He missed, but at the crack of the rifle one of the horses whinnied and reared, pulling loose from the truck and taking off in a zigzag gallop across the galled field and up the hill. Sam grabbed the bridles of two of the shying horses, and the other pair stood steaming in the light snow as if nothing at all had happened. The men watched the spooked horse run up the far rise for half a mile, dodging stumps and jumping craters and then stepping on God knows what, disappearing at once in a monstrous pink fireball. The ear-flattening concussion roared back across the field like a clap of thunder and they all ran behind the truck, scanning the sky for falling debris.Once the sound of the explosion had echoed away, the lieutenant turned around and pointed to Dupuis, the only veteran among them. ""What did that animal step on?""Dupuis, a dour older man from Arnaudville, said, ""I don't know, Cap. I been here a whole year and don't understand none of it.""A twenty-pound piece of shrapnel came straight down out of the clouds and banged through the hood of the truck. Crouched next to a tire, Sam stared at where the horse had been vaporized and then up at the sky, unable to imagine this cause-and-effect, the power involved, or what they were doing here. Up on the hill, a crater smoked like an entrance to a burning mine.They fanned out over the blasted countryside shooting at grenades, about half of which exploded. Sam adjusted his sights and began setting off German stick grenades that went up with earcutting thuds, both dull and sharp at the same time. After an hour he felt something like a hammer blow on his helmet. Examining a long coppery crease, he guessed it was caused by a stray shot from another man's rifle, for other teams were working adjacent quadrants. After that, he worked in the low places, sighting in from the edge of trenches. Walking along a poisoned trickle of a stream, the water blue and stinking, he looked up the bank and saw a thighbone protruding from the earth. Downstream five German helmets sat as inert as dead turtles. Farther on he saw a mortar hitched to a team of killed horses frozen hard in their harness, and his thoughts began to balk against the math of the place; there were enough unexploded grenades of all nationalities to keep him busy for a hundred years. The smell was a walking presence and a mockery of what he had imagined of war, now blasted out of his mind forever. He understood how brutally the illusion of warfare had ended for the hundreds of thousands who'd struggled here. ""What a damned lie,"" he said aloud. Climbing out of the stream, he worked the bolt and fired at a French pear grenade, which tumbled away but didn't detonate.Suddenly an infantryman raised his head over the next hillock.""Son of a bitch, didn't they give you a compass? You're not supposed to fire to the northwest.""They walked toward each other until only a naked ravine graveled with spent machine-gun casings separated them.The man was coated with mud and his helmet was missing.""What's left of one. Two of us were killed outright this morning when they kicked over grenades. Another caught a bullet in the [expletive], and we don't even know who did it.""""I been sure of my backdrop when I took a shot.""The man held his arms up against the sky and let them drop. He looked behind him into his own sector and then back at Sam.""Nobody's ever done anything like this before."" Bareheaded, sickly small, he seemed lost and befuddled.Sam spat into the ravine. ""It's a bitch, all right.""""A trainload of bitches,"" the infantryman said, turning back down the hill.It took them all afternoon to build a stack of German three-inch shells to the size of a cord of wood, set the dynamite charges, and pay out wire to the detonating machine. They had no idea how far to back off. The lieutenant found a long trench a hundred yards away, and the ten of them piled into it. After Dupuis wired the machine, the lieutenant pushed the plunger. The explosion was astounding, and at the end of the row a man from Lafayette cried out when a chunk of shell came down and fractured his collarbone. Sam crawled through a rain of falling dirt and found that the man's heavy coat had saved his shoulder from being cut off, but that some terrible wound was bleeding under the cloth.He laid him flat in the trench and as gently as he could, pulled his arm straight down by his side. The soldier roared at the hot star of pain in his shoulder, and Sam, who had never seen such hurt, felt foolish and near tears himself. He turned to the lieutenant. ""What can we do for him?""'"
"'09-04-05,'0','In 1906, Anthony Comstock finally got his man. It had taken at least four attempts, but he nabbed Charles Conroy at last, his nemesis, the criminal who had allegedly ruined the innocence of thousands and unintentionally handed Comstock his destiny.Thirty-eight years before, while working in a dry-goods shop on Warren Street in lower Manhattan, Comstock was shown a book by a fellow clerk  a book the clerk blamed for his unwelcome contraction of a venereal disease. Outraged that his friend was thus corrupted, Comstock sought out the publisher of the book, one Charles Conroy. After purchasing a similarly outrageous item at Conroy's shop in the neighboring basement, Comstock brought the police and had Conroy arrested. But that was not the end of the story.Six years later, in 1874, Comstock caught up with Conroy again. By now Comstock was the federal postal inspector, and he collared Conroy at the Newark, New Jersey post office as he was mailing dirty pictures. As he escorted the felon to jail, Conroy suddenly ""stabbed him in the head, inflicting frightful wounds, the last stab cutting a gash from the temple to the chin."" Comstock recovered, but was thereafter badly scarred (though he considered the scar a badge of honor).Ten years after the attack, Comstock happened to pass by Conroy's picture-stand at 701 Broadway and again took the opportunity to arrest him. Conroy fought back again, attempting to punch Comstock in court, but a bailiff intervened. At his final arrest in 1906, Conroy, age seventy, offered no resistance to Comstock, age sixty-two.Charles Conroy, an unrepentant two-bit pornographer  whose name even the New York Times couldn't get right, mistakenly reporting him as John or James Conroy in his arrest notices  inadvertently kick-started Anthony Comstock's career as the most influential moralizer in American history.Resplendent in bushy white muttonchops, a severe black suit, starched white shirt and stiff collar, Anthony Comstock stood as a righteous figure over a city steeped in physical and moral chaos. Yet his beginnings were appropriately humble for a man who made a career of pious humility. Both his father, Thomas Anthony, and his mother Polly were direct descendents of the first Puritans of New England and owned substantial farmland, with two sawmills in New Canaan, Connecticut. Anthony Comstock was thus born, on March 7, 1844, into the landed gentry, but spent his childhood in ascetic study, reading Bible stories and tales of moral courage.At the outbreak of the Civil War, while Comstock enlisted in the Union Army and saw minor combat, his most enduring feat of heroism was to convince some of his fellow soldiers to follow his path to purity. ""As we entered the Barracks a feeling of sadness came over me and it seems as though I should sink when I heard the air resounding with the oathes of wicked men,"" Comstock wrote in his diary. ""[But], as I read [the hymn entitled `Waiting'] such a light and relief came over me that I resigned to all of my trials ... 3 out of 7 [soldiers] that accompanied me Pledged themselves to me that they would not swear, drink nor chew tobacco while we were in the army (for 3 yrs.).""After the war, Comstock settled in New York City, an unusual choice for someone who was ""saddened"" by his proximity to vice. He lived in a variety of cheap lodging houses in lower Manhattan and Brooklyn while working in the dry-goods shop, and saved his wages until he was able to purchase, with a $500 down payment, a small house at 354 Grand Avenue in Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood.Thus settled, Comstock set about procuring a wife. Margaret Hamilton, an old maid at thirty-seven, was ten years his senior and the daughter of a Presbyterian elder. M., as Comstock called her in his diary, would become a subordinate and unfailingly gracious partner to her fire-and-brimstone husband.All was not well, however, within Comstock's purview. In June 1871, six months after settling on Grand Avenue, he noticed several nearby saloons staying open on Sundays, ignoring the Sabbath. He promptly called the police, who refused to close them down. ""I am determined to act the part of a good Citizen and wherever a man breaks the laws I will make him satisfy the laws demands if in my power,"" Comstock wrote defiantly in his diary.'"

"'09-04-05,'0','“Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account,” Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount. “Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven.” By that measure, no one in the history of Christianity is due a greater heavenly reward than Judas Iscariot, for no one in the Gospels or afterward has been more thoroughly reviled on Jesus’ account. In “Judas: A Biography,” Susan Gubar has amassed a long, grim and often nauseating catalog of the ways in which the Christian imagination has vented its wrath on the disciple who betrayed his master.According to Papias, an early church leader writing around A.D. 130, Judas’s “private parts were shamefully huge and loathsome to behold and, transported through them from all parts of his body, pus and worms flooded out together as he shamefully relieved himself.” The author of the medieval “Golden Legend” imagined Judas’s early life, which included killing his father and marrying his mother; an Arabic legend conjured an infant Judas obsessively biting himself. Medieval artists portrayed him as a slavering brute, deploying a racist arsenal of Jewish and African stereotypes to contrast him with the lily-white Jesus. No wonder that Dante placed Judas at the very bottom of the Inferno, where he is gnawed by Satan: “his head within and outside flails his legs.”For most of the history of Christianity, such frankly sadistic treatment of the 12th Apostle seemed self-evidently justified. Who, after all, could be more evil, more worthy of punishment, than the man who handed God over to be crucified? The Gospels themselves are quite explicit that Judas deserves whatever he gets. During the Last Supper, when Jesus predicts that one of the Twelve will betray him, he adds, “Woe to that one by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that one not to have been born.” The circumstances of Judas’s treachery make it especially terrible: when the Temple police come to arrest Jesus, Judas points him out with a kiss, turning a sign of love into an act of malice. And he does it for money, the infamous 30 pieces of silver that are his reward from Jerusalem’s priestly establishment.Yet as Gubar notes, the four Gospels offer significantly different pictures of how and why Judas did what he did. In Mark and Matthew, he appears to be driven by indignation at Jesus’ profligacy in allowing himself to be anointed with an expensive ointment, which could have been sold for money to give to the poor. It is just after this episode, at the house of Simon the leper, that Judas is shown going to the chief priests to denounce Jesus. John, on the other hand, goes out of his way to deny that Judas was motivated by charity: he was only angry, this Gospel holds, because he was the disciples’ treasurer, and he wanted to steal the proceeds from selling the ointment. In Matthew, Judas commits suicide out of remorse for his crime; in Acts, however, he bursts open “in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out,” a grotesque divine punishment.It is because of these “knots” in the Gospel accounts, as Gubar calls them, that Judas’s post-Biblical career could be so various and contradictory. The real subject of “Judas: A Biography” is not the fragments of a life revealed in the New Testament, but the afterlife elaborated by subsequent generations of Christian artists, writers, theologians and propagandists. In keeping with the conceit of her title, Gubar proposes that we read this long history as a biography, in which the figure of Judas ages and changes over time. He is “an enigmatic loner in ancient times who was mercilessly bullied during a fiendish adolescence in premodern societies until he unexpectedly attained a seductive and ethical maturity at moments in the medieval period and with frequency after the Renaissance.”Gubar borrows the idea of a biography from Jack Miles, who treated the deity himself in similar terms in “God: A Biography” (1995). Yet the conceit does not work nearly as well for Judas, and it creates more problems for Gubar than it helps to solve. For what has changed over the two millenniums between the Gospels and her own book is not Judas himself — who, if he ever lived at all, exists for posterity only as words in a story — but the culture and civilization that used him to express its understandings of good and evil, loyalty and treachery, belonging and exclusion. The very wealth of material Gubar has to deal with (she invokes Latin sermons and English poems and German films; paintings and stained-glass windows, even the music of Bach) shows how widely ramifying the Judas story is. To do full justice to it would require a team of scholars — in particular, historians of theology and art.'"
"'09-04-05,'0','We had paid extra airfare to take our folding Pakboat canoe with us from our home in Vermont, but the boat missed the connection in Philadelphia, so we rented a canoe from an outfitter called Aventure Plein Air. After our first night at Castel-Merle, a shuttle conveyed us to an embarkation point several miles upstream on the Vézère, and we set out. The outfitter also provides guides, but we preferred to make our own way.We had arrived in July for this trip last year, missing the months just before, when high water is most reliable. But it was a good summer for rain, and a swollen current rushed us through the village of Montignac, past narrow medieval lanes and foie gras shops, and then beneath the nearby hill of Lascaux, which has been called the Sistine Chapel of the Upper Paleolithic because of its famous cave paintings, 15,000 to 17,000 years old. It is more than a mile above the river, and visitors are restricted to a reproduction of the cave’s most striking chambers. We swept on past. Though many visitors are as moved by the facsimile as the original and it deserves a visit, our goal for this trip was to encounter the seam where land and art were joined, so the river held us in its grip for now.The river carried us under overhanging grottoes gouged out of limestone by the current; the 16th-century Château de Losse sits on top of one of them. Gardens of ferns and mosses dangled from their ceilings, and swifts darted in and out. On the river, black kites swooped overhead, and anglers fished for pike.The overhanging grottoes were our first sign of the caves and natural rock shelters that fostered and preserved this region’s outpouring of prehistoric art, which has long fascinated archaeologists. A recent theory, promoted by Jean Clottes, a godfather of French prehistoric studies, and David Lewis-Williams, a South African expert in the region’s rock art, is that its creation was the province of shamans who often painted in ecstatic trance states and for whom the caves and shelters were portals to the underworld. Others believe that the theory explains only one of many reasons that, over a period of more than 30,000 years, people decorated the caves.When we had paddled our way back to the stretch of the Vézère below Castel-Merle, we pulled out our canoe at the boat landing in Sergeac and walked a few minutes to a narrow vallon, a small side canyon. Students were working under a shed roof, excavating a thin layer of a floor 33,000 years old in a rock shelter called Abri Castanet.Abri means shelter in French, and this vallon, about 100 yards across and 300 yards long, has at the bases of its cliffs a dozen such shelters, containing some of the oldest known carvings and paintings, as well as cruder artifacts going much further back. Marcel Castanet, the first excavator at this spot, is the source of the name for Abri Castanet. His descendants still own the land — and Castel-Merle — and his son, René, runs a small museum of prehistory in Sergeac. René’s granddaughter, Isabelle Castanet-Daumas, an archaeologist, owns the vallon and offers tours of its rock shelters.In a Quonset hut beside Abri Castanet, Dr. Randall White, a professor of anthropology at New York University, was excavating refuse from a 33,000-year-old bead workshop. He picked through bead-making residue with a pair of tweezers, separating tiny shards of hematite, used for polishing, from equally minuscule scraps of the charred reindeer antler and bone. The beads themselves were made of mammoth ivory and soapstone, materials prized apparently for their smoothness. Behind him, students uncovered a section of the ancient floor with brushes. “We’re picking through the garbage of everyday life 33,000 years ago,” he said, holding up the tiny ulna of a prehistoric bird or rodent.The nomadic hunters called the Cro-Magnon, who were, like us, Homo sapiens, existed here from about 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, and wintered in the vallon sporadically over that time. The canyon sheltered them from cold winds, and the natural rock overhangs allowed them to hold heat inside by hanging hides over the openings of their shelters. It is thought that different groups met in those cold months and shared materials, techniques and genes before separating to go to their summer hunting grounds in the spring.Their own ancestors had come to Dordogne from Africa, taking thousands of years to get there only to find another human species already in residence — the Neanderthal.Professor White believes that the shock of that contact was an impetus for the Cro-Magnon use of body ornamentation. “Ornamentation helped them organize into large groups and identify each other across wide distances,” he said. Their distinctive styles of beadwork and clothing made them identifiable as Cro-Magnon and differentiated them from the Neanderthals. In this view, ornamentation was not only the beginning of metaphor — the taking of an image or material out of one context and placing it in another — but also of the concept of social status. Abri Castanet is one of the richest sources of concrete evidence for ornamentation, though earlier so-called “find spots” exist in France and South Africa.From the vallon we followed a centuries-old trail under the overhanging cliffs and through oak forests along the river for almost a mile, to the next village, St.-Léon-sur-Vézère, and back to Castel-Merle. Here the wild surroundings made it possible to imagine the landscape as a preagricultural refuge for early humans, if not as the dry grassland that once existed here.The next day we paddled on downstream. The valley narrowed under limestone cliffs, called falaises, that have yielded evidence of human occupation from the 19th century back 400,000 years to the early days of the Neanderthals. Only a millennium or so before our own era, villages with stone churches and battlements began to be built into some of these cliff walls: in the eighth and ninth centuries residents took to the rocks to evade riverborne Viking raids, and in the 15th century, peasants took refuge there from the English during the Hundred Years’ War. Two of these sites open to tourists are La Roque St.-Christophe and La Madeleine.We ended our Vézère paddle at Les Eyzies-de-Tayac. It was late in the day, and we left to spend a final night at Castel-Merle, but in the morning we were back at Les Eyzies. The epicenter of prehistoric France, it is the site of the shelter called Cro-Magnon, where the first Upper Paleolithic remains were identified in the 19th century and were given the Cro-Magnon name.The comprehensive National Museum of Prehistory, one of the finest of its kind in the world, is there now. It sits under one of the overhanging cliffs surrounding the village and looks down on the river and the touristy streets of Les Eyzies. Inside are vast collections of stone tools found in the region, along with carvings extracted from caves and shelters — including a carving of a vulva discovered two years ago at Abri Castanet — and many of the most beautiful examples of portable art carved in limestone, bone and antler. Its exhibits on the glaciation of Dordogne, and films demonstrating toolmaking techniques from various eras, bring the prehistoric period alive.From the museum we drove our rental outside town to Font-de-Gaume cave, one of the earliest decorated caves explored in the 19th century. Open to the public, it is, like many caves in the area, operated by the French Ministry of Culture, and visits are kept brief and strictly controlled to protect the art.The two gaping portals of its dramatic entrance look down on another tributary canyon of the Vézère, and we followed the guide down the single narrow passage to paintings of mammoths, bison and horses and to a famous and graceful portrait, 14,000 years old, of a male and female reindeer — an animal rarely depicted in the caves despite being the Cro-Magnons’ main food species. The reproduction of this painting in 1901 by Abbé Henri Breuil, a great cave explorer and theoretician, helped popularize Paleolithic art and sparked its influence on modern painting.Our Pakboat had now arrived, and on the next leg of our trip we drove to the medieval market town of Sarlat-la-Canéda, put the boat into the Dordogne River and canoed a scenic stretch that has no prehistoric sites but attracts armadas of paddlers with its imposing castles, clear waters and cliffside villages. Debarking at Beynac, where Richard the Lionhearted stayed during one of his periods of exile from England, we reclaimed our car and went south for two hours to the Célé River.I HAD heard about the Célé from Jim Walker, a Vermont canoe outfitter, who told me the landscape was wilder than that along the Vézère and closer to something the prehistoric cave painters might have known. The river runs southwest into the upper Lot River, near Cahors, through the high karst plateaus and deep, narrow valleys of the Causses du Quercy, now a designated natural area of almost half a million acres. Many of its remote villages are connected by hiking trails, and its inky, deep Cahors wines were the preferred appellation for British import in the days of Eleanor of Aquitaine.For three days we followed the Célé under 1,500-foot falaises pocked with caves and shelters, some containing Paleolithic carvings and paintings. (They are closed to the public.) The valley, not quite narrow enough to be called a canyon, would have made a natural funnel for prey species, with plenty of places for prehistoric hunters to ambush them. As a canoeing river, the Célé is swifter and more engaging than the Vézère or Dordogne, with sporty Class 1 mini-rapids and only occasional portages of a few dozen feet around old dams or bridges.At the end of each day on the Célé, we landed in villages under steep canyon walls, left our canoe on shore and carried our things to a pension or hotel. A noted trout stream, the Célé preserves the hours before 11 a.m. and after 6 p.m. for anglers, but the villages were spaced so that we never suffered from the late start and could linger politely at breakfast over coffee and conversation.On the last morning, we left our hotel in Cabrerets and climbed half a mile out of the village to Pech Merle cave. From the trail, another narrow side canyon opened to view as we rose through scrubby oak woods with caves and shelters visible in the opposing cliffs.Pech Merle, open to the public and operated by the Ministry of Culture, contains all the archetypes of Upper Paleolithic European art — charcoal drawings of horses, reindeer, mammoths and a rare “wounded man” that many interpret as a trancing shaman. We saw children’s footprints left 25,000 years ago and preserved in hardened clay on the cave floor.Most riveting were the “twin horses,” two life-size horses painted in black and dull rust with heavy outlines and facing in opposite directions, one behind the other, their transparent hindquarters arranged in convincing perspective and their equine forms wedded to the rock’s natural shapes. They have been on a freestanding boulder in this cave for 26,000 years.Large spots made by artists who painted the palms of their hands and then slapped them onto the rock, and negative handprints made by blowing pigment over the hand and onto the rock, made the horses shimmer with life. A spectral fish, probably a pike, was superimposed over the horses like a Chagall angel, fusing the ephemeral with the substantial.It was hard to view this painting as primitive. We came out into the sunlight seeing the world differently, and made our way, blinking and speechless, back down the trail to the river.To reach the canoeing rivers and the caves of the Dordogne region, take a train from Paris to a regional town such as Brive-la-Gaillard, on the upper Vézère River, and rent a car.Water levels for paddling are most dependable in May and June, especially on the Célé, though summer rains can bring good levels much later. Among the outfitters that rent boats on the Vézère is Aventure Plein Air, St.-Léon-sur-Vézère (33-5-53-50-67-71; www.canoevezere.com), which charges 50 euros, about $70 at $1.39 to the euro, for a two-person canoe from Montignac to Les Eyzies, including shuttle, and less for shorter legs. Some outfitters also provide shuttles and guided archaeological tours.BattenKill Canoe (800-421-5268; www.battenkill.com), in Arlington, Vt., runs trips in June that include canoeing on the Vézère, Dordogne and Célé Rivers, as well as visits to caves with prehistoric art; $2,769 a person.Of the several privately and publicly operated caves on the Vézère containing prehistoric art, most limit access and require reservations. The most famous, the Cave of Lascaux in Montignac, containing several chambers with 16,000-year-old images of animals painted on their walls, is now closed to the public to preserve the art, but Lascaux II, a replica of two of the cave halls, was opened in 1983 near the original and is a favorite tourist site. The fee is 8.50 euros; the hours fluctuate from month to month, but usually run from 9 or 9:30 a.m. to 6 or 6:30 p.m. (closed January and early February; 33-5-53-51-95-03; www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/lascaux/en).The Musée National de Préhistoire (33-5-53-06-45-45; www.musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr), above the Cro-Magnon cave in Les Eyzies, looks down on the village and the Vézère River from high on the cliff. It houses magnificent prehistoric art and artifacts, vast collections of exquisitely varied stone tools and filmed demonstrations of the techniques that were used to create them. Open daily except most Tuesdays, 9:30 to 6:30, 5 euros a person.Pech Merle cave, outside Cabrerets, is open April to November, every day at 9: 30 a.m. at a cost of 7.50 euros for adults. The last tour begins at 5 p.m. Visitors are limited to 700 per day, so reservations are recommended (33-05-65-31-27-05; www.quercy.net/pechmerle).The Auberge de Castel-Merle in Sergeac (33-5-53-50-70-08; www.hotelcastelmerle.com) has half-board rate, including continental breakfast and a dinner of the proprietor and chef Christopher Millinship’s traditional regional cuisine, of 100 to 108 euros for two. At Castel-Merle you can also book a visit to René Castanet’s Museum of Castel-Merle in Sergeac, where donations are accepted, and the Prehistoric Site of Castel-Merle and its rock shelters (33-5-53-50-79-70).On the Célé, the pension Les Tilleuls, under high cliffs in the village of Marcilhac (33-5-65-40-62-68) has high-ceilinged rooms and a sumptuous continental breakfast. Doubles start at 45 euros.In the dizzyingly sited village of St.-Cirq Lapopie, far above the Lot River, you can find delicious regional fare and Cahors wines at Bar Lapopie (33-5-65-30-27-44; www.barlapopie.com) and 10 rooms starting at 81 euros at Hôtel de la Péllisaria (33-5-65-31-25-14; pagesperso-orange.fr/hoteldelapelissaria).'"

Holmes with a bogey on the first playoff hole.Casey, a 31-year-old Englishman, has nine international victories but had never won in the United States. The victory boosted Casey to No. 6 in the world rankings, a career high.Holmes needed a win to earn a trip to this week’s Masters; he is the only player from last year’s Ryder Cup who failed to qualify.Casey bogeyed the 18th hole in regulation to complete a round of 72 and tie Holmes at 11 under par. Holmes wrapped up a 69 almost three hours before Casey finished.The players met at the 488-yard No. 18.Holmes hooked his tee shot into the pond that lines the hole up to the elevated green. Casey drove into the fairway bunker on the right side and hit a safe layup to the front of the green.Holmes reached the green with his fourth shot, then missed a long bogey putt. Casey two-putted from 27 feet to secure the victory.Fred Couples, seeking his first victory since winning the 2003 Houston Open, led for most of the final round before bogeys on his final three holes left him at nine under par, tied with Henrik Stenson and Nick O’Hern in third place.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','With the domed stadium only partly filled with fans, every ball hit and every conversation sounded like it was going through something Alexander Graham Bell was about to throw in the trash. Everything echoed, and the sound system made it sound like the announcer was speaking from a submarine booth 1,000 leagues under the sea. To top it off, he spoke in two languages, English and French, and the sound was so bad that no one could tell which one he was speaking in. As far as I was concerned, we were on the surface of .To kick off their opening day, the Montreal Expos took a creative page from the hit show They had dramatic drumming, a dance team, tiki lamps with flames, and grass skirts. The players went out to their positions and snuffed out their lamps like they were eliminating someone. Since most opening days revolved around fireworks, Blue , parachutes and flying mascots, the burning tiki lamps really took us to a new place. It’s really too bad only a handful of people were at the game, because it was the most creative opening day I had ever seen.Opening-day games themselves are also notable for the monumental effect they have on your stats. Once the game starts and you get that first at-bat, anticipation is high: you’re squeezing the bat like you were trying to build a mound of sawdust at the plate. As one of my minor-league teammates joked after grounding out in his inaugural at-bat, “Oh no! I am batting .000, I’m 0 for 1!” One year in Florida, I did manage to hit a home run on opening day. It was nice to peek at the newspaper the next day and see myself among the league’s home run leaders, even while knowing that it would last for about two days, at best.The start of a season isn’t all roses. As would happen in a lot of spring trainings, an environment where players from all over the world descend into one locker room will eventually cause a -like bug to hit everyone in camp.One season, in camp, it hit us all the last couple of days, and while I guess that was better than the year we had to get emergency vaccines, the entire team was still knocked out with a horrible flu to kick off the year. Usually the season starts after an off-day that serves as a practice day (or, if you’re opening at home, a “get settled into your apartment” day). Well, I spent that practice day lying on a hotel floor. I finally crawled to the phone to call the team trainer and hours later I was in some New York hospital hooked up to an IV. I played the next day against the at , but I might as well have been swinging a sledgehammer. All I could do was think about my bed and some chicken soup from Mom across the bridge in Teaneck, N.J.There was also the horror of getting a phone call from my Mom that my father had a stroke just days before our opening game against and the . That was certainly a bad opening day — nothing like facing a 100 m.p.h. fastball when your father is hanging between life and death.My last opening day was also the grand opening of the Phillies’ new stadium, Citizens Bank Park. It was cold and rainy, but it was nice to see the changing of the guard from Veterans Stadium (where I got the first hit of my career) to this wonderful new park.This day that begins the new baseball season is more than just the start of something special. It is the renewal of the soul of the game. Looking back at opening days, a player can mark all the stages of his life. The day also continues the journey of a life in baseball, with players reaffirming their vow to play the game with everything they have, while living a dream and enjoying a passion.And judging from the faces of the fans I saw for so many years on opening day, I got the feeling it meant the same thing to them.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','The conference this year is centered on the “R.E.O. tsunami,” referring not to any natural disaster but to the one caused by the flood of as many as 700,000 bank properties now on the market nationwide. There were just 100,000 in 2006.The tsunami has leveled off a bit in recent months, because of foreclosure moratoriums imposed by major banks and the Obama administration. But the real estate agents here were told not to worry — the flood will continue for several more years, and probably has not peaked yet.In February, nearly 45 percent of the home sales nationwide were R.E.O. or so-called short sales, in which homeowners, under duress, sell a property for less than their mortgage, according to the National Association of Realtors. The sales have intensified a nationwide decline in home values. R.E.O. homes typically sell at a 20 percent discount.The convention at the Desert Springs J. W. Marriott formally began on Sunday, with a golf tournament, featuring a “19th hole” bash cosponsored by Coldwell Banker, the giant real estate firm. Other convention-goers were at the resort spa, getting top-priced treatments, like the protein-rich caviar scrub for $185.“What we have seen so far is just a hint of what is coming down the pike in the next three years,” Marty Higgins, a San Francisco real estate broker who specializes in apartment buildings, said as he stepped off his golf cart, smoking a cigar.For real estate industry service providers, like title insurance companies, the R.E.O. market has become essential if they want to remain in business, which explains why executives like Ron Jones, from a California title company, was walking around offering to send wine to one important Arizona agent.“Buyers now have tunnel vision,” Mr. Jones said. “R.E.O. is all they want.”The convention’s biggest party was the so-called Tsunami Club event on Sunday night, at an 18,000-square-foot stone house in Rancho Mirage. In the grand foyer, two young women in leather boots, black bustiers and shorts danced atop platforms to a D.J.’s club music, while waiters in white shirts buzzed around with trays filled with hors d’oeuvres and drinks. Beyond was a row of craps and blackjack tables and a pool surrounded by palm trees, with a view of a desert mountain range.“Everyone wins but the loser,” one man yelled at a blackjack table, when the cards turned against him.The event also included a selection of hand-rolled cigars, a special Scotch lounge and a patio set aside just for networking.Educational seminars take place on Monday and Tuesday, where the convention-goers can learn about how a giant wave of foreclosed commercial properties is expected to come in behind the flood of bank-owned homes.They will also learn how to deal with challenges associated with handling vacant properties, like pools the color of pea soup (the color they turn as algae takes over a pool that has not been maintained), as well as what to do when they find a vacant home with abandoned pets.One focus of the convention is the recent slowdown in the surge of foreclosed properties on the market. The number, while still enormous, means increasing competition among the R.E.O. specialists for listings, particularly given how many agents are trying to get into the field.Stephen Christie, a Westlake Village, Calif., broker, said the efforts by the Obama administration to slow down foreclosures made no sense.“It is screwing it all up,” Mr. Christie said, as a waiter at the hotel sushi bar handed him a giant tray of fresh-cut fish. “Those people who are behind on their loans are still going to end up in the same place. It is just a Band-aid.”But Mr. Johnson, the agent from Detroit, said he welcomed the effort if it might help families stay in their homes.“I don’t want to make money off of people’s hardship,” he said.Such questions, while important, were not the focus for many of the attendees.Sherry Waite, who serves an affluent community in southern California near San Diego, is eagerly awaiting the foreclosure of some of her neighborhood’s high-priced homes.“Three dozen R.E.O. listings between $1.8 and $8 million,” she said, a pomegranate martini in her hand, as she cited what she soon hopes to be handling. “Hello! Those are big numbers.”Benny Nassiri, who with a partner handles R.E.O. sales in California, Kansas and Louisiana, was sitting poolside Sunday on a chaise longue in a red-white-and-blue bikini, Dior sunglasses and Bebe sandals, sipping a beer and asking her assistant about the party planned that night.Then a call came in on her cellphone, related to a property she had put on the market just two days ago in Carson, Calif.“Asking price $360,” Ms. Nassiri told the prospective bidder. “Yes, we already have a couple of offers. Are you ready to make one?”The call complete, she had her aide send an e-mail message to the possible buyer, as she promised him she could help arrange financing. Sales certainly are hot, she said. “There just is not enough inventory,” she said, before looking once again poolside.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','It is more than bank failures and rising unemployment that give these troubled times echoes of the 1930s. An unfinished labor battle from the New Deal is being waged again.The goal is to win basic rights that farm and domestic workers were denied more than 70 years ago, when the Roosevelt administration won major reforms protecting other workers in areas like overtime and disability pay, days of rest and union organizing.That inequality is a perverse holdover from the Jim Crow era. Segregationist Southern Democrats in Congress could not abide giving African-Americans, who then made up most of the farm and domestic labor force, an equal footing in the workplace with whites. ’s compromise simply wrote workers in those industries out of the New Deal.They were thus sidelined from the labor movement, with predictable results. Though the Dixiecrats have all long since died or repented, the injustice they spawned has never been corrected. Poverty, brutal working conditions and legally sanctioned discrimination persist for new generations of laborers, who are now mostly Latino immigrants.In New York, advocates are pressing for passage of the Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, which would give these workers the rights that others have long taken for granted, as well as seek badly needed improvements in safety and sanitary conditions in the fields. Domestic workers, meanwhile, are seeking a “Bill of Rights” in covering things like overtime pay, cost-of-living raises and health benefits.A separate effort begun last week seeks to end these stubbornly lingering injustices for workers in all states by fixing federal law. It was announced on Cesar Chavez’s birthday by old lions of his movement, including Jerry Cohen, who as general counsel of the United Farm Workers helped win passage of a landmark 1975 law that secured unprecedented rights for the state’s farm workers. The campaign has been joined by a growing number of labor groups and immigrant advocates, like of and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which represents migrant workers in the Midwest and .In both campaigns, advocates are counting on a changed political landscape to help their cause. But even with Democrats controlling the New York Legislature, the farm worker bill has languished. It faces fierce opposition from growers and has been eclipsed by the entropy and fiscal crises of Gov. ’s Albany. In , labor advocates are preoccupied by different battles, like the fight for the pro-union Employee Free Choice Act. Other long-sought reforms have taken a back seat to the budget and health care.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','“If this molecule is as important as it appears to be, you can see the possible implications,” said Dr. Todd C. Sacktor, a 52-year-old neuroscientist who leads the team at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center, in Brooklyn, which demonstrated its effect on memory. “For trauma. For addiction, which is a learned behavior. Ultimately for improving memory and learning.”Artists and writers have led the exploration of identity, consciousness and memory for centuries. Yet even as scientists sent men to the moon and spacecraft to Saturn and submarines to the ocean floor, the instrument responsible for such feats, the human mind, remained almost entirely dark, a vast and mostly uncharted universe as mysterious as the New World was to explorers of the past.Now neuroscience, a field that barely existed a generation ago, is racing ahead, attracting billions of dollars in new financing and throngs of researchers. The last year spent $5.2 billion, nearly 20 percent of its total budget, on brain-related projects, according to the Society for Neuroscience.Endowments like the Wellcome Trust and the Kavli Foundation have poured in hundreds of millions of dollars more, establishing institutes at universities around the world, including Columbia and Yale.The influx of money, talent and technology means that scientists are at last finding real answers about the brain — and raising questions, both scientific and ethical, more quickly than anyone can answer them.Millions of people might be tempted to erase a severely painful memory, for instance — but what if, in the process, they lost other, personally important memories that were somehow related? Would a treatment that “cleared” the learned habits of addiction only tempt people to experiment more widely?And perhaps even more important, when scientists find a drug to strengthen memory, will everyone feel compelled to use it?The stakes, and the wide-open opportunities possible in brain science, will only accelerate the pace of discovery.“In this field we are merely at the foothills of an enormous mountain range,” said Dr. Eric R. Kandel, a neuroscientist at Columbia, “and unlike in other areas of science, it is still possible for an individual or small group to make important contributions, without any great expenditure or some enormous lab.”Dr. Sacktor is one of hundreds of researchers trying to answer a question that has dumbfounded thinkers since the beginning of modern inquiry: How on earth can a clump of tissue possibly capture and store everything — poems, emotional reactions, locations of favorite bars, distant childhood scenes? The idea that experience leaves some trace in the brain goes back at least to Plato’s Theaetetus metaphor of a stamp on wax, and in 1904 the German scholar Richard Semon gave that ghostly trace a name: the engram.What could that engram actually be?The answer, previous research suggests, is that brain cells activated by an experience keep one another on biological speed-dial, like a group of people joined in common witness of some striking event. Call on one and word quickly goes out to the larger network of cells, each apparently adding some detail, sight, sound, smell. The brain appears to retain a memory by growing thicker, or more efficient, communication lines between these cells.The billion-dollar question is how?In the decades since this process was described in the 1960s and 1970s, scientists have found scores of molecules that play some role in the process. But for years the field struggled to pinpoint the purpose each one serves. The problem was not that such substances were so hard to find — on the contrary.In a 1999 paper in the journal Nature Neuroscience, two of the most prominent researchers in brain science, Dr. Jeff W. Lichtman and Joshua R. Sanes of , listed 117 molecules that were somehow involved when one cell creates a lasting speed-dial connection with a neighbor, a process known as “long-term potentiation.”They did not see that these findings were necessarily clarifying the picture of how memories are formed. But an oddball substance right there on their own list, it turned out, had unusual properties.“You know, my dad was the one who told me to look at this molecule — he was a scientist too, my dad, he’s dead now but he had these instincts — so anyway that’s how it all started,” Dr. Sacktor was saying. He was driving from his home in Yonkers to his laboratory in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, with three quiches and bag of bagels bouncing in the back seat. Lunch for the lab.The father’s advice led the son, eventually, to a substance called PKMzeta. In a series of studies, Dr. Sacktor’s lab found that this molecule was present and activated in cells precisely when they were put on speed-dial by a neighboring neuron.In fact, the PKMzeta molecules appeared to herd themselves, like Army Rangers occupying a small peninsula, into precisely the fingerlike connections among brain cells that were strengthened. And they stayed there, indefinitely, like biological sentries.In short: PKMzeta, a wallflower in the great swimming party of chemicals that erupts when one cell stimulates another, looked as if it might be the one that kept the speed-dial function turned on.“After that,” Dr. Sacktor said, “we began to focus solely on PKMzeta to see how critical it really was to behavior.”Running a lab is something like fielding a weekend soccer team. Players come and go, from , , , Grand Rapids. You move players around, depending on their skills. And you bring lunch, because doctoral students logging 12-hour days in a yellowing shotgun lab in East Flatbush need to eat.“People think that state schools like ours are low-key, laid back, and they’re right, we are,” said Robert K. S. Wong, chairman of the physiology and pharmacology department at SUNY Downstate, who brought Dr. Sacktor with him from Columbia. “You have less pressure to apply for grants, and you can take more time, I think, to work out your ideas.”To find out what, if anything, PKMzeta meant for living, breathing animals, Dr. Sacktor walked a flight downstairs to the lab of André A. Fenton, also of SUNY Downstate, who studies spatial memory in mice and rats.Dr. Fenton had already devised a clever way to teach animals strong memories for where things are located. He teaches them to move around a small chamber to avoid a mild electric shock to their feet. Once the animals learn, they do not forget. Placed back in the chamber a day later, even a month later, they quickly remember how to avoid the shock and do so.But when injected — directly into their brain — with a drug called ZIP that interferes with PKMzeta, they are back to square one, almost immediately. “When we first saw this happen, I had grad students throwing their hands up in the air, yelling,” Dr. Fenton said. “Well, we needed a lot more than that” one study.They now have it. Dr. Fenton’s lab repeated the experiment, in various ways; so has a consortium of memory researchers, each using a different method. Researchers led by Yadin Dudai at the Weizmann Institute of Science in found that one dose of ZIP even made rats forget a strong disgust they had developed for a taste that had made them sick — three months earlier.“This possibility of memory editing has enormous possibilities and raises huge ethical issues,” said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, a neurobiologist at Harvard. “On the one hand, you can imagine a scenario in which a person enters a setting which elicits traumatic memories, but now has a drug that weakens those memories as they come up. Or, in the case of addiction, a drug that weakens the associations that stir craving.”Researchers have already tried to blunt painful memories and addictive urges using existing drugs; blocking PKMzeta could potentially be far more effective.Yet any such drug, Dr. Hyman and others argue, could be misused to erase or block memories of bad behavior, even of crimes. If traumatic memories are like malicious stalkers, then troubling memories — and a healthy dread of them — form the foundation of a moral conscience.For those studying the biology of memory, the properties of PKMzeta promise something grander still: the prospect of retooling the engram factory itself. By 2050 more than 100 million people worldwide will have or other dementias, scientists estimate, and far more will struggle with age-related memory decline.“This is really the biggest target, and we have some ideas of how you might try to do it, for instance to get cells to make more PKMzeta,” Dr. Sacktor said. “But these are only ideas at this stage.”A substance that improved memory would immediately raise larger social concerns, as well. “We know that people already use smart drugs and performance enhancers of all kinds, so a substance that actually improved memory could lead to an arms race,” Dr. Hyman said.Many questions in the science remain. For instance, can PKMzeta really link a network of neurons for a lifetime? If so, how? Most molecules live for no more than weeks at a time.And how does it work with the many other substances that appear to be important in creating a memory?“There is not going to be one, single memory molecule, the system is just not that simple,” said Thomas J. Carew, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Irvine, and president of the Society for Neuroscience. “There are going to be many molecules involved, in different kinds of memories, all along the process of learning, storage and retrieval.”Yet as scientists begin to climb out of the dark foothills and into the dim light, they are now poised to alter the understanding of human nature in ways artists and writers have not.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','The men were also involved socially with a Cuban named Conrado Hernández, who was surreptitiously recording their conversations during regular parties at his ranch in Matanzas. Some of those recorded conversations, which Cuban officials recently discovered, included acerbic criticism and off-color jokes about various government leaders, including Fidel and Raúl Castro.Mr. Hernández, who served as the liaison on the island between the Cuban government and business interests in the Basque region of Spain, has been detained for over a month, Cuban officials said, because he was supposedly passing the recordings to Spanish intelligence officials, a claim that the Spanish Embassy in Cuba adamantly denies.The Cuban officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with reporters.On the streets of Havana, the capital, people seem to care less about the politics of the shakeup than whether the changes will make any difference in their lives.“Politics here is a sport whose spectators are all blind,” said a man as he swept up litter along the seaside Malecón and who, like most people interviewed, did not want to be quoted by name. “Everyone knows things are happening. No one is sure what. So you stop trying to watch.”People say they have seen small improvements in the economy that do not go far enough. Many roads in Havana have been repaired. Microwave ovens, DVD players and cellphones are now in stores, but most Cubans cannot afford them.The nation still imports more than 80 percent of what it consumes, and Raúl Castro is trying to encourage farming by giving fallow lands to those willing to work it. But the money they can earn selling the food remains below what is needed for the tools and labor needed to start a farm.Mr. Castro faces a tough road ahead. Three hurricanes last season cost Cuba $10 billion, or 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Salaries remain low, food prices are high and housing is scarce. Bartenders, with access to dollars, earn wages many times that of physicians. Tourism was up last year but the price of Cuba’s top export, nickel, dropped by 41 percent.Many Cubans are putting their hopes for the economy on Mr. Obama’s easing of longstanding restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba, which he is expected to announce in the coming days.Some people believe Mr. Obama needs to do much more to make a difference.“Financially, the effect those steps would have for Cuba is tiny,” said Luís René Fernández, a University of Havana foreign policy specialist. “Only opening up travel to all Americans and lifting the blockade will have a measurable impact.”In the meantime, as the American embargo continues, foreign companies are gradually increasing their presence in Cuba. Brazil, China and Russia have joined the search for oil in Cuban waters in the Gulf of Mexico.Spanish companies have always had a strong economic presence here, and relations between the countries have grown stronger since Spain passed a law last year that allows anyone with Spanish grandparents to become a Spanish citizen. But the recent accusations against Mr. Hernández have complicated diplomatic matters; Spanish officials sent a delegation to Cuba this weekend to talk with officials about the issue.Mr. Hernández’s troubles began at his farm in Matanzas, about 60 miles east of Havana, where he, Mr. Pérez Roque and Mr. Lage met regularly for drinks and dominoes.During at least one of those tape-recorded gatherings in early February, which was attended by Mr. Lage, Mr. Pérez Roque and Fernando Remírez de Estenoz, the head of the Cuban Communist Party’s Foreign Relations Department, the conversation drifted off course and the men began making vulgar jokes about Fidel Castro’s age and health and about the political capabilities of Raúl Castro and José Ramón Machado Ventura, the vice president, according to two Cuban officials.Though it is not clear why Cuban officials detained Mr. Hernández originally, they raided his office where they found the recordings and an unauthorized diplomatic passport that Cuban officials say was given to him by Mr. Roque. He was arrested Feb. 14 at the airport in Havana.On March 2, Raúl Castro announced his shakeup. After Mr. Pérez Roque received a standing ovation in the lobby after he left his office for the last time, Raúl Castro called a meeting on March 6 to explain his actions to his top 20 officials. In broad details, he described the evidence against the men and played certain sections of the recordings for those gathered.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','The move to address the caseloads in New York City comes amid a national uprising of sorts by public defenders. In at least seven states, government-appointed lawyers either have refused to take new cases or have filed lawsuits to limit them.“People do look to New York to establish different policies,” said David Carroll, research director for the National Legal Aid and Defender Association. “We do hope that this becomes a model both for reform for the rest of the state and, hopefully, a model for other large urban centers.”Under the law, New York State’s chief administrative judge would be required to establish new caseload standards for public defenders by April 1, 2010. The judiciary would then have four years to phase in the limits and ensure proper funding. Despite the state’s grim economic condition, the judiciary’s budget for the current fiscal year remained stable at $2.57 billion.Public defenders have been pleading for help since 1963, when the United States Supreme Court, in its decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, mandated the right to counsel for defendants who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. The Legal Aid Society has long fought the city, which provides most of its financing, over money. Tensions peaked during Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s administration when the society’s lawyers went on strike.Jonathan Lippman, the chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals and the head of the state’s judicial system, said that allowing four years to phase in the caseload limits would give the judiciary time to plan its budget accordingly.“This is so important to all of us in the justice system,” said Judge Lippman, who was instrumental in ensuring the legislation’s passage. “This affects what judges do in the courtroom every day. We can’t do our jobs unless you have the two key players — the prosecution and the defense — on a level playing field.”Judge Lippman did not speculate what the caseload limits would be. But in 1995, the Appellate Division in Manhattan adopted caseload guidelines that would amount to public defenders handling roughly 70 cases at a time, Mr. Banks said.But those guidelines were not binding, and Legal Aid has been too understaffed to meet them, Mr. Banks said. Last year, the agency had 435 criminal defense lawyers who were responsible for 227,000 new cases, up from 210,000 in 2005, Mr. Banks said. The society’s criminal defense division is expecting an $11.3 million shortfall for the fiscal year that starts in July, he said.Although easing the caseload for public defenders is a prudent step, said John Feinblatt, the mayor’s criminal justice coordinator, it is more important to invest in technology and other resources that help lawyers work more efficiently. The city has already invested millions of dollars to modernize methods of data entry and systems for looking up a client’s bail status or the details of a case, Mr. Feinblatt said.“We need to bring this paperbound system into the 21st century,” he said. “In the long run, those kinds of investments in technology will be far more important than just counting cases.”Prof. Norman Lefstein of the Indiana University School of Law said blanket case limits could cause problems because they could create expectations that some lawyers might not be able to meet. Any standard should take into account a lawyer’s ability, the resources available to him or her and the complexity of a case, said Professor Lefstein, who studies indigent defense.“You can’t be bound in kind of a robotic fashion by a set of numbers,” he said.But Laura Pitter, who worked for Legal Aid in the Bronx from 2003 to 2008, said caseload caps were “great and very necessary.”When she started at Legal Aid, she said, she handled 70 to 80 cases at a time. Eventually, that number climbed to between 110 and 115 cases, meaning that she sometimes had to make 5 to 10 court appearances a day, she said. Cases were delayed for months or years, she said, while her clients sat in jail or rearranged their lives around court appearances.She said she left Legal Aid for private practice because she was overburdened and because she needed to make more money to pay off student loans.“It was becoming impossible to do that job,” she said. “Clients suffered enormously.”'"
"'09-04-06,'0','Until now, China has been a hotbed of online piracy and free downloads of music, film and even television shows.According to the International Federation of Phonographic Industries, which represents the global record makers, 99 percent of the music downloaded in China violates copyrights.Lawsuits by major music labels and promises by the Chinese government to crack down on Internet piracy have failed to deter the practices.But now, the music industry says that, at least in China, it can live with giving away music.“The level of online advertising in China is quite mature, so we’re willing to try this out,” said Sandy Monteiro, a senior vice president at the Universal Music Group.The deal creates a powerful tandem — the world’s biggest online search and advertising engine, paired with powerhouses from the music industry —aiming to take on China’s leading search engine, Baidu, whose Web traffic has grown partly because of its links to free, unlicensed music.Global record labels have sued Baidu, trying to force the company to stop linking to unlicensed sites. But Baidu, which declined to be interviewed for this article, has said it is simply a search engine and does not engage in piracy.With its popular searches, Baidu has managed to keep far ahead of Google in China, with a search market share approaching 65 percent.But analysts say Google could be significantly aided by the new music partnership.“It’s a smart move for Google,” said Ma Xiushan, deputy director general of the China Intellectual Property Society in Beijing. “Google has realized the point: they have to open the access for downloading so that they can compete with Chinese competitors and attract more users.”Google executives say they acted because a music search function was one of the few elements they did not have in China.According to government figures, about 84 percent of China’s nearly 300 million Internet users download music over the Web, and most of it is used for cellphone ring tones.Google hopes that by offering free, high-quality music — giving consumers fewer worries about viruses or damaged tracks — it can cut into Baidu’s lead.For the music industry, which believes it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars to online piracy, the deal promises to deliver a steady stream of revenue and could also put pressure on Baidu and other Chinese Internet companies to distribute legitimate tracks or risk being locked out of future deals.Not everyone believes it will work.“Google’s move is just burning money to compete with Baidu’s dominance,” said Guo Chunlong, founder of yobo.com, a music and entertainment Web site. “Sharing ad revenues with music companies — this business model is not sustainable. How many page views could generate the money both Google and the music companies expect?”Music executives dispute that. But they say the China deal is not a model for the rest of the world. They say different regions call for different approaches — some that charge for downloads, some that stream music for a single subscription price and some that are supported by advertising.In China, they decided an advertising-supported model was best.“China was a curious place,” said Mr. Monteiro at Universal Music. “It was the one market we couldn’t crack. And then Google approached us about this model.”Erik Zhang, one of the founders of Top100.cn, said advertising-supported free downloads were just the first of several stages in the proposed deal.The partners say they could broaden offerings to include paid V.I.P. memberships, free concert tickets or backstage passes and other benefits.But one thing is clear: Google and its partners want to limit this experiment to China.For instance, the site — which will eventually offer about 1.1 million tracks — is in Chinese, and only Internet addresses based in China can download free music. Could China’s clever pirates download this music free and then swap it or sell it in other parts of the world, possibly undermining the system?Last week, for example, a user downloaded a music track in China and easily shipped it to a friend in London.Music producers said customers might try this, but they are trying to put up legal and technical hurdles to such ploys.“We’ll definitely need to watch it,” Mr. Monteiro, of Universal Music, said.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','PARIS — HSBC Holdings said Sunday that it had raised nearly $18 billion by issuing new shares to investors, one of the largest such offerings in British history.To strengthen its finances, the bank sold 4.9 billion shares, or 96.6 percent of the stock offered, to existing shareholders at £2.54, or $3.77, each. Shares in the so-called rights issue were sold at a 41 percent discount to the company’s closing share price in London on Friday and yielded HSBC $17.7 billion net of expenses.“We remain confident that HSBC is well-placed in today’s environment and that our strength leads to opportunity,” HSBC’s chairman, Stephen K. Green, said in a written statement.HSBC said it expected to place the remaining 3.4 percent of the offering on Monday but any unsold shares would be acquired by its underwriters, led by Goldman Sachs International and JPMorgan Cazenove.HSBC said in March that it would seek the financing and cut about 6,100 jobs. The bank said it was trying to reposition itself for the economic crisis and seeking flexibility to make acquisitions or take market share from weakened competitors.Two British rivals, the Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland, have taken taxpayer cash, giving Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s government majority stakes in their businesses.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner says he is prepared to oust the senior management and directors at banks that require extensive aid from the federal government.“If in the future, banks need exceptional assistance in order to get through this, then we will make sure that assistance comes,” while ensuring that taxpayers are protected, Mr. Geithner said Sunday in an interview on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “Where that requires a change in management and the board, then we will do that.”Mr. Geithner said the chief executives of the American International Group, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been removed after it became clear the companies could not survive without government rescues. The Treasury is reviewing how much capital the biggest financial companies would need to endure a severe economic downturn.“Where we’ve had to do exceptional things,” the government has replaced management and boards, Mr. Geithner said.Mr. Geithner made the pledge as signs emerge that the world economy may be stabilizing.

"'09-04-06,'0','The Cube is entering a crowded category of the depressed auto market composed of niche models meant as emotional purchases rather than rational. Such cars are intended to attract attention for unusual design rather than horsepower, bling or fuel economy. Examples include Chevrolet HHR, Fiat Qubo, Ford Edge, Honda Element, Honda Fit, Kia Soul, Mini Cooper, Smart Fortwo and Toyota Scion.Niche models tend to appeal to younger drivers, as should the Cube, or at least its price: starting at $13,990 (and $695 in destination charges). For many, the Cube is likely to be their first car — assuming, that is, they have jobs, credit and enough confidence to face the uncertain economy.As challenging as the climate may be, “we think the Cube’s a perfect vehicle for this time” because “it offers a tremendous value,” said Erich Marx, director for marketing communications for the Nissan division at Nissan North America in Nashville, a unit of Nissan Motor of Japan.For those who may still need a boost into the driver’s seat, said Phil O’Connor, senior manager for marketing communications at the division, “we’ve got a number of plans in place to help that customer,” including enabling buyers with “a limited amount of credit history to get financing.”Still, conditions may deter even the most determined customers. Nissan sales in this country in March fell 37.7 percent from March 2008. They declined 35.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year.“We’ve certainly assessed various options through the filter of what’s going on with the economy,” Mr. Marx said, “but we’re sticking with our launch plan.”“The first half of 2009 is protected in every sense,” he added, referring to elaborate introductions for the Cube and the Nissan 370Z sports coupe. “There’s no hunkering down.”The campaign is starting a month before the Cube goes on sale to pique curiosity — or, as the intended audience would say, build buzz — about the car, whose offbeat looks and quirky sales pitch may prove polarizing.The first look at the campaign will come during the episode of “Heroes” scheduled to be broadcast by NBC on Monday night. The Cube plays a cameo role, part of a long-running branded entertainment deal between Nissan North America and NBC, part of the NBC Universal unit of General Electric.After the episode appears, a Cube commercial — or all-screen video, if you are Cubean — will go up on a Facebook fan page for the car.The Cube will also be featured in an online graphic novel devoted to “Heroes” that is sponsored by Nissan North America; it can be read on a section of the NBC Web site (nbc.com/heroes/novels). Plans include a contest on the Web site to give away a Cube.“This is a tough time to bring anything out, whether a car or a new TV,” acknowledged Kerry Feuerman, group creative director at the Playa del Rey, Calif., office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, which is the Nissan North America creative agency.“So we decided we wouldn’t think about it as a car,” he added, but rather “position it as designed to bring young people together — like every mobile device they have.”Of course, TBWA/Chiat/Day is not unfamiliar with such devices; it is the creative agency for the iPhone.TBWA/Chiat/Day is creating the aspects of the Cube campaign that include the videos, print and outdoor ads, social media like Facebook, the iPhone games and the music downloads.The “Heroes” appearance was handled by a sibling Omnicom agency, OMD, along with media buying. OMD is also working with TBWA/Chiat/Day on events and other so-called experiential marketing elements of the introduction.The Designory, a Long Beach, Calif., agency, is working on Cube content for the Nissan Web site (nissanusa.com).Those with long memories may recall a soundalike brand, Qube, a cable TV system begun in 1977 that prefigured services like pay-per-view shows.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','Roger Friedman, an entertainment columnist for FoxNews.com, discovered over the weekend just what Rupert Murdoch means by “zero tolerance” when it comes to movie piracy.On Friday, the film studio 20th Century Fox — owned by the News Corporation, the media conglomerate ruled by Mr. Murdoch — became angry after reading Mr. Friedman’s latest column. (Movie bloggers had started opining about it late Thursday, alerting the studio.) The subject was “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” a big-budget movie that was leaked in unfinished form on the Web last week.Mr. Friedman posted a minireview, adding, “It took really less than seconds to start playing it all right onto my computer.”The film studio, which enlisted the F.B.I. last week to hunt the pirate, put out a statement calling Mr. Friedman’s column “reprehensible,” among other things. Then the News Corporation weighed in with its own statement, saying it asked had Fox News to remove the column from its Web site. (It did.)Over the weekend, the Web site Deadline Hollywood Daily reported that Mr. Friedman had been dismissed. Sure enough, on Sunday came a revised statement from the News Corporation. “When we advised Fox News of the facts,” the statement said, “they promptly terminated Mr. Friedman.”Interestingly, Fox News has been relatively silent. In a statement released on Sunday, the network said, “This is an internal matter that we aren’t prepared to discuss at this time.”'"
"'09-04-06,'0','For most of its Friday-night concert at the Miller Theater at Columbia University the Columbia Ballet Collaborative looked exactly like what it is, a student troupe.This was sometimes endearing: hard to resist the joyous smiles of the 10 female performers in Bruce Wood’s “Local 126,” a pleasing, predictable rush of interlocking formations and movement styles set to a cascade of Vivaldi and Bach.And sometimes not: “Living End,” a premiere by Cassia Phillips, sank under a deadly combination of heavy-breathing atmospherics and unsteady performances. Similarly empty-headed was Kimi Nikaidoh’s new “Thunersee,” an utterly conventional ballet gloss set to Brahms sonatas for cello and piano. Such works belie the collaborative’s stated mission: “to combine movement vocabulary with the ideas we are coming into contact with at the university.”Of course this isn’t just any startup. Founded in 2007 by five professional female dancers turned students, its members have danced with Boston Ballet, Miami City Ballet and others. The ballet world is small, so it didn’t surprise to see a ringer on the bill: “Two Part Affair,” by the established choreographers Brian Reeder and Pam Tanowitz. Set to a fierce mash of composers, including Charles Wuorinen and Lou Harrison, it combines modern and ballet sensibilities to striking effect (marred on Friday by underwhelming dancing).In addition to Bonnie Scheibman’s new “Spring of Fall,” the program featured the first choreographic endeavor by Justin Peck of New York City Ballet, “A Teacup Plunge,” danced by his colleagues Teresa Reichlen and Russell Janzen. A breathless burst, it takes its classical but punkish tone from the music of Joby Talbot and Jack White (strings meet the White Stripes). Mr. Peck made much of Ms. Reichlen’s endless limbs and threw in a game of rock-paper-scissors. Not bad for a first attempt. Let’s see where he goes.If it’s anywhere near as far as Emery LeCrone, he’ll do fine. Her “Aphorismós” is a ready-for-primetime knockout, including sophisticated costumes and lighting, and an original, electronic score by Jonathan Melville Pratt. Ms. LeCrone has been paying attention — to William Forsythe’s slippery torque and tension, to Twyla Tharp’s sexy athleticism, to the stillness of Miro Magloire (with whom she dances). Better yet, she has ideas about gender dynamics and power structures and how, in 2009, she might use ballet, and her own artistic voice, to address them.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','A week into his new job as chief executive of , said on Sunday he was confident in the future of the company but a structured bankruptcy remains a possibility.Mr. Henderson has just 55 days remaining to meet ’s timetable to come up with a new plan to save the struggling car giant. Speaking on ’s “Meet the Press,” he said that the company was working to avoid bankruptcy, but that if it failed to meet its goals for cutting costs and shrinking the company, it “may very well be the best alternative.”“If it can’t be done outside of a bankruptcy process, it will be done within it,” he said.Secretary stressed Sunday that “is going to be a part of this country’s future,” but said that a managed bankruptcy was among the options for the company.“These guys have made some progress in putting together a restructuring plan, but they’re not there yet,” Mr. Geithner said on ’s “Face the Nation. We wanted to give them the time to try to get it right. But, again, our objective is to allow — is to help these companies emerge stronger in the future so they can survive without government assistance.”Mr. Henderson, who also appeared on CNN’s steered away from specifics during his two stops on the Sunday talk-show circuit. He said that he and the G.M. board are running the company, not the Obama administration, even though he conceded that he has “several masters.”“I think the administration and the task force has been very clear, they don’t wish to run General Motors. They expect us to get our job done,” Mr. Henderson said. “But the day we took money from the taxpayer was one of the, one of the most difficult days of certainly my career and of the history of General Motors. ... And one of the, one of the happiest days of my future career is going to be the day we pay the back.”A -born son of a car salesman who has spent more than 20 years with G.M., Mr. Henderson was given the reins to the company late last month just minutes before a final review of the company’s restructuring plan by President Obama’s auto task force. At the start of that meeting his boss, , was told to resign by the White House.'"
"'09-04-06,'0','In his speech, he said North Korea’s missile test illustrated “the need for action, not just this afternoon at the , but in our determination to prevent the spread of these weapons.”“Rules must be binding,” he said. “Violations must be punished. Words must mean something.” Those words were added to the end of a long-planned arms control speech hours before, after the president was awakened at 4:30 a.m. by his press secretary, , with news of North Korea’s defiance.The president quickly began talks with senior officials, including Secretary of State , his former rival who offered up the now famous “It’s 3 a.m. and the telephone rings” campaign advertisement that was meant to show that Mr. Obama was not prepared to deal with an international crisis.Mrs. Clinton talked to South Korean, Russian, Chinese and Japanese officials, administration officials said. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, got on the phone with Adm. , the chairman of the , and Gen. James E. Cartwright, the vice chairman. He also spoke by phone to Defense Secretary and huddled with Gen. , his national security adviser, before heading to the square outside of Prague Castle to address the crowd there.Despite his calls for action, it remained unclear exactly what the West would be able to do to punish North Korea. President pressed for similar sanctions after the North’s nuclear test in October 2006, but they had little long-term effect.At the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, members were at an impasse on whether to condemn the test. The United States and its main allies — , and — were pushing for a resolution denouncing the launching as a violation of the 2006 sanctions, which demanded that North Korea suspend any activity related to the launching of ballistic missiles.As talks continued after a three-hour emergency session ended inconclusively, diplomats said a main issue would be determining if the failed launching violated any resolutions.“We think that what was launched is not the issue; the fact that there was a launch using ballistic missile technology is itself a clear violation,” said , the American ambassador.left its position ambiguous, although diplomats said that at the initial meeting it stressed that the North Koreans had a right like any other country to launch satellites. “Our position is that all countries concerned should show restraint and refrain from taking actions that might lead to increased tensions,” Yesui Zhang, the Chinese ambassador, told reporters.Igor N. Schcherbak, the Russian envoy, said that his country did not think it was a violation of the previous resolutions banning ballistic missiles, but he left some wriggle room by saying that Russia was studying the matter.In his speech, Mr. Obama said he still planned to continue with missile defense, but he tied the need for such a system to any Iranian acquisition of nuclear weapons. Russia opposes locating a defense shield in and the , as current plans call for, and Mr. Obama has responded by pushing the Russians to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon.Missile defense is a resonant issue in Prague, since the now-collapsed government of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek went to bat against popular opinion here to support the missile shield, only to have the Obama administration begin backing away from the plan. But Mr. Obama praised the government’s support, saying there was still a need.“Let me be clear: Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, not just to the United States, but to Iran’s neighbors and our allies,” Mr. Obama said. “The Czech Republic and Poland have been courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven.”Despite his categorization of Iran and North Korea as threats, the new nuclear strategy as laid out in his speech sidestepped the question of exactly how to handle them, or the risk posed by ’s nuclear arsenal.Those cases have proved to be some of the hardest in modern nuclear strategy. And they prompt a question that has haunted past administrations: How do you compel a country to stop its drive for nuclear weapons when sanctions fail and military action seems far too risky?Past threats to isolate Iran were stymied first by high oil prices — which washed away the effects of modest economic sanctions — and then by Iran’s determination to enrich uranium no matter the cost. Mr. Obama has said he will try to engage Iran, but that has raised concerns both within the administration and among allies that the country’s nuclear program would be able to progress while talks proceeded.Perhaps trying not to overload a Pakistani government that has shown itself to be overwhelmed by daily political and terrorist attacks, Mr. Obama made only oblique mention of a concern voiced frequently inside the White House: That Al Qaeda and other terrorists view Pakistan’s arsenal of 60 to 100 weapons as the ultimate goal of a campaign to destabilize that government.On the North Korean issue, President Bush’s six-party talks, a process that Mr. Obama has embraced, set up a diplomatic framework. But they still failed to prevent the country from harvesting the fuel for six or eight weapons, testing one device, and advancing plans to test missiles.The diplomatic challenge was underscored again while North Korea was preparing its latest missile test. In last week, Mr. Obama raised the imminent test with President of China, whom the United States has relied on to influence the North. A senior administration official, briefing reporters, said he believed the Chinese had expressed concerns to the North, urging it to halt the flight.If so, was ignored — as it was twice in 2006, when it told the North not to conduct missile tests and then its nuclear test. That suggests, one of Mr. Obama’s aides said Sunday, “that either the Chinese aren’t trying very hard, or the North Koreans aren’t listening very well.”'"
"'09-04-06,'0','North Korea failed in its highly vaunted effort to fire a satellite into orbit, military and private experts said Sunday after reviewing detailed tracking data that showed the missile and payload fell into the sea. Some said the failure undercut the North Korean campaign to come across as a fearsome adversary able to hurl deadly warheads halfway around the globe.Defying world opinion, North Korea in recent weeks had moved steadily and fairly openly toward launching a long-range rocket that Western experts saw as a major step toward a military weapon. The launching itself of the three-stage rocket on Sunday, which the North Korean government portrayed as a success — even bragging that the supposed satellite payload was now broadcasting patriotic tunes from space — outraged Japan and South Korea, led to widespread rebuke by President Obama and other leaders, and prompted the United Nations Security Council to go into an emergency session.But looking at the launching from a purely technical vantage point, space experts said the failure represented a blow that in all likelihood would seriously delay the missile’s debut.“It’s got to be embarrassing,” said Geoffrey E. Forden, a missile expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “I can imagine heads flying if the ‘Dear Leader’ finds out the satellite didn’t fly into orbit,” he said, referring to the name North Koreans are obliged to use when speaking of Kim Jong-il, North Korea’s reclusive leader.North Korea’s official news agency said Mr. Kim attended the launching.Analysts dismissed the idea that the rocket firing could represent a furtive success, calling the failure consistent with past North Korean fumbles and suggesting it might reveal a significant quality control problem in one of the world’s most isolated nations.“It’s a setback,” Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer who tracks satellites and rocket launchings, said of the North Korean launching. He added that the North Koreans must now find and fix the problem. “The missile doesn’t represent any kind of near-term threat.”Others said North Korea’s client states, like Iran, seemed to be having more success at rocketry than North Korea. In February, Iran managed to launch a small satellite into orbit.The United States Northern Command, based in Colorado Springs, issued a statement on Sunday that portrayed the launching as a major failure. It based its information on a maze of federal radars, spy ships and satellites that monitor global missile firings.The command said that North Korea launched a Taepodong-2 missile at 11:30 a.m. Sunday local time, or 10:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Saturday, and that its first stage fell into the Sea of Japan, which analysts had expected as the point of splashdown in a successful launching.However, “the remaining stages, along with the payload itself, landed in the Pacific Ocean,” the statement said. Analysts had expected the rocket’s second stage to land in the Pacific but its third stage and its ostensible satellite payload to fly into space.The command emphasized that “no object entered orbit,” apparently a reference to both the rocket’s third stage as well as the supposed satellite.North Korea’s public portrayal of the event as a complete success was similar in its celebratory tone to the happy note it struck in 1998 after having failed to loft a satellite into orbit.News reports out of Japan also said the rocket’s second stage splashed down in the Pacific, hundreds of miles short of the danger zone that North Korea announced last month. Western analysts said that shortfall, if correct, probably indicated a failure of the missile’s second stage.A general rule of engineering is that failures reveal more than successes. If so, North Korea — which has now test-fired three long-range rockets, each time unsuccessfully — is learning a lot about limitations.“It’s not unusual to have a series of failures at the beginning of a missile program,” Jeffrey G. Lewis, an arms control specialist at the New America Foundation, a research group in Washington, said in an interview. “But they don’t test enough to develop confidence that they’re getting over the problems.”'"

"'09-04-07,'0','“Southland” finds eloquence in holding back. Ben’s first day on the job is so harrowingly tense that at times it also evokes “Training Day,” the movie that starred Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington.“The Unusuals,” which begins on Wednesday, isn’t nearly as thrilling. But it isn’t bad, just more predictable. It’s ambitious in a different way, trying to recover the mix of high drama and absurdist comic relief that distinguished shows like “Hill Street Blues.” It invests a little too much of its energy in attempted humor, including an unseen dispatcher who blurts out bulletins in a nasal Queens accent: “Second Squad, this is dispatch. Be on the lookout for a Puerto Rican man wearing a cape and no pants.”Casey, who dropped out of Harvard to become a cop, is working undercover as a prostitute for the vice squad when she is suddenly recruited, still in her falsies and stiletto heels, to help investigate the murder of a veteran detective. It’s not a very imaginative way to start a new series about a female cop — more like the “jiggle TV” of yesteryear. But Ms. Tamblyn has an appealingly aloof, brooding manner that wipes some of the silliness off her character.Casey’s new partner is Detective Jason Walsh (Jeremy Renner), who used to share his cases with the victim, and is a retired baseball player who in his off time runs a tiny diner. Walsh and Casey work well together despite the preening, idiotic interference of Detective Eddie Alvarez (Kai Lennox), who refers to himself in the third person and is the joke of the squad, a little like the Frank character on “M*A*S*H.”No show is totally original, but “The Unusuals” lifts a scene from “The Wire” so blatantly that it’s practically plagiarism. Two of the more screwball detectives are questioning a suspect in a series of cat killings, and tell the man that the copier machine is the latest high-tech lie detector, before asking him questions and photocopying his hand with the word “true” on it. That ruse worked on “The Wire” because those detectives were questioning hardened teenagers from the ghetto who knew everything about drugs and weapons, but had no idea what even basic office or school equipment looked like. On this show the suspect is a well-spoken middle-class adult, and the prank makes no sense.“Southland” doesn’t steal from “The Wire,” but it is inspired by that HBO show’s intense, intimate look at the inner workings of street crime and beat police work. Ben is assigned for training, not to say hazing, at the hands of a hardened police-force veteran, John Cooper (Michael Cudlitz), who subjects his charge to an endless stream of insults and sexist jokes. Ben, determined not to be baited, tries not to flinch or react, which prompts Cooper to call him a Canadian.Most of the police officers who surround Ben are as crude and unfeeling as the suspects they hassle. It’s the crimes that are heartbreaking: a teenager killed for no reason by gangbanging ex-cons driving past him, a girl snatched outside her house when her father’s attention strays for a moment. Ben is almost as spooked by his new colleagues as he is by the criminals, and with good reason.Even the most hard-edged network shows tend to surrender to expectations after a while and go soft, diluting their power with mawkish sentimentality and romantic subplots. For now, at least, “Southland” is commendably stinting and cold, a series that doesn’t aim to please, and is all the more pleasurable for it.Created by Ann Biderman; directed by Christopher Chulack; John Wells, Mr. Chulack and Ms. Biderman, executive producers; Jon Pare and Andrew Stearn, producers.

"'09-04-07,'0','Santana’s last game was that gallant start on the final Saturday of last season, when he pitched, although outsiders did not know it at the time, with a torn meniscus. After knee surgery, he is back.On Monday, Santana looked sharp early, breaking off his nasty left-handed slants on the knees of right-handed hitters.With it raining, some of the Yankees had time to loll on the couch, watch Santana and play umpire, guffawing at one bad call at first base.Santana lasted 99 pitches, out in the sixth inning after giving up three hits and striking out seven.Then money talked. The Mets brought in the new bullpen tandem, J. J. Putz and Frankie Rodríguez, who cost $13.1 million for three years and $37 million for three years in last winter’s major upgrade, which was virtually mandatory or else the Mets might not have dared to play eighth and ninth innings this season.By the time the two new relievers were shutting down the Reds in frigid Cincinnati, the Yankees were going through the ritual booing in windy but brightening Baltimore.There were Yankees fans everywhere (four No. 2 jerseys right behind the Yankees’ dugout) but not as many as there usually are later in the season, when Yankees fans (and Red Sox fans) take over Camden Yards.Yankees Manager Joe Girardi cautioned about opening days, “What you have on Sunday is different from what you have on Monday.” He promised he would not overwork his imported ace, saying, “He is a big, strong man,” but noting that Sabathia had not thrown more than 95 pitches in any spring game.Sabathia never seemed comfortable, throwing two wild pitches in the same inning, the first time in his career he had done that.On television, he was seen holding a hot-water bottle against his midsection — “just trying to keep warm, man,” he said later.He threw 96 pitches, giving up eight hits and six runs, five of them earned, in four and a third innings. He later said, “I definitely feel I let us down today, but five days from now, we’ll start again.”Because it was opening day, some of the once-a-year fans headed for the exits after the seventh inning, with the Orioles holding a gigantic one-run lead. They must not have seen any Yankees-Orioles games in the past decade. But plenty of locals were left to roar when Teixeira the home-boy made the final out in the eighth, with the tying run on base.“I expected nothing less,” he said later, seeming happy to know his hometown people had not lost their edge.In the bottom of the eighth, an orange-clad fan in left field stuck out his glove and deflected the ball away from Johnny Damon as César Izturis’s fly ball plopped into the stands for a two-run insurance homer. Damon said he thought it was interference but did not complain.The play was reminiscent of the young fan who turned a fly ball by Derek Jeter into a home run in the 1996 postseason, which, it could be argued, sent the Yankees and the Orioles in opposite directions.Next week, there will be two more home openers — one at the Mets’ new park on Monday and one at the looming new fortress in the Bronx next Thursday. Undoubtedly, we will be getting back to the issue of the bad sight lines in the two new palaces. At the prices they pay, no wonder the fans are furious, and it is not even opening day yet in New York.'"
"'09-04-07,'0','Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany made a surprise visit to troops in Afghanistan on Monday but left about 20 minutes before a rocket attack on the base in Kunduz, according to a statement released by the German government. The attack failed and none of the 700 German soldiers stationed there were wounded, the government said. The German Web site Spiegel Online reported that a Taliban spokesman called it “a targeted attack against Angela Merkel.” Germany has roughly 3,800 troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO mission there, and plans to send an additional 600 ahead of presidential elections in August.'"
"'09-04-07,'0','Indexes in New York, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo have all risen sharply from March lows. Rousing rhetoric from world leaders partly explains the fillip. Expectations of inflation caused by stimulus plans, against which stocks offer a long-term hedge, might be another.But it’s too soon to say that markets are enjoying a sustained rally. Evidence that earnings are close to bottoming is scarce. Even HSBC admits that it has little visibility for how the worsening economy will affect its business.Issuers would be wise to seize the moment. By the same token, investors need to exercise caution.The convertible bond market has returned to life. After several quiet months, companies are rushing to sell the bonds, which can eventually be converted into common stock. Of the $3.3 billion sold in the first quarter, the vast majority occurred in March — nearly a third in its final week, according to Dealogic.This trend has room to run as long as balance sheets are stretched, stock prices keep swinging, and investors think share prices are low.One reason for the sudden thaw in the market is that time has cured some old troubles. Before the crisis, perhaps 70 percent of demand came from practitioners of convertible arbitrage, who aimed to profit from the interplay of the debtlike and equitylike characteristics of the securities.But then falling debt values, investor redemptions and the ban on short-selling stocks killed or wounded many of these specialist funds. Some dumped their holdings. Furthermore, as stocks cratered, convertibles lost their appeal for issuers.Many small technology companies issued them in the boom years at low interest rates because investors had the kicker of conversion into stock they hoped would appreciate. But when it came time to refinance in a bear market, the cost was too high.Today, volatility has made the stock option embedded in convertible securities valuable, giving issuers relatively low interest rates while giving investors upside potential. Attractive prices on new issues and rising equity markets have also greased demand.Alcoa sold $575 million of convertibles on March 18 with a 5.25 percent coupon and a conversion price of 23 percent above the price at which it also sold new shares that same day. Alcoa’s stock blew past the strike price within two days.But the company also benefited as the coupon it is paying was a lot lower than the double-digit rate it would likely have had to pay on straight debt. There is still a danger that this bull market could skid to a halt. The recent optimism in stocks could evaporate. Or, less likely, credit could come flooding back, making old-fashioned debt more cost-effective.But barring that, the convertibles rush is on. JOHN FOLEY and ROBERT CYRAN'"
"'09-04-07,'0','But, as we’ve learned the hard way these last couple of years, risk-free investing is an oxymoron.So where did the risk go this time?To the F.D.I.C., and ultimately, to us taxpayers. A close reading of the F.D.I.C.’s statute suggests the agency is using a unique — some might call it plain wrong — reading of its own rule book to accomplish this high-wire act.Somehow, in the name of solving the financial crisis, the F.D.I.C. has seemingly been given a blank check, with virtually no oversight by Congress.“Nobody is paying any attention to how they’re pulling this off,” said a prominent securities lawyer who has done work for the government. Not surprisingly, he, along with others I asked to review the program, declined to be quoted by name. “They may not be breaking the letter of the law, but they’re sure disregarding its spirit.”The F.D.I.C. is insuring the program, called the Public-Private Investment Program, by using a special provision in its charter that allows it to take extraordinary steps when an “emergency determination by secretary of the Treasury” is made to mitigate “systemic risk.”Simple enough, but that language seems to bump up against another, perhaps more important provision. That provision clearly limits its ability to borrow, guarantee or take on obligations of more than $30 billion.The exact legalistic language says that it “may not issue or incur any obligation” over that limit. (You can read a highlighted version of the F.D.I.C.’s charter at nytimes.com/dealbook.)So how is the F.D.I.C. planning to insure more than $1 trillion in new obligations? This is where things get complicated and questions are being raised.The plan hinges on the unique, and somewhat perverse, way the F.D.I.C. values the loans. It considers their value not as the total obligation, but as “contingent liabilities” — meaning what it expects it could possibly lose. As the F.D.I.C’s charter dictates: “The corporation shall value any contingent liability at its expected cost to the corporation.”So how much does the F.D.I.C. think it might lose?“We project no losses,” Sheila Bair, the chairwoman, told me in an interview. Zero? Really? “Our accountants have signed off on no net losses,” she said. (Well, that’s one way to stay under the borrowing cap.)By this logic, though, the F.D.I.C. appears to have determined it can lend an unlimited amount of money to anyone so long as it believes, at least at the moment, that it won’t lose any money.Here’s the F.D.I.C.’s explanation: It says it plans to carefully vet every loan that gets made and it will receive fees and collateral in exchange. And then there’s the safety net: If it loses money from insuring those investments, it will assess the financial industry a fee to pay the agency back.But think about this for a moment: if the program doesn’t work — and let’s hope it succeeds — the F.D.I.C. would be forced to “assess” banks it is hoping to save, possibly bankrupting them in the process. After all, if the F.D.I.C. starts losing money, it will probably be because the broader economic environment is deteriorating further. So those fees will a new burden at a time when key financial players can least afford them.Ms. Bair said that she can not imagine the F.D.I.C. losing money on the scale I suggested in my doomsday scenario. She said that before announcing the program, the F.D.I.C.’s lawyers determined that the statute allowed it to guarantee loans by valuing them as contigent liabilities. “That’s how we’ve interpreted it,” she said, adding that the determination was made back in October when the F.D.I.C. first introduced the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, which is also backed by the F.D.I.C.She also defended her agency saying that the F.D.I.C. has not experienced mission creep: the various programs that it is participating in are meant to insure the stability of the financial system, which she says was always the goal of the agency. She also pointed out that under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, so far, the agency hasn’t lost a dollar — and more important, she said, the program has worked to stabilize the banking system.All true, but that has come as the burden on the F.D.I.C. has increased as it pays out more to cover losses of failed banks.In a letter to the financial industry last month seeking an assessment that could be as much as $27 billion, Ms. Bair wrote, “Without these assessments, the deposit insurance fund could become insolvent this year.” Ms. Bair seems to recognize that the borrowing limit of $30 billion makes her job difficult. And two officials with a lot of sway in this area have sought to raise the F.D.I.C.’s borrowing limit (by $100 billion, according to a bill introduced by Representative Barney Frank, and by $500 billion, in a bill introduced by Senator Christopher Dodd).But then again, who needs a borrowing limit when the potential liabilities from the new program seem to be zero?If the P.P.I.P. program works — and again, it’s in everybody’s interest to cheer it on — it will be a boon for the economy and participating investors, who will likely make off like bandits.If the program fails, however, there will be heavy losses on us. In other words, taxpayers could be the ones stuck with billions of dollars in “contingent liabilities.”And these days, whenever anybody talks about risk-free investing, it’s not hard to hear the famous line uttered by Joseph J. Cassano of A.I.G. in 2007: “It is hard for us, without being flippant, to even see a scenario within any kind of realm of reason that would see us losing one dollar in any of those transactions.”'"
"'09-04-07,'0','The United States and some Western countries have accused Iran of having a clandestine nuclear weapons program, but Iran contends that its program is aimed at producing nuclear energy.Still, the presidential race seems to be shaping up as a clear choice on June 12 between Mr. Ahmadinejad and Mr. Moussavi. For now, they are the leading candidates, although there is still time for others to enter the race.Former President Mohammad Khatami was considered a leading moderate candidate until he withdrew from the race when Mr. Moussavi entered. Aides said he quit so as not to split the vote against Mr. Ahmadinejad.Mr. Moussavi, 68, is remembered for his protectionist economic policies and for introducing food rationing. An architect and painter, he has not held a government post since the Constitution was amended to eliminate the position of prime minister in 1989.He is seen as more conservative than Mr. Khatami, and consequently would be expected to face less opposition. Mr. Khatami, president from 1997 to 2005, acquired strong enemies among politicians who opposed his policies of greater political and social openness.Mr. Moussavi said Monday that he favored freedoms of speech and the press and would try to change the law that bans private television stations.He said that relations with the United States would have advantages for Iran and he acknowledged the change of tone in the new American administration. “But we have to wait and see how it will change the accusations against us,” he said, referring to charges that Iran is trying to build a nuclear bomb and that it supports terrorists.Responding to a question about the Holocaust, which Mr. Ahmadinejad has dismissed as a myth, he said, “Islam is against killing of anyone, even one person, and considers it genocide.”“But we do not understand why the Palestinians should pay for it now,” he added.Although asked twice about the Holocaust, he did not explicitly acknowledge its existence.'"
"'09-04-07,'0','“The tone I’m hearing across the board is notably improved,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, which specializes in debt securities. “Portfolio managers are feeling better about their sectors. The story is the most positive it’s been in months.” Which, admittedly, is not saying too much.The market for loans and corporate bonds went into lockdown mode last autumn after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Lending dried up, bond values plunged and skittish banks started charging hefty premiums to part with their money for even a short while.But huge rescue measures and guarantees by the Treasury and Federal Reserve have helped to shore up the credit markets, and some tentative signs of life in the wider economy are now encouraging lenders and borrowers to rethink their apocalyptic outlooks.“The fundamentals are still poor, but a lot of bonds are priced for an extraordinarily high default rate,” Ms. Caron said. “We’ve priced in a pretty disastrous outcome, so anything short of disaster bodes well for these bonds.”On Monday, the Federal Reserve and central banks in Britain, Japan and Europe continued to try to chip away at the credit problem. They announced an agreement that could provide about $287 billion in liquidity to the Federal Reserve, in the form of currency swaps.The Fed could draw on these lines to provide more liquidity to financial institutions, this time using euros, British pounds, Swiss francs and yen. Last fall, the Fed and other central banks set up swap agreements to provide dollars to foreign banks, and some analysts said the pendulum was now swinging the other way.“This really underlines the globalization of the monetary system,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange strategist at CMC Markets. “You could say that the global central banks are being used as an indirect means of shoring up liquidity in a nation’s commercial banks.”Credit markets and stock markets have largely been riding the same updraft in the last four weeks. A swell of optimism, ignited by the government’s new bailout plans and some positive chatter from banks about their profitability, has lifted shares from their lowest levels in 12 years and rescued credit markets, which had been stumbling back toward the bad old days of last year.Businesses with better credit ratings issued $200 billion of debt in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, compared with $188 billion a year ago.Even as credit rating agencies predict high rates of default for 2009 and junk-rated companies like General Growth Properties, the shopping mall owner, struggle to avoid bankruptcy, investors are pushing more money into high-yield debt. Junk bonds just ended their best quarter in five years, and a report by AMG Data Services said that $923 million flowed into junk-bond mutual funds last week, the most since 2005.“We’re definitely getting money coming back,” said Jeremy Hughes, a high-yield portfolio manager at Aviva Investors. “The risk appetite has definitely returned, at least for the time being.”Yields on junk bonds are about 16.5 percentage points more than Treasuries, a fat premium for risk by historical standards. But the gap has narrowed from nearly 22 percentage points in mid-December, according to Merrill Lynch indexes, and it has fallen over the last four weeks as stocks raced higher.As the Dow Jones industrial average closed above 8,000 on Friday for the first time since February, other crucial measures of lending also wrapped up a winning week.The London interbank offered rate, known as Libor, which tracks borrowing costs among banks, fell to 1.16 percent, down from 1.27 percent a month ago and sharply lower than the 4.8 percent interest banks charged each other at the peak of the credit crisis.The gap between borrowing costs for banks as reflected by the Libor and for the federal government, and, as such, a measure of confidence in banks, was at 0.97 points on Monday, close to its lowest and most optimistic levels since February and about where it was last summer. Last October, as Washington groped to address the financial crisis, the gap, known as the Ted spread, spiked to 4.6 points.Of course, credit markets are still fragile. Ratings agencies are slashing the credit scores of companies, including General Electric, whose previously triple-A credit rating was cut two notches by Moody’s, to Aa2. Bondholders at General Motors are bracing for the possibility of losing billions of dollars in unsecured debt if the automaker files for bankruptcy protection.And if unemployment continues to race higher or the stimulus fails to take root and the economy enters a deeper period of decline, many of the tentative gains in credit could come undone, analysts say.Even if the markets continue to improve tick by tick, some analysts wonder whether they are truly getting better, or merely being kept alive by a huge apparatus of government support systems propping up everything from short-term commercial paper to money markets to home mortgages.“The question to ask is not whether credit markets have improved,” said Jeff Rosenberg, head of credit strategy research at Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. “The question is, what is the source of the improvement? Can credit markets function without significant government intervention? Indisputably, the answer is no.”'"
"'09-04-07,'0','DETROIT (AP) — Michael Jordan was elected to basketball’s Hall of Fame on Monday along with David Robinson and John Stockton.The Rutgers women’s coach C.

"'09-04-07,'0','LOS ANGELES  Less than a week after a pirated copy of the unreleased movie “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” popped up on the Internet, federal legislators and entertainment executives presented an extraordinarily bleak picture of the damage digital piracy can inflict, and the grim prospects for limiting it.At a Monday morning Congressional field hearing here, lawmakers and executives both described a deteriorating situation in which $20 billion annually in copyrighted movies, music and other entertainment are being lost to global piracy networks that are tolerated or encouraged by countries like China, Russia, India and  in a case that drew special attention  Canada.Representative Howard L. Berman, a Democrat from the Los Angeles area who conducted the hearing as chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said he planned to offer legislation that would “begin to elevate the attention” given to foreign piracy, but offered no specifics.Representative Brad J. Sherman, another Democrat of California, said at one point that countries that failed to stem the theft of United States copyrighted material still had full access to American markets for their own wares. “That will get very controversial,” Mr. Sherman said.A panel of entertainment executives and others chronicled what appeared to be a largely failing effort to stem the illegal sale of copyrighted material in an increasingly wired world.Richard Cook, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, traced an elaborate chain of events under which the studio’s animated hit “Wall-E” was duplicated by a camcorder at a theater in Kiev last July. In less than a month, he said, the single copy was traced to illegal sales in more than a dozen countries.Zach Horowitz, president and chief operating officer of the Universal Music Group, estimated that only one in three music CDs and one in 20 downloads around the world are sold legitimately.Mr. Horowitz and others drew particular attention to Baidu, a Chinese search engine that offers links to sites offering pirated material.“It’s time to bring the hammer down,” said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California.Yet no one on the industry panel offered a proposal when Mr. Rohrabacher asked them to describe a measure that might, for instance, persuade Canada to change a policy under which large shipments of illegal movies and music, according to the legislators and executives, are permitted to pass from that country to the United States.One of the strongest possible measures was offered by Steven Soderbergh, who testified as a vice president of the Directors Guild of America. He proposed that the entertainment industry be “deputized to solve our own problems,” under a model that is being tried in France.Pressed later for details of the French plan, Mr. Soderbergh stumbled a bit and said he was not quite sure how it might work.People who have worked closely on Hollywood copyright issues described a French-like solution as a plan under which those who believe their copyright has been infringed might ask an Internet service provider to send successive warnings to an illegal downloader.If the warnings fail, the downloader might then be barred from using the provider for a time and be placed on a national registry that would block access to other providers.To pass laws with similar steps in the United States “is going to be tricky,” Mr. Soderbergh acknowledged during the hearing.'"
"'09-04-07,'0','For old television shows, there’s Hulu. For college lectures, there’s iTunes U. And now, for videos about art, there’s ArtBabble, a Web site created by the Indianapolis Museum of Art that offers videos from sources including the Museum of Modern Art and the PBS series “Art:21.”In the last few years, as museums have tried to take advantage of the Internet to connect with young audiences, they have produced an increasing number of online videos, from artist interviews and time-lapse shots of exhibition installations to short profiles of curators, art handlers, and even museum guards. Most institutions feature these videos on their own Web sites, as well as uploading them to sites like YouTube or blip.tv. But until now, there has been no dedicated place on the Web for art videos.ArtBabble (artbabble.org), which goes live to the public on Tuesday, is intended to change that. For the roll-out the Indianapolis museum invited a handful of institutions, including the New York Public Library, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, to take part. In the long run, it hopes to add more institutions, so that ArtBabble becomes “the destination for art content online,” Daniel Incandela, the director of new media at the Indianapolis museum, said in an interview.On sites like YouTube, an artist interview can get lost among the “music videos, blooper videos, and sort of more viral, edgier content,” Mr. Incandela added. There is also no easy way to browse content from multiple museums, and, until recently, videos weren’t available in high definition.On ArtBabble the majority of videos are in high definition. The design of the home page is clean and is clearly meant to draw in nonspecialists, with speech bubbles featuring punchy quotations that, when clicked on, jump to the relevant videos. (A mock dictionary entry defines “ArtBabble” as “a place where everyone is invited to join an open, ongoing discussion  no art degree required.”)The most unusual feature of the site is the “notes” that accompany each video. The notes run down a window to the right of the screen, offering links to related material on the Web. For example, in an interview with the artist Robert Irwin, when Mr. Irwin mentions the sculptors Mark di Suvero and Richard Serra, the notes offer links to the Wikipedia entries for each artist. A reference to the gardens that Mr. Irwin designed at the Getty Center in Los Angeles provides links to the Getty Center’s Web site (getty.edu) and a YouTube video of the gardens. Representatives of several of the partner institutions said that they were most excited about the notes feature and its potential.“We can give an online viewer the opportunity to take countless tangents,” said Joshua Greenberg, director of digital strategy at the New York Public Library. “It fits the core premise of librarianship, that it’s not just about putting something in someone’s hands but contextualizing it.”The hosting fees and other expenses of ArtBabble are being covered by the Indianapolis museum, with the help of a $50,000 grant from the Ball Brothers Foundation. (ArtBabble is free to users.) If the site becomes popular, the museum will look for corporate sponsorship, the museum’s director, Maxwell Anderson, said.Mr. Anderson said the goal behind ArtBabble, and the museum’s own video production, is to allow visitors to “experience the life of museums,” whether through employee profiles, studio visits with artists or videos of conservators restoring objects. The advantage of making the new video site a collaborative one was obvious, he said: “The strength and potency of this as a shared site is much greater than one museum at a time.”The Indianapolis museum has been a pioneer in using the Internet to provide greater transparency about museum operations. A section of its Web site (imamuseum.org) called the Dashboard offers current information about the value of the museum’s endowment, the number of visitors and its average daily energy consumption. The museum also recently created an online database of works it has deaccessioned.Mr. Incandela acknowledged that the ultimate success of ArtBabble will depend, at least partly, on what other institutions the Indianapolis museum persuades to join.Internationally, one museum that has devoted substantial resources to producing videos is the Tate. In collaboration with British Telecom, the Tate has put hundreds of videos on its Web site, tate.org.uk, from studio visits with Jeff Koons and Gilbert & George to archival interview footage with Francis Bacon. Reached by phone, Will Gompertz, the director of Tate Media, the branch of the museum that oversees its video production, said that he had not previously heard of ArtBabble, but based on a description, he thought it was a great idea.“Tate would be delighted” to put its videos on a site like ArtBabble, Mr. Gompertz said, adding, “Nothing in this new world can be achieved alone.”'"

"'09-04-07,'0','CINCINNATI — Mets leading by one. Out goes the starter. Ten outs to go.Such a situation last season would have had Jerry Manuel making seven pitching changes, Johan Santana covering his eyes in the clubhouse and fans preparing for another loss.On Monday, the Mets’ bullpen, a symbol of their most recent implosion, produced perhaps the most orderly ending possible to their 2-1 season-opening victory against the Cincinnati Reds. After Santana departed in the sixth inning, the three relievers imported as part of the off-season overhaul — Sean Green, J. J. Putz and Francisco Rodríguez — allowed only one base runner in preserving his win. The only late-inning drama on this raw and frigid day — it was 37 degrees at first pitch — came before the bottom of the eighth, when Putz dodged an ice patch as he exited the bullpen.“They deserve all the credit today,” said Santana, who had seven potential victories blown by the bullpen last season. “That was something we were very inconsistent with last year, so to see us get that out of the way in the first game is definitely great for us and brings our confidence level up. That’s what this team is going to be all about, and we showed it today.”Not every game this season will unfold as neatly as it did Monday. That late-inning tandem of Putz and Rodríguez, however lethal, will stumble, hard as it may seem to believe now, with the Mets sitting in first place in the National League East and with a zero beneath the L column in the standings. The Mets will not always allow three hits or one run, just as they will not always leave 12 runners on base, go 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position or have a runner (David Wright) thrown out at the plate.And that is why they will focus just as much on the other important elements — some surprising, others not — when evaluating how the victory came together, and why the margin was not greater.'"
"'09-04-07,'0','“The key issue is too much government protection,” Yegor T. Gaidar, a former prime minister, said. “The factory will create as many problems for the Russian economy as General Motors for the States.”Moscow’s concerns extend far beyond automobiles. As mounting economic anxiety prompts worker protests from China to Ukraine to the Czech Republic, politicians and economists say the Kremlin is calculating that it can keep the peace by bailing out Russian workers.The country’s manufacturing base, wobbly in the best of times, is contracting quickly in the global downturn. Layoffs are spreading. Manufacturing declined by 13 percent in February alone. And industrial discontent is stirring in the most hardscrabble Russian factory towns.On March 11, 16 Russian steelworkers announced a hunger strike to protest wage cuts at a Ural Mountain mill. (The same week Severstal, one of Russia’s largest steel makers, announced it would lay off 9,000 to 9,500 workers.)Here in Tolyatti, when a G.M. joint venture laid off 400 people in December, riot officers were called in to disperse an angry crowd that had gathered in the plant parking lot.It is a trend with a history here; a shrinking manufacturing base in the late Soviet period contributed to social unrest. To keep that from happening now, government officials promised at a meeting here last week to give additional aid to the factory: $730 million in an interest-free loan for one year, $230 million in loans from state banks at a favorable rate, and a commitment by state-owned banks to help Avtovaz raise an additional $2.6 billion from banks.“Avtovaz, along with producing cars, is fulfilling a social role. It is employing the population. Either fortunately or unfortunately, the state must support Avtovaz,” Vladimir R. Yagutyan, a former deputy mayor of Tolyatti, said in an interview. “The stability of the town depends on it.”Apart from the company’s role as an employer, economists see little point in propping up such an aging giant.The factory, a monument to Soviet gigantism in industrial design, is a panoramic sprawl of pipes and smokestacks on a bank of the Volga River, 460 miles southeast of Moscow. It employs 104,000 assembly line workers, many of whom still toil with hand-held wrenches.All told, the Avtovaz factory and its suppliers support two million jobs, according to a statement by the factory’s management, out of a total Russian work force of about 75 million. Many of those jobs are in small and medium-size towns not far from Moscow.The collapse of the car market came later in Russia than in the United States, but it could be more severe. Russia had been the fastest growing major car market in the world, with 35 percent growth in 2007. The country was projected to surpass Germany as Europe’s largest automotive market in 2009; that is no longer the case.Now car sales are projected to fall 25 to 50 percent, or 1.6 million to 2.3 million vehicles, according to a report by the Moscow office of PricewaterhouseCoopers.Last fall, the Russian government deftly shifted the economic hardship away from this politically fragile car industry belt in central Russia. It imposed a tariff on imported cars. The move set off protests and a police crackdown — but in Vladivostok, a major center for importing and servicing secondhand Japanese cars, more than 5,000 miles from Moscow.Now, the government is backing a no-layoff policy at Avtovaz, in spite of tumbling demand for its products. The government is also subsidizing auto loans to stimulate demand. The factory has requested state loan guarantees, which were approved last week.Even employees forced to take furloughs seemed unconcerned about being laid off. “The factory is our wet nurse,” Denis N. Makarov, a clerk in the factory office, said. “We have nothing else. If it stops, the whole town will be out on the streets. We all understand this.”Still, Timofey G. Bushuyev, 59, a sheet metal worker, said he understood the factory’s troubles last year when he bought a new Lada only to discover the horn and heater did not work and the belts squeaked.In a possible silver lining for Avtovaz, more expensive foreign brands have fared worse. G.M., Hyundai and Toyota, all companies with assembly lines in Russia, were among the biggest losers.Avtovaz’s management, in a written response to questions, hailed the company’s “indisputable advantages” in a downturn owing to its inexpensive product line. The car now marketed as the Klassika — a design for the squared-off Fiat 124 that the company bought in 1974 — sells for $4,160.“In crises Avtovaz always had a product people wanted to buy,” the company said. “From the onset of the crisis Avtovaz has not laid anybody off, and does not plan to do so.” Instead, the factory has gone to a four-day week, with two six-hour shifts. Workers are offered voluntary furloughs at two-thirds pay.But even the unions, used to believing the worst of management, say layoffs are inconceivable here.“It would become a political issue for this city and this country,” Andrei A.

"'09-04-07,'0','Central banks in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan announced an agreement on Monday that could provide some $287 billion in liquidity to the Federal Reserve, in the form of currency swaps.Under the arrangement, the Fed could draw on these lines to provide more liquidity to financial institutions, this time in the form of foreign currency.The announcement was the latest in a series of coordinated efforts between the Federal Reserve and other central banks to try to unlock credit markets, restore normal lending and raise confidence in the financial system.“Should the need arise, euro, yen, sterling and Swiss francs would be provided to the Federal Reserve via these additional swap agreements with the relevant central banks,” the Federal Reserve said in a statement. “Central banks continue to work together and are taking steps as appropriate to foster stability in global financial markets.”The Bank of England agreed to provide £30 billion ($44.7 billion) in currency swaps, while the European Central Bank said it would provide 80 billion euros ($108 billion). The Swiss National Bank offered 40 billion in Swiss francs ($35 billion) while the Bank of Japan said it would provide 10 trillion yen ($100 billion).The currency-swap agreements would be active through Oct. 30. So far, the Fed has not announced that it has drawn on any of these lines.“This really underlines the globalization of the monetary system,” said Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign exchange strategist at CMC Markets. “You could say that the global central banks are being used as an indirect means of shoring up liquidity in a nation’s commercial banks.”'"

"'09-04-08,'1','But given the economic decline, nine states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and South Carolina — have already announced cuts to state-run pre-kindergarten programs, Dr. Barnett said.And legislatures are debating cutbacks in some others, including Tennessee and Washington State, he said.“All of this may produce dire consequences for state pre-K programs,” says the new report, the State of Preschool 2008, by the National Institute for Early Education Researchat the Rutgers Graduate School of Education. “In most states, expenditures on pre-K are entirely discretionary and therefore easier to cut than expenditures for some other program.”Meanwhile, however, at President Obama’s request, Congress has significantly raised federal financing for preschool education. Mr. Obama promised during the campaign to make large new investments in early childhood education, and in the economic stimulus package, Congress appropriated more than $4 billion for Head Start and Early Head Start programs and for grants to states to support child care for low-income families.“The big picture here is that for the last eight years, the only game around for early childhood was in the states, because under Bush there was nothing going on at the federal level,” said Cornelia Grumman, executive director of the First Five Years Fund, an advocacy group based in Chicago. “All of a sudden that’s changed. Now the only game is federal, because if you’re a state-funded program relying on your state legislature, well, it’s not a rosy picture.”The two largest federal preschool programs are Head Start, which serves low-income 3- and 4-year-olds and was begun by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965, and Early Head Start, which serves infants and pregnant mothers and was inaugurated under President Bill Clinton in 1994. The combined budget for both programs was $6.5 billion in 2002. In 2008, Mr. Bush’s last full year in office, their combined budget was $6.9 billion.The National Head Start Association, a nonprofit advocacy group, says that when inflation is taken into account, the financing for the two programs declined 13 percent from 2002 to 2008.Under the Obama administration, financing for Head Start and Early Head Start has been separated and has greatly increased. The stimulus law includes $1 billion for Head Start, which last year served about 830,000 children, and the 2009 budget includes an additional $235 million.The stimulus law increases financing for Early Head Start, which serves 62,000 families, by $1.1 billion. That will allow the program to enroll an additional 55,000 families.Mr. Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan say their enthusiasm for early childhood education is based on research showing large paybacks for every dollar spent on the careful nurturing of poor children.Mr. Duncan repeated those arguments at a forum on early learning in Washington last week. “For every dollar we spend on these programs, we get nearly $10 back in reduced welfare rolls, fewer health care costs and less crime,” Mr. Duncan said.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Two senior American officials came under withering public criticism from Pakistan on Tuesday, with the Pakistani foreign minister saying that “trust” between the countries was in question, particularly over the issue of American missile attacks in Pakistan’s tribal areas.With the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, and the special envoy to the region, Richard C.

Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, refused to meet separately with Mr. Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen, who had requested a meeting, according to Pakistani officials and an American official, who sought anonymity because he did not want to further damage relations.General Pasha did attend a meeting with the two Americans and Pakistani military’s chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, according to a statement issued by the press arm of the Pakistani Army after Mr. Holbrooke and Admiral Mullen left Islamabad for India on Tuesday night.Mr. Qureshi singled out the issue of the remotely piloted aircraft armed with missiles that the United States used against Al Qaeda’s havens in the tribal areas adjacent to Afghanistan.'"

"'09-04-08,'1','For the past six seasons, the Mets have marketed their games according to the sizzle of the opponents, and which day and month the games are played. Tickets are priced by tier: Bronze games, for example, are against weaker teams like the Pirates; platinum games, the most expensive, are on opening day and against the Yankees. The better the metal, the more costly the ticket.This year, with a new stadium as an extra draw, the Mets not only raised ticket prices 8.6 percent, they also moved more games to costlier tiers. When the tier system was introduced in 2003, there were only 17 gold games. Now there are 30. The number of games in the bronze and value categories has fallen to 28, from 43. For this season, nearly two-thirds of the Mets’ 81 home contests are classified as silver, gold or platinum games. As recently as 2005, only 44 percent of the team’s home games were in these tiers. Games that were in the value or bronze categories in years past have been upgraded to silver and gold this year, including night games next week against the San Diego Padres and weekend games against the Washington Nationals in September.David Newman, the Mets’ senior vice president for marketing and communications, said that the tier inflation was based on the team’s improvement in the standings over the past few years and the high demand to see the new ballpark, which has more amenities than Shea Stadium yet 15,000 fewer seats.About half the major league clubs have variable ticket prices, but the Mets have more tiers than any other team and have fiddled with them more from season to season. They charge more for games against more competitive opponents like the Cubs and the Phillies, and for games played in summer months. Weekend games generally cost more than weeknight games. A field box seat for platinum games at Citi Field costs $175. The same seat for a value game against the Florida Marlins on an April weeknight is $75.As the recession deepens, the Mets are going against the trend. Ten teams cut their ticket prices this season, and another six teams left them unchanged or raised them by less than 1 percent. Another four teams raised prices by less than the leaguewide average of 5 percent, according to the Team Marketing Report, which compiles the Fan Cost Index. In effect, the Mets’ average ticket prices went up more than 8.6 percent because the Team Marketing Report includes only nonpremium seats in its calculations.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Administrators at the Chelsea Foyer at the Christopher, which houses dozens of former and current foster youths, said that typically, 90 percent of their residents were employed, but that in February only 70 percent had jobs.“They are the low man on the totem pole for jobs anyway,” said Jerome Kilbane, the executive director of Covenant House New York, a nonprofit that operates shelters for young people. “Now they are even more at a disadvantage.”Michael Smith, 20, said he was increasingly anxious as he approached the day in August that he will have to leave his foster home in . He has been searching for work since October, leaving résumés at places like and the clothing stores Express and H & M.Mr. Smith graduated from high school in in 2006 and went to Kingsborough Community College, but he dropped out after his sickle-cell caused him to miss class frequently.“I’m coming up to my 21st birthday, when I’m no longer going to be supported,” Mr. Smith said. “I feel overlooked all the times I do go apply for these jobs. But I have to do this, or else I’ll be out on the street.”Officials at the Administration for Children’s Services say they do everything possible to avert that, including the letters that help smooth the application process for public assistance.The child-welfare agency and the 36 foster-care groups with which it contracts begin to prepare children for independence as early as age 14. There are workshops on budgeting, job hunting, how to sign up for and how to negotiate with a landlord over rent.At age 19, foster youths begin to talk to caseworkers about housing options, which commonly include Section 8 vouchers, public housing projects and supportive housing, where counseling and job training might be available on site.The Administration for Children’s Services provides a one-time stipend of $750 as a cushion to foster youths when they exit the system. They are also eligible for a monthly payment of $300 from the city, from the time the leave foster care until they are 21 ½, if they are not receiving any other public housing subsidy, such as Section 8.Most of those leaving foster care are entitled to Section 8, which typically allows tenants to rent apartments for one-third of their monthly income. But that means they need income to qualify. And with unemployment rates in New York rising precipitously, foster-care workers are worried.“To be honest, I’m afraid that our youth are really going to be unable to secure housing,” said Jane Feyder, the assistant director at the New York Foundling Fontana Center for Child Protection. “They don’t have the work experience that other people have who are looking for jobs right now. They’re competing with so many other people who have advantages over them.”Even advocates for foster youth acknowledge that they are a particularly difficult group to employ.Many lack high school diplomas, having spent being shuttled from home to home. The responsibilities of a first job can come as a shock, and many quit out of frustration.“A year ago, if they’d lose one $9- an-hour job, there was usually another one that we could find them,” Mr. Golden said. “Now it’s a little more costly to become unemployed.”One of the former foster children in his care, Jessica Molina, landed a job in January 2008, working in computer technology at . She was laid off in June when the company downsized, and has been working at temporary jobs since.“Like everyone else, I have my fingers crossed that I’ll find something,” Ms. Molina, 22, said. But looking at the gaps in her résumé, she is often reminded of the constant moves between group homes she endured during her teenage years. “Sometimes you’re looked at as a castaway,” she said. “It’s like coming from a totally different place.”Brenda Tully, the program director for Chelsea Foyer at the Christopher, said residents have been laid off or seen their hours reduced at jobs in gyms, nightclubs and clothing stores.“There’s a much greater fear among the young people about what to expect,” Ms. Tully said. “They are very, very concerned that they’re not going to be able to find housing that’s affordable.”Stephany Diaz, a housing specialist for New York Foundling, one of the city’s largest foster-care agencies, said she has begun prodding youths to apply for public assistance once they are officially discharged from care.“I used to discourage them to go down that route,” she said. “But now we almost have to.”Since 2002, the Administration for Children’s Services has tried to move teenagers out of group homes and into foster care, hoping that when the time comes to leave, the children would have families to turn to.“We want children to leave care with a loving, caring and supportive adult who’s going to continue to work with them long past their 21st birthday,” said Lorraine Stephens, a deputy commissioner at the Administration for Children’s Services. “We don’t want any kid to leave without someone connected to them.”But many children have tenuous connections to foster families, at best.Mr. Smith, whose aunt is his foster parent, said staying with her after his 21st birthday is not an option. “She’s moving in with her boyfriend,” he said.Melissa Diaz, 19, left the foster care system more than a year ago, shortly after her foster mother died. Ms. Diaz later moved to Covenant House, and after nearly three months of searching found a job stocking shelves at Duane Reade.She is training to become a nursing assistant and trying to earn enough money to become independent and afford housing on her own. “That would be great,” she said. “It would be a blessing from God.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Even opponents of same-sex marriage recognized the week’s developments as a potential watershed moment that could subdue the effect of their Election Day victory in . Voters there narrowly approved Proposition 8, which amended the state’s Constitution to ban same-sex marriage, effectively reversing a decision by the state’s Supreme Court that had legalized it.“It’s a bad day for the country,” said Brian Brown, executive director of the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight same-sex marriage. “There is a palpable sense that something has changed and people need to get active.”Vermont, which in 2000 became the first state to adopt civil unions for gay couples, is now the fourth state to allow same-sex marriage. In addition to Iowa, the others are and .The vote in Vermont came on the same day the Council of the gave preliminary approval to a plan recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. Since Congress has the option of overriding that vote, the battle over same sex-marriage could end up on the federal stage this year.The mood among equal rights advocates is distinctly different now than in recent years, when state after state moved to legally define marriage as between a man and a woman. Voters approved constitutional bans on same-sex marriage in 26 states since the Massachusetts law, a landmark, took effect in 2004; the constitutions of four other states also limit marriage to heterosexuals.Advocates have acknowledged that they strategically chose the states in which they have won battles for same-sex marriage so far. While states like New York and New Jersey offer strong possibilities for additional victories, many others — especially those with constitutional bans on same-sex marriage — present formidable challenges.Jennifer C. Pizer, the marriage project director for Lambda Legal, said after the Iowa ruling on Friday that the approach in the states with constitutional bans would have to be different.“I think we will have a period that we really haven’t ever seen before in American history,” Ms. Pizer said, “of people needing to undo state constitutional amendments — which is not an easy thing to do.”Several groups that oppose same-sex marriage suggested Tuesday that the successive victories for gay rights advocates would give the opposition movement new energy. Mr. Brown, of the National Organization for Marriage, said the developments in Iowa and Vermont had prompted his group to start running advertisements against same-sex marriage in several states now, instead of in late spring, as originally planned. In particular, he said, the ruling in Iowa caught opponents off guard and invigorated them because they had not expected it so soon.His group will hold news conferences Wednesday in New Jersey and to denounce same-sex marriage bills under consideration there.“People are beginning to understand there is a systematic, targeted effort to get same-sex marriage through the legislatures in the Northeast,” he said, “to continue to work through the courts in other states, and ultimately to use these redefinitions of marriage to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act on the federal level.”The Defense of Marriage Act, passed by Congress in 1996, prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriage. It denies federal benefits, like survivors’ payments, to spouses in such marriages. Last month, a legal advocacy group in filed a lawsuit seeking to have the law overturned on equal protection grounds.Polls suggest that Americans remain divided on the issue. A CBS News poll last week found that while 6 out of 10 Americans think some form of legal recognition is appropriate for same-sex couples, only a third think those couples should be allowed to marry. Americans are somewhat more supportive of same-sex marriage than in 2004, when just 22 percent supported it.Last month, the House of Representatives in New Hampshire voted narrowly to approve a bill to legalize same-sex marriages. The Senate is expected to take up the bill in the next few weeks. The California Supreme Court is expected to rule in the coming months on a petition to overturn Proposition 8, but many legal scholars have predicted that it will be upheld.In Vermont, approval of the marriage bill had been expected in the Senate, where the vote was 23 to 5. But the outcome in the House of Representatives was not clear until the final moments of a long roll call, when Representative Jeff Young, a Democrat who voted against the bill last week reversed his position.Two other Democrats who had opposed the bill also supported the override, and one Democrat who had opposed it was absent. The vote was 100 to 49, slightly more than the required two-thirds majority of members present.After the final tally, cheers erupted in both chambers of the State House and in the hallways. Several lawmakers on both sides of the debate looked stunned.Representative Robert South, a freshman Democrat from a conservative district, said he reversed his position after 228 of his constituents reached out and urged him to support the override, compared with 198 who urged him to oppose it.“It was very difficult for me,” Mr. South said, “because the marriage equality bill, as far as I’m concerned, has split the state. I see how close my numbers are for and against same-sex marriage, and it’s divided my constituents, and that’s what upsets me.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The internal watchdog for the Treasury Department’s financial bailout program is auditing payments made by the American International Group to counterparties in its dealings, including Goldman Sachs.The audit was begun on Thursday, according to a letter sent to Representative Elijah E.

"'09-04-08,'1','Lewisburg is one of hundreds of small cities and counties across America reeling from their reliance in recent years on risky municipal bond that went bad. Municipalities that bought the derivatives were like homeowners with fixed-rate who refinanced by taking out lower-interest, variable-rate mortgages. But some local officials say they were not told, or did not understand, that interest rates could go much higher if economic conditions worsened — which, of course, they did.The municipal bond marketplace was so lightly regulated that in Morgan Keegan was able to dominate almost every phase of the business. The firm, which is based in , sold $2 billion worth of municipal bond derivatives to 38 cities and counties since 2001, according to data compiled by the state comptroller’s office.After The made inquiries, the Tennessee comptroller, Justin P. Wilson, ordered a statewide freeze on bond derivatives and a review of the seminar taught by Morgan Keegan and others.Representatives of Morgan Keegan pointed out that they saved cities and counties money for years by delivering lower interest rates, and that the economic decline that created the turmoil in the bond market was beyond their control. rating agency on Tuesday issued a negative outlook for the fiscal health of municipal governments.In , federal regulators are now considering ways to restrict the use of municipal bond derivatives. Regulators and some in the industry are challenging whether it is appropriate for large investment to engage small cities and counties in transactions that lower interest rates but carry higher risks.“When these sophisticated things were created, most people didn’t think they’d ever be used by the smallest issuers, who had the least amount of resources and knowledge and experience to understand the risks,” said Thomas G. Doe, the chief executive of Municipal Market Advisors, a bond strategy company in , Mass.In Lewisburg, the fallout from the bad confronted the city of 11,000 people at an inopportune moment. Unemployment just nudged past 10 percent, businesses like Penny’s Home Cooking are shuttered, and a sprawling new corporate park sits mostly empty. A nearby employer, Sanford Pencil, the maker of Sharpie pens, is preparing to move to .Unlike most states, Tennessee was one of the few where the legislature passed a law intended to regulate the sale of these complicated municipal bond derivatives to local governments. But the profusion of those deals and the various roles of Morgan Keegan have left leaders of those cities and counties furious at both the firm and the state.In Claiborne County, north of , officials said they were recently told by Morgan Keegan bankers that extracting themselves from a municipal bond derivative would cost $3 million, a sum the poor county cannot afford.“I told the Morgan Keegan man here in my office, ‘It seems to me, you are all trying to slip paperwork by us like a small, shady company,’ ” said Joe Duncan, the mayor of Claiborne County.In Mount Juliet, a suburb east of , city leaders were surprised to discover that the payments on its bonds had increased by 500 percent to $478,000. Morgan Keegan offered to refinance the bonds, but the city hired a new financial adviser and another investment bank.“We decided we needed advice from someone who was not trying to sell us something,” Mayor Linda Elam said.Mr. Wilson, the state comptroller, told a State Senate finance committee two weeks ago that his office was examining the guidelines on municipal bond derivatives, including the “swap school” taught by Morgan Keegan and the Nashville law firm of Bass, Berry & Sims, which often served as the bond counsel.An investment bank makes more in fees and annual income from derivatives than from fixed-rate bonds. Morgan Keegan has made millions of dollars in fees in Tennessee since 2001, but the precise number is not public.“I think the multiple roles of a single firm is something we should look at, and there well may be limitations or prohibitions,” Mr. Wilson, who became comptroller in January, said in an interview. In hindsight, he said, it “may not have been the best idea.”Municipal bond experts say they know of no other state where a firm was allowed to wear three hats; several states prohibit a single firm from acting as both adviser and underwriter. In , which has such a prohibition, federal prosecutors are investigating accusations that investment banks and financial advisers conspired to sell bonds with inflated fees to school districts.“It’s like the lion being hired to protect the gazelle,” Robert E. Brooks, a municipal bonds expert and a professor of financial management at the , said of the situation in Tennessee. “Who was looking after these little towns?”Morgan Keegan said local officials were unfairly blaming them for the economic downturn. “People are upset; we’re upset, too,” said Joseph K. Ayres, the firm’s managing director. “We’ve been very successful helping a lot of communities try to weather this storm. Obviously, there are going to be a few disappointments. People are going to look to find a scapegoat. We’re big boys and girls. We understand that.”Mr. Ayres denied that the firm had a conflict in advising municipalities and underwriting bond derivatives. He said that Morgan Keegan had taught the seminar at the request of the state and that they had offered unbiased descriptions of municipal bond options. He added that the firm had not marketed products during the sessions.“I don’t think the course was skewed at all,” Mr. Ayres said. “It was designed to deal equally with risk and reward. The course was approved by the state comptroller’s office.”Karen S. Neal, a lawyer at Bass, Berry & Sims, said the comptroller’s office had strictly monitored the seminars. “There was certainly no intent that they be biased one way or the other,” Ms. Neal said. “The intent was purely to educate people on the process, the mechanics, the legal requirements, the risks and the benefits.”For decades, the -exempt municipal bond was considered as safe a way to raise money as it was to invest money. If a city wanted to build a bridge, a hospital or a school, it raised the money by issuing a bond and repaid investors over decades. were considered conservative and dependable.Beginning in the late 1970s, big states like began to use variable rate bonds as a way to save money. By the late 1990s, some rural counties and small towns jumped on board as a way to avoid raising taxes.A swap allowed a municipality to keep a portion of its debt at a fixed interest rate and a portion at a variable rate. The municipality was, in effect, betting that interest rates would move in its favor. Investors protected themselves by taking out that guaranteed they would be paid. But as the nationwide credit market collapsed, most of the bond insurers’ credit ratings were downgraded, including the Ambac Financial Group, the primary insurer of Tennessee bonds. That allowed the investors to accelerate the of the debt, usually from 20 years to 7, leading to a steep increase in the interest rate.Although such a provision was in the swap contract, several local officials said that possibility had not been explained to them.The risks of the transactions were, in fact, on the minds of members of the Tennessee legislature in 1999, when they passed a law requiring a municipality to follow several procedures before receiving authorization from the comptroller to enter a swap agreement.Even with those regulations, the comptroller approved all 215 swap applications submitted in the state since 2001. “Tennessee was an unwitting conspirator in this whole mess,” said Emily Evans, a Nashville City Council member and former bond trader who was a critic of her city’s swap deal on the bond for the ’ stadium.One of the most important provisions of Tennessee’s law was education. In 2000, the state comptroller at the time, John G. Morgan, appointed nine government and industry representatives to establish guidelines for derivatives and devise a curriculum for the swap school. The panel included two lawyers from Bass, Berry & Sims and a Morgan Keegan banker.Mr. Morgan said he had asked business professors to teach the course, but they had declined. “So the job was left for the people who know the most about these intricate transactions — the people in the business,” he said. “I didn’t think there was a problem.”State records show that the comptroller’s office approved course material submitted by Morgan Keegan and Bass, Berry & Sims. In 2007, the comptroller approved a 300-page course book in two days, the records show.In a 177-page book used in 2003 and reviewed by several bond experts for The Times, there was far more about rewards than risks. On a page titled “Interest Rate Swap Risks” for example, there is no mention of the consequences of a downgrade in the bond insurer’s rating. Ms. Evans said the daylong seminars, held in Memphis, Nashville and Knoxville, amounted to “nothing more than an infomercial.”The first page of a manual used at a 2007 seminar quotes the former Fed chairman extolling the virtues of derivatives in 1999.Peter Shapiro, the managing director of Swap Financial Group of South Orange, N.J., said the material “certainly doesn’t have what we would consider the requisite amount of detail going through the risks, how they materialize and how you might attempt to mitigate them.”Sheila Luckett, the city recorder in Mount Juliet, attended the swap school twice. “It was way over my head,” she said. “I’m not a bonds person. People with Morgan Keegan told me, ‘Don’t worry if you don’t understand it.’ ”In many corners of Tennessee, the first anyone heard of interest-rate swaps was from C. L. Overman, a vice president of Morgan Keegan who assured officials that the deals carried little risk, city and county officials said.“He told us it would be a good thing and there wasn’t much downside,” said Mayor Duncan of Claiborne County. He then laughed, adding, “When everything went belly up, of course, they told us it wasn’t their fault.”Earlier this year, Claiborne County officials were told by Mr. Overman that they had only a few weeks to refinance an $18 million bond or pay a quadrupled quarterly payment of $700,000. Mr. Overman declined to comment for this article.In Lewisburg, after Mr. Overman pitched the swap idea for the sewer project, Kenneth E. Carr, a city official, attended the class. “The seminar was dull and boring,” said Mr. Carr, who still has a copy of the book, stamped with the state seal of Tennessee on every page. “I thought, ‘Well, this is approved by the state because they put their seal of approval on it. This must be something they think is good for us.’ ”Mr. Carr said he had not known the course would be taught by the bank and the law firm involved in Lewisburg’s deal. “It would have been better if someone neutral had taught the course,” he said. Even so, he said the officials making the decision never asked his opinion after the session.Connie W. Edde, Lewisburg’s finance director, said she had assumed the city would reject the proposal because “it was a big risk.” But hours before the City Council was to meet on the plan, Ms. Edde said, she saw the city’s superintendent for water and sewage return from lunch with Mr. Overman. The superintendent “announced that he decided this was now a good idea.” That evening, the plan passed.Mr. Ayres, the Morgan Keegan managing director, pointed out that Lewisburg had benefited from a relatively low interest rate of 2.5 percent, a rate that did not include the firm’s fees.This year, with residents facing a 33 percent increase in water and sewer rates, the city decided to refinance the bond, dropping Morgan Keegan and hiring another financial adviser. Mayor Phillips said the city would use fixed rate debt on its new bonds. “Nothing that says derivative, nothing that says swap,” he said. “We learned our lesson.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','But that has not changed the reality that Iraq remains religious, conservative — and still violent. The killers, the police say, are not just Shiite death squads, but also tribal and family members shamed by their gay relatives. (And the recent spate of violence has seemed aimed at more openly gay men, rather than homosexuality generally.)Clerics in Sadr City have urged followers to help root out homosexuality in Iraqi society, and the police have begun their own crackdown on gay men.“Homosexuality is against the law,” said Lt. Muthana Shaad, at a police station in the Karada district, a neighborhood that has become popular with gay men. “And it’s disgusting.”For the past four months, he said, officers have been engaged in a “campaign to clean up the streets and get the beggars and homosexuals off them.”Gay men, he said, can be arrested only if they are seen engaging in sex, but the police try to drive them away. “These people, we make sure they can’t get together in a shop or walk together in the street — we make them break up,” he said.Gay men and lesbians in Iraq have long been among the targets of both Shiite and Sunni death squads, but their murders have been overshadowed by the hundreds of overall weekly casualties during the height of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007.In 2005, the country’s most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah , issued a religious decree that said gay men and lesbians should be “punished, in fact, killed.” He added, “The people should be killed in the worst, most severe way of killing.” The language has since been removed from his Web site.In recent months, groups of gay men have been taking greater chances, gathering in cafes and other public places in Baghdad, Basra, Najaf and other cities. On a recent night in Sadr City, several, their hair parted down the middle, talked as they quietly sipped tea at a garishly lighted cafe, oblivious to the stares of passers-by.Basim, who would not give his last name out of fear for his safety, said he knew at least 20 young men from Sadr City’s large but hidden gay community who had disappeared during the past two months. He said he had learned later that each was found dead. After three of his friends were killed, he stayed inside his house for a week. Recently he has begun to go out again.“I can’t stay at home all day,” he said. “I need to see my friends.”Publicly, the Iraqi police have acknowledged only the deaths of six gay men in the neighborhood. But privately, police officials say the figure is far higher.The chief of a Sadr City police station, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to speak to reporters, said family members had probably committed most of the Sadr City killings. He played down the role of death squads that had once been associated with the , the militia that controlled Sadr City until American and Iraqi forces dislodged them last spring.“Our investigation has found that these incidents are being committed by relatives of the gays — not just because of the militias,” he said. “They are killing them because it is a shame on the family.”He said families typically refused to cooperate with the investigation or even to claim the bodies. No arrests have been made in the killings.At the same time, though, clerics associated with , an anti-American cleric with significant influence in Sadr City, have devoted a portion of Friday Prayer services to inveighing against homosexuality.“The community should be purified from such delinquent behavior like stealing, lying and the effeminacy phenomenon among men,” Sheik Jassem al-Mutairi said during his sermon last Friday. Homosexuality, he said, was “far from manhood and honesty.”Abu Muhaned al-Diraji, a Sadrist official in Sadr City, said the clerics were in no way encouraging people to kill gay men.“All we are doing is giving advice to people to take care of their sons,” Mr. Diraji said. He acknowledged, however, that some of the killing had been committed by members of “special groups,” or death squads.“In general, it is the families that are killing the gay son, but I know that there are gunmen involved in this, too,” he said. “But we disavow anybody committing this kind of crime and we encourage the people to follow the law.”In addition to the killings, a Sadr City cafe frequented by gay men recently burned down under mysterious circumstances.Some young gay men in Sadr City have become nihilistic about the ever present threat.“I don’t care about the militias anymore, because they’re going to kill me anyway — today, tomorrow or the day after,” said a man named Sa’ad, who has been taking and has developed small breasts. “I hate my community and my relatives. If they had their way, the result would be one gunshot.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','New York is hardly lacking in music festivals of all sizes and persuasions, so it takes a lot to make an up-and-comer stand out. Keys to the Future, founded by the pianist and composer Joseph Rubenstein in 2005, has carved a valuable niche for itself by focusing on contemporary piano music, doled out in two- and three-night series. The next festival is scheduled for May, but on Sunday night Mr. Rubenstein and several colleagues visited Le Poisson Rouge for a concert concentrating on one specific area of repertory, Minimalism.Or so the program said. But just one piece qualified as Minimalist in the narrow sense the term has come to imply: music constructed from relatively simple, straightforward melodic cells, tonal or modal harmonies, insistently repetitive rhythms and small, incremental changes that take place over extended, sometimes vast durations.By that definition, only Steve Reich’s “Piano Phase,” a powerful, influential phase-shifting piece from 1967, lived up to the billing. The artless elegance of six Howard Skempton miniatures, with which Mr. Rubenstein opened the concert, were less Minimalist than simply minimal: airy, slow-whirling mobiles not unlike those fashioned by Satie.The rest could more rightly be termed post-Minimalism: music that partakes of Minimalism’s rhythmic vibrancy and unambiguous tonality, but parcels them into concise portions. That loose definition allowed for a wide variety of styles. About all Ryan Brown’s “Ceramics” and David Lang’s “Wed” had in common, apart from being expertly handled here by Lisa Moore, was a single-minded focus through which simple musical materials were made to render specific, evocative results.Mr. Brown’s piece, inspired by his grandmother’s teacups, ran in bright, brittle circles around the highest notes of the keyboard. Mr. Lang’s work, which memorialized an artist friend who was married on her deathbed, used tiny stepwise motions to effect a haunting suspension between major and minor tonalities.John Adams, among the best-known composers still saddled with the Minimalist label, has produced precious little that fits the definition in decades. His “Hallelujah Junction,” played by Ms. Moore and Molly Morkoski, evoked broad, sunny prairie vistas in a way that Copland and the jazz guitarist Pat Metheny might recognize. Honky-tonk piano riffs, big-top pomp and a melodic line that mouths the word “hallelujah” all had a place in the work.Nico Muhly’s “Hudson Cycle,” played by Blair McMillen, suggested Philip Glass’s music reconfigured by someone with an ear for classic pop ballads: it was sweet, sophisticated, poignant and concise. Mr. McMillen and Stephen Gosling concluded with Mr. Reich’s “Piano Phase,” a bit of musical sleight of hand that retained every bit of its hypnotic mystery.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','The New York State Racing and Wagering Board issued a subpoena Tuesday to the prominent New York thoroughbred owner Ernie Paragallo concerning the treatment of his horses at his Center Brook Farm.The board is investigating Paragallo, a licensed authorized agent in New York who is associated with Paraneck Stable, and his involvement with the horses.“He has made some public comments about the condition of those horses,” Joseph Mahoney, the board’s spokesman, said, ”and we have serious questions about their treatment and conditions.”The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is also investigating whether Paragallo neglected and abused horses at Center Brook Farm, which is in Climax, about 20 miles south of Albany.Colleen Segarra, who picked up two malnourished horses at the farm Saturday, filed a police complaint that said she saw at least 16 other horses showing signs of distress. She also said that the farm’s manager told her that Paragallo had not provided proper food for his 125 horses there.Paragallo denied the charges Monday, and in doing so caught the attention of the board.“It was a rough winter,” he said Monday, adding: “I’m not going to lie — there’s seven or eight that are maybe 75 or 100 pounds underweight. The investigators suggested we change our feed, and we’re doing so. There’s a mare there that we’re feeding three times a day.”John D. Sabini, the chairman of the Racing and Wagering Board, also urged the state Thoroughbred Breeding and Development Fund, which distributes incentive awards to thoroughbred breeders and owners, not to issue any checks to Center Brook Farm, Paraneck Stable or Paragallo. Sabini is also on the board that directs the development fund.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Such escapist urges are also fueling sales of science fiction and fantasy, said Bob Wietrak, a vice president for merchandising at Barnes & Noble. Mr. Wietrak said sales of novels with vampires, shape shifters, werewolves and other paranormal creatures were “exploding,” whether they were found in the romance, fantasy or young-adult aisles, where Stephenie Meyer’s Twilight series continues to dominate and inspire look-alike books like the House of Night teen novels by P. C. Cast and Kristin Cast.Romance readers are considered among the most loyal fans, sticking to a series or an author once they have grown attached to one. “It’s a very dedicated audience who doesn’t see it as a luxury as much as a necessity,” said Liate Stehlik, publisher of William Morrow and Avon, imprints of HarperCollins Publishers.The romance genre may also be especially attractive to consumers during difficult economic times because so many of the books are sold in the mass-market format, smaller paperbacks often found on racks at the grocery store or in airport bookshops. These books sell for $7.99 or less, compared with $12 to $15 on larger trade paperbacks.Romance novels also often appear in discount chains like Wal-Mart or Kmart, where shoppers make impulse buys.“If you’re going to Wal-Mart or Target anyway, you’re more likely to go and pick up a book,” said Ms. Hayes of Harlequin. “And a book is such incredible value in this environment.” Several retailers including Kmart, Wal-Mart and Kroger have been running three-for-$10 or two-for-$5 specials on Harlequin’s new titles.Romance readers have always tended to buy in much higher volumes than people who read other genres like literary fiction. So even though some romance readers may be cutting back — Sue Grimshaw, the romance buyer at Borders, says people are buying four or five instead of five or six books a week — they are still buying more than readers of other book categories.Some publishers have seen such strong sales on particular authors that they are willing to test hardcover editions for the first time, even in this market.New American Library, a division of Penguin Group USA, has published six paperback-only versions of vampire romance novels in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series by J. R. Ward. Later this month it will publish Ms. Ward’s “Lover, Avenged” in hardcover, with a planned first printing of 125,000. (These numbers are generally known to be exaggerated, but they are a sign of the publisher’s confidence.)Romance novels have also captured a larger proportion of the electronic book market than other categories. Whereas most publishers say that about 1 percent of sales come from e-books, Harlequin says that digital editions make up about 3.4 percent of its sales.At Fictionwise, the e-book seller recently acquired by Barnes & Noble, about 50 percent of sales are romance books, said Steve Pendergrast, chief technology officer. “Romance readers tend to be voracious readers,” Mr. Pendergrast said. “The ability to instantly download and start reading is potentially more important to that audience than any other audience.”The growing market for digital romance novels has attracted several newcomers, including tiny independent publishers like Ellora’s Cave, Samhain Publishing and Ravenous Romance.Because they have no distribution or warehousing costs, they can sell books even cheaper than paperback editions — Ravenous Romance, which specializes in erotic fiction, sells e-books for $4.99 each. “That’s the same as a fancy drink at Starbucks,” said Lori Perkins, editorial director. “At that price, who wouldn’t want a book?”The recession has also meant more business for other purveyors of romance books: public libraries. Robin Bradford, the fiction buyer for the Indianapolis-Marion County Public Library, said demand for many romance titles had gone way up. She noted, for example, that the list of borrowers waiting for a copy of “Nauti Intentions” by Lora Leigh, a popular romance writer, was now 69 — up from an average of 15 or 20 for previous titles by that author last year.“People don’t have the discretionary income, especially for authors they are just trying out,” Ms. Bradford said. “It may sound interesting, but they’re not going to go spend $8 on something they may like, whereas before maybe they would have.”Many readers are still buying. “I would give up something else if money was tight,” said Annmarie Anderson, a district manager in Atlanta for a national retail chain, who said she still spent about $100 on romance novels each month. “I would give up my manicure and pedicure. I have my priority list, and books are pretty high on my priority list.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','It becomes clear, though, that Mr. Hurley had a dark side as well; he was a womanizer, and quick to use his fists. Ms. Hooper compares him to Conrad’s Mr. Kurtz, perhaps drunk on the kind of raw power policing affords in far-flung locales. (“Do the things that draw a missionary to savage places also lure a cop?” the author asks. “Does the cop get the same rush from lawlessness that missionaries get from the godless?”)Ms. Hooper, who grew up in Melbourne, began to investigate this story at the urging of a crusading lawyer who became involved in the case. “Like most middle-class suburbanites, I grew up without ever seeing an Aborigine, except on the news,” she confesses. She is wide awake to the fact that “concentrating on a white man killing a black man” takes Australia “back to its original sin.”“Tall Man” is an introspective book that nonetheless moves at a brisk, cinematic pace. Mr. Hurley claimed that Mr. Doomadgee’s injuries were the result of a fall. When a coroner agreed with him, the Aborigines of Palm Island rioted. Mr. Hurley’s house was burned; the police station was surrounded.“This was an outbreak of visceral loathing,” Ms. Hooper writes. “It was payback: the symbolic clash of two laws. The furies had been unleashed, not just over Cameron Doomadgee’s death but over all the black deaths in custody, all the black deaths and all the injustices.” There were chants of “Kill them whities!” Only the arrival of dozens of policemen from the mainland calmed the situation.Ms. Hooper pauses in “Tall Man” to relate the sorry saga of the way Australians treated the Aborigines, how, from 1910 to 1970, many Aborigine children were forcibly removed from their parents and sent to missions or foster families.These removals explain some of the pathology and grimness of Aboriginal life in Australia, Ms. Hooper suggests, but not all of it. About daily life on Palm Island, she writes: “In the past six weeks, a man had critically knifed his brother over a beer. A woman had bitten off another woman’s lip. A man had poured petrol over his partner and set her alight. The unemployment rate was 92 percent. Life expectancy was more than 20 years less than the national average. This place was a black hole into which people had fallen. Rocks may as well rain down.”Mr. Hurley ultimately does stand trial for Mr. Doomadgee’s death, and the second half of this book is largely given over to this event. How it ends may not be a surprise. But simply getting the case in front of a jury was an accomplishment. Incredibly, Ms. Hooper writes, Mr. Hurley was “the first policeman in Australia ever to be charged over the death of a prisoner in custody.”Ms. Hooper tells this story carefully and ingeniously, constantly turning it over to explore new facets. She sees the world through alert, appraising eyes. A far northern town is described as a place where “claustrophobia battles with agoraphobia.” Life in the north is “limbo with alcohol.”Ms. Hooper sometimes forces the literary resonances here. Mr. Hurley is compared not just to Mr. Kurtz but also to T. E. Lawrence (“back from the wilderness, smooth and upstanding at the London club”), Gulliver (“suddenly gigantic and tied to the ground”) and “Kafka in the tropics.”“Had I read ‘Heart of Darkness’ too many times?” she asks. Yes, maybe. But Ms. Hooper is such an intelligent and interesting storyteller that she is easily forgiven these infield errors.In her previous book, Ms. Hooper wrote: “We read true-crime books to learn about ourselves.” By the end of this new book, she wonders what Chris Hurley and his trial say about Australia. “I had wanted to know more about my country and now I did,” she intones. “Now I knew more than I wanted to.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Finally. After watching the Beatles’ company, Apple Corps, devote the last few years to developing a site-specific show in Las Vegas, a video game and a line of pricey memorabilia, Beatles fans are finally getting something they’ve been demanding for at least the last decade: sonically upgraded reissues of the group’s original British albums, in stereo and mono. Apple Corps and EMI announced on Tuesday that the much-postponed remasters would be released on individual stereo CDs and in two boxed sets — one stereo, the other mono — on Sept. 9, the same day the Beatles edition of Rock Band, the music video game, is scheduled for release.Downloadable versions of this music, however, remain in limbo. In December Paul McCartney said that they were being held up because of a dispute between Apple Corps and EMI. More recently, Dhani Harrison, George Harrison’s son, suggested that Apple Corps was dissatisfied with the price Apple, the computer company, was charging for iTunes downloads, and hinted that the Beatles might sell digital downloads through a system of their own. That could be resolved by September as well.Like the original set of Beatles CDs, released in 1987 and not upgraded since, the reissue series will include only the 12 albums the Beatles released in Britain between 1963 and 1970, from “Please Please Me” through “Let It Be,” along with “Magical Mystery Tour” — an American album that was originally released as a two-EP set in England — and the two-CD “Past Masters” compilation of the group’s nonalbum singles. All told, the set includes 16 CDs. (Beatles projects are typically tightly guarded; few outside EMI have heard the remasters yet.) Compilations released since 1987, including the “Beatles Anthology” series, “The Beatles Live at the BBC,” “Yellow Submarine Songtrack,” “1” and “Love,” the soundtrack for the Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, are not included in the new series. Nor are the two “Capitol Albums” boxed sets, which presented several of the Beatles’ albums in the versions released in the United States.The main reason collectors have been so intent on reissues of music they already own is that the 1987 CDs, like many discs released in the early years of the format, sound comparatively harsh and brittle by today’s standards. Since then, improvements in digital sound technology and remastering equipment have yielded a richer, smoother sound, and most of the major groups and artists from the 1960s — from Bob Dylan, the Byrds and Simon and Garfunkel to the Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd — have had their catalogs refurbished at least once since their first appearance on CD. And the Beatles’ own recent releases, including the “Capitol Albums” and “Love” discs, showed that the band’s recordings could sound vastly better — warmer and with far greater presence — than they do on the 1987 discs.Even so, remastering can be a dicey business: noise-reduction techniques can slice away the high frequencies of a recording, dulling the treble sound (in return for eliminating tape hiss). EMI’s remastering team apparently took this into consideration: the company’s production notes mention that fewer than five of the 525 minutes of music were subjected to noise reduction. The new transfers were done using a high-resolution Pro Tools system, and each track was compared with both its vinyl LP and 1987 CD incarnations.This is largely what collectors have been looking for. But Beatles fans are an exacting bunch, and the release plan gives them some cause for complaint as well. The stereo CDs include video documentaries, directed by Bob Smeaton (“The Beatles Anthology”), about the making of each album. But these will be available only on early pressings, and there are otherwise no bonus tracks, outtakes or extras.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Such is the discomfort with the grand duke’s prerogatives and powers that major constitutional reform is afoot, which its promoters hope to have in place by next year. “It is a step toward bringing the Constitution in tune with reality,” said Michel Pauly, a historian at the University of Luxembourg, founded in 2003. “And to rid the Constitution of the remains of absolute rule.”Henri, who resides in Berg, an hour’s drive north of the capital, which has the same name as the country, is surrounded by courtiers who appear at times as disorganized as they are numerous; he exercises ceremonies of state in a 17th-century palace that was once the town hall in the center of Luxembourg city.People here speak a German dialect, incomprehensible to outsiders. Yet Henri also speaks German, English and some Spanish, and the language of his court is French.These days, Henri may dress in civilian clothes and venture forth from his castle, accompanied at times by his five children, to jog through the mountains. But for centuries, Luxembourg was the plaything of conquerors, falling under the sway of Burgundy, then Austria, Spain, France and the Netherlands. They wanted its great citadel, perched on and dug into sheer stone cliffs above an oxbow in the Alzette River.The discussion comes at a disquieting time for Luxembourgers. Once a land of farmers and steelworkers (iron ore was discovered here in the 19th century), roughly half its economy is now based on financial services. For decades, the industry has thrived on strict bank secrecy laws; almost every bank you have ever heard of has an office on the six-block-long Boulevard Royal.But those have now come under attack by financial powers like the United States, Germany and France, which agreed at last week’s meeting of the Group of 20 to take more action against tax havens. On top of that, the financial crisis has shaken the foundations of the economy. Last year, for the first time the government was forced to stave off the collapse of several local banks, to the tune of more than $3 billion.With the industry in dire straits, and facing the threat of being blacklisted by international financial organizations, Luxembourg last month took the unprecedented step of joining other tax havens, like Switzerland and Liechtenstein, in relaxing bank secrecy to provide more cooperation against tax cheats.Bankers try to put the best face on it. “I cannot completely exclude that one or another of our customers will leave, but you have to look forward,” said Fernand Grulms, 48, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, a business promotion agency. “Those are not the customers on whom you could build a future.” Still, he acknowledged that private banking accounted for 20 percent of the nation’s business.The debate swirling around Henri, a wealthy man with manorial residences scattered throughout Luxembourg, began not long after he ascended the throne in 2000, when he announced his intention to sell off a vast forest known as the Grunewald, upsetting most Luxembourgers, who considered it part of the national patrimony. Then, in 2006, there was further popular upset when Henri announced his intention to sell the jewels of his mother, the Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte, in auction at Sotheby’s. In the end, he backed down, selling neither.But the move that most shook the crown came late last year when a majority in Parliament passed a bill allowing euthanasia, making Luxembourg the third European nation to do so, after Belgium and the Netherlands. (Switzerland, which allows assisted suicide, does not technically permit euthanasia, which is a mercy killing by a doctor.) Henri refused to sign it. Speculation had it that Henri’s Catholicism prevented him from doing so. But there was puzzlement: in 1978, his father, Grand Duke Jean, signed into law an abortion bill, despite his fervent Catholicism.In a blitz session of Parliament, the Constitution was changed, making Henri’s signature unnecessary. But calls arose for a broader reform of the Constitution, to bring the grand duke’s role more in line with that of other European monarchs. If the changes are enacted, gone will be many of his executive powers, including his role as commander in chief of Luxembourg’s Army, with its 800 soldiers, though he is a graduate of the British military academy, Sandhurst. After national elections in June, the legislation is expected to move quickly through Parliament.The grand duke’s subjects appear divided over his future role. Pascale Goedert, a schoolteacher in her 30s, recalled how Henri’s grandmother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, kept Luxembourgers united while in exile in London during World War II. “Now there is no war, so he has no function,” Ms. Goedert said.Roland Streber, 50, a consultant, was more accepting. “We will keep him if he behaves nicely,” he said, adding that in rejecting the euthanasia bill Henri had made a “huge mistake. It’s a typical Luxembourg situation. Someone tries to accomplish something, and someone else throws up an obstacle.”Henri said that he had provoked the conflict to pursue “a vision of a more democratic and modernized institution.” Luxembourg, he said, will achieve “a great similarity with monarchies on the Continent, though each has its peculiarities.”“Whatever changes,” he said, “goes in the direction of modernization.”Especially in times of economic stress, he argued, his role remains fundamental in maintaining the unity of the tiny country. There are only about 325,000 native Luxembourgers in the total population, and fewer than half of the residents of the capital are citizens. “One-third of our people are foreigners,” he pointed out, guest workers of one sort or another, some wearing pinstripes, others denim.“In a globalizing world,” Henri said, “people need an image representing the country, a force for integration.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Bemidji State will meet Miami of Ohio on Thursday at the Verizon Center in Washington. Boston University will play Vermont in the other semifinal.Entering this season, C.H.A. teams had won one N.C.A.A. tournament game in eight attempts. Niagara was the lone winner, in 2000. Bemidji State lost first-round games in 2005 and 2006. The Beavers’ victories were so unexpected this year that the college booked a trade show at the hockey arena, John S. Glas Fieldhouse, for last weekend and removed the ice. So they have been practicing at the rink at the Bemidji Curling Club, about a mile away. The club has a tiny locker room and no showers.“It’s kind of an annoyance to come over here and all that, but it’s not too bad,” Cody Bostock, a senior defenseman, said. “It’s only a few days.”Besides, Bostock said, it means the 20-15-1 Beavers are still playing. That seemed unlikely on Jan. 23, when the Beavers were 8-13 after losing six straight. Their 12-2-1 rush to the regional title has become as much a part of folklore here as the legend of Paul Bunyan and Babe the blue ox, whose statues adorn a park on the shore of Lake Bemidji.“Did we expect to win both games? I don’t know,” Travis Winter, the senior captain, said. “I knew we’d compete and we’d have a chance. I’m not going to sit here and say I’m not surprised, but I’m not shocked either. We’ve got a good hockey team.”The timing has been so fortuitous for the team and the college, which has an enrollment of about 5,000, that it seems scripted. With the defections of Niagara and Robert Morris to the Atlantic Hockey Association, the four-team C.H.A. is disbanding after the 2009-10 season, leaving Bemidji State without a conference. It applied to join the 10-team Western Collegiate Hockey Association, which includes Minnesota’s other four Division I programs.On Friday a visit by W.C.H.A. officials coincided with the groundbreaking for Bemidji’s $90.7 million event center, which will feature a 4,700-seat hockey arena for the university’s men’s and women’s teams. A pep rally to welcome the officials turned into a raucous sendoff for the men’s team.“There’s definitely no better timing that this,” Bostock said. “Everything’s coming together at the same time, with all the hype around town. How can they look at it and not like it?”Though Bemidji, with a population of 13,500, is known for curling — both 2006 United States Olympic teams were based here, and Pete Fenson, a curling bronze medalist, owns a local pizzeria — Bemidji State has a rich hockey tradition.The Beavers won 13 national championships in Divisions II and III and in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics under Coach Bob Peters from 1968 to 1997. Peters developed four N.H.L. players and five United States Olympians, among them Joel Otto.Peters shepherded the move to Division I in 1999 before retiring two seasons later as the first coach to win 700 hockey games at one college. Peters, 71, remains such a revered figure among the Beavers faithful that he received as long a standing ovation as Serratore at the pep rally.Peters’s style of pressuring the puck and forcing turnovers remains in place under Serratore, who played for Peters from 1984 to 1987. “We might not be the fastest team, but we like to play fast — get the puck and move it, and be in people’s face at all times,” Bostock said.Tyler Scofield, a senior forward, scored 9 of his 22 goals on Bemidji State’s power play, which ranks sixth in Division I.Bemidji State earned an automatic N.C.A.A. bid with a 3-2 overtime victory over Robert Morris in the C.H.A. tournament final. Though Serratore abhors any suggestion that his team’s run has been a fluke, he concedes curious coincidences are at play.The afternoon after the Beavers upset Notre Dame, Serratore flipped through the television channels in his hotel room and stumbled upon “Rudy,” the uplifting movie about a Notre Dame football walk-on. “How weird is that?” he said.At the pep rally, the standing-room crowd of more than 1,000 included the 1980 Olympic hockey gold medalists Bill Baker and Phil Verchota, who live in the area. That inspired Jon Quistgaard, the university president, to tell the crowd, “I would suggest that next week we’re going to see the second Miracle on Ice.”And later this month Bemidji State’s theater department is staging “Cinderella.”“It’s crazy,” Serratore said. “It’s really odd how this has all transpired.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Kellogg is fluid in describing offensive plays, but he needed to offer prescriptions for the issues he raised. If Michigan State had to choke off the Tar Heels’ 3-point shooting Monday night, what did they have to do? And why did the Spartans fail to do it?He waited until the second half to say why the North Carolina point guard Ty Lawson was so successful at stealing the ball, but why was there no Telestrator to demonstrate his skills at anticipating where passes were headed? Kellogg called it “tracing the ball.” Show it!When Kellogg called North Carolina’s defense “really solid,” what did he mean? How did Roy Williams’s team stop Michigan State’s dribble penetration and how did the Tar Heels so successfully steamroll the fast-paced attack that defeated Connecticut on Saturday? Why had the Spartans been so savvy at throttling Connecticut’s A. J. Price?All questions that demanded more than the general answers Kellogg often gave.Sometimes, as he discussed what Michigan State had to do to come back from its early double-digit deficit against North Carolina, Kellogg leaned too much on what the Spartans had to do offensively but did not detail what they had to do defensively. Did Coach Tom Izzo have to shift Michigan State from man-to-man to a zone? Did he have the right players in the man defense?Viewers could see how far out on the perimeter the Spartans had been pushed on offense; what was North Carolina’s defense doing?Kellogg and his partner, Jim Nantz, were a little more willing to attribute the blame for Michigan State’s woeful offense and ball-handling to its players’ inexperience and their need to please their economically devastated state than to the defense that was tying them up.Here is where the contrast with Packer was sharpest: Packer would have been playing the coach, questioning Izzo’s moves, and would have declared the title game over by the middle of the first half. But Kellogg suggested twice in the second half that the run-down Spartans had a chance if they sank their 3-pointers and stopped turning the ball over. “They’ve got to get a few shots to go,” he said with 7 minutes 23 seconds left and North Carolina leading by 16.Kellogg would have benefited from Nantz’s asking questions to prod more detailed answers about the defenses, or had their producer, Bob Dekas, pushed him to be more specific.Nantz never had to goad Packer, who was relentless about saying what teams had to do.Perhaps Kellogg was just too excited to offer aggressive and specific defensive analysis. In the pregame show, he declared that he was “amped up two more levels” over his normal excitement. That might account for his uttering one of the weirdest lines I’ve ever heard. During a North Carolina scoring run, Kellogg said it was “the epitome of the spurtability team.”His wordplay is a signature aspect of his work. A foul by North Carolina’s Tyler Hansbrough was evidence that he was going for “a little lower-body root-canal action.”If only similar, nervy creativity were applied to analyzing defensive strategies.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','“The charges have been proved beyond all reasonable doubt,” César San Martín, the chief judge of the panel, said Tuesday in the courtroom at a base for special forces on the outskirts of Lima.In a previous case, Mr. Fujimori had already been sentenced to six years in prison for ordering an illegal search, while his government was collapsing in 2000, of the residence of the wife of Vladimiro Montesinos, his former intelligence chief. With that sentence to run concurrently with the 25-year sentence handed down on Tuesday, less the time Mr. Fujimori has served since his extradition two years ago, he could remain in prison until 2032.The verdict came after a trial that lasted more than a year and was broadcast on television in Peru. Among other things, the judges found Mr. Fujimori guilty of the murder of 15 people, including an 8-year-old boy, at a barbecue in the Barrios Altos area of Lima, and of 10 people who were abducted in 1992; their burned bodies were found a year later outside Lima.The killings were carried out by a shadowy squad of military intelligence officers, known as the Colina Group. In testimony last week, Mr. Fujimori said he had not authorized the murders or kidnappings.“I had to govern from hell,” he said. “That is why I am being judged.”The panel of judges also found him guilty of overseeing the kidnappings of Gustavo Gorriti, a prominent journalist, and Samuel Dyer, a businessman, in 1992. Both men were later freed.Mr. Fujimori still faces two additional trials on corruption charges. The Supreme Court could take four to six months to rule on his appeal of the conviction on Tuesday, Peruvian legal experts said.As the verdict was read, Mr. Fujimori, wearing a dark suit and a black necktie, sat alone and silent in the courtroom, writing on a notepad.Outside the building, hundreds of his supporters faced off in shouting matches with people who had turned out to demonstrate against Mr. Fujimori, who is known in Peru as Chino, although his ancestry is Japanese. Riot police officers tried to separate the two groups, but some clashes took place.Some of Mr. Fujimori’s followers brandished signs reading “Fuerza 2011,” or “Force 2011,” a reference to Peru’s presidential election in two years; his daughter, Keiko Fujimori, 34, a congresswoman, is a candidate for president. Ms. Fujimori has said that if she is elected, she will pardon her father.“My indignation is immense to listen to this judgment full of hate and vengeance,” Ms. Fujimori said of the verdict, in televised comments.Others disagreed with that assessment, pointing to detailed testimony during the trial, the report of Peru’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission and documents declassified by the United States government.A State Department cable on Aug. 23, 1990, for example, described information from a Peruvian intelligence source, a former naval officer, who said that the plan to carry out extra-judicial assassinations of suspected terrorists had “the tacit approval of President Fujimori.” Ernesto de la Jara, director of the Legal Defense Institute, a human rights organization in Lima, described the judges’ verdict as “an impeccable sentence.”“It is so well made that it would be difficult to dismantle it,” he said.On Lima’s streets, reactions ranged from redemption to dismay. “Injustice has been committed,” said Jorge García, 42, a motorcycle mechanic who admires Mr. Fujimori. “Now we must take to the streets to make ourselves heard, peacefully.”Others had a more simple analysis. “If he is guilty,” said Tomasa Sánchez, 35, a cellphone saleswoman, “then he should pay.”'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Mr. Douri, 65, is a member of the “deck of cards” of 52 Iraqi officials that American troops distributed after the invasion in 2003. American intelligence officials say he is active in financing and organizing insurgents, including Baathists.The United States has posted a $10 million reward for his capture; American and Iraqi officials have accused the Syrian government of giving him refuge.Mr. Douri called Mr. Maliki’s government and Iraqi elections illegitimate because they were a result of the American military occupation. Americans were withdrawing, he said, because they failed in Iraq but hoped to leave a puppet government in place.“The political process is the occupation’s main project, so attack it through all means available to you,” Mr. Douri said, addressing “jihadis” in Iraq.He said a Baathist government in Iraq would seek good relations with the Obama administration and “put behind them what happened in the past.”The transcript of Mr. Douri’s broadcast, e-mailed to The Times by a Baathist-led coalition called the National Islamist Pan-Arabist Front, made no mention of a series of seven car bombs, six of them on Monday, that killed more than 40 people.Mr. Maliki’s office released a statement late Monday blaming the Baathists, in conjunction with Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, for the car bomb attacks. Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is a homegrown extremist group with some foreign leadership.The prime minister’s statement described the bombings as “a gift of the disbanded Baath Party on the ill omen of its anniversary.” Tuesday was the anniversary of the founding of the Baath Party, which ruled Iraq from 1968 until Mr. Hussein was ousted by the Americans.Mr. Douri’s statement rejected any possibility of negotiations unless the Iraqi government met a series of conditions, which included allowing armed Baathists to take over the government and disbanding all institutions created after the American invasion.Mr. Maliki in recent statements has made a distinction between people with Baathist backgrounds, who may have been supporting the insurgency, and terrorists with groups like Al Qaeda.That was seen as a positive step in encouraging reconciliation, but it also drew strong criticism from Mr. Maliki’s own Shiite constituency.Tuesday’s car bomb attack took place near a mosque, the Husseiniya al-Newab, in the largely Shiite neighborhood of Kadhimiya. A police official said that eight were killed and 20 wounded, all civilians.Monday’s six car bombings were also all in Shiite neighborhoods and killed at least 33 people, mostly civilians, according to police reports.The attacks did not bear the usual signature of Al Qaeda, which has more often employed roadside bombs and suicide bombings, either in vehicles or by individuals wearing explosive vests. The latest seven attacks all apparently used cars that were remotely detonated while parked or stopped.“The followers of the destroyed regime have planted death and destruction in neighborhoods of our beloved city with the cooperation of the terrorist Al Qaeda organization,” Mr. Maliki’s statement said. “They’re trying to stir up sectarian unrest and instability.”The prime minister offered no specific evidence to link the bombings to the Baath Party but noted that attacks had occurred every April 7 since Mr. Hussein was toppled.“These criminal blasts reveal how bloody and despised this party is by the sons of the Iraqi people who have suffered from catastrophes and destruction for 35 years of their dictatorship,” Mr. Maliki’s statement said.In Anbar Province on Tuesday, a suicide bomber rammed a car loaded with explosives into the armored car of an Awakening Council leader in Garma, near Falluja, in an unsuccessful attempt to kill him, according to a Falluja police official.It was the third assassination attempt since December on Col. Saad Abbas al-Shimary, head of the Garma council. The other two attempts involved a suicide bomber in a truck and an effort to poison him.One policeman was killed and nine were wounded in the latest bombing.Garma, a former stronghold of insurgents, has had several suicide bomb attacks, including one last June that killed 20 people, including 3 Marines, at a meeting of local sheiks.'"
"'09-04-08,'1','Mr. Sun said he had previously visited the cemetery on Qingming Day to honor Mr. Zhao’s death without serious incident. But this year, he said, he announced his forthcoming visit on the Internet.“It is important for China to restore the memory of its history,” Mr. Sun said in a telephone interview from his hospital bed. “Zhao Ziyang is such an important person in Chinese history, and students today have no idea who he is. That is outrageous.”As he left the teacher’s dormitory at Shandong University, he said, a public security officer and about 20 plainclothes officers tried to stop him. “They said, ‘Don’t go there today. So many people are going there. It is dangerous,’ ” he said.When he got into a taxi, a car followed him, he said. He said he had started down a cemetery path, carrying a banner that read “Condolences for the heroes who died for freedom,” when four or five men jumped him from behind.He said the attackers lifted him off the ground, threw him into a deep ditch, and kicked and beat him for more than 10 minutes. Other people came to the edge of the ditch, he said, “but nobody tried to help.” Finally, a uniformed officer showed up and called an ambulance, he said.In the four days he has been in the hospital, the police have not shown up to investigate, he said.“I still feel very weak. And I think probably my days are numbered. But I don’t feel regret. I am 75 years old and I would be very happy to sacrifice my life for my ideals,” he said.Mr. Sun has a long history of activism. He was imprisoned for seven years in the 1970s for criticizing Mao and his successor, Hua Guofeng, and was among the first to sign Charter 08, a manifesto issued in December that calls for democratic reforms.Still, he said: “I didn’t expect this. I was not trying to organize any group of people. It was just a personal visit to a cemetery. In order to fight for democracy, we need to make personal efforts.”'"

"'09-04-09,'1','CHICAGO — The mayor-elect of a North Shore suburb said Wednesday that he would drop many restrictions against illegal immigrants imposed by his predecessor.“The current mayor was not open to listening to what the community really needed,” said Robert Sabonjian, who on Tuesday defeated the incumbent mayor of Waukegan, Richard H. Hyde, a Democrat. “The community was put in fear by the ordinances put in place.”Among the regulations Mr. Hyde, 81, imposed in his two terms in office was one that allowed the police to arrest people exclusively on immigration charges, most often charges of being in the United States illegally.Before the election, a grass-roots Hispanic organization in Waukegan, a blue-collar community of about 91,000 residents, canvassed the town, urging Hispanic residents to support Mr. Sabonjian, an independent who won 52 percent of the vote to Mr. Hyde’s 43 percent.The group, the New Waukegan, estimated that 31 percent of the roughly 7,000 votes cast were by Hispanic voters. The population is about 50 percent Hispanic.A restaurant owner, Jose Zavala, said he formed the group to help make the city more welcoming to immigrants. Its main goal, Mr. Zavala said, is the eventual election of a Hispanic mayor.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','“I thought I was on the bag, but we didn’t get a good view on the video,” Delgado said. “We got out of there, though.”Phillips advanced to third on the play. Ramon Hernandez then walked, and Rodriguez struck out Alex Gonzalez. Rodriguez then put a scare into Mets fans when Laynce Nix hit a fly ball to the warning track in center field, only to have it fall in Carlos Beltran’s glove.The Mets improved on one thing from Monday’s game — hitting with runners in scoring position. After his team went 1 for 12 on opening day, Manuel said the Mets were going to “address that situation.”Beltran, Delgado and Brian Schneider provided the firepower to bail out the bullpen and starter Mike Pelfrey, who struggled to survive the first inning.Delgado, who drove in four runs, gave Pelfrey a 2-0 lead after he crushed an Edinson Volquez fastball 438 feet to right field. But Pelfrey gave up a home run of his own in the bottom half of the inning — a three-run shot by Joey Votto. The Reds tacked on a fourth run when a throwing error by Jose Reyes on a double-play ball allowed Phillips to score.Pelfrey walked four in five innings, and only 56 of his 104 pitches were strikes. But for all his struggles, he did not allow a run over the next four innings.“You’ve got to give Pelfrey a lot of credit,” Delgado said. “He didn’t have his best stuff, but he was able to battle and gave us five innings. One thing about this ballclub, we can put some runs on the board and you stick around, you’ve got a chance to get out of there with a win.”After a run-scoring groundout by Delgado, Beltran singled home Daniel Murphy and David Wright to give the Mets a 5-4 lead in the top of the fifth.Pelfrey, however, made it interesting again in the bottom half of the inning.With Votto on third and Jay Bruce on first with two outs, Pelfrey faked a pickoff throw to third and wheeled around, only to find Bruce sprinting toward second. Pelfrey fired to second baseman Luis Castillo, who saved the ball from going into the outfield. Castillo, in no position to tag out Bruce after Pelfrey’s toss, fired home to nip Votto at the plate.The Mets then built their lead with a four-run seventh inning.Delgado singled home Wright. With the bases loaded, Brian Schneider ripped a line drive into right-center field. It was a likely two-run single that became a three-run double after Bruce fell down and the ball rolled past him.The Mets led by 9-4 and seemed in control, but then it felt like 2008 and 2007 all over again. Bobby Parnell allowed two walks in one inning and Pedro Feliciano surrendered two runs. Then Putz gave up a run before Rodriguez came in to close it out — barely.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','But the stock market seemed to believe that the insurers’ chances were greatly improved on Wednesday. After The Wall Street Journal reported that the Treasury might have an announcement within days, stock in Hartford Financial Services Group rose 13.5 percent, and that of the Lincoln National Corporation rose more than 30 percent.All of the dozen insurers that have applied for TARP money are believed to be life insurers, although not all have been identified. Some are well-known companies, like MetLife and Prudential Financial.Insurance companies are acutely vulnerable to ratings downgrades — once an insurer falls below AA status, it can start having trouble getting new business. Many life insurers have already suffered credit downgrades this year because of losses in 2008. And with the markets still weak as of March 31 — the day insurers generally marked their assets to market for their first quarters — investors worry that more downgrades are looming.Infusions from TARP could offset that pain by restoring some capital, if the Treasury acts in time.The life insurers have been waiting for nearly half a year, after being told last November that they could apply for TARP money if they had a federally regulated affiliate. Several insurance companies promptly bought thrift institutions to obtain their federal charters.While the applicants have waited, all have grown weaker.“We think that the life insurance industry is in a very precarious position,” analysts for Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, said in a report last month. “It does not appear that some of the big insurance companies possess enough capital to weather the storm.”Concerning state regulators overseeing the insurance industry, they wrote, “There is a lot of stalling and hope that someone else will deal with the problem. This may be all that can be done until someone in Washington decides insurance companies are systemically important.”The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, has said that reining in systemic risk is a priority, but has not offered specific proposals or definitions.Late last year, life insurance officials said they, too, should qualify for federal money, citing their huge presence in the bond markets, then under extreme duress.The government seemed to agree that they might pose a form of systemic risk. The life insurance industry now holds about 18 percent of all United States corporate bonds, as well as big blocks of commercial mortgages and government bonds.If an insurer were to get into financial trouble, its policyholders would presumably be protected by the guarantee fund of its home state. But if a big troubled insurer were caught in a cash squeeze and began selling off bonds to raise cash, the insurers argue that it could wreak further havoc on the bond markets.The Bridgewater analysts said that the life insurers could also face liquidity problems in a period of high unemployment. When unemployment rises and consumer credit dries up, people may surrender their life insurance policies or borrow against their cash value.Bridgewater projected that life insurers could run through “$500 billion during the next couple of years to meet policyholder demands.”That could stretch some insurers to the breaking point. But it is not clear this amounts to the sort of systemic risk that the Treasury has said it wants to contain.Another problem is the use of derivatives — specifically, the credit-default swaps that nearly toppled American International Group last fall. They are used routinely for various purposes by large insurance companies, without incident. But if a weakened insurer had swaps that required it to come up with a lot of collateral suddenly — as happened to A.I.G. — that could produce the kind of risk to the financial system that the Treasury views as unacceptable.In its annual report, the Hartford Group said that if its financial strength ratings were to be downgraded by three notches from where it stood in February, it “could begin to trigger potentially material collateral calls on certain of our derivative instruments.”A spokeswoman for the company declined to specify how much collateral might be required, but said that the Hartford Group’s involvement with swaps was small — unlike that of A.I.G., which sold them extensively and then suddenly had to come up with $17 billion when it was downgraded, setting in motion a bank run.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','CHICAGO — Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. of Illinois confirmed Wednesday that a Congressional ethics office had begun a preliminary inquiry into his efforts last fall to win appointment by Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama.Mr. Blagojevich, removed from office by the Illinois legislature in January, was indicted last week in a federal corruption case that includes charges that he sought to barter his appointment power for campaign contributions and other favors.That Mr. Jackson is under preliminary inquiry in Congress was first reported Tuesday afternoon, on the Web site of The Chicago Sun-Times. In confirming the investigation Wednesday, Mr. Jackson, a Democrat from the city’s South Side, said he had done nothing wrong and was confident that the panel would dismiss the matter.The Office of Congressional Ethics, which is conducting the review, began operations this year, and its questions about Mr. Jackson amount to its first known inquiry.The panel, whose members are not lawmakers, is made up of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. It was created a year ago to provide a more independent review of possible ethics cases involving House members. As ethics questions arose in connection with other Democratic lawmakers, Republicans criticized how long it had taken to get the office set up.Under the rules for the new office, a preliminary inquiry is begun when two of its members — one from each party — seek such action in writing. The panel has 30 days to conduct an initial review and then 45 days for any further inquiry. It can refer cases to the House ethics committee, where the authority to discipline lawmakers rests.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','Federal immigration authorities said Wednesday that they were still accepting petitions by employers for temporary visas for foreign scientists and technology engineers for the next fiscal year, reflecting a sharp drop in applications over last year.The announcement came as a surprise to some employers, researchers and immigration advocates, who had predicted that in spite of the recession and other factors, the quotas for petitions for the so-called H-1B visa would most likely be reached within the initial five-day period, which began on April 1.The State Department issues up to 85,000 H-1B visas, including 65,000 for applicants with a bachelor’s degree or similar training and 20,000 for those with a master’s degree or higher from an American university.Some analysts have attributed the decline to the economic downturn and to new restrictions on financial companies that received emergency federal aid.But Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles the petitions, said that in 2006, the agency did not reach the regular H-1B cap for at least a month and did not reach the master’s cap until July.In 2007, the regular cap was met in the first five-day filing period and the master’s degree cap was met within a month. Last year, the agency received about 163,000 petitions within the first five-day petition period, more than meeting the quotas.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','Mental health experts say that stress associated with economic worries can affect people in different ways.Some people may find themselves being more irritable, anxious, lethargic or sad. Some may be unable to sleep, may eat too much or too little, or may experience physical symptoms of stress, like high blood pressure or headaches.Others may turn to behaviors like gambling, alcohol or drug use. Often, one symptom can lead to another — anxiety can lead to sleeplessness, which can cause greater stress and so on.There are a variety of suggested coping techniques and ways to get help, depending on the individual situation. In general, experts advise people to engage in activities that can release stress, like exercise, hobbies or socializing with friends and family. Sharing worries with people experiencing similar stress can help.Many therapists encourage people to write down their worries and responsibilities before they go to bed, which can keep them from dwelling on them while they are trying to sleep.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','Major league baseball teams cut payrolls for their active rosters and disabled lists by $47 million from opening day in 2008 to the first day of this season, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. That is a drop of 1.7 percent.“Clubs were cautious all winter with regards to the economy and were concerned the economy might have an impact on club revenue,” said Bob DuPuy, baseball’s chief operating officer. “The spending reflected that for many clubs.”The drop is the first since 2004 and just the second since the 1994-95 strike.Looking at payroll team by team, 16 of the 30 major league clubs cut payroll. The Yankees were among those who lowered spending.While the Yankees led the major leagues with a $201.4 million payroll, they trimmed salaries by $7.6 million from the start of last season. Although they added the high-priced free agents C. C. Sabathia, A. J. Burnett and Mark Teixeira, they also let Jason Giambi, Bobby Abreu and Carl Pavano leave, watched Mike Mussina retire and cut Andy Pettitte’s guaranteed pay by more than half.Others cut more, led by the San Diego Padres ($30.9 million) and the Chicago White Sox ($25.1 million).'"
"'09-04-09,'1','“For the last three years, it was the bigger the better,” said Dolly Lenz, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman. “Now the key words are smaller, livable and affordable. Before no one asked what the maintenance was. Now everyone wants to know.”Manhattan was spared some of the housing problems the rest of the country faced during this downturn. The mortgage foreclosure rate in Manhattan remains low even today. While thousands of condos were built here, most were bought by homeowners, not speculators, as was common in Miami and other oversaturated markets.But Manhattan housing prices were driven higher by record earnings and bonuses on Wall Street, and they fell hard when the music stopped last fall.The quick fall in prices is shown in the experience of Abigail Disney, a philanthropist and documentary filmmaker, who a year ago put her sprawling 17-room co-op on West End Avenue on the market for $13.5 million.With trophy homes commanding ever higher prices from the titans of finance, Ms. Disney priced the apartment at 20 percent more than she had paid for it only a few months earlier. Harry Belafonte, the singer and actor, had created the huge space many years earlier by breaking through the walls of two smaller apartments.After a series of price cuts, Ms. Disney has finally found buyers for the property, for just under $7.5 million, a 46 percent discount from her initial asking price. But to make a deal she agreed to restore the walls and convert it back into two apartments and sell it to two buyers.Despite government efforts to ease credit around the country, the market in New York is being starved by a limited availability of credit, especially for jumbo mortgages, which are loans of more than $729,750. More than half of all apartment sales in Manhattan are above even the expanded limits of conventional mortgages, which carry lower interest rates.Jonathan J. Miller, an appraiser who prepares quarterly reports on Manhattan, said the market could continue to fall through this year and next, especially if credit remained tight for most buyers. After that, he said, it could take several more years to work through the excess inventory.The housing recovery will also depend on the state of the economy, which many forecasters say will take a disproportionate toll on New York City before the recession ends. In New York, the financial industry accounts for more than 30 percent of all wages, and at least some of the wages of half of all very high income households, according to the New York City comptroller’s office.While employment fell nationwide last year, the number of jobs actually grew in New York City until September. Since then, the city lost nearly 85,000 jobs through January, and the comptroller’s office has forecast a loss of 121,000 jobs in 2009 and another 83,000 in 2010.Condominiums under construction have been hit particularly hard, especially because new mortgage rules have made it difficult for buyers to get conventional loans unless 70 percent of the apartments in a building are in contract.This has left many developers scrambling to convert condominium projects to rentals or provide alternative financing.At 99 John Street in Lower Manhattan, where the Rockrose Development Corporation is converting a 27-story prewar Art Deco rental building into hundreds of condominiums, buyers were offered a chance to “rent to own,” and a promise that Rockrose would buy back an apartment after five years at 110 percent of the purchase price. The developer also began offering the apartments in bulk to investors, in packages of 15 apartments.In the late 1980s, a surge in condominium construction in New York created a glut of condo apartments. Prices peaked in 1989, declined steeply in 1991, bottomed out in 1993 and stabilized in 1995 and 1996.Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, said he had begun to see more activity this spring, but at much lower prices, with luxury apartment prices off as much as 40 percent.Mr. Miller said that during the last big real estate downturn, when studio apartments were so cheap that he considered buying one on a credit card, people thought the luxury market would never come back. “Conspicuous consumption was out of vogue in 1991,” he said. “The market was back by 1997 or 1998.”'"

"'09-04-09,'1','The only famous person on the preview special of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” on Tuesday night was relegated to the status of unnamed extra.That burly man training an attack dog in the yard of one of the show’s housewives was none other than Bernard B. Kerik, the disgraced former New York City police commissioner and former nominee for secretary of homeland security.“Some intruder’s in my house? That’s his problem,” deadpans the housewife, Caroline Manzo, as Mr. Kerik holds the leash of a German shepherd thrashing the padded arm of another man.The shot, teasing future delights on the new series, was tightly edited to intermingle with the sort of adages now common to the reality television version of real life, like “Make sure you get a C-cup.”The show, the Bravo network’s latest entry in its popular “Real Housewives” series, is to begin being broadcast on May 12. The preview episode was available on the network’s Web site Wednesday morning. The scene showing Mr. Kerik comes in the final three minutes.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','“So if you take basic precautions with door and window locks, you’re ahead of the game.”The first thing to do is to assess your windows with a quick exercise: call it Try to Break Into Your Own Home. “Just go out and give your windows a shake and see if they hold up,” Mr. McCrary said. “If you can reach in and turn the lock, or the window is so loose that you can rattle it open, that’s not good. If you, the average person, could climb in, then so could the less-than-average burglar.”Look closely at upper-floor windows. If there’s a roof, ledge, fire escape or ladder nearby, he said, remember that you need to secure those windows.The easiest protection against intruders and falling children or pets is something people often forget: opening windows from the top. It’s not foolproof, but it reduces the risks because the opening is difficult to reach. “It’s always preferable,” Dr. Mickalide said. “And keep furniture away from the window so there’s no access — don’t put a bed there.”Pin locks can keep a window locked in place when it’s open a few inches. They cost little and are installed by drilling a removable pin through both sashes.For those who prefer to open the lower half, there are two options: window stops and guards.Window stops (also called sash stops or night locks) do as the name implies: stop the sash from opening beyond a set point. They come in plastic or metal, in many forms — from simple pop-ins installed manually to key cylinders — and are built in to a lot of new windows. Pin locks can also be used to lock a window a few inches open.David Ticktin, the manager of United California Glass and Door in San Francisco, said that stores like Home Depot and Lowe’s sell them for as little as $2.Mr. McCrary said that people should make sure all locks are “screwed in tightly and doing what they’re supposed to do.”But proceed with caution: make sure they are easily removable in a fire, and if children are around, install them to open the window only 3 to 4 inches.“Otherwise children can slip their bodies through and dangle,” Dr. Mickalide said. (A recent trip to a hardware store found no packaging with such warnings.)Window guards — removable metal or aluminum grates designed to prevent children from falling out — are required by law in some cities, including New York, which mandates them for homes with children under 11.“Make sure there is an emergency release function so that you can get out of the house in a fire,” Dr. Mickalide said. “You want to show children how to get out if they have to do so on their own.”She added, “They aren’t designed to prevent intruders, but they’re certainly a visual deterrent.”If you have particularly mischievous children or live where crime is ever-present, steel or iron window bars could be the answer. The plus: you can leave your windows open wide day and night. The minus: you’ll have to get used to the jailhouse look.Questions about home maintenance or décor may be sent by e-mail to thefix@nytimes.com.

"'09-04-09,'1','Some are seeking counseling or medication for the first time. Others are resuming or increasing treatment, or redirecting therapy for other issues onto economic anxiety.“The economy and fear of what’s going to happen is having a huge effect,” said Sarah Bullard Steck, a therapist who also directs the employee assistance program at the Commerce Department. “People are coming in more” with “severe anxiety” or “more marital strife, some domestic violence, some .”Alan A. Axelson, a psychiatrist, said he was seeing first-time patients and infrequent ones experiencing “relapse and needing more therapy and medication” even though, he said, “Pittsburgh’s actually doing pretty good economically.”It is early to measure the recession’s consequences, but surveys suggest a growing impact. In an American Psychological Association poll in September, 80 percent reported the economy’s causing significant stress, up from 66 percent last April. The National Sleep Foundation said 27 percent of people surveyed last fall had because of economic anxiety.National Prevention Lifeline calls jumped to 50,158 in January 2009 from 39,465 a month in January 2008, and economic stress more frequently “played a central role,” said Richard McKeon, the group’s federal project officer.The , Labor and other departments started a Web site for people experiencing stress. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is training counselors who usually assist people devastated by tornadoes and floods to now help people with what they “are going through with the economy,” said Dr. McKeon, an agency adviser.And while a New York Times/CBS News poll found fewer people saying the economy had worsened, most did not think it was improving. People overwhelmingly thought the recession would last another year or more, and 70 percent were concerned that a household member would be jobless.Anxiety is not just troubling those with much to lose, like older people and homeowners. Elizabeth Dewey-Vogt, 25, a paralegal whose bills and shrinking overtime made her move in with her parents in , Va., said she began “constantly worrying about finances,” and having panic attacks, “rapid , sensation, chills or , in my fingers,” and feeling “almost removed from my body.”Ms. Dewey-Vogt said that she now took anxiety medication, and that a therapist advised her to pull over or “concentrate on the license plate ahead” if she began panicking while driving and to grip on the handles of her chair when panicking at work.Daniel A. Cohen, a psychiatrist, said he saw “more families in crisis,” with children experiencing “increased signs of anxiety and depression” and more and acting out.Joshua Batista, 16, of , who was treated for depression and post-traumatic stress after a taxi accident, said he had “gotten more depressed and stressed” since “the recession and that stuff started.” In school, he said he experienced “a nervous breakdown where I was pulling out my hair, hitting my head.” Joshua, a singer-guitarist, said the economy limited his purchases and earnings. Therapy and medication have increased. Asked to leave school, he will be taught at home. “He noticed it was happening at the same time as the economy,” said his mother, Elissa Levine.Even for insured people, the economy both causes anxiety and makes help less affordable.Susan Bandrowsky, 30, a photographer in , Del., with , said she felt strain because her husband, having lost a long-term consulting contract, worked short-term jobs requiring travel, unsettling their 4-year-old son. Fearing the loss of , Ms. Bandrowsky would like more therapy, but to save co-payments she spaces appointments, which, she said, “ups the anxiety.”Many seeking help are fearful, not actually incurring economic difficulty, said Joseph Ojile, founder of Clayton Sleep Institute in , where patients increased 25 percent since October.Steven Craig, a psychologist in , Mich., said “people of less means” were handling some of this better because “their identity is not as caught up in how much money they have.”Many ask primary physicians for medication, not therapy referrals, because they fear that employers will consider them unstable or resent counseling during work hours, said Allen J. Dietrich, a in , N.H. He said he broached the subject of emotional stress gently because many had come in with physical complaints like or headaches.Still, a survey of employee assistance programs found a jump in stress-related requests. “The stress level has increased a lot,” said Suzanne Greenlee, human resources benefits director at Inc., a food services company.Even for Ms. Greenlee, who said she “realized how tense I was” after trying Sodexo’s stress-management coach. She e-mailed the coach, “Today I’m feeling totally overwhelmed.”During therapy recently, Marcy Krust, 39, told Dr. Craig, “People say it’s going to be better, but I don’t feel that way yet.” A divorced mother and on-and-off patient, Ms. Krust said she had not needed therapy for months until, with layoffs affecting her technology firm’s clients and fellow hockey moms, she felt “out of control” and “started to forget things.” Now twice-monthly sessions focus on the economy. Dr. Craig advises writing down worries, and making decisions about controllable things, like vacations.Scott Schuck, 43, a business owner who had consulted Dr. Craig only for career coaching, began twice-weekly phone sessions after stress started waking him and creating “a lot of anxiety” in his relationship with his girlfriend.Ms. Villalba, wary of medication, started meditation classes, even meditating in her car outside her office.Ms. Hubbard, knowing “financially we were fine,” said she believed “I shouldn’t feel like this, I’m lucky.” She cried visiting her primary doctor, who recommended therapy and medication, hard to accept, she said, because her Depression-era parents believed “you pull yourself up.”“I felt like a neurotic middle-class, middle-aged woman too weak to deal with life on my own,” she said. “I should be stronger, it was simply money, and why do I have to take pills to not worry about money.”But treatment and further organizing family finances helped. She said the weakening economy made her “fear that even if you do everything right, something bad can happen to you.”'"
"'09-04-09,'1','The funds, the thinking goes, would buy troubled mortgage securities from banks, enabling the lenders to make the loans that are needed to rekindle the economy. Many of the loans that back these securities were made during the subprime era. If all goes well, the funds will eventually sell the investments at a profit.But, as with any investment, there are risks. If, as some analysts suspect, the banks’ assets are worth even less than believed, the funds’ investors could suffer significant losses. Nonetheless, the administration and executives in the financial industry are pushing to establish the investment funds, in part to counter swelling hostility against the financial industry.Many Americans are outraged that companies like the American International Group paid out many millions in bonuses despite crippling losses and multibillion-dollar rescues from Washington.The embrace of smaller investors underscores the concern in Washington and on Wall Street that Americans’ anger could imperil further efforts to stimulate the economy with vast amounts of government spending. Many Americans say they believe the bailout programs — and the potentially rich profits they could yield — will benefit only a golden few, including some of the institutions that helped push the economy to the brink.“This is an opportunity to forge an alliance between Main Street, Wall Street and K Street,” said Steven A. Baffico, an executive at BlackRock, referring to the Washington address of many lobbying firms. BlackRock, a giant money management firm, is playing a central role in the government’s efforts and is considering creating a bailout fund. “It’s giving the guy on Main Street an equal seat at the table next to the big guys,” he said.The new funds are still under discussion, and they are unlikely to be established for several months, if indeed the plans go through at all.But the comparison one industry official uses to illustrate the mistake that America must avoid is the large-scale privatization in Russia in the 1990s, which involved a transfer of entire industries to a few, well-connected oligarchs. That experience tarnished the idea of free-market capitalism in Russia and undermined its program to move toward a market economy.“It is really, really important to allow Main Street in,” said the official, who was involved in discussions about the plan but who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about it publicly. “They are getting taxed for this problem. They should have an opportunity to participate in the recovery.”Still, it is unlikely that everyday investors would play a major role in financing the bailouts through these funds. Hedge funds and other private investment firms are expected to invest far more money. The Treasury has not said how much money it intends to raise from individuals; first it wants to select about five fund managers to participate in the program to buy beaten-down securities. These firms must demonstrate an ability to raise about $2.5 billion among them. It may select several more fund managers later.Perhaps more important than the money would be the political bonus of having thousands or even millions of taxpayers — whose portfolios have nose-dived during the crisis and whose tax dollars are financing bank bailouts and stimulus packages — profit from the toxic asset plan.To head off the political risk of using public subsidies to move the assets from banks into the hands of private investors, the Treasury has already announced that, as part of its plan, it will retain part ownership of the toxic securities and loans, thus ensuring that taxpayers will share some of the gain if the assets’ prices rise.But the plan to allow small investors to participate directly with their own money goes further.Critics like Joseph E. Stiglitz, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, argue that the bailouts merely privatize profits and socialize losses.But if the plan goes well, including everyday Americans as buyers of the assets may encourage them to support the government’s program and avoid another American International Group-style firestorm. If investors lose money, however, the effort could backfire.“If this turns out to be great but you have kept it away from Mom and Pop and the rich are favored, that looks bad, but it’s also bad if you have people who are burned,” said Jay D. Grushkin, a partner at the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.Some of the biggest investment managers in the United States, including BlackRock and Pimco, have been consulting with the government on ways to rebuild the country’s broken financial markets.On the day the plan was announced by Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, both Bill Gross, the co-chief investment officer of Pimco, described it as a “win-win-win policy,” andLaurence D. Fink, BlackRock’s chairman and chief executive, said his firm would take part.The fund industry has been in discussion with the government but insists the Treasury has not been prescriptive about the type of funds it wants established. In its letters to potential investors, however, the Treasury requires fund managers to set out how they will include retail investors, saying applicants “must note whether, and if so how, it plans to structure the fund to facilitate the participation of retail investors in the fund.”Individuals could participate in the funds by investing just a few hundred dollars, although the details are still being worked out.If selected — likely to happen by mid-May — money managers like BlackRock could begin a fund within weeks.As well as BlackRock and Pimco, Legg Mason, another big mutual fund company, and BNY Mellon Asset Management, a big asset manager, have said they are interested in starting retail investment funds to participate in the government’s plan.For the investment managers, the benefits are potentially large. These big firms can charge healthy fees to investors for taking part. They will also have the marketing prestige of being the firms the government turns to at a time of crisis to help sort out the country’s financial mess.'"
"'09-04-09,'1','She said she had long wanted to take the plunge into small business but did not because “I was a single mom for several years and couldn’t take the risk.” But when she moved to the United States, she said, creating a start-up filled a void and became “a passion for me.”Now, Ms. Joseph runs the shop and Ms. Young, 44, supplies it.First, she scours stores in New Hampshire and Maine for bargain designer brands. On shopping sprees that can last days, “I try to hit all the T. J. Maxxes, Marshalls and even Macy’s stores within driving distance,” she said.Then, she packs them, very tightly, in suitcases. “I can get a city in a suitcase,” she boasts.Finally, she and her husband drive to Boston and fly to Fort Lauderdale, Fla. They take the SeaEscape cruise ship to Grand Bahama Island and, the next day, board a cabin cruiser to Abaco, where her sister picks her up.It is on that final sea voyage that Mr. Young sometimes stands out in the crowd. “I’m like a shipping agent,” he says, adding that on his wife’s shopping expeditions, he is an “advance scout” for evaluating men’s wear.Mr. Young marvels at her sales skills, a must attribute for any entrepreneur. When she is in the Abaco store, he says, “It’s incredible how she interacts with women. A lot of them walk out carrying a couple of hundred dollars’ worth of clothes they probably never expected to own.”Just For You Boutique is currently recording sales of about $2,500 a week and is profitable. The only major misstep the sisters have made was their initial decision to aim at slim women; their best customers turned out to be women who required larger sizes.They have resolved that problem and are putting aside most of their earnings for future expansion. Their next step is to introduce a limited selection of men’s and children’s apparel. And at some point, they intend to move into larger quarters and maybe open a second store on Grand Bahama.Small as her enterprise is, it shows that small businesses can succeed at the outset of a recession and do so across borders even as trade barriers are going up in the global economy.It illustrates something else, as well: the infectiousness of entrepreneurial enthusiasm. As she was making plans for the shop, Ms. Young traded ideas with her hairdresser, Bernice Jahn, a white South African transplant and her closest friend in the United States.Ms. Jahn, 48, had run several businesses in her native land and, it turned out, had entrepreneurial ambitions of her own. She often accompanied Ms. Young on her shopping tours, she said, and her friend, in turn, “gave me ideas” about the venture she was working on, a 2,000-square-foot spa in Greenland, N.H.In early May, Ms. Jahn expects to open the center, named Zakanaka Day Spa after the word for thankfulness in the language of the Shona people of Zimbabwe. In addition to providing hair styling and skin and nail care, she said, Zakanaka will introduce a new nonsurgical hair replacement procedure. It will also be selling African artifacts, with some of the profits going to help artists and poor children in Africa.Speaking of Ms. Young, she said, “We came to this country within months of each other and we started businesses within months of each other. Donna’s working with her country, and I’m working with mine. I guess you could say it’s the American dream.”'"
"'09-04-09,'1','“This law is definitely overdue and it’s only a fair and proportionate response to a major problem,” said Marc Guez, the managing director of the French Society of Phonographic Producers, which represents recording companies. “Our members are losing more than 500 million euros a year in sales.”While piracy surveillance systems have been discussed in a number of countries, the French plan goes farther than the measures under consideration elsewhere. On April 1, a law in called the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive took effect, allowing industry groups to more easily prosecute copyright piracy.In the , a Congressional committee this week began studying the issue. In a hearing Monday before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives, , the film director, cited the French initiative in asking lawmakers to deputize the American film industry to pursue copyright pirates.In France, the law has attracted prominent support from the French music and film establishment, including Johnny Hallyday, the French rock star, and Denis Olivennes, the former chief executive of the FNAC retail chain.The International Federation of Phonographic Industry, a group based in that represents the global music industry, said that 95 percent of all songs downloaded on the Internet last year — including those in France — were illegal downloads. Globally, illegal music downloads cost $12.8 billion in sales, according to the group.While supporters and opponents both predicted that the proposal would become law, some lawyers and Internet advocates said the measure would face a tougher road before the French Constitutional Council, which can invalidate laws that it determines do not conform with the Constitution.One of several controversial aspects of the proposal places the onus of proving innocence on those accused, who would only be able to protest their innocence after they were disconnected from the Internet.“It is always hard to predict how the Constitutional Council may rule, but this new law does not protect the fundamental right to defend oneself,” said Cédric Manara, a law professor at the Edhec Business School in .Winston Maxwell, a media lawyer at Hogan & Hartson in , said the legal challenges might delay the measure’s effective date.“But I doubt the Constitutional Council will decide a French citizen has the right to make illegal downloads,” Maxwell said.Nonetheless, Internet advocates call the French proposal legally unsound on the ground that there are inadequate the provisions for challenging an action, and because it gives industry groups the power to police the Internet. Others question whether the law would unfairly penalize those whose wireless broadband accounts are misused by others. The French law tries to anticipate this by making it a civil infraction for citizens to fail to “secure” their broadband accounts by using approved filtering technology.That burden, theoretically, would fall on public Wi-Fi hot spots.Nicolas D’Arcy, a spokesman for France’s ISP Association, the Association des Fournisseurs d’Accès et de Services Internet, said Internet providers were hoping the law would not take effect.Internet service providers, Mr. D’Arcy said, do not want to become the enforcement arm of French justice and do not trust the law to insulate them from suits brought by customers whose service has been cut off.“There are so many things wrong with this,” Mr. D’Arcy said.Other critics say the law will not stop illegal downloads.Jérémie Zimmermann, director of La Quadrature du Net, an Internet advocacy group based in Paris, said some computer users would turn to encrypted downloads and other methods to avoid detection. On Wednesday, a Swedish company, the Pirate Bay, began a service called Ipredator, which lets users use its virtual private network to make anonymous downloads for 5 euros a month.“The French law will only drive people further underground,” Mr. Zimmermann said. “It will make the situation worse.”Michel Thiollière, the French Senate sponsor of the legislation, said the system would probably survive legal review by the council and help preserve the rights of French artists, musicians and actors.“The mechanism is reasonable and a graduated response designed to bring Internet users to a new world where the rights of creators must be respected,” he said.'"

The acquisition also will give Pulte large tracts of land in Texas and the Carolinas, two of the most resilient real estate markets, and a presence in 29 states and Washington.The new company will keep the Pulte name and headquarters in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.

"'09-04-10,'0','If, after Greg Mottola’s charming “Adventureland,” which opened last week, you find yourself in the mood for another tale of a recent college graduate’s coming of age in Pittsburgh one crazy summer in the 1980s, you may be in luck. Or not, since even the most passionate fan of Pittsburgh-in-the-’80s-crazy-summer-coming-of-age stories is likely to be disappointed by “The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,” a clumsy and confused adaptation of Michael Chabon ’s 1988 novel.That Rawson Michael Thurber, who directed and wrote the screenplay, was motivated by sincere affection for Mr. Chabon’s book is evident in his scrupulous attempt to capture the novel’s delicate tone, which is poised between whimsy and heartbreak. A certain amount of the author’s prose has been transferred directly into the movie in the form of voice-over narration, which turns the main character’s wry naïveté into glum and redundant pretension. His name is Art Bechstein, and he is played by Jon Foster, who is attractive and well behaved but, at least in the absence of strong direction, a fairly inert screen presence.Art’s story meanders from one fraught incident to another without much resonance or momentum. His father, played with gruff efficiency by Nick Nolte, is a local gangster who is urging his son toward a respectable career as a stockbroker. While he studies for the Series 7 exam, Art works in a discount bookstore and carries on an affair with his supervisor, Phlox (Mena Suvari), who never rises above the level of a moderately misogynist, blatantly snobbish caricature. Art is distracted by the ravishing Jane (Sienna Miller) and her volatile, bisexual boyfriend, Cleveland. (“Like the state?” Phlox asks, just so we know that she’s too dumb for our sympathy.)Played by Peter Sarsgaard, Cleveland is a potentially interesting character, and both Mr. Sarsgaard and Ms. Miller do their best (though just what accent Ms. Miller is attempting is hard to guess) to push beyond the film’s hazy, romantic view — shared with the book — of who they are. Mr. Thurber’s suave camera movements, the slightly weary natural beauty of Pittsburgh and a piquant score (by Theodore Shapiro) provide the impression of a style, but the absence of any credible emotion beyond Art’s passive-aggressive anomie cripples the story before it begins.When, at the end, the plot accelerates, and things start to look interestingly complicated, it’s too late. You’re left not with any feeling or insight, but rather with nothing much beyond the vague impression that Mr. Thurber, whose previous film was the Ben Stiller comedy “Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,” is a big fan of Mr. Chabon’s “Mysteries of Pittsburgh.” Even viewers who share his admiration for the book may leave the theater wondering what he saw in it.'"

Higgins’s goal came on a pass through the crease that caromed in off McKenzie’s stick past the freshman goaltender Rob Madore.“A lot of people were pulling for us,” the Bemidji captain Travis Winter said. “We knew that going into the game. It was kind of a feel-good story for a lot of people out there.”Unwilling to let the good vibes continue for Bemidji fans, the sophomore forward Tommy Wingels raced up the left side eight minutes into the second period, head-faked a defenseman, and slipped a cross-crease pass toward Hirschfeld, who extended his stick at the right side of the net, getting just enough of the puck to tip it past the scrambling goaltender Matt Dalton (33 saves) to give Miami (23-12-5) a 2-0 lead.The Beavers struck back just over a minute later to close the gap and breathe life into a crowd eager to see the unlikely postseason run continue. The center Matt Read gathered a bouncing puck by the left post and skated toward the goalie Cody Reichard (24 saves), deking him out of position and easily scoring to cut the Miami lead to 2-1.“You’re never comfortable with a team that plays like Bemidji, because they just go,” Miami Coach Enrico Blasi said.The packed arena, peppered with fans clad in Bemidji green, cheered wildly while Read celebrated the goal. The joy, however, was short-lived.The RedHawks scored again to regain their two-goal edge 61 seconds later. Will Weber’s shot from the left point was batted down in front and ended up beneath Dalton’s pads, but Bill Loupee fished out the puck and hammered it into the net to make the score 3-1. It was just the third goal of the year for Loupee, who picked up on a Miami trend of getting goals from unlikely places. Hirschfeld’s goal was just his fifth.“We know that guys like Loupee and Hirschfeld are going to have to come up big for us,” Blasi said. “Maybe next game it’s somebody else.”Wingels was the offensive star for Miami, finishing with two goals in addition to the assist on Hirschfeld’s goal. He ignited the RedHawks’ offense with a goal early in the second after a first period in which both teams failed to score on several quality chances.Wingels lined a low wrist shot tight to the left post and just over Dalton’s right pad to open the scoring with a power-play goal. And with the Bemidji State net empty in a last-ditch effort to keep the team’s championship hopes alive, Wingels carried the puck over the blue line and deposited it to ice the game and send Miami to its first title game.'"

"'09-04-10,'0','When the National September 11 Memorial and Museum announced a year ago that it had reached its $350 million capital fund-raising goal, it did so with a roster of the top names in finance, including the American International Group and the Starr Foundation, with which A.I.G. was once closely allied; the Merrill Lynch & Company Foundation; Bear Stearns; and Lehman Brothers.Together, these five institutions pledged $55 million, or more than 15 percent of the total. The memorial had placed a lot of eggs in one basket, but with the exception of Bear, which had just collapsed and been acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Company, it seemed like a pretty sturdy basket.Five months after the fund-raising announcement, however, Lehman sought bankruptcy protection. Some of its assets were picked up by Barclays Capital, which had already made its own pledge to the memorial. Merrill, on the verge of failure, agreed to sell itself to the Bank of America, which had also made an independent pledge to the memorial. Then the government agreed to bail out A.I.G. with tens of billions of dollars before it could collapse. Meanwhile, its many troubles had depleted the assets of the Starr Foundation, which held a large amount of A.I.G. stock.You would expect, then, that the memorial would now be staggering from the loss of anticipated gifts.But Joseph C. Daniels, the president and chief executive, said in an interview this week that the memorial’s finances were actually in good health.“We are very grateful for the amount of cash we have received,” he said: $220 million to date.Among the 81 contributors who pledged $1 million or more, Mr. Daniels said, 45 have already fulfilled their commitments or paid at least half of their pledges.The Starr Foundation, whose donation of $25 million was the largest of all, has already paid $20 million of that pledge and intends to make the final payment this month, said Florence A. Davis, president of the Starr Foundation and a director of the Starr International Foundation of Switzerland.The international foundation, Ms. Davis said on Thursday, “is contemplating making a gift to help with any shortfalls in the memorial’s funding as the result of one or two donors canceling their pledges, which we understand might be the case.”Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the chairman of the memorial, said in a statement, “The creation of the memorial is uniquely important to New Yorkers, and the fact that the city’s corporate citizens are honoring their commitments to it despite the downturn is a reflection of that.” (Mr. Bloomberg has already made good on his $15 million pledge, a spokesman said.)Memorial officials would not disclose the status of any individual donors. But a couple of them spoke for themselves.“Bank of America’s $10 million commitment has been fully paid,” said Nicole Nastacie, a spokeswoman for the bank. “Merrill Lynch committed $10 million and we will honor that commitment.”JPMorgan Chase pledged $10 million and Bear $5 million. “We are honoring both the JPMorgan Chase & Company and the Bear Stearns commitments, payable over a multiyear period,” said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the bank.Another $10 million pledge came from A.I.G. “We have paid $4 million of that and intend to meet the rest of our commitment,” said Christina Pretto, a company spokeswoman.And Barclays Capital has paid its $5 million pledge in full, said a spokesman, Mark Lane.However, it is clear that memorial officials do not expect to see the $5 million Lehman pledge. On the public list of donors, they have moved the company from the $5 million category to the $1 million category, suggesting strongly that this is how much Lehman Brothers actually gave before declaring bankruptcy.Mr. Daniels said the foundation had written off $1 million of the $51 million in cash it expected to collect in 2008. About 90 percent is in hand, he said, and the rest is expected. He said the memorial would not need to draw significant amounts from its cash reserves until next year. First, it is using $250 million in federal grants that came through the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and $80 million from New York State for the museum’s plaza-level pavilion.The principal benefactor of the memorial and museum, the Starr Foundation, takes its name from Cornelius Vander Starr. He founded companies that were combined into the American International Group by Maurice R. Greenberg, who was chairman and chief executive of A.I.G. until 2005. Mr. Greenberg is chairman of the Starr Foundation.The Starr Foundation of New York has been selling off its large holdings of A.I.G. stock since Mr. Greenberg’s departure, Ms. Davis said, and its two million shares now amount to “a drop in the bucket” compared with diversified assets of approximately $1.25 billion. The Starr International Foundation is far more reliant on A.I.G. stock. The ownership of 290 million shares is being contested by A.I.G.Ms. Davis said so many Wall Street companies were involved in financing the memorial in part because they were so directly affected by the events of Sept. 11, 2001.“A.I.G.’s headquarters always was downtown and the foundation was located there until 2005,” Ms. Davis said. “I am confident that we would have been major contributors to the memorial in any event, as New Yorkers and as Americans, but Starr’s proximity to ground zero made it feel even more imperative. We were close enough on Pine Street that for many hours we couldn’t leave our building because of smoke and debris. Many of us knew people who died or who lost family members. And we all returned to work on Pine Street to a ghost town, which lasted for many months.”'"
"'09-04-10,'0','The site, scheduled to debut this week, will be a “one-stop shop” for anyone following climate change, Mr. Morano says. He will post research he thinks the public should see, as well as reported video segments and ratings of environmental journalists.Supporters see Mr. Morano as a crucial organizing force who has taken diffuse pieces of scientific research and fused them into a political battering ram.“Before Marc, efforts to debunk global warming were scattered and disorganized,” said John Coleman, a weather broadcaster who helped found the Weather Channel and who has called global warming “a scam.”And environmentalists and mainstream climate scientists, however much they disagree with Mr. Morano’s views, still pay attention to what he does.Kert Davies, the research director of Greenpeace, said he would like to dismiss Mr. Morano as irrelevant, but could not.“He is relentless pushing out misinformation,” Mr. Davies said. “In denying the urgency of the problem, he definitely slows things down on the regulatory front. Eventually, he will be held accountable, but it may be too late.”In his work with Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Morano, whose thick build fills out his suit like a bulldog in a restraining jacket, did not hesitate to go after journalists he saw as biased. He promoted any study or statement that could be construed as cutting against the prevailing view that heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming. Peter Dykstra, a former executive producer for CNN’s science, environment and technology unit, recently called him the “drum major of the denial parade.”Mr. Morano may be best known for compiling a report listing hundreds of scientists whose work he says undermines the consensus on global warming.But environmental advocates and bloggers say that many of those listed as scientists have no scientific credentials and that their work persuaded no one not already ideologically committed.Mr. Morano’s new Web site is being financed by the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a nonprofit in Washington that advocates for free-market solutions to environmental issues.Craig Rucker, a co-founder of the organization, said the committee got about a third of its money from other foundations. But Mr. Rucker would not identify them or say how much his foundation would pay Mr. Morano. (Mr. Morano says it will be more than the $134,000 he earned annually in the Senate.)Public tax filings for 2003-7 — the last five years for which documents are available — show that the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the ExxonMobil Foundation and from foundations associated with the billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, a longtime financer of conservative causes best known for its efforts to have President Bill Clinton impeached. Mr. Rucker said Exxon had not contributed anything last year.Mr. Morano grew up in a conservative household in Northern Virginia with an affinity for nature and animals — his basement was home to a menagerie of reptiles, including a boa constrictor.“I used to tell people I was Republican except on the environment,” he said.After college, Mr. Morano worked as a reporter for Rush Limbaugh, where he said he had learned the satisfactions of poking at the “liberal establishment.” He made a documentary on the Amazon rain forest, he said, because it annoyed him that celebrities like Sting could dictate what people think about the issue. They vastly exaggerated the problem of deforestation, he concluded.He then jumped to Cybercast News Service, where he was the first to publish accusations from Vietnam Swift-boat veterans that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, then the Democratic presidential nominee, had glorified his war record. Many of the accusations later proved unfounded.Mr. Morano is proud of his work, which he says is not advocacy but truth seeking.“Even in the Senate, I’d put up any of the stories we did against any pablum Time or Newsweek has put out on global warming,” he said. “We’d link to the other side; we’d present their arguments. They do one-sided screeds.”In 2007, he points out, the Republican Web site of Mr. Inhofe’s committee won an award from the independent Congressional Management Foundation.But some scientists and environmental advocates who have made it their business to monitor Mr. Morano see his reports — the most recent was titled “More than 700 International Scientists Dissent Over Man-Made Global Warming Claims” — as far from balanced.Kevin Grandia, who manages Desmogblog.com, which describes itself as dedicated to combating misinformation on climate change, says the report is filled with so-called experts who are really weather broadcasters and others without advanced degrees.Chris Allen, for example, the weather director for WBKO-TV in Kentucky, is listed as a meteorologist on the report, even though he has no degree in meteorology. On his Web site, Mr. Allen has written that his major objection to the idea of human-influenced climate change is that “it completely takes God out of the picture.” Mr. Allen did not respond to phone calls.Mr. Grandia also said Mr. Morano’s report misrepresented the work of legitimate scientists. Mr. Grandia pointed to Steve Rayner, a professor at Oxford, who was mentioned for articles criticizing the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international treaty on curbing carbon dioxide emissions.Dr. Rayner, however, in no way disputes the existence of global warming or that human activity contributes to it, as the report implies. In e-mail messages, he said that he had asked to be removed from the Morano report and that a staff member in Mr. Inhofe’s office had promised that he would be. He called his inclusion on the list “quite outrageous.”Asked about Dr. Rayner, Mr. Morano was unmoved. He said that he had no record of Dr. Rayner’s asking to be removed from the list and that the doctor must be “not to be remembering this clearly.”Many scientists, Mr. Morano said, are afraid that appearing on the list will have political fallout.And political fallout, for him, is the point.'"
"'09-04-10,'0','It was during the 1970s that the Russian River area experienced a slowdown in its second-home market. But then, the area’s low prices caught the interest of developers of gay resorts. These offset the decline and by the 1980s, the Forestville area experienced a resurgence. Buyers come from the Bay Area, including San Francisco, which is about 60 miles south.Pricing here is driven less by square footage than by a property’s acreage and proximity to the river. There are a significant number of very small uninsulated cabins available in the $200,000 to $300,000 range, but these often need a lot of work. More characteristic of the low end are houses in the mid-$300,000’s. These houses tend to be near but not on the river, and small. At the high end, prices from $1 million to $2 million are typical, but rare properties with significant acreage occasionally yield higher prices, too.Sales have slowed in some areas, but conditions for buyers are good, real estate agents said.“It’s been a long time since interest rates have been this low,” Ms. Packer said. “My parents had a rate like this when I was in third grade,” she said. “I’m 60 now.”This 7,000-square-foot house is on 20 acres, of which about one-quarter is devoted to pinot noir grapes, under contract to a winery. Built in 2004, the stone and stucco house has an open layout and many floor-to-ceiling windows. Glass doors lead to a wraparound deck and a pool from which there are vineyard and mountain views. The passive-solar house has two wings: one with the master suite, one with a guest suite. There is a large kitchen with a butler’s pantry, hardwood floors and four and a half bathrooms.

"'09-04-10,'0','“I’ve been in a transition where Louisville wasn’t that great at first and we turned the program around. I think Atlanta has a lot of great players to definitely turn this program around.”Fifteen seniors were here for the three-round draft, waiting anxiously for their names to be called in anticipation of the W.N.B.A.’s 13th season, now with 13 teams because the Houston Comets disbanded.After Maryland teammates went with the second and third picks — the 6-1 guard/forward Marissa Coleman to Washington and the 5-7 point guard Kristi Toliver to Chicago — the leader of Connecticut’s championship team, Renee Montgomery, a 5-7 point guard, came into play. She went fourth to Minnesota.“It really sinks in,” Montgomery said. “Now I really do have a new team. I really am not on UConn’s team anymore. I’ll always be a Husky, though.”She added: “I know the W.N.B.A. is looking for a more fast-paced-style game, so I hope that’s where I can be a help.”Phoenix selected Auburn’s DeWanna Bonner, a 6-4 guard, with the fifth pick, and Arizona State’s Briann January, a 5-8 guard, went next to Indiana.Courtney Paris, Oklahoma’s four-time all-American center, was taken seventh, and she could not have been more thrilled.Sacramento selected Paris, who is from Piedmont, Calif., about an hour and a half from the state capital. Her father, the former San Francisco 49ers offensive lineman Bubba Paris, lives in Discovery Bay, about 45 minutes away.“He reached over to me and said, ‘I get to come to every one of your games,’ ” said Courtney, whose twin sister and Oklahoma teammate, Ashley, went in the second round to Los Angeles. “So I’m excited. He’s really proud.”There has been that question of $64,000 hanging over Courtney Paris, the only N.C.A.A. player, male or female, to post 2,500 points and 2,000 rebounds. She had vowed to repay her scholarship if Oklahoma failed to win the championship. Louisville knocked out the Sooners in a national semifinal.The fifth through eighth picks make base salaries of $41,574, $42,406 and $46,646 in their first three seasons, but Paris said she still planned to make good on her promise, only in a different way.“I keep my commitments,” she said. “Right now, we’re working on something, trying to collaborate to make up some type of fund that kicks back into the community. I feel that’s something I would have wanted to do anyway. We have a great university, and our athletic director wouldn’t accept the money back. But I feel like there is something I can do to help the state of Oklahoma.”With the eighth pick, the Liberty went to New Jersey for help, taking Rutgers’s Kia Vaughn, a 6-4 center from the Bronx. Vaughn said she was happy to be joining her former Rutgers teammate Essence Carson on her hometown team. Vaughn called Carson “my big sister.”Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer said Vaughn “is going to be a great pro.”The W.N.B.A. made the economic decision to streamline the rosters this season, from 13 to 11. So the second- and third-round choices will have a tougher time sticking.“Undoubtedly,” Orender said. “The league’s play has exponentially grown, the excitement, the athleticism, the skill level. The young players will push the old players, but there are a limited amount of spots.”'"

"'09-04-10,'0','Small businesses will soon feel a little more love in their love-hate relationship with Yelp, the Web site whose users post reviews of restaurants, dry cleaners and other local businesses.Starting next week, Yelp will let small-business owners publicly respond to reviews. This is a big change for the site, which has until now steadfastly refused to give businesses significant access to its pages.“Business owners for years now have been asking for more and more voice on the site,” said Geoff Donaker, Yelp’s chief operating officer. “As long as it’s done in a respectable way, it’s good for the consumer and good for the business owner.”As Yelp has become more important in major American cities, its relationship with small businesses has become more contentious. Particularly in San Francisco, where the company started in 2004, Yelp has angered some small businesses because it has not allowed them to respond to reviews, as TripAdvisor and other review sites do.Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive, Jeremy Stoppelman, has said that to protect the voice of the consumer, the voices of businesses, many of which advertise on the site, had to be muted.As the site matures, though, it has been taking steps to appease small-business owners. A year ago, Yelp started allowing business owners to update their businesses’ profile pages and privately contact reviewers.The latest step of adding public responses shows that the start-up company is maturing, said Greg Sterling, founder of Sterling Market Intelligence, an Internet research firm.“They’ve received a lot of criticism about their perceived bias against businesses,” he said. “This is a concession to the needs and interests of small businesses who sometimes feel powerless.”Yelp requests that business owners use the public comments to correct inaccuracies, provide their side of a story or explain how they have fixed a problem. They are not supposed to use comments to advertise or make personal attacks. Yelp will not screen comments before they are published, but users will be able to flag inappropriate comments for review by Yelp’s customer service team.Peter Picataggio, the owner of Tart, a Los Angeles restaurant, and an advertiser on Yelp, has been frustrated by false reviews in the past.He said that although he and his staff responded privately to almost every Yelp review, he welcomed the chance to do so publicly. “I think that’s great that I get to tell my side of the story,” he said.'"
"'09-04-10,'0','General Motors is working on a new debt-exchange plan for its bondholders, one that would most likely offer only equity instead of cash or new debt, a person briefed on the proposal said on Thursday.The new exchange offer, which is being drafted in consultation with the Obama administration’s auto task force, may be announced next week. To succeed, G.M. must reach an agreement with bondholders by June 1, when some of its bonds are due.As part of its effort to restructure itself inside or outside of bankruptcy, G.M. is looking to reduce its debt burden. Its bondholders, who range from big investment firms to potentially hundreds of individual investors, hold about $28 billion of unsecured debt.G.M. offered its bondholders an offer two weeks ago through which they would have swapped their holdings for new equity, debt and a small amount of cash. But on March 30, the Obama administration’s auto task force said that G.M. had 60 days to rework its plan.The task force, led by Steven Rattner, has demanded that G.M. bondholders take a steep discount to the value of their debt holdings. The presidential team has signaled that it would not allow taxpayer money to be used as interest payments for G.M.’s bonds.Advisers to an unofficial bondholders committee have argued that they are being forced to accept a bigger sacrifice than other creditors. They have also complained that they have met with the presidential auto task force only once, on March 5.'"
"'09-04-10,'0','At the last minute, several members of the opposition Socialist Party rushed in to vote against the plan, according to Christine Albanel, the culture minister, in what she called a “cynical maneuver by the opposition.” The bill was rejected, 21-15.Jérémie Zimmermann, director of La Quadrature du Net, an Internet advocacy group in Paris, described the outcome as “a huge political blow” for Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Albanel. “It’s a victory for the citizens and the civil liberties over the corporate interests,” Mr. Zimmermann added.While film studios and record companies blame piracy for billions of euros in lost sales, critics said Mr. Sarkozy’s plan would violate Internet users’ rights and might have been unworkable.Under the proposal, the music and movie industries would be allowed to analyze the downloads of individual Internet users to look for unauthorized sharing of movies and music, and to report violations to a newly created, government-run agency. The agency would send warning letters to violators; after the third letter, the Internet service provider would be required to sever service.Patrick Bloche, a Socialist member of the National Assembly who has led opposition to the Sarkozy proposal, said the plan was “politically dead.”“This effort to intimidate 18 million French Internet users, the vote today showed, will not succeed,” he said.Under France’s parliamentary system, it is unusual for a government initiative to be voted down. According to the newspaper Le Figaro, it was the first time that a bill worked out in a joint committee of Parliament had been rejected.But French lawmakers have sometimes entertained maverick approaches on media-related issues. Three years ago, members of the National Assembly discussed, but then rejected, a proposal for a “global license” for anyone to download unlimited amounts of music in return for a modest annual fee.Sarkozy’s anti-piracy plan could still be revived, at least in its broad outlines. Ms. Albanel said in a statement that she was “determined to fight for its adoption by the two chambers when the bill is debated anew, by the end of the month.”The progress of the bill was being followed closely outside France because other governments, under pressure from the entertainment industry, have also been considering more aggressive laws against piracy. In South Korea, for example, the government this month introduced a measure that would allow it to shut down online message boards that had repeatedly ignored warnings to remove pirated content.Britain, meanwhile, has been pushing Internet providers and content companies to come up with a solution on their own, without requiring legislation — so far, to no avail. In New Zealand, the government recently suspended a law requiring Internet service providers to cut off copyright pirates because the I.S.P.’s and content owners could not agree on how to enforce it.“The ‘three strikes’ policy is a highly politically charged and sensitive issue that triggers extreme reactions on both sides of the debate,” said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research. The vote in Paris “illustrates the risks associated with business issues being subject to political concerns.”While many Socialists have long opposed the idea of cutting off Internet users, Mr. Sarkozy and Ms. Albanel also apparently failed to persuade some party lawmakers to come into line.Hervé Rony, director general of S.N.E.P., a trade group for French record companies, said he thought a revived proposal, removing the requirement for payment to continue during the cutoff period, could win support from lawmakers.“Of course, we are very disappointed,” he said. “But it is probably just a political maneuver. It will take some weeks more, and that’s a problem — the more we wait, the more the people download.”'"
"'09-04-10,'0','Stock markets surged higher on Thursday after Wells Fargo, the nation’s largest consumer bank, said that it expected to report record profit for the first three months of the year, kindling hopes that financial companies may finally be closing the book on quarter after quarter of wrenching losses.As financial stocks soared, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 219 points in late afternoon trading, crossing above 8,000 points. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was 3.1 percent higher, increasing the gains of a bear-market rally that has lifted stocks more than 20 percent since it began one month ago.Just three months ago, Wells Fargo announced that it had lost $2.55 billion as the economy foundered and the bank absorbed billions of losses from the acquisition of the Wachovia Corporation. But a statement on Thursday, Wells Fargo said it expected to report $3 billion in profit for the first quarter of 2009, far exceeding Wall Street’s expectations, and said it was issuing mortgages at a fast clip.Investors took the statement from Wells Fargo, whose shares gained 20 percent, as another harbinger that the tattered economy may be bottoming out.Other major banks like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which reported billions in losses last quarter, have said that they expected to be profitable this year, and wisps of less-bad data from the housing market, manufacturers and consumer surveys are giving rattled investors new hopes that a bottom is in sight.'"

"'09-04-11,'0','The Bush administration — which disdained the United Nations only slightly more than it disdained the hard work of diplomacy — chose to boycott the United Nations’ highly dysfunctional Human Rights Council. The Obama administration has decided to run for a seat on it. That may be the best chance to shape up this international embarrassment, but it won’t be easy.The council frequently and unsparingly condemns Israel, but when it comes to Sudan’s genocide in Darfur or the murderous crimes of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, it has cynically and shamefully pulled its punches. Last month, it endorsed an ill-considered Pakistani resolution against defaming religions that could easily be used to justify censorship and official persecution of unbelievers.The council’s weakness is part of a larger problem at the United Nations. Rather than risk criticism of their own policies, members all too willingly enable each other’s excesses — and call it respect for national sovereignty. And like too many other United Nations bodies, the council apportions membership on the basis of regional bloc politics, not merit or performance. As a result, countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Cuba — all current members — sit in judgment of others’ human rights performance, while routinely abusing the rights of their own people.Making the council credible will require countries that are genuinely committed to human rights to stand up to the relatively small number of egregious violators and the much larger group that gives them cover. That will not always be easy for Washington since some chronic abusers — Egypt and Pakistan come to mind — are allies or strategic partners of the United States.Washington will surely be elected next month, since it will be running uncontested for a seat assigned to the Western bloc. Membership will not be enough. Successful diplomacy rests on forging compromises and building consensus. But when quiet diplomacy fails, as it often will, the United States must raise its own voice, unequivocally, on behalf of repression’s voiceless victims.'"
"'09-04-11,'0','Gay men and lesbians across the country have had plenty to celebrate in recent days. Last week, the Iowa Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry. Days later, the Vermont Legislature agreed that that state should sanction same-sex marriage. Now, Gov. David Paterson of New York has restated his promise to push for this decent and important change in the marriage laws of New York State.This is a basic civil right that has been denied to New York’s gay residents for too long. Many have been forced to go to Connecticut or Massachusetts for an official marriage certificate. If that is not enough of an argument for Mr. Paterson, it could also give him a much-needed political, as well as moral, win. The governor’s poll numbers are at historic lows, in part because people worry that he does not have enough discipline and backbone to succeed at Albany’s tough politics.Mr. Paterson seemed to back into the subject of same-sex marriage, at first. Instead of a major news conference, which would have been fully justified given the importance of the moment, he mentioned his decision on a radio show as he was touring the state handing out stimulus money. He did, however, restate his view the next day while making it clear that it was time for his fellow Democrats in the State Senate to stop stalling and to prepare to put the issue to the floor — to be debated and then voted up or down.This is a radical idea in Albany where a bill rarely gets to the floor unless its passage is assured. As Mr. Paterson noted in Rochester this week: “It’s like professional wrestling. You know who’s going to win before the match starts.” For that reason, some gay-rights advocates have expressed alarm about letting such an important bill get to the Senate floor before being assured that it would pass. They should take heart from what happened in 2007 when the Assembly did exactly that.The same-sex marriage bill went to the Assembly floor that June with few predictions that it would pass. That brought out members, the press and staff members to watch one of the best and most pointed debates in recent memory. At one point, Assemblywoman Teresa Sayward, a Republican and devout Catholic from upstate, spoke of how she and her son had struggled with his identity as a gay man and how she had finally told him to be who he is, not who people wanted him to be.Her story helped carry the vote, 85-to-61. This year, the Assembly is expected to pass a same-sex marriage bill by an even wider margin.So far, Senate Majority Leader Malcolm Smith, who also supports same-sex marriage, has not warmed to the idea of a free debate and open vote on the issue. He needs all 32 Democratic votes and one Democrat — Senator Rubén Díaz Sr. of the Bronx — openly opposes the bill. But there are undoubtedly some Republicans who would favor such progress for the state. Mr. Smith’s spokesman has dismissed the idea of an open vote as “empty rhetoric.”'"

I learned a little bit of that with Pedro, the guys that have to master certain things for a period of time, that you don’t want to extend them.”SCOUTING THE STADIUM Dolphin Stadium is a familiar stop for most on the Mets, who play three series here every season. Not so for Jeremy Reed, who, as the team’s designated late-inning defensive specialist, was looking forward Friday afternoon to becoming acclimated to the park’s quirky angles and outfield dimensions.Reed played here once before, in June 2005 with Seattle, but only for two innings and in center field. He has replaced Daniel Murphy in left field for defensive purposes twice in three games, and he planned to prepare as if he would be playing there again this weekend.“Batting practice is key for me,” Reed said. “That’s the way I’m going to learn.”He stationed himself a few feet in front of the left-field warning track during batting practice and watched balls bounce around in the corner and off the Teal Monster, the 26 ½-foot-high wall.Razor Shines, the Mets’ outfield coach, said he planned to hit balls over Reed’s head to see how he would react. Shines is also the third-base coach, and learning the caroms will help him decide whether to send runners home.He watched the Marlins coach Bo Porter pound balls off the wall and learned that “the higher the ball hits off the wall, the bigger the bounce,” Shines said. “You’ll get in trouble if you don’t play it right.”STOKES A MODEL MET On Page 13 of this month’s edition of Delta Sky Magazine, the in-flight magazine of Delta Air Lines, there are photographs of the Sydney Opera House, the actress Daryl Hannah and the reliever Brian Stokes. Delta is the Mets’ official airline. Fernando Tatis, while flipping through the magazine on the team charter Thursday night, showed the photo to Stokes. “I don’t know why they picked me,” said Stokes, laughing. “I guess I’m the new face of the Mets.”PLANS FOR SHEFFIELD Gary Sheffield had another right-field tutorial Friday afternoon, and afterward Jerry Manuel said Sheffield probably would make his first start Wednesday night against San Diego at Citi Field. Manuel had been thinking about starting Sheffield on Sunday, but he said he wants to play the team’s best outfield defense behind Johan Santana.Asked if Sheffield would be ready to play Sunday if Santana was not pitching, Manuel smiled. “I wouldn’t say that he would be ready,” he said. “But he probably would play.”PART OF GAME WON’T BE SHOWN Viewers will not be able to watch the first part of Saturday night’s game.

The company disclosed the subpoena, issued in March, in a bankruptcy court filing and said it had handed over the documents. A Tribune spokesman was not available for comment.The agency’s questions relate to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a law intended to protect people in employee retirement plans. The stock plan was an important piece of Mr. Zell’s plan to acquire the company in an $8.2 billion deal that involved $13 billion in debt. He intended for the stock plan to become the largest owner of the company, which would let it avoid corporate taxes. That, in turn, was supposed to help a company turnaround.'"

"'09-04-11,'0','Yahoo and Microsoft, which held a marathon series of fruitless merger and partnership negotiations last year, have restarted discussions, this time over a possible advertising agreement, a person briefed on those discussions said Friday.Conversations between the two sides have been scant since Carol Bartz was named Yahoo’s chief executive in January. But they have started anew recently, and Ms. Bartz met with Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, last week, said the person briefed on the discussions, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because the talks were confidential.The discussions are in early stages and may not lead to any agreement, the person said. They have centered on ways for the companies to pool their advertising efforts, including a possible partnership under which Microsoft would sell search ads for Yahoo, and Yahoo, in turn, would sell display ads on Microsoft properties, this person said.After merger and partnership talks collapsed last year, Microsoft continued to make sizable investments in its search business to better compete with Google. Those investments included the hiring of a string of top search executives and engineers, some of whom had previously worked at Yahoo, including Qi Lu, a well-regarded technologist who is now in charge of Microsoft’s overall online business, including search.Microsoft is expected to release the results of its latest research and development efforts in search technology this summer when it plans to introduce a major overhaul of its search engine.Microsoft executives are bullish about the capabilities of the new service. But they readily admit that it does not address one of the principal challenges the company faces in competing with Google: Microsoft’s audience and its base of advertisers are tiny compared with Google’s. That makes Microsoft’s search business, in which advertisers bid against one another in an auction, less lucrative than Google’s.'"
"'09-04-11,'0','A campaign promoting atheism on London buses this year ultimately “served God’s cause” by reminding people of the importance of faith, especially to those who suffer, a papal preacher said Friday. The campaign involved paying to have the slogan “There’s probably no God. Now enjoy your life!” placed on buses. “We should almost thank the people who promoted that advertising campaign. It has served God’s cause more than so many of our apologetic arguments,” said the Rev. Raniero Cantalamessa, whose title is preacher of the papal household. He added: “It has demonstrated the poverty of their reasons and has helped stir so many sleeping consciences.” He was preaching in St. Peter’s Basilica in the presence of Pope Benedict XVI on Good Friday.'"
"'09-04-11,'0','But Judge Stanton disagreed, noting that the trustee’s distributions, by law, can go only to those who were customers of Mr. Madoff’s brokerage firm “rather than a substantial number of those whose losses stemmed from investments made through intermediaries.”To be sure, those feeder funds — like the giant Fairfield Sentry fund, run by the Fairfield Greenwich Group, and the private hedge funds run by the prominent investor J. Ezra Merkin — were Mr. Madoff’s customers, and they ultimately will be eligible to recover the same percentage of their losses as his individual customers. They could then use that money to compensate their own investors.But their investors are not eligible for the $500,000 in SIPC insurance coverage that is being distributed to the brokerage firm’s customers.Judge Stanton also rejected government arguments that criminal forfeiture laws were a more powerful and less expensive way to gather assets for Mr. Madoff’s victims, because his personal assets were almost certainly the fruits of his crime and therefore subject to forfeiture.The government submitted no proof for that conjecture, the judge noted. Moreover, Mr. Madoff’s victims have no role in forfeiture proceedings, as they do in bankruptcy court, he said.John Nestor, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the agency wanted to maximize returns for investors “in the most efficient and cost-effective manner possible” but would work with a bankruptcy trustee when one was appointed.Jonathan M. Landers at Milberg, the law firm that asked Judge Stanton to permit the bankruptcy filing, said the need to protect the feeder-fund investors was not one of the arguments his firm made to the judge.Rather, the firm argued that the bankruptcy court was the best place to weigh competing claims from creditors, which are barred from suing to seize the debtor’s assets in other jurisdictions — as various victims have already done in the Madoff case.Moreover, Mr. Landers said, the bankruptcy court is the most effective forum for tracking down Mr. Madoff’s personal assets abroad, where the reach of federal forfeiture laws may be disputed. He added: “What are you going to do — send the Marines over to seize the French château?”But the search for foreign assets has certainly not been neglected by Mr. Picard, the Madoff brokerage firm’s trustee.Since early February, he has engaged a half-dozen foreign law firms — in Ireland, the Cayman Islands, London and Luxembourg — to pursue fresh assets and defend those already recovered.On Thursday, he sued an offshore bank, Banque Jacob Safra in Gibraltar, and one of its hedge fund clients, Vizcaya Partners, to recover $150 million that was withdrawn from the Madoff firm for Vizcaya’s benefit at the end of October.But people close to the case said it did not signal the beginning of a campaign of so-called clawback lawsuits — cases aimed at recovering money from investors who withdrew more from their Madoff accounts, over time, than they had put in.There are many individual investors of limited means, as well as some large charities, who fear they fall in that category, and many of them have said publicly that the threat of clawback litigation has been their nightmare for months.Those lawsuits may come, of course — but the Vizcaya complaint is not one of them. Indeed, Vizcaya would not normally be vulnerable to a clawback suit at all because, according to the complaint, it invested $327 million and withdrew only $150 million.Cases like the one filed against Vizcaya involve a simpler and less controversial aspect of the bankruptcy code, James Sprayregen, a bankruptcy law specialist with Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago, explained.To prevent devious debtors from transferring money for their own use and then filing for bankruptcy when the piggy bank is empty, all bankruptcy trustees have a broad right to sue to recover money transferred from the debtor’s estate within 90 days of the bankruptcy filing, he said.Payments made during that 90-day window are called “preference” payments, and they are the low-hanging fruit in any insolvency — but they may be particularly significant in this case, where the trustee has so far recovered only about $1 billion.Criminal charges filed against Mr. Madoff in December quoted him as telling employees soon before his arrest that he was worried about recent redemption demands totaling $7 billion. If he honored those redemption requests within the 90-day window, the Vizcaya complaint could be the first in a worldwide siege of these “preference” lawsuits.'"
"'09-04-11,'0','On Thursday the New York Racing Association revoked the credential Paragallo, informing him that he was not welcome at its racetracks. It also prohibited him from turning over the operation of his family’s Paraneck Stable to relatives or current employees.On Wednesday the State Police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals took over Paragallo’s farm in Climax, saying he had neglected more than 170 horses in his care.The Humane Society began a feeding program for Center Brook’s horses Thursday to combat malnutrition that Perez said had left the horses in horrific condition. Veterinarians will return to the farm Saturday and Monday to tend to the horses — ages 1 to 20 years old — that were showing bones from lack of food and were riddled with parasites, lice and skin infections as well as untreated injuries.In the past week, several individuals and rescue groups have shed light on the poor condition of Paraneck’s horses, and one group saved four undernourished former racehorses from a New York kill pen.The New York State Racing and Wagering Board has opened an investigation of Paragallo, but the New York Racing Association was the first group within racing to take action. It scratched all of the Paraneck Stable horses entered for races at Aqueduct through Wednesday. NYRA also said it would not accept entries for any more of the stable’s horses until it approves a new operating agent.“It being understood that no current employee or affiliate of Paraneck Stable or no member or blood relative of the Paragallo family is acceptable to NYRA,” according to a letter from the racing association’s legal department and delivered to Paragallo.Over the years, Paragallo has run a busy operation, starting 4,686 runners and earning $20.6 million in purses. His principal trainer, John P. Campo Jr., is the brother of NYRA’s racing secretary, Paul J. Campo.Also on Thursday, NYRA said it would convene a hearing next Thursday of its Backstretch Area Violation Panel for the trainer Jeff Mullins, who was caught medicating a horse in a detention barn last Saturday. The group will hear Mullins’s explanation for why he had a syringe and cough medication in the barn before a race at Aqueduct.No medication is allowed in New York on raceday with the exception of a diuretic, which is administered by a state veterinarian.After the barn incident, Mullins’s horse, Gato Go Win, was scratched from the $200,000 Bay Shore Stakes. Two races later, Mullins captured the $750,000 Wood Memorial with I Want Revenge, an early favorite to win the Kentucky Derby.Mullins contended that the substance and the syringe were in plain sight when he was searched and that when he was allowed in, he did not think he was doing anything wrong. “It was an honest mistake,” he said this week.The panel can take a number of actions if a trainer is found in violation of medication rules, ranging from a fine and a suspension to denying entry to Mullins’s horses. Though Mullins is based in California, I Want Revenge could theoretically be competing for a Triple Crown at Belmont.'"
"'09-04-11,'0','But the recent anecdotal data, if they hold, would have a historical parallel in , when the birth rate fell sharply.As this recession continues, it is understandable that more people might hesitate to expand their families. A baby born in 2006 — the latest year for which data are available — will cost middle-income parents $260,000 by the time the child reaches 17, according to the Agriculture Department. And that doesn’t include college.In , says that compared with last year’s first quarter, requests for vasectomies were up more than 30 percent in the first three months of this year at its clinics in and Riverside Counties, where 64 of the procedures were done.“The recession has created a new level of urgency among our clients,” said Vince Hall, a spokesman. “We used to have a three- to six-week waiting period. Now men have to wait two-and-a-half months to get an appointment.”Helping spur demand, he said, might be the fact that unemployed men often qualify for free vasectomies under Family PACT, a family planning program for low-income households.On the Upper East Side of , where the financial industry’s collapse has compressed many a household budget, Dr. Marc Goldstein says he has been performing more vasectomies than usual over the last five months.Through most of last year, Dr. Goldstein, who directs male reproductive medicine and microsurgery at the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill , was performing about six vasectomies a month. Then, in November, the number rose to nine, where it was holding steady through the end of March.“I’ve been in practice for 30 years, and I’ve never seen a spike like this,” Dr. Goldstein said. “Many of my clients work in finance and say they feel anxious about the expense of an added child.”In , Dr. Charles Wilson of the Vasectomy Clinic says that in the last half-year he has performed an average of 123 of the procedures each month — 13 percent above the year-earlier average. “Some come in because they are out of work and have more time on their hands to take care of medical issues,” Dr. Wilson said. “Others are afraid of losing their job and want to get their vasectomy done before they lose their .”Unemployment was the reason Michael Swogger, 30, went to see Dr. Wilson. Mr. Swogger was laid off in January from his job as a software test engineer. With three children and another on the way, he and his wife decided it was time for a vasectomy.“I wanted to get this done before the ran out,” Mr. Swogger said.Meanwhile, visits to — a 10-year-old informational site that also markets doctors to patients — were up 17.5 percent in the first quarter, compared with the first three months of last year.And traffic to the site’s physician profile pages was up 40 percent, according to Maya Wank, chief operating officer of the Web site, who said the activity might indicate consumers were not simply gathering information but wanting to take action.Experts agree that from a practical and financial point of view, vasectomies are an ideal form of . The procedure — which cuts or seals the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles — typically costs $500 to $1,000, but is usually covered by insurance.The surgery is done in a doctor’s office with local and requires less than 20 minutes. Recovery takes a matter of days. It is nearly 100 percent effective. A successful vasectomy renders a man permanently sterile — unless he changes his mind.The possibility that a man might change his mind, in fact, is the reason some doctors who perform vasectomies say men should think twice before having one. Reversing the procedure is a complicated, five-hour task, can cost thousands of dollars and is rarely covered by insurance. And, oh, yes: About half the time it does not work.“Since I spend a lot of time reversing vasectomies, I initially try to talk my patients out of getting one,” says Dr. Harris Nagler, chairman of the Sol and Margaret Berger department of urology at Beth hospital in Manhattan. “If they are convinced that they want a permanent surgical form of , then we go ahead. It is the right decision for many individuals.”'"
"'09-04-11,'0','HONG KONG — Stock markets in Asia were broadly higher on Friday, helped by the strong rally staged by Wall Street overnight. But the rises in Asia were more modest, and numerous key markets were shut for public holidays.The Nikkei 225 index in Japan eked out an increase of 0.5 percent, the Kospi in South Korea rose 1.5 percent, and the key indices in Taiwan and mainland China both gained more than 2 percent – all helped by Wall Street's performance on Thursday in which the main indexes saw gains above 3 percent.The rally in the American markets was propelled by the announcement by Wells Fargo, one of the United States' largest consumer banks, that it expects to post record profits in the first quarter. That kindled hopes that the financial system, which dragged the economy toward the brink, was now poised to lead the way out of the downturn.The news came amid mounting signs that the worst of the economic downturn may now be over – even though a perceptible recovery remains months off.On Friday, data from China showed exports in March were 17.1 percent below a year earlier, while imports slumped 25.1 percent.

"'09-04-12,'0','PIRACY is the maritime ripple effect of anarchy on land. Somalia is a failed state and has the longest coastline in mainland Africa, so piracy flourishes nearby. The 20th-century French historian Fernand Braudel called piracy a “secondary form of war,” that, like insurgencies on land, tends to increase in the lulls between conflicts among great states or empires. With the Soviet Union and its client states in Africa no longer in existence, and American influence in the third world at an ebb, irregular warfare both on land and at sea has erupted, and will probably be with us until the rise of new empires or their equivalents.Somali pirates are usually unemployed young men who have grown up in an atmosphere of anarchic violence, and have been dispatched by a local warlord to bring back loot for his coffers. It is organized crime carried out by roving gangs. The million-square-miles of the Indian Ocean where pirates roam might as well be an alley in Mogadishu. These pirates are fearless because they have grown up in a culture where nobody expects to live long. Pirate cells often consist of 10 men with several ratty, roach-infested skiffs. They bring along drinking water, gasoline for their single-engine outboards, grappling hooks, ladders, knives, assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and the mild narcotic qat to chew. They live on raw fish.The skiffs are generally used to launch attacks on slightly larger crafts, often a fishing dhow operated by South Koreans, Indians or Taiwanese, taking the crews prisoner. In turn, they use the new ship to take a larger vessel, and then another, working up the food chain. Eventually, they let the smaller boats and crews go free. In this way, over the years, Somali pirates have graduated to attacking oil tankers and container ships; the bigger the vessel, the higher the ransoms, which the pirate confederations can then invest in more sophisticated equipment.As Braudel suggested, there is nothing new here. Piracy has been endemic to the Indian Ocean from the Gulf of Aden to the Strait of Malacca, and particularly so after the Western intrusion into these waters, beginning with the Portuguese in the 16th century. Pirate groups, sometimes known as “sea gypsies,” tended to escalate in number and audacity as trade increased, so that piracy itself has often been a sign of prosperity. The Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta, who was the victim of pirates off western India in the 14th century, informed us that commercial ships in the Indian Ocean of his day traveled in armed convoys as a defense. Slightly earlier, Marco Polo described many dozens of pirate vessels off Gujarat, India, where the pirates would spend the whole summer at sea with their women and children, even as they plundered merchant vessels.The big danger in our day is that piracy can potentially serve as a platform for terrorists. Using pirate techniques, vessels can be hijacked and blown up in the middle of a crowded strait, or a cruise ship seized and the passengers of certain nationalities thrown overboard. You can see how Al Qaeda would be studying this latest episode at sea, in which Somali pirates attacked a Maersk Line container ship and were fought off by the American crew, even as they have managed to take the captain hostage in one of the lifeboats.So we end up with the spectacle of an American destroyer, the Bainbridge, with enough Tomahawk missiles and other weaponry to destroy a small city, facing off against a handful of Somali pirates in a tiny lifeboat. This is not an efficient use of American resources. It indicates how pirates, like terrorists, can attack us asymmetrically. The challenge ahead for the United States is not only dealing with the rise of Chinese naval power, but also in handling more unconventional risks that will require a more scrappy, street-fighting Navy.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','The Dream Factory is being left in the dust by the Field of Dreams.Matt McCoy, an openly gay Iowa legislator, was so excited by the court’s unanimous decision that he posted a video inviting everyone, “gay and straight,” to come get married and settle in Iowa.Max Mutchnick, the co-creator of “Will and Grace,” who married the entertainment lawyer Erik Hyman in just days before Proposition 8 passed last November — theirs is among the 18,000 or so marriages now in legal limbo — was tickled by the idea of Iowa as the new California.“Will we see rollerblading in the Des Moines skywalk?” Mutchnick mused. “Will paparazzi chase after farmers looking for candid shots? Will Ashton and Demi be BlackBerrying friends from their corner table at ? Will there be a new line of Kiehl’s products for goats?”Mutchnick, who is raising twin girls with Hyman, frets that may be behind the country on this issue, and that the Obamas do not have enough gays around them.“If more homosexuals were in the Obamas’ lives,” the writer said, “there is no way Michelle would have worn a twin set when she met the queen.”Newsom is running for governor, even though his cause foundered, and he may have trouble wooing those blacks and Latinos who supported Prop 8. He doesn’t like the image of California reeling backward and “becoming the first state in U.S. history to use the Constitution to strip people’s rights away.”The dashing mayor, now 41, was a pariah at the 2004 Democratic convention because some Democrats thought his operatic parade of gay marriages had helped W. and buzz the base and eke out a victory against .Over what he called a “Vitamin V” vodka at the St. Regis hotel here, Newsom’s predecessor, Willie Brown (who prefers for governor and thinks Newsom should run for lieutenant governor) disputed this, laughing: “You think John Kerry lost because Gavin Newsom married people? No way! It was because he was on that sky- piece of equipment. Wind-surfacing. He was wind-surfacing all over the world.”Newsom said he hasn’t sat down with , who warned the mayor to win approval in court before issuing marriage licenses, but that he had reconciled with , who said Newsom had pushed the issue “too much, too fast, too soon.”While he says he doesn’t like being a chew toy for , and the religious right, or getting ugly messages or obscene gestures from people at airports, he asserts that his brazen approach in 2004 made it harder for Democrats “to speak from both sides of their mouths to justify their position that separate is equal,” and caused a “softening” in discrimination.“People watched and saw a human face,” he said. “They saw somebody who looked like their next-door neighbor and said, ‘That’s not the person with chaps in the big gay parade.’ ”He said he has been rereading ’s “Letter From Jail” and feels he needs to “do more, now and better.”“If we didn’t do it in 2004, do you think the party would have wanted us to do it in 2006 during the midterm elections to take back Congress?” he said. “God forbid. 2008? Well, it’s another presidential year. And now people are saying 2010? That’s another critical year to hold Congress, and we’ve got statehouses across the nation. 2012? Another presidential year. 2014? Another Congressional year. Wait does almost always mean never. That was Dr. King’s point.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Among the criticisms of the Obama administration’s bank rescue proposal is that it’s a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose proposition, with Wall Street flipping the coin and taxpayers coming up tails.Under the plan, which could be up and running in a matter of weeks, the government will provide up to $1 trillion in financing for big private investors, like the powerhouse asset manager BlackRock, to buy up banks’ bad assets. If those assets subsequently lose value, the investors do not have to repay the government loans, sticking taxpayers with potentially huge losses. If the assets make money, taxpayers get only half the profit.Given that lopsidedness, it is not surprising that many Americans see the bank bailouts — the Bush administration’s and now the Obama administration’s — as intentionally gamed to benefit Wall Street constituents at taxpayers’ expense.Apparently stung by that criticism and distrust, Obama officials have now floated the idea of encouraging everyday investors to invest directly in the plan. One possible approach would be to gather some of those assets into a mutual fund in which everyone could buy shares. With more skin in the game, the thinking goes, we could all learn to love the bailout.The notion is flawed. For individuals, investing makes sense only after they have a comfortable cash cushion, they have paid off credit cards and other high-interest debt, they are current in taxes and monthly bills, and they are reasonably secure in their jobs and incomes. Unfortunately, in ever-increasing numbers these days, Americans do not fit that description. Even among those who do, only those with money to burn would be in a position to jump into investments so complex and risky that the world’s major banks utterly misjudged them.At this point, it is still not clear whether the banks will be willing to sell their toxic assets — because doing so may require them to take long-postponed write-downs, admitting just how bad things are. If the banks are willing to sell, it is also not clear whether enough of the “big guys” will want to buy, even with all of the subsidies in the bailout plan. The plan assumes that the banks’ assets are temporarily undervalued and will rebound. If the big guys do not step up big time, it is a safe bet that assumption is wrong. And even if they do go on a buying spree, that does not mean the rest of us — who cannot depend on the government for a bailout if we choose wrong — should follow.'"

Walsh is intent on preserving salary-cap space for the expected stellar free-agent class of 2010.There will be competition for both players. Lee has established himself as one of the most productive big men in the N.B.A., averaging 16.1 points and 11.7 rebounds. Robinson, although erratic, has become one of the league’s top sixth men, averaging 17.4 points and 4.1 assists.Assessing their worth amid a difficult rebuilding project is now one of Walsh’s primary tasks.“If the team is built the right way, they could be valuable and have a place on this team,” Walsh said Saturday. “They could be. But we’ll have to see.”Lee and Robinson were eligible for extensions last summer, but no serious negotiations took place because of each player’s initial asking price. According to a person who was briefed on the matter, Lee’s agent was seeking about $10 million a season, and Robinson’s agent was asking for about $6 million.Walsh would not discuss their value, but he noted that “a player can be good at a number and not good at another number.”Based on the Knicks’ cap concerns, it is likely that they will try to re-sign the pair for no more than $10 million to $11 million combined. They are more likely to keep Lee than Robinson.Because they are restricted free agents, Walsh will have the right to match any offer. He could also try to arrange a sign-and-trade deal to gain something in return.“With each player, I kind of have an idea of if they fit, where they fit, that kind of thing,” Walsh said, declining to elaborate.There was some risk in waiting a year to evaluate the two players. Lee and Robinson seemingly increased their value this season — Lee with a league-best 63 double-doubles and Robinson with 26 games of at least 20 points.Both players, however, are regarded as below average defensively, and they have never been part of a winning team. There are also concerns about Robinson’s behavior. He has 12 technical fouls and is frequently caught up in verbal battles with referees, opponents, teammates and coaches.The Knicks could lose both players this summer, but Walsh dismissed the suggestion that he had gambled by not trading or re-signing them sooner.In fact, the decision to wait may help the Knicks’ bargaining position, given the poor state of the economy.Most N.B.A. teams are in cost-cutting or cost-containment mode, which could depress salaries this summer. The salary cap is expected to decrease. And only six or seven teams will have significant cap space. At least a half-dozen teams are trying to conserve space for 2010, when LeBron James and Dwyane Wade can become free agents.Of course, as Walsh noted, “it only takes one team” to inflate a player’s price and render him too expensive.There are other factors in the Knicks’ favor. Lee and Robinson are solid young players, but neither one projects as an All-Star. And they will be competing for dollars with a fairly strong free-agent class.Among the players who can become free agents this summer are six current or former All-Stars (Carlos Boozer, Allen Iverson, Rasheed Wallace, Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion, Ron Artest) and three top-shelf veterans (Mike Bibby, Andre Miller, Lamar Odom). The younger tier includes Josh Childress, Marvin Williams, Ben Gordon, Raymond Felton, Linas Kleiza, Paul Millsap, Charlie Villanueva, Trevor Ariza and Leon Powe.It seems likely that a team that wants to spend its cap space on a young forward is more likely to pursue Boozer than Lee. A team looking for a high-scoring guard may prefer Gordon to Robinson. (The Knicks themselves may pursue Gordon if Robinson’s asking price is too high.)Robinson and Lee say they want to stay in New York. Knicks officials still say they want to keep them. The rest will be decided in July.“Myself and D-Lee, we spoke pretty loud,” Robinson said. “Everybody around the league knows what we can do. So we’ll just see what decision they make.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Since that day, even the basic question of whether Mr. Levinson is alive remains unresolved.One businessman who is assisting the F.B.I. in its inquiry said in a brief telephone interview that it was his understanding that Mr. Levinson was alive, a view that F.B.I. agents involved in the case share, said several people who had spoken with them. That businessman, like several other people interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to disrupt efforts to resolve the case.In a recent interview, a top F.B.I. official said the agency had received several unconfirmed reports of sightings of Mr. Levinson in Iran. But the official, Joseph Persichini Jr., said the inquiry had yet to produce evidence to prove that Mr. Levinson was alive. “Some of those reports were detailed and sound credible, and we need to resolve that,” said Mr. Persichini, the assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.’s Washington field office, which is conducting the investigation.Some American lawmakers have said they believe that Mr. Levinson is being held in an Iranian prison. An expatriate Iranian businessman said his contacts in Iran had told him that Mr. Levinson was held for a time at a site near Tehran run by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard.Government officials there have repeatedly said that they know nothing about Mr. Levinson. An official in the Iranian president’s office and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry both refused to comment about the case on Saturday.Because no group has said it is holding Mr. Levinson, some people familiar with his case have speculated that he may have died in captivity. But others believe that the silence surrounding his status could suggest that because of his F.B.I. background, his captors view him as a high-value chip in a possible prisoner swap.“I am confident he is alive,” said David L. McGee, a lawyer in Pensacola, Fla., who represents the Levinson family.Mr. Levinson, who turned 59 a day after his disappearance, lived in Coral Springs, Fla., 20 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. For his wife, Christine Levinson, and their seven children, ages 15 to 31, the past two years have been an excruciating ordeal. Their hopes have soared and then plummeted amid conflicting reports about progress in his case. Last year, Mrs. Levinson traveled to Kish to retrace her husband’s footsteps. She receives regular briefings from the F.B.I.“They just keep telling me they keep hearing that he is doing well,” Mrs. Levinson said in a recent telephone interview. “I have always believed that he is alive and well and somewhere in Iran, and that has not changed.”Mr. Levinson spent more than 20 years with the F.B.I. Before his retirement in 1998, he specialized in Russian organized crime cases. Most of his work as a private investigator involved product counterfeiting, though he also worked for human rights organizations.It was an assignment for one such organization, Global Witness, a London-based group that investigates corruption in natural resource industries, that took Mr. Levinson to Dubai in March 2007. After spending several days there, he next flew to Kish for his meeting with Mr. Salahuddin.Mr. Salahuddin’s involvement has added another mystery to the case. While he has been quoted in news reports as saying that the killing he carried out in 1980 was necessary to eliminate enemies of Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution, he has also criticized some of Iran’s recent leaders and once flirted with the possibility of surrendering and returning to the United States. Mr. Salahuddin did not respond to recent e-mail messages seeking comment.Jeffrey Katz, the head of a London-based investigative firm for which Mr. Levinson did some work, said that he and other friends of the former agent believed that the F.B.I. was initially slow to devote sufficient resources to the case. An agency spokesman, John Jay Miller, disputed such suggestions.The Levinson case has received more attention since President Obama’s election. Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, has been urging the F.B.I. and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to make resolving Mr. Levinson’s case a priority.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Now he has turned his attention back to writing. He is polishing a novel he completed in prison, “Movin’ Violation,” which he plans to publish in the summer with his own imprint. Then he will focus on two other novels and two movie scripts that are nearly finished. “And I have new books that are running through my mind,” he said. “I just have to find time to sit down and write.”His literary career represents a striking transformation for someone who says he never read a book before being sent to prison.Mr. Reddick, a high school dropout, devoted seven years during his late teens and early 20s to building a lucrative drug-selling business. From his base on University Avenue in the west Bronx, he expanded to several East Coast states, selling heroin and crack cocaine. He claims he earned “hundreds and hundreds” of thousands of dollars during that time, enough to purchase a new luxury car every six months and spend $3,000 to $4,000 a day on clothing, food and gifts.“One month you would make $100,000, and the next $1,000,” he said. “That’s the way the game worked. But I knew that as long as I had drugs, I had money.”The end came in 1992 when a woman he had hired to carry drugs from New York to North Carolina was arrested. She and several others agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against Mr. Reddick. After a trial in federal court in North Carolina, he was convicted of leading a conspiracy to transport and distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced to nearly 20 years.While in federal prison in Allenwood, Pa., Mr. Reddick first considered writing. Inspired by Jeffrey Archer’s 1979 novel “Kane and Abel,” which he picked off a book cart, he began writing tales about young drug dealers. He had a cellmate “who wouldn’t read any books,” he said. “So I started writing things on pieces of paper and he would read them. Every night he would ask for more pieces.”After long hours at a manual typewriter in the prison library, Mr. Reddick produced a manuscript that was passed from inmate to inmate. “I would overhear people talking about it in the TV room and the line at the chow hall,” he said. Mr. Reddick was transferred to a federal prison at Fort Dix in New Jersey in 2000, and was encouraged by another prison author he met there, Michael G. Santos. Mr. Santos, whose latest book is “Inside: Life Behind Bars in America,” enlisted his wife, Carole, to help edit the work and commission a small print run of a few hundred copies of “Street Team.”“I’m a white girl from north Seattle, about as far away from the Bronx as you can get,” said Ms. Santos, who now lives in California and helps manage the career of her husband, who is still in prison on a drug conviction. “Yet I loved the book because it was a story of relationships.”As he moved from prison to prison, Mr. Reddick continued to write, and a fellow inmate at several institutions, Joe Maldonado, was often his first reader, discussing plot points and character motivation.“I wasn’t someone who was into reading urban novels,” said Mr. Maldonado, who was serving 10 years on a drug charge and has since been released. “So he wanted my opinion. They’re good books.”One of the novels, “Squeeze,” found its way into the hands of Susan Hampstead, an editor at Don Diva, a magazine popular among prisoners. “I just read it casually one day because I needed something to read,” she said. “And I couldn’t put it down. The humor captured me. I had read a lot of gangsta novels, and it was the first time I found comedy in that type of book.”Ms. Hampstead was so impressed that she decided to form a company, Hampstead Publishing, expressly to publish “Squeeze” and republish the earlier book. Hampstead’s edition of “Street Team” was released in 2005 and has sold 9,000 copies; “Squeeze,” which came out in 2006, has sold 5,000 copies. The books are available from street-corner vendors, urban bookstores and the publisher’s Web site.“He lived the life, and people can relate to that,” said Divine Harris, who sells Mr. Reddick’s and other urban-themed novels on a table outside the Prospect Avenue subway station in the South Bronx.If his books have not cracked the best-seller lists — the most popular title in the genre, “The Coldest Winter Ever” by the rapper Sister Souljah, has more than a million copies in print — they have been read avidly by Mr. Reddick’s neighbors in the Bronx. After leaving prison in May 2008, he discovered that he was as well known for his books as his drug past.“Everybody says, where’s Part 2 to ‘Street Team?’ Where’s Part 2 to ‘Squeeze?’ ” he said. At a cookout held in his honor three days after his release, he wore out his arm signing copies for scores of friends and neighbors.During a walk around the neighborhood on a recent afternoon, Mr. Reddick acknowledged that much had changed since he went away. The crack houses are gone. The abandoned synagogue next to his old drug hangout is being turned into a Boys and Girls Club. The small park that was once a heroin marketplace is now outfitted with a new jungle gym.He is different, too. He said he was determined to write about his past rather than relive it.“I know the repercussions,” he said. “If I had known the repercussions from it, I would’ve never got involved.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Investment advisers caution against reading too much into the discrepancy. Stocks everywhere may be experiencing a dead-cat bounce, with ones in the developing world merely gaining a bit more altitude after their initial drubbing.“Emerging markets really took it on the chin last year, so it isn’t that much of a shock that they have been more resilient this year,” said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation at GMO, a global investment management firm.But he and others contend that there is more to the rally. They take it as a sign of fundamental strength in emerging economies.Severe periods of underperformance in the past have been deserved, they say, and were not just a matter of risk aversion. This time around, emerging markets seem to be the strong link in an otherwise flimsy chain.“Fundamentals are much better in parts of the emerging world than in the developed world,” said Thomas Melendez, manager of the MFS International Diversification fund.“Some would argue that some developed markets are bankrupt,” he said. “Emerging markets have very little debt at the government, company or individual level.”In other words, many emerging markets got stronger by getting smarter.“Companies, for the most part, are pretty solid with strong balance sheets and lots of cash because they were being cautious in view of what happened in the past,” said Mark Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management. The same goes for governments, many of which have built up huge foreign-exchange reserves.The lower debt and abundant cash mean that some of the larger developing countries are burdened with fewer financial and economic problems than more mature ones. That allows them to tackle their problems more aggressively. China is an oft-cited example.“I still think there is a strong case for China doing better” than other markets, emerging or mature, said Edmund Harris, manager of the Guinness Atkinson Asia Focus fund. By preventing banks from engaging in some practices that proved so disastrous elsewhere, the country “has protected itself to some degree,” he said.“That provides a stable base through which China can stimulate its domestic economy,” he added.JUST how much stimulation China needs is debatable. Josephine Jiménez, chief investment officer of Victoria 1522 Investments, notes that some economists predict 6 percent growth in Chinese economic output this year and that the government expects its efforts to support the economy to result in 8 percent growth.Other developing countries will be hard pressed to match either number, but Ms. Jiménez expects growth in many of them to come in well ahead of what mature economies will attain. That growth comes cheap, in her view.“I’m finding a lot of companies trading below their breakup value,” she said, meaning that their market values are lower than what the companies’ net assets likely would fetch in acquisitions.She prefers sectors like gold mining, telecommunications and food production. Her portfolio includes such holdings as Zhaojin Mining in China; Shoprite Holdings, a fast-growing retailer in such countries as Botswana and Madagascar; and Rainbow Chicken, which supplies four million broiler chickens a week in South Africa for a 30 percent share of the market.Mr. Mobius, at Templeton, also finds emerging markets extremely cheap. “We’re like kids in a candy shop,” he said. “Everywhere we turn, we’re finding bargains.”He favors energy companies, including Petrobras of Brazil and PetroChina, and banks like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction and Banco Itau in Brazil.Mr. Melendez, the MFS fund manager, says he thinks that buying technology stocks is a way to capture a recovery in the global economy.“If we do come out of this malaise, we’ll probably see a replacement cycle, which would be good for parts makers,” he said.South Korea is an especially good play on global growth, said Mr. Inker of GMO. But he reminds investors that most emerging markets, with their emphasis on commodities and manufacturing, amount to a bet on a stronger economy.He does not know whether such a bet will pay off, but he likes the odds that the markets are offering.“It helps to be priced for destruction,” he said. “It’s never too much of a surprise when cheap stocks go up.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','American policy makers are fighting a two-front war. On the eastern front, they are battling a shortage of demand, as traumatized households and businesses pull in their horns. Less spending by some people means fewer jobs for others who, in turn, curtail their own spending. Keynes diagnosed this vicious recessionary spiral in the 1930s, and we are now in the midst of the worst one since then.Fortunately, we know how to fight a demand shortage — with more government spending, tax cuts and lower interest rates. That is why Congress enacted a huge fiscal stimulus in February and why the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to virtually zero. But the cure takes time, and we are still sliding downhill. Depending on how long and deep the recession gets, we may need more firepower. But at least policy makers know what to do — and are doing it.The western front is vastly more complex. All economies run on credit, and ours developed an extreme dependency. Largely through their own failings, banks have been seriously damaged. Bankers are paralyzed by fear of further loan losses and shrinking capital that might subject them to regulatory penalties — or worse. One way or another, the banks must be restored to health and emboldened to lend.How? The Fed has made huge loans to banks and flooded them with cash. But the banks also need capital, and private money is not stepping up to the plate. That was why Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, decided to devote the Troubled Asset Relief Program to injecting capital into banks last fall. I disagreed with both his decision and the way he executed it. But there was a rationale for what he did, and the current Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, will eventually be back for more money for this purpose.But banks are just part of the problem. Much modern lending is securitized by the so-called shadow banking system — a complex web of interlocking, sometimes mysterious capital markets. Invisible to most people, it is crucial to getting credit to mortgagees, credit card holders and businesses. And while the financial implosion wounded the banks, it decimated the shadow banking system.The most obvious — but not the only — disasters stem from mortgage delinquencies, fears of more, and consequent uncertainty about the values of mortgage-related securities. Bringing these markets back to life is one rationale for both the administration’s foreclosure mitigation programs and its public-private investment programs. It is also a principal rationale for many of the Fed’s unprecedented lending and money-creation activities.Thus the war plan has four essential components that hang together logically: stimulating aggregate demand, limiting foreclosures, rescuing (most of) the banks and rehabilitating the shadow banking system. Three of the four are in place. We await Mr. Geithner’s bank rescue plan, which, I hope, will be some version of the good bank-bad bank idea I mentioned here last month.Unfortunately, the administration seems to have a penchant for complexity in designing its programs, and I certainly would not defend all the details. But it’s essential that citizens see through the trees to the forest. All this taxpayer money is being put at risk for a good, simple reason: Victory in a two-front war requires winning on both fronts. We won’t defeat the recession unless we restore some financial order.Countries do unpalatable things in wartime, and collateral damage is common. So it is here. The impending federal budget deficits are monstrous. The Fed is printing money like mad. People who deserve punishment are receiving help instead. The government’s investment partnerships may enrich some investors.There will be time to address these problems later. For now, the nation must focus single-mindedly on winning the war. There really is a plan.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','What has the masses frothing — justifiably — are the Bizarro World salaries and bonuses that executives pulled in before and after they blew up the global economy. President Obama satisfied some of this blood lust by defenestrating Rick Wagoner, G.M.’s chief executive. But even if the White House could figure out a way to better align pay with performance on Wall Street and elsewhere, would you really want to see officials take time out from what should be Job One: stabilizing financial markets? It’s a little like asking a firefighter to stop and inspect a safety code violation on his way to a four-alarm blaze.In reality, the financial press has been screaming about executive pay for decades, though hardly anyone else seemed to care. In 1980, the year the Carter administration bailed out Chrysler, Lee Iacocca earned what for that time was a princely salary of $868,000 (or $2 million in today’s dollars), according to Forbes, enough to put him in the top 100 on the magazine’s best-paid C.E.O list — and no one was talking about putting his head on a pike. (Six years later, as his popularity soared, Mr. Iacocca would top the same Forbes list.)In June 2001, Geoffrey Colvin wrote a cover article for Fortune called “The Great C.E.O. Pay Heist” that was shocking and prescriptive — and completely ignored by the nonfinancial punditry. The article also noted a few unintended consequences in the government’s earlier attempts to rein in runaway C.E.O. pay: In 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission demanded that companies provide far greater detail about what they pay their leaders — but once every corner-office mandarin knew how much his peers made, compensation consultants were armed with everything they needed to get even more from corporate boards.Sure, you could point to countless other articles in Fortune, and other magazines and newspapers, that read like love sonnets to A.I.G. and other companies that would later be vilified. But if you were paying attention, there were also plenty of warnings about equity and real estate manias, not to mention the ever-riskier bets on Wall Street that seemed destined to go terribly awry sooner or later.So far during this financial crisis, the cathartic moment has been Jon Stewart’s deft evisceration of Jim Cramer, on “The Daily Show” last month. But again, followers of the financial press could only roll their eyes. Critics have been hammering Mr. Cramer ever since he unveiled his Ozzy Osbourne routine on “Mad Money” a little over four years ago.In January 2006, the New York Times columnist Joe Nocera put it bluntly in an interview with NPR: “The people who are watching this and following the advice are fools.”A year or so later, Henry Blodget, the former analyst who was banned from the securities industry after privately criticizing stocks he extolled in public — but has reinvented himself as a financial journalist — pointed out that Mr. Cramer’s portfolio was losing money even in a fabulous bull market. That’s what made smart financial folks snigger when Mr. Stewart stared at Mr. Cramer from across his desk and shouted, “You knew!”The sad and maddening irony, as Mr. Nocera, Mr. Blodget and others have pointed out in article after article, is that when it comes to predicting what stock is going to do what or where the economy is headed, he didn’t know, doesn’t know and will never know.No one does, really.With a little luck and a lot of taxpayer money, the economy will one day be removed from the intensive care unit and the news media will likely retreat from the business story again. But why wait for another financial crisis to start making sure that economic news has its rightful place alongside politics, sports and entertainment?Otherwise, we run the risk looking as silly as the TV viewers who bet real money whenever Jim Cramer shouts into his microphone if we keep expecting “The Daily Show” to take down the next Enron or smoke out the next Bernie Madoff.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Still, the industry whose troubles are having the greatest impact on the rethinking of careers, especially at the nation’s elite universities, is the one at the center of the country’s economic downturn — finance. For years, the hefty paychecks and social status on Wall Street proved irresistible to many of America’s brightest young people, but the jobs, money and social respect there are much diminished today.“In choosing careers, young people look for signals from society, and Wall Street will no longer pull the talent that it did for so many years,” said Richard Freeman, director of the labor studies program at the National Bureau of Economic Research. “We have a great experiment before us.”What will the new map of talent flow look like? It’s early, but based on graduate school applications this spring, enrollment in undergraduate courses, preliminary job-placement results at schools, and the anecdotal accounts of students and professors, a new pattern of occupational choice seems to be emerging. Public service, government, the sciences and even teaching look to be winners, while fewer shiny, young minds are embarking on careers in finance and business consulting.For the highest-paid business fields, the outlook is for a tempering correction instead of an all-out exodus. At Harvard, for example, about 40 percent of undergraduates in recent years went into the most lucrative corporate arenas like finance and consulting, based on surveys at the school year’s end. “That certainly won’t be the case this year,” observed Lawrence Katz, a professor and labor economist who has studied undergraduate career choices at Harvard going back to the 1960s. “We’re seeing students who would have been part of the Ivy League pipeline to Wall Street in the past considering very different career paths.”Kedamai Fisseha, a 21-year-old senior, is one of them. An economics major, Mr. Fisseha says he always assumed he would go into finance, and his summer internship last year was at the investment bank Morgan Stanley. Yet after Wall Street’s meltdown, job prospects there have withered. Instead, he is interviewing with Teach for America, a nonprofit group that recruits college graduates to teach in hard-to-staff schools for two-year stints. (After that, only one-third stay in the classrooms, though two-thirds remain in education.)Mr. Fisseha regards the turn of events as an opportunity to broaden his horizons. “It’s been liberating, and lucky for me,” he said. “But your situation does dictate your preferences.”Graduate schools of government and public policy are seeing a surge of applications. In a survey of its members released last week, the National Association of Schools of Public Affairs and Administration found that 82 percent reported an increase in applications this year, and many saw the largest percentage jumps in several years, or ever. The most-cited reason was the expectation by students that government will be hiring.Still, the appeal of public sector careers extends beyond job openings, say school officials. The laissez-faire presumption that government is not the solution but the problem, dating back to the Reagan era, has been cast aside, they say.The government’s need to step in with financial bailouts and recovery programs to steady the economy is seen as the immediate proof, they say, but not the only one. The environment, energy and health care also pose huge, complex challenges. “Young people today understand that government has a powerful role to play in solving these problems,” said Sandra Archibald, dean of the Evans School of Public Affairs at the University of Washington, where applications this year are up 26 percent.Government school officials also point to an Obama effect: his election as an endorsement of government activism.The economy, other long-range policy issues and the new administration, according to David Ellwood, dean of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, add up to a “benevolent perfect storm,” which could lure talented people to public service in a way not seen in decades.Yet even before the economic crisis, Mr. Ellwood said, there were signs of a drift among young people toward trying to work on public problems, influenced by everything from the 9/11 attacks to climate change.Matthew McKnight attended Phillips Exeter Academy and was a freshman at Dartmouth College during the 9/11 attacks. The event and its aftermath, he recalled, left him with a conviction that he should serve his country “because of the opportunities I’d been given.” After graduating from college, Mr. McKnight joined the Marines. His four years in the military included a stint at the State Department in a counterterrorism unit, and he recently returned from 13 months in the field in Iraq.This fall, Mr. McKnight, 25, is headed to the Kennedy School for a joint-degree program with the Harvard Business School. He may work in the private sector for a couple of years at some point, he said, but he plans to make his career in government service. Mr. McKnight’s particular experience, to be sure, is unusual. But, he said, “There is a big crop of people, like me, who grew up in a different time when public policy and public issues have been at the center of things.”At leading business schools, too, a shift in career patterns is evident. Last year, 64 percent of the graduating class from the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia went into finance or consulting. Graduation is still a couple of months away, but that percentage will be well down this year, especially in finance, said Jack Oakes, director of the career development center. Jobs in investment banking, for example, are running at less than half the level of last year, while more students are showing an interest in government jobs.Patricia Foglesong, a second-year student at Darden, turned down a job offer from a major consulting firm. Instead, she is considering two government jobs, one with the Secret Service and another with the Park Service.“Am I going to be a federal employee for the next 30 years? Probably not,” Ms. Foglesong said. “But public-private partnerships are going to be increasingly important in almost any field. And the timing is right to do this.”The sciences could well rise in the new pecking order of career status. The Obama administration wants to double federal spending in basic research over 10 years and triple the number of graduate fellowships in science.There are already signs of a renewed interest among students in science and technology. For the first time in six years, enrollment in computer science programs in the United States increased last year, according to a university survey last month. At Stanford University, the number of students taking the introductory computer science course increased 20 percent this year, said Eric Roberts, a professor of computer science.“What we need to do is to broadly educate as many people as possible in science, so the most talented people find their way into the field,” Mr. Roberts said. “That’s what happened in the Sputnik era.”Don Chamberlin, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Santa Cruz, was a member of the “Sputnik generation,” when American schoolchildren were encouraged to pursue careers in science, after the launch of a tiny satellite in 1957 appeared to give the Soviets a lead in missile technology used in nuclear strikes. As a teenager, he endangered his family garage in California with his rocket kits and later went into the fledgling field of computer science. He was a leading scientist in a team of IBM researchers that created the SQL database, an unseen technology that nonetheless animates every credit card purchase and A.T.M. banking transaction.In the early 1960s when he was choosing a career, Professor Chamberlin recalled, technical people were respected and well paid. Money, he said, was part of the equation. “But the bigger part of the motivation for me,” he said, “was that I would be doing exciting and important work and that my contributions would be appreciated.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','“A guy stood right there and cried,” says Mr. Neff, pointing at a table covered with $800 cashmere cable knit sweaters. “And he told me he’d lost it all, his wife lost it all, his daughter lost it all. He said to me, ‘I had everything with Bernie.’ ”A lot of regular customers haven’t been seen in Trillion since Hurricane Madoff struck in December — including, of course, the hurricane himself.The last time he was here, he fell for a $2,000 pair of worsted spun cashmere pants, which Trillion didn’t have in his size, and had to be ordered from Italy.After the slacks arrived, but before Mr. Madoff could come by for a fitting, he was arrested.“I remember I heard about the arrest and I went directly to the store to charge those pants on his credit card,” recalls Mr. Neff, a fit, gray-haired man in perpetual motion. “But the card had already been canceled.”So, what happened to the pants?“They’re in the racks, over there,” Mr. Neff says, nodding toward the trouser section.You have Bernie Madoff’s unclaimed $2,000 pants, on a rack, in this store?“Uh-hmm,” he says, with a slightly abashed grin. “Would you like to see them?”NOBODY keeps a statistic called “fortunes lost per square mile,” but let’s crunch some numbers.Palm Beach has just 10,200 residents on a land mass that is not quite three times the size of Central Park. It’s so packed with wealth that the joke here is that calling someone a “millionaire” is an insult.Given the density of the superrich, given the roughly 20 percent decline in the value of real estate since the housing bust, and given the concussive impact of Mr. Madoff, Palm Beach might well have this dubious distinction: the net worth of the average resident here has recently plunged, in absolute terms, by more than the average net worth of residents in any other town or city in the country.Of course, when your $50 million is cut to a third, you’ve lost a lot of money but you’re still rich by any sane standard. And real estate agents say they don’t know of any foreclosures here, which means the place is relatively unscathed, compared with Florida’s new tumbleweed suburbs.But you don’t often find catastrophic loss in the midst of spectacular plenty. It’s a bizarre combination, and we’ve come to see how Palm Beach is handling it. The answer is not very well, though the trauma here is, for the most part, invisible to the naked eye. Public displays of affliction are not Palm Beach’s style.To learn what ails the place, you need to talk to retailers and the rare chatty local. Palm Beach, they will tell you, is reeling and much of it is seething, too. Jews and gentiles here have long lived and socialized in different spheres, with some of the latter quietly irked to find more of the former moving in every year. The Madoff scheme targeted the Jewish populace, as everyone knows, and among Jews there is a galling sense that the gentiles are privately thrilled by the fiasco.As paranoid as this might sound, it has a ring of truth to Laurence Leamer, a Palm Beach resident and author of “Madness Under the Royal Palms,” a history of the island.“In fact, there are a lot of gentiles here who thought the Jews got what was coming to them,” he says. “The gentiles think this is their place. As far as they’re concerned, the Jews have Boca Raton and Miami. What are they doing in Palm Beach?”LINKED to the world by three bridges, Palm Beach is an island that feels like one large gated community. It’s shaped like a toothpick, roughly 13 miles long and about four blocks wide. Do not confuse it, thank you, with nearby places with similar names.“I get kind of irritated when I’m in La Guardia and I hear people say they’re heading to Palm Beach when they’re really headed to West Palm Beach or some part of Palm Beach County,” says Jeff Cloninger, a real estate agent who has offered a tour in his Mercedes S-class sedan. “Well, no, that’s not Palm Beach.”Mr. Cloninger, 49, has the velvety, sonorous voice of a disc jockey, and his face is a shade of medium rare that you typically don’t find outside of steakhouses. He’s wearing khakis, a striped Brooks Brothers shirt and Gucci loafers without socks.“That’s Rush Limbaugh’s house,” he says, pointing to a gate with an intercom and enough shrubbery, flowers and trees to completely obscure whatever is behind them.Mr. Cloninger knows the provenance of nearly every house on the island, and during this two-hour drive he points out the homes of Rod Stewart, Jimmy Buffett and Ivana Trump; the estate of Estée Lauder; the former home of the secretary of the McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc (“I think he paid her in stock”); the hotel favored by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; the Kennedy compound; as well as all of the country clubs, including the Palm Beach Country Club, epicenter of the Madoff scam, and such Protestant redoubts as the Everglades Club and the Bath & Tennis Club.Between sites, Mr. Cloninger emphasizes one point over and over: Palm Beach real estate is holding up remarkably well, under the circumstances.“Are there extremely good buys in Palm Beach right now? You better believe it,” he says. “Are there steals? No. If you want to buy something at 50 cents on the dollar, there are probably any number of American cities where you can do that. Palm Beach isn’t one of them.”In fact, the ravages of the last year aren’t immediately obvious when driving around the perfectly kept residential streets here, maintained with Swiss efficiency. But that’s in part because Palm Beach regulates the size of for-sale signs, which can’t be larger than 24 square inches, smaller than a CD case, and must be in black and white. And once you’ve learned to spot these mini-placards, you see them all over. More than 260 single-family homes are on the market — starting at $700,000, and on up to $72.5 million — which is more inventory than anyone in the business can remember.More noticeable are the empty storefronts, which have started popping up even on Worth Avenue, the home of a Saks Fifth Avenue, a Chanel and an Hermès, to name just a few. Shop owners in the nearby Royal Poinciana Way business district are aghast, not just by the tenants who’ve left but the new tenants moving in.“There’s now a psychic getting ready to open up,” groaned Les Evans, a property owner, when he spoke at a public workshop on the area’s troubles in March, as reported in The Palm Beach Daily News. “What are we going to get next? A tattoo parlor?”Restaurants that were always fully booked are running specials, like a $25 three-course lunch at Cafe L’Europe. Others are just printing new menus with lower prices, as at Amici Ristorante. Caterers are finding that charity galas, long the core of the Palm Beach social scene, are either canceled or sparsely attended.“We’re getting fewer requests for lobster and caviar,” says Charlie Crawford of the White Apron Catering Company, “and a lot more for mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese.”Every other person here seems to know someone who once had millions and, because of Mr. Madoff, is now bagging groceries at Publix or working as a maid. But a vast majority of people are still multimillionaires. So why aren’t they spending? Stuart Doppelt, a jewelry store owner, says you’d need a shrink to get to the bottom of it.He has encountered a few vulture buyers demanding deep discounts on the assumption that he has acquired fire-sale diamonds from Madoff victims trying to raise quick cash. (He hasn’t.) But everyone else is so reluctant to break out the AmEx that on some days, Mr. Doppelt has found himself on the sidewalk, wooing shoppers, Atlantic City-style, into the store.“Customers that can still come in and afford to buy fine pieces of jewelry have this feeling of guilt,” he says, sitting next to a couple of vaults at the rear of his store, H. T. Stuart & Company. “They say, ‘I still want to buy jewelry, but I feel funny, and I have friends and these people know others who got hurt, pretty badly, and they don’t want to flaunt it.’ I have to try to convince them to go on living.”Down the street, at Trillion, Mr. Neff says his customers will go for rarities, like a $1,200, super 180 wool sweater knitted on something called a 39-gauge machine. Everything else is a tough sell.“They won’t deny themselves the top top,” Mr. Neff says. “I used to say, ‘I know you have eight blue blazers but look at this blue blazer. It’s an upgrade.’ And any upgrade, they’d buy. This year, they don’t want to seem foolish. Eight blue blazers is enough.”At a men’s store called Crease Liberty, a longtime customer recently told Jennifer Inga, a saleswoman, that he wouldn’t be buying anything for a while, because his net worth had dropped to $12 million from $30 million.“He said, ‘Now is not the time.’ It’s mind-boggling to me,” Ms. Inga said. “How can someone with $12 million feel like they can’t afford a new pair of pants?”As she was talking, another businessman, Bruce Beal of Boston, came out of a dressing room, barefoot, in a pair of trousers he was trying on. He’d overheard the question and he had a very detailed answer.He imagined a hypothetical couple, in their 60s, who started last year with $15 million — one-third with Madoff, one-third in the stock market and one-third in bonds. The Madoff millions are gone; the stock market money is down 40 percent. Maybe they’ve got $350,000 a year in income from bonds and dividends.They’ve also got expenses. “Taxes and maintenance on their New York co-op and their Palm Beach house are $150,000 a year. They belong to two country clubs, at $50,000.” Plus taxes, living expenses, medical, cars, charitable commitments. And perhaps they have children and grandchildren who depend on them.“It doesn’t take a huge stretch of the imagination to see how these people feel poor,” Mr. Beal says. “One feels poor the day you spend a dollar more than your income.”Soon after, a man who Ms. Inga says is a member of the Palm Beach Country Club — where the initiation fee is reportedly $300,000 — entered the store. He looked over the merchandise on sale, then turned to the full-price stuff and asked for a 50 percent discount.WHEN you try to take the temperature of Palm Beach, you quickly learn that it won’t so much as look at the thermometer, let alone open up and say “ah.” Even servants sign confidentiality agreements. Request an interview with the mayor, Jack McDonald, and you get a call from his assistant saying, “The mayor doesn’t do interviews with reporters from out of town.”The cold shoulder seems part of the local DNA. There aren’t any hospitals, cemeteries or funeral homes here, as though illness and death could be willed out of mind, no mean feat for a place filled with 80-year-olds.Aside from death and money, the topic that preoccupies everyone here the most, and is spoken of the least, is the gentile-Jewish divide. As recounted in “Madness Under the Royal Palms,” Palm Beach was founded in the late 19th century by Henry Flagler, a Standard Oil executive, and for years it was dominated by white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.In the middle of the last century, A. M. Sonnabend, a Jewish entrepreneur, started buying commercial property, including what became the Palm Beach Country Club, and nouveau-riche Jews suddenly had a hotel, beach club and a golf course of their own. Gradually, enough moved here to be described by the Christian elites as “the other half,” many of them clustered in large condominium buildings south of a place called Sloans Curve, known informally by just about everyone as the Gaza Strip. (That the real Gaza Strip is inhabited by Palestinians is apparently beside the point.)The score between these two tribes has traditionally been kept on the society pages of The Palm Beach Daily News, known as the Shiny Sheet for its smudge-free paper, which covers parties and galas. The more you’re covered, the better your tribe is doing.So that article about the Duchess of Marlborough’s 50th birthday party at the Everglades, for which the ladies reached “into the vault,” as The News put it, for their finest jewelry — that goes in the win column for the gentiles. An article about the three-day, Brooklyn-themed 80th birthday party for Larry Herbert, the father of the Pantone color system, with a quotation from his wife, “The president said to go out and spend money, so I did” — chalk one up for the Jews.But the Madoff fiasco has changed the game here. It’s hard to find local victims of his fraud to talk on the record, but one retiree agreed to speak on the condition that he not be named. He says he and his wife lost a modest sum, compared with others.“When this whole thing broke it was like they dropped a veil over this town,” he said. “Now, Madoff is all we talk about. Today, I was hitting golf balls with a friend of mine. He turns around, out of nowhere, he says, ‘My accountant told me the I.R.S. said you can take a 95 percent loss against ordinary income going back five years.’ I says: ‘Where the hell did that come from? I’m in the middle of hitting 9-irons!’ ”He estimates that 80 percent of the Jewish community here was affected in one way or another, either directly or through charitable endeavors that are now struggling. Hit worst were the people who took out a second mortgage on their home to give Mr. Madoff additional funds. If the guy delivered a steady 10 percent or 12 percent, why not?“We’re going to dinner tonight with a few couples,” this man continues, slightly amused by how obsessed everyone has become by this topic. “We’ll raise a glass and make a vow — no Madoff talk. It’ll last five minutes.”IT’S not just the scale of damage caused by Mr. Madoff that inspires endless conversation. It’s the sense of being snookered by a man who embodied what so many here aspire to be: rich and revered as the savviest of the savvy. At Trillion, whenever Mr. Neff read in the newspaper about some Wall Street scam, he’d tear out the story and wait for Mr. Madoff, the financial whiz with the outer-borough accent, to turn up and explain what had happened.“He was my go-to guy,” Mr. Neff says. “There was some fellow a couple years ago, I can’t remember his name, but I saved the story and I asked Bernie about it. ‘Where did this guy think he was going to go?’ He said, ‘Some people.’ He always claimed nobody would get away with anything these days because the S.E.C. would catch them.”As it happens, Mr. Madoff seemed to know a lot about clothing, too. As evidence of his good taste, Mr. Neff says, take a look at those worsted cashmere pants that would have been Mr. Madoff’s last clothing purchase, if his credit card had worked. After a bit of rummaging through the racks, Mr. Neff pulls them off a hanger and splays them on a table top.“Here they are,” he says.Before us sits a pair of plain-looking charcoal gray pants in a fabric that feels like the skin of an exotic pet.“It doesn’t pill; it doesn’t wrinkle,” Mr. Neff says, bunching a pant leg in his hand. “You might not get that razor-sharp crease that you’ll get on other wools, but it just doesn’t wrinkle.”We gape at Bernie Madoff’s unclaimed $2,000 trousers and we think: Could there be a better symbol of all that has gone wrong, so suddenly, in the last six months? One day the Money Men were brilliant; the next day, they were thieves. One day, cash flowed; the next day, credit vanished. One day, it seemed extravagant to buy a garment for the same price as a low-end used car; the next day, it seemed insane.The Era of Gorging and the Age of the Bust — they’re both in those pants, stranded in a store named for the kind of money we’ll need to clean up this mess.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','The government’s mistakes were serious and have alarmed lawyers who say it is fitting that several prosecutors are themselves now the subject of ethics investigations. The prosecutors failed to disclose information that defense lawyers could have used at the trial to bolster their case that Mr. Stevens did not intentionally conceal the receipt of gifts and services.Mr. Stevens, who became the longest-serving Republican in Senate history, was convicted in October of seven counts of willfully failing to list gifts and services on Senate disclosure forms.The dismissal of the charges, a victory for Mr. Stevens and his lawyers, raises the question of what it means to say that someone is innocent.Mr. Stevens is certainly innocent in the civics-book sense that everyone is innocent in the eyes of the law until and unless proved guilty.But lawyers point out that such a definition is part of the legal construct in which the burden of proving guilt falls on the government.Mr. Stevens’s chief lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, said of his client: “His name is cleared. He is innocent of the charges as if they had never been brought.”Prof. Joshua Dressler of the law school said, however, that the failure to be convicted in a criminal trial does not, by itself, confer innocence on someone.“The decision by the judge to dismiss the case is certainly not a statement that the defendant is innocent,” Professor Dressler said, “but that the prosecutors didn’t play by the rules, and for that reason alone we have to use this strong remedy” to deter other prosecutors from similar misbehavior.In fact, two jurors have said that the dismissal of the case because of the prosecutors’ actions did not make Mr. Stevens innocent in their view.Brian Kirst, an alternate juror in the trial, said the prosecutors’ problems had nothing to do with much of the testimony that mattered to him. “I mean he had the chair,” said Mr. Kirst, a professional photographer.He said he was strongly leaning toward conviction — though he did not participate in the verdict because he was randomly deemed an alternate — because he believed that the defense had done little to rebut the basic accusations that Mr. Stevens had been given lots of gifts and never reported them.Colleen Walsh, one of the jurors who convicted Mr. Stevens, said on her personal blog of the trial’s collapse, “The only thing this proves is that the prosecution messed everything up.”Ms. Walsh, a church secretary, wrote on the blog as if speaking to Mr. Stevens, saying: “You may be innocent on corruption charges which were never brought up. But you are still guilty of not disclosing some of your major gifts to the public.”Most of the prosecutors’ mistakes involved the handling of , a chief witness against Mr. Stevens who, the government said, provided some $250,000 worth of goods and services to upgrade the senator’s Alaska residence. Prosecutors failed to provide defense lawyers with interview notes in which Mr. Allen told them that he believed Mr. Stevens would have paid for things if he had been sent a bill and that the renovations were worth only about $80,000.More important, prosecutors did not disclose that Mr. Allen did not recall in early interviews something he later testified about at trial — that he had been told by a Stevens emissary that Mr. Stevens did not want a bill and only asked for one to cover himself.Mr. Sullivan, the defense lawyer, said he would have used that fact to demonstrate that Mr. Allen had made up that story later to bolster his accusations.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Is it real? That sound of screeching tires and smell of burning rubber? Was that something pulling up in the driveway? Just wishful thinking; it won’t be here until the summer.What they said: “The 2010 MazdaSpeed3 is everything Mazda stands for, in one vehicle,” said Takashi Yamanouchi, Mazda’s chief executive. “It is stylish, with bold ‘Nagare-inspired’ front details, an air-intake scoop that shows its performance intent and powerful detailing in the body. And while it is a practical five-seat, four-door, its turbocharged engine makes it one of the fastest front-wheel-drive cars in the world.”What they didn’t say: When the former Mazda designer Franz von Holzhausen left the company last year, he apparently took with him the secret to applying the flowing “nagare-inspired” lines of his acclaimed concept cars like the Furai, Kabura and Nagare.What makes it tick? A carry-over direct-injected, turbocharged 2.3-liter 4-cylinder with 263 horsepower and 280 foot-pounds of torque. But power is now delivered more smoothly because of taller gearing in the 6-speed manual transmission. An “advanced torque management system” has been recalibrated to help reduce torque-steer by adjusting engine output based on steering position and gear.How much, how soon? The outgoing 2009 model starts at around $23,000, and some are still available. That fact should keep 2010 model prices, which have not yet been confirmed, somewhat close to the previous model.How’s it look? The lines are supposed to flow, like wind-blown liquid. Instead, the MazdaSpeed3 just gets a tacky smiley-face chunk of plastic slapped on its kisser. Ignore the grille, remove it or wait for the inevitable aftermarket replacement. The rest of this little pocket rocket fairly screams “ticket me.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Both Mr. McDaniels, who lives in Wayne, and Ms. Phillips, an English singer-songwriter who lives in Montclair, were adopted as infants.“People who aren’t part of the adoption community don’t know about the issues, the pain, the emotions that can come from not knowing where you come from,” said Mr. McDaniels, 44, who in 2007 won an Emmy Award for the documentary “DMC: My Adoption Journey.”“Knowing who you are is about health, happiness — a human right,” he said.State Senator Diane B. Allen, a Republican from Burlington County, said New Jersey’s existing law is a “discrimination against civil rights.” She blames pressure from organizations like the New Jersey Catholic Conference for the delay in the bill moving forward.Critics of the bill said a change in the law would essentially break a contract with women who believed their privacy would be protected.“It’s as simple as this: Women who gave up their babies 20, 30 years ago were told that their information would be kept private,” said State Senator Anthony R. Bucco, a Morris County Republican. “If we changed the law now, we would be going back on our word. That’s not right.”Mr. Bucco and the New Jersey Catholic Conference have proposed establishing a state registry that — similar to services private agencies already provide — would allow adoptees and birth parents to exchange medical, contact or other information via an intermediary.“We firmly support medical records being made available to adoptees, but the confidentiality that was assured birth mothers in closed adoptions has to trump adoptees’ desire for information, even though we understand that desire,” said Patrick R. Brannigan, executive director of the Catholic Conference. “We’re not uncompassionate.”But Ms. Phillips, 44, and others who support the bill say the compromise does not provide all they want.“Growing up in England, I always saw the United States as being so far ahead,” Ms. Phillips said, adding that British law has long allowed unlimited access to birth records in adoptions. “But with this, America is really behind. When I heard how backward things are here, all I could think was, ‘Are you kidding?’ ”Along with the release of the “I’m Legit” single this month will be a music video that includes footage from 2008 adoption rallies in Trenton and Montclair, which both Ms. Phillips and Mr. McDaniels attended.Their hope is that others who support the New Jersey bill will use the song and video to help advocate for open birth records nationwide.The two also plan to perform the song in Cleveland this month at the nonprofit American Adoption Congress’s annual conference. There, Ms. Phillips will also screen “Roots: Unknown,” a documentary about adoption she made with the help of her husband, Jonathan Phillips, a filmmaker.The film won an award as best Home Grown Documentary at the 2008 Garden State Film Festival.Ms. Phillips also wrote an adoption memoir, “Mother Me,” which was published last year by the British Association for Adoption & Fostering.“I never set out to be an adoption activist, but the more I get letters and feedback from people, the more I realize that I need to keep at it, though it can be really hard,” Ms. Phillips said. “I grew up as a pretty messed-up teen, using drugs and alcohol and making a lot of bad choices because of the deep sadness I felt about not knowing where I came from.“But I feel that if I share my story, I can help other adoptees and adoptive parents dealing with kids who are acting out. I think every adult adoptee owes it to today’s kids to share their stories.”'"
"'09-04-12,'0','SHIFTING into reverse may be more dangerous than previously thought. According to the first study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on the issue, 221 people — more than four each week — were killed by vehicles backing up in 2007. In the same period, about 14,000 people were injured in backup accidents, the safety agency said.“I’d say it was dramatically higher than what we typically estimated,” said Janette Fennell, president of Kids and Cars, a nonprofit safety advocacy group from Kansas. “We used to say about 100 per year.”However, Ms. Fennell’s organization focuses on incidents involving children, who are at greater risk because they are more likely to be unseen by drivers backing up. The group said that 44 percent of all nontraffic fatalities of children aged 15 or younger are from backup accidents. Nontraffic accidents are those that occur in vehicles not on a public road, such as in driveways, parking lots and private roads.Often a relative or caregiver of the child is behind the wheel when such an accident occurs. Indeed, federal legislation passed last year to attempt to address the issue, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act, is named in remembrance of a 2-year-old boy who was accidentally backed over and killed by his father on Long Island. It was this legislation that prompted the new study.In the past, Kids and Cars generated its statistics by compiling newspaper and other media reports of backover accidents. To get a more detailed accounting of just how deadly the problem is, the government study based its estimates on police reports, death certificates and records from emergency responders.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','OPEN since last November, Route 100 Wine Bar & Grill is one of a number of dining spots where the difficult economy has forged a new and welcome restaurant reality. Dishes are creative, food is carefully presented, portions are generous, the welcome is warm and appreciative and the service accommodating. Yet prices are moderate and, for what Route 100 has to offer, even a bargain. Diners will hardly feel recessive here.The chef, Jose Lopez, and the owner, Norberto Avila, whose brother Hector owns Tango Grill in White Plains, have put together a nifty package. And both the wine bar and the restaurant seem to draw a steady clientele.Bins of wines line the walls and are functional as well as decorative. The casual diner and the frugal connoisseur will appreciate the user-friendly list of almost 200 ready-to-drink brands, all at fair mark-ups. A few dozen bottles stop at $30 and most others peak at $55. Some favorites include a robust 2006 Chianti Classico ($30); an intense berry-scented 2007 Cline Cellars Zinfandel ($28); and a smooth, fruity 2007 Planeta La Segreta Rosso ($30) from Sicily.The restaurant is as successful as the wine bar. Mr. Avila takes great pride in his establishment and is delighted when customers show interest in his offerings. Making the rounds of the dining room, he informs us that “everything except the ice cream is homemade.”Delicious evidence of that statement was brought with the bread. Served upright in a paper cone, warm, fresh-baked batons of rosemary bread defied resistance; our table surrendered at once, happily accepting another cone-full.As mouth-filling as the mushroom soup-of-the-evening was, had we only one starter to choose, pokie, a fish salad, would be our pick. This kitchen used only high-quality tuna, diced and dunked in a marinade fragrant with sesame oil, light soy sauce and citrus. Dark seaweed salad and a splay of avocado slices made perfect plate mates in flavor and presentation.'"
"'09-04-12,'0','Christianity is practiced differently in the global south, and especially in Africa, where it has been invested with cultural values that long predate the first missionary efforts. During the 20th century, the population of Christians in Africa grew from 10 million to around 360 million, and that could double by 2025, by which time demographers project the continent will be home to a quarter of all believers. These Africans are making Christianity their own, in ways both subtle and profound. This is evidenced in political debates over subjects like homosexuality, which is scorned throughout the continent, or condom distribution, which — despite the current pope’s opposition — some local Catholic bishops have countenanced as a practical response to AIDS. But it can also be seen in a style of worship: colorful, musical and suffused with a belief in the presence of the supernatural in everyday life.This Africanization is obvious in Pentecostal sects like the Redeemed Christian Church of God. Here again is a story of revival. The Pentecostal movement is said to have begun in 1906, in a rundown church in a Los Angeles ghetto, where a black preacher gathered a multiracial congregation to pray in a fashion that contemporary critics saw as radical and strange, maybe even possessed. Today there are around 600 million Pentecostals worldwide, the vast majority of them in developing nations, and Africa is a hotbed. Pentecostalism is not so much an organized religion — it has no central authority — as a set of beliefs and practices that can be adapted by local entrepreneurs. It is perfectly suited to harness the modern forces of global crosspollination.American televangelists like T. D. Jakes and Benny Hinn are received like rock stars when they fly into African capitals, where they preach to crowds estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands. Their African counterparts, meanwhile, are moving in the opposite direction, winning converts in Europe especially. In Kiev, a Nigerian minister leads a predominantly white Pentecostal church that claims a membership of 30,000, including the city’s mayor. Four of the 10 largest megachurches in London are run by Africans. Of all the many new sects, however, none are as organized as the Redeemed Christian Church of God. “I always cite the R.C.C.G. as the best example of a rising church that, probably by the time I die, is going to be a global denomination,” Philip Jenkins said. “It really is pushing so hard in all possible directions.”The Redeemed Church offers a case study of the crosscurrents that are drawing Christianity southward. Its leader and guiding force, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, sums up the church’s history this way: “Made in heaven, assembled in Nigeria, exported to the world.” He preaches that his followers — known as the Redeemed — are a chosen people and have a special covenant with God, one that promises that the church will one day claim an adherent in every family on earth.The Redeemed mission to the United States represents perhaps the greatest test to date of these immense ambitions. The church is still in its infancy here, with only around 15,000 active members, most of them Nigerians, but its goal is to make gradual inroads into the wider culture, at first aiming at members of immigrant groups — other Africans, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Asians — and then moving on to African-Americans and whites. They are filled with the confidence of miraculous faith, though they realize they are contending with cultural impediments. “Initially, it may be rough,” says Pastor James Fadele, head of the church’s operations in North America. “But some of our children grew up in America, and they are affiliated with the church, and they have white friends, they have African-American friends, they have Asian friends. They will come to the church. It’s a matter of time.”Fadele has entrusted the task of increasing the number of Redeemed churches to Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran. Reed-thin at 44, the minister carries himself with the earnest conviction of someone who has already surmounted many obstacles. He came to this country in 1995, without a job or a place to live. At first he slept in homeless shelters and subways until he landed a job at a Brooklyn car wash, where the owner let him bed down in a hallway. He now presides over a parish with around 400 members and branches in other cities. “I believe that when there is raw power, when the lame come to church and can walk, when the blind can come and see . . . when things begin to happen like that, people will come,” the pastor told me. “It’s going to be very, very explosive.”THE BEST EVIDENCE OF THE REDEEMED CHURCH’S outsize aspirations, at least in this country, lies in the prairie lands of Hunt County, Tex., about an hour northeast of Dallas. Down a gravel road, past barns, a white clapboard Methodist church and flat fields of dark, freshly turned soil, a large brick-and-glass auditorium appears from behind grain silos. A sign points the way to Redemption Camp, the church’s North American headquarters. From this unlikely base, in the course of less than a decade, the Redeemed have spawned nearly four hundred parishes. Over the long term, church officials plan to develop the site as a mixed-use community, with homes, stores, a university, a commercial fish farm and perhaps even a water park.In January, Ajayi-Adeniran traveled to Redemption Camp with other church leaders to celebrate the end of a month of fasting. Several hundred people, most of them Nigerian, gathered in the auditorium for a service that began in the morning and went well past midnight. It was televised live on the Internet for a global audience. A succession of evangelists asked God to heal sickness, to keep the faithful from harm, to cancel debts “supernaturally” and, most of all, to multiply the ranks of the Redeemed. Wearing a white linen jacket and clutching a crinkled Bible, Ajayi-Adeniran stood in the front row, hands raised and eyes closed, his head bobbing, his face fixed in an ecstatic grimace.Even by the passionate standards of Africa, the Redeemed are renowned for the intensity of their prayer. In Nigeria, it has been called “the weeping church.” During services, members of the congregation will clap, whoop and break into glossolalia — speaking in tongues — which Pentecostals believe to be the verbal expression of the Holy Spirit. They will collapse to the floor, burying their faces in the carpet, and writhe in the throes of divine communion. “I don’t know how to explain it,” Ajayi-Adeniran once told me when I asked him what he felt when he prayed. “There’s a kind of aura that comes from above that envelops you.”It is this spiritual zeal that the Redeemed Church hopes to bring to Americans. Though its successes so far are tentative and anecdotal, they appear to be real. In my visits to many Redeemed churches in different parts of the country, I encountered non-Nigerians at every turn. That night in January at Redemption Camp, I met an African-American woman named Della Faye Sowunmi. A native of Indiana, Sowunmi is married to a Nigerian and was first exposed to the Redeemed by her sister-in-law. “I just wasn’t getting what I was after spiritually in the Baptist Church,” she said, explaining her conversion. “To watch people praise and worship like that, it touched my heart.”Enoch Adeboye, the Redeemed Church’s leader, calculates that there are countless Americans who feel such spiritual longing. “There is an emptiness in man that can only be filled by God,” Adeboye told me in October. Adeboye was visiting Baltimore to preside over a conference of the church’s ministers and activists. We met in a high-ceilinged Marriott hotel suite, which was guarded by two mountainous security men. Adeboye sat in a wingback chair, next to a gilt fireplace, dressed casually in black slacks, a collarless African patterned shirt and white sneakers.To understand what the church plans for America, it is crucial to appreciate what it has become in Nigeria, largely because of Adeboye’s personal charisma and sophisticated appeals. Born into a family of poor cocoa farmers, Adeboye taught mathematics at the University of Lagos before he became a full-time minister. His followers, who revere him as a patriarch, call him the General Overseer, or Daddy G.O. The church he has built echoes his personality: it is disciplined, nurturing, systematic. Back in Nigeria, Adeboye claims to have at least five million followers, including some of the country’s most influential figures. As general overseer, he presides over financial ventures, including private schools, a bank and a media business. He’s innovative at developing methods to spread the word, as well as coming up with fresh revenue streams. The church produces inspirational movies on DVD, which are big sellers, and offers a service that sends daily text messages, believed to offer divine protection, to subscribers’ cellphones.In our interview, Adeboye began to talk, as he often does, about his own personal journey to salvation. It is a story with the usual Augustinian elements: prestige, women, booze. But Adeboye’s distinctive weakness, one he also glimpses in this society, was what he describes as an idolatrous reliance on reason. “It begins to give man the impression that man is the almighty, that man can do anything,” the pastor said. “He can go to the moon, go to Mars, perform operations with a laser beam without spilling blood. The problem, the way I see it, is that because of the advance of technology, science and investing, the Western world began to feel that they didn’t need God as much as before. Whereas in Africa, we need him. We know we need him to survive.”Nigeria’s evangelical surge dates to the late 1960s, when university students formed campus prayer groups. Christian students, rejecting their parents’ less-vigorous beliefs, became born again and embraced Pentecostalism, which had long been present in Nigeria but previously was considered lower class. Political factors spurred the revival, too, particularly in later years, as Nigeria suffered through a series of military dictatorships dominated by Muslims from its northern region. Though Adeboye seldom mentions Islam, Nigeria’s other proselytizing faith, it is clear that religious tension fueled the awakening. Like everyone on campus, Adeboye was exposed to Pentecostalism, but he says he didn’t give himself over wholeheartedly to God until he was in his 30s. Seeking a cure for a daughter’s persistent illness, he wandered into a modest church overseen by an aging pastor who was reputed to be a miracle worker. According to Redeemed lore, the moment Adeboye appeared, a vision told the old man that he’d found his inheritor.The pastor, Josiah Akindayomi, founded the Redeemed Church in the 1950s, with God’s promise, according to doctrine, that it would eventually reach “the ends of the earth.” But the faith had not spread very far by the 1970s, in part because Akindayomi spoke only Yoruba, which limited his ability to evangelize beyond the bounds of his tribe. The next leader of the church, he knew through prior revelation, needed to be “a man of books,” capable of reaching the wider world. And so, in 1979, Akindayomi unveiled his succession plan.Adeboye recently celebrated his 67th birthday — with a huge revival held at Redemption City, the church’s worldwide headquarters, located 30 miles north of Lagos. The model for the Texas site, Redemption City is built on land that was formerly occupied by animist shrines. Since the 1980s, Adeboye’s followers have constructed homes all around the grounds, along with schools, supermarkets, banks and a water-treatment plant. Every December, inside a mammoth hall, Adeboye holds a six-day event called the Holy Ghost Congress. Crowd estimates — never an exact science, especially in Africa — are in the millions.“It is the largest prayer meeting in the world, and there is not another prayer meeting in the world that is a close second,” said Dr. James O. Davis, a Pentecostal minister based in Florida and the founder of the Billion Soul Network, an organization devoted to spreading Christianity around the world. “Everything that the Redeemed Church does is huge.”UNLIKE MANY PENTECOSTAL DENOMINATIONS, the Redeemed Church is a tightly regimented organization, with authority flowing down from the general overseer through geographic zones and into individual parishes. Adeboye, for all his talk of blind belief, is still a numbers man, and he has shown a strong preference for delegating authority for overseas missions to leaders who have training in business or science. Pastor James Fadele, the head of the church in North America, is a former automotive-design engineer as well as a close relative of Adeboye. Fadele left a job at the Ford Motor Company to run the church full time from Texas. He holds an M.B.A. and has some practical business experience — he used to own a Wendy’s franchise in Detroit — and he says he has to think like a marketer when it comes to his mission here. “Everything,” Fadele told me, “is Americanized.”That applies, in a narrow sense, to things like the books the Redeemed Church uses in its American Sunday schools, which have been purged of parables about market women and chickens, and more broadly, to the way the church positions itself in society. In Nigeria, church leaders speak out against corruption and make efforts to fight AIDS, while here they’ve assimilated the political rhetoric of the Christian Right, condemning abortion and pledging to take prayer back to public schools. The most Americanized aspect of the church, though, is its missionary strategy, which bears a striking resemblance to the business plan of a successful corporate chain — like Wendy’s, for instance. For now, in the United States, the emphasis is as much on erecting infrastructure as on making converts. Enoch Adeboye would prefer to have many small parishes rather than a few megachurches. So the Redeemed spread through a process similar to mitosis. When a parish reaches a certain size, it is encouraged to divide in two, with part of the congregation moving to a nearby location, usually with a newly ordained pastor, a process that the Redeemed, adopting a bit of American evangelical lingo, call “church planting.”Last fall, I saw James Fadele give a presentation on missionary strategy to a gathering of church leaders. A short man with big voice and an endearing sense of humor, he spoke over a series of PowerPoint slides, in which Venn diagrams and bullet points alternated with pictures of the targets: black, white, Hispanic and Asian faces. “How do we love people?” he asked rhetorically. “We love people by planting churches.”One slide, a bar graph, showed a set of ambitious growth objectives. Each of the church’s 22 zonal coordinators in North America, he said, had been charged with planting seven churches during the previous year. He announced an award for Pastor Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran, who, in addition to overseeing the overall effort, had also managed to consistently hit his numbers in the zone he administers, which encompasses New York and Vermont. Other coordinators reported less success, and Fadele cheerfully scolded them.“Last year in October, we had 297 parishes in North America,” he said. “As of September of this year, we have 374. Praise the Lord!”There was a round of applause, and Fadele’s voice turned stern.“To Daddy G.O., that’s a failure,” he snapped. The number of parishes had increased by 25 percent in just a year, but Adeboye had asked for twice that.One way that the church promotes growth in this country is by encouraging successful congregations to start satellites in other cities. Della Faye Sowunmi belongs to a church called the Holy Ghost Zone, in Irving, Tex., which grew out of a similarly named mother church in London. Both are led by female pastors. Victory Temple, based in Bowie, Md., has spun off outlets around the Southeast. Probably the most successful example is Jesus House, which was established by a large Redeemed church in Lagos. It now has branches all over the world. The Jesus House brand signature is “empowerment,” and the churches cater to the well-to-do, including businesspeople and others who have benefited from Nigeria’s recent oil boom. Jesus House’s Washington outlet is located in the Maryland suburbs, in a glass-fronted building that looks like a software company’s headquarters. “Our congregation is 90 percent professional,” said Ghandi Olaoye, the pastor. “We create avenues to give knowledge to people so that their lives can be better.” Olaoye’s church offers computer classes and hosts weekly business networking meetings. A recent celebration, “Empowerment Week,” featured American and African preachers and the motivational speaker Willie Jolley.Church leaders are quick to contest any suggestion that they preach the “prosperity gospel” extolled by American evangelists like Creflo Dollar, which teaches that God will grant material wealth to those he favors, but whatever distinction they’re making is small. (“I am not a prosperity preacher,” James Fadele said at one sermon I attended, “but I am rich!”) Redeemed pastors routinely petition God to transform their followers into millionaires, members are encouraged to tithe and the Sunday collection is accompanied by joyous fanfare. At various events I attended, I heard Fadele ask members to raise money to help Adeboye buy a private jet (which duly arrived in March) and to sign up to accompany the general overseer, at a cost of up to $8,500 a person, on a coming pilgrimage to Jerusalem, which is to feature luxury hotel accommodation and a re-enactment of the Last Supper.A sizable portion of the money collected in the United States is directed back into the North American organization’s centerpiece project, the expansion of the camp in Texas. Since 2000, Redeemed officials have been buying up large parcels of farmland around a rusty rail-stop town called Floyd (population: 220). They picked the spot, they say, in accordance with a vision Enoch Adeboye had many years ago, after a layover at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. Progress on the project has slowed, at least temporarily, since a $20 million loan was delayed. But in mid-January, when I visited, Fadele told me that construction would soon begin on a hall that seats 20,000.The larger quarters are necessary, Fadele said, to accommodate the many thousands that flock to Redemption Camp for an annual June revival ministered by Adeboye. The event, which goes all night, has caused some consternation among neighbors. Some cities in Texas, especially Houston, have large Nigerian communities, but the area around Floyd is pickup-truck country — very rural, with a long history of racial prejudice. Until the 1960s, a banner hanging over the main road in downtown Greenville, the county seat, read, “The blackest land, the whitest people.”Over time, however, the Redeemed have become accepted — if a bit warily — as a part of the community, says John Horn, the Hunt County judge, its highest elected official. “I came from the law-enforcement field prior to running for judge, and I had heard some of the issues regarding the Nigerian Internet scams,” he told me. “I think there were probably some preconceived notions about that.” But Horn said the church had made efforts to reach out, inviting him, for example, to attend Fadele’s 60th birthday party. Fadele explained that the Redeemed had tried to bring all their neighbors to the camp for such public occasions to show them “we are a Christian church,” he said, “not a cult.”The Redeemed Church has made a similar effort to quell any suspicions that American evangelical leaders might have, portraying itself as firmly within the Pentecostal fold. American evangelists are routinely invited to preach at the church’s revivals both here and in Nigeria. Those who have gone to Nigeria have come home with the impression that the Redeemed Church is a force to be respected — a potential partner, not a competitor, in a common struggle to revive Christian worship. “I often say,” says Bishop Bart Pierce, a white Pentecostal minister from Baltimore, “that the African is the midwife for next great move of God in America.”RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IN AFRICA is an omnipresent element of life: pastors are celebrities, waiters quote Scripture, gospel music plays in government offices and secular newspapers report miracles with the same credence they extend to soccer scores. Salvation is never too far away. When Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran woke up on Christmas morning in 1989, on the floor of his house in a town near Ibadan, hung over and convinced he had to make a change in his life, he knew where to find the Redeemed Church. There was one across the street, with a loudspeaker mounted on its roof, through which sermons bombarded the neighborhood every Sunday.As an educated man with a civil-service job, Ajayi-Adeniran was a prime recruit, and within five years he was ordained an assistant pastor. Committed as he was to the church, he couldn’t endure Nigeria, which was then under the rule of Gen. Sani Abacha, a particularly nasty dictator. He immigrated to the United States, part of a wave of African migration that has come to many American cities. At the time Ajayi-Adeniran arrived, the Redeemed Church was just getting started in the United States. He began attending its first parish in New York, on Roosevelt Island. When some Nigerians from the Bronx decided to start their own church, he became its pastor.The parish subdivided several times, according to the Redeemed model, before Ajayi-Adeniran settled at his current location, a yellow-painted, two-story brick building. When he first leased the property, it was derelict and gutted. Gradually, Ajayi-Adeniran renovated and built a substantial Sunday following, directing his proselytizing toward the souls available in the neighborhood. “My focus here is the black Americans, Caribbeans, Africans and Spanish,” he said. “For me to get whites in the church, it will take a miracle.”His parish’s population has fluctuated over time because new churches keep splitting off. There are 13 so far, in locales as distant as Syracuse, Buffalo and Burlington, Vt. Some require more nurturing than others. The parish in Burlington, for instance, has been a particular struggle. “Vermont is 96.2 percent white,” Ajayi-Adeniran points out. But the general overseer wants the Redeemed to have a presence in every state, so a few years ago Ajayi-Adeniran drove to Burlington, scoured phone books for African names and eventually located some Congolese and Sudanese refugees. “Now they have maybe two or three Nigerian families, and the rest are Congolese, Sudanese, then black Americans and whites,” he said. “They’re not too many, but they average 40, 45” attendees on Sunday. “It will definitely work,” he predicted. “But it will take time.”You might reasonably question why a church with limited resources would expend effort and capital in such an unpromising location, but that misses the point of Enoch Adeboye’s vision of ubiquity. He is preparing to meet a demand that so far exists only in prophecy. “If it appears as if initially our church is sent to target the immigrants from Africa and so on, it’s because you have to start somewhere,” Adeboye told me. “But then, later on, the people who are natives of this land will sooner or later come to the realization that they need God, and we will be on the ground when that time comes to present God to them.”The Redeemed Church believes that this country has fallen into the thrall of wickedness. With an adoptive boldness that seems quintessentially American, Redeemed preachers talk of restoring a bygone God-fearing era. In their sermons, they invoke the founding fathers — many of whom had no problem with buying and selling people from Nigeria. “Right now there is moral decadence,” Ajayi-Adeniran said. “Things are not the way they used to be. All kinds of things: pollution and watering down of the Gospel — the gospel of convenience, the gospel of tolerance. You want to please people rather than pleasing God. That is one of the purposes, why we are here, to bring sanity to the church.”Like many evangelists, Ajayi-Adeniran sees this as a particularly ripe moment: hard times are good times for belief. His flock in the Bronx, full of people at the margins of the work force, looks to him for spiritual guidance. On a snowy Sunday morning in January, two days before Barack Obama was to be inaugurated president, Ajayi-Adeniran strode to a clear glass lectern as his church band played an African-tinged rendition of an old American gospel hymn. In one hand, he clutched a white handkerchief; his sermons are full of sweaty exertion. “We’re going to pray for our nation, the United States of America,” he said, as he opened his Bible to the Book of Zechariah. He read a passage commanding God’s chosen people to rebuild Jerusalem’s razed temple.“This is our Jerusalem!” Ajayi-Adeniran shouted, as he began to jump and swing his arms in loose-limbed fervor. “You want to talk to God?” he asked. In response, his congregants dropped to their knees and began to speak in tongues, which to the uninitiated sounds like a babble of sharp syllables. Above the din, Ajayi-Adeniran voiced a series of petitions to God, seizing certain phrases and repeating them, almost as if he were chanting an incantation. “Father, restore the old glory back to our nation,” the pastor said. “The old glory. The old glory.” Ajayi-Adeniran jabbed a finger toward heaven, his sermon crescendoing in a high-pitched, swooping cry: “Churches are in pain. Children of God are in pain. People are losing their jobs. Many are losing their jobs. Marriages are breaking up. God — God almighty — come and heal our land. Come and heal our land! Come and intervene. Move! Move! Move!”IT IS A TENET OF PENTECOSTALISM that the divine is an active force, which is revealed through signs and wonders. The broad movement, however, encompasses a wide variety of practices. All the Americans I met who had gravitated to the Redeemed Church described their motivations similarly: they were searching for something that they felt was missing from this society, a feverish engagement with the worship of God. “I’ve seen in other churches such a laid-back sophistication,” said Keith N. Green, who drifted through a number of African Methodist Episcopal and nondenominational churches before joining a Redeemed parish in Columbia, S.C. “When I came here I didn’t see that. I saw a congregation of people who really enjoyed praise. I didn’t see any shyness in here about dancing for Jesus.”The Redeemed see God as a magical presence in their lives. Like most Pentecostals, they believe that when the Holy Spirit inhabits them, they can perform miracles and see the future. Enoch Adeboye is said to have publicly prophesied the untimely death of General Abacha in 1998, three days before it actually happened. In “Let Somebody Shout Hallelujah!” a hagiographic biography of Adeboye written by his former secretary, the general overseer is credited with using his God-given powers to raise the dead, avoid traffic jams, foresee coups, restore hair to the balding and cure kidney disease, depression and H.I.V. Bart Pierce, the Pentecostal minister from Baltimore, says he witnessed such miracles while attending Adeboye’s services in Nigeria. “We watched people get right out of their wheelchairs and walk,” he told me.“They move — ‘they’ being the Africans — in the supernatural,” said Cheryl Broadus, who attends the same multiethnic South Carolina parish that Green belongs to. Born in Brooklyn, Broadus said she happened into the church after she moved to Columbia to work for a local public television station. “They have brought those miracles that we read about in the Bible, that we know Jesus performed,” she said. “This is what really drew me and a lot of the Americans.”Her pastor, Kwesi Ansah Jr., describes himself as a “pioneer missionary.” A few days before Christmas, he pulled up in a Nissan Pathfinder — its license plate reads, “Fear This God” — and led me into his church, which is located in a building vacated by a defunct mortgage broker. A jovial, pie-faced man, Ansah told me that in contrast to most Redeemed pastors, he is not a Nigerian but a Ghanaian, and he has spent his life preaching the Gospel in locales as disparate as Israel, Australia and Spain. His current posting, he says, is one of his most difficult. There’s a lot of evangelical competition in South Carolina, and not many Africans. But Ansah has managed to establish a congregation of around 100, with satellite parishes in other South Carolina cities.“It was the Westerners, Europeans and Americans that brought the Gospel as missionaries to us on the dark continent of Africa,” Ansah said. “So the seed was sown, is grown, germinated, and it is now bearing fruit. So we’re now here to also give back.”The Redeemed often cast their mission as a recapitulation, but the reality is that their church did not originate, in any meaningful sense, as a Western import. Its founder, Josiah Akindayomi, was born around 1909, into a family that worshiped Ogun, the Yoruba god of iron and war. According to “A New Paradigm of Pentecostal Power,” a study of the church by the Nigerian scholar Asonzeh Ukah, Akindayomi may have been a babalawo, a priest and healer in the indigenous tradition, before his conversion to Christianity. He started off as an Anglican and briefly attended a mission school but left that church to follow a local prophetess who belonged to a grass-roots Christian movement called aladura, or “owners of prayer.”The aladura movement began in western Nigeria around 1920. Though its teachings and style of worship bear a resemblance to American Pentecostalism, which sprang up roughly contemporaneously, many scholars believe the aladura churches were an entirely independent phenomenon, probably a response to cataclysms like the 1918 flu pandemic. Philip Jenkins, whose most recent book, “The Lost History of Christianity,” is a study of missionary movements, points out that charismatic practices have a long history and arose with eerie similarity in places like Los Angeles and Brazil. “A lot of the stuff they’re getting, they’re getting from the Book of Acts,” he said, referring to the portion of the New Testament that describes the miracles the apostles performed during the early spread of Christianity. To scholars, this coincidence is evidence of a theological undercurrent, and to sociologists it speaks of a deep human need, but to believers it’s simply proof that some truths are everlasting.The aladura movement incorporated elements of traditional belief systems, which revolved around a diverse pantheon of natural and ancestral spirits. For its first generation of followers, like Akindayomi, aladura represented a bridge between two worlds. “There’s a lot of homegrown material in these churches,” said Elias Bongmba, a Rice University religious-studies professor. “The members — though they may not accept it — actually share a similar worldview with the indigenous religions.”Akindayomi, as an itinerant preacher, wandered the roads of western Nigeria in all-white garments, ringing a bell and winning converts through his healing abilities. Eventually he formed the Redeemed Church in 1952. By this time, Akindayomi had communicated with some Pentecostal missionaries who were based in South Africa, and he became convinced that the aladura tradition had gone astray. He banished the most obvious remnants of the indigenous religions, along with any suggestion of worldliness. Men and women were strictly separated at services, where there were no musical instruments, and Akindayomi refused to take up collections for fear of the corrupting influence of money. He also banned polygamy, an accepted practice in Nigeria.Many aladura churches still exist in Nigeria, but the Redeemed now distance themselves from them. “Even though they love to pray, they are not sound biblically,” James Fadele said. The same adaptive process that produced the church in the first place has, more recently, moved in a homogenizing direction. Adeboye, who has made a close study of American evangelists, has altered some teachings to conform to biblical orthodoxy while simultaneously loosening Akindayomi’s more strident prohibitions. Music had become an integral part of worship, patriarchal restrictions on women have been lifted and the asceticism on which the church was founded has been replaced by a joyous embrace of materialism.The Redeemed following, which was small, poor and uneducated when Adeboye became the general overseer, is now full of members of Nigeria’s elite. Adeboye has made an explicit effort to recruit the upper classes and prominent government figures by setting up what are called “model parishes,” churches where, in the words of the general overseer’s biographer, the affluent are able to “have the company of their likes at fellowship.” Adeboye enjoyed a close relationship with President Olusegun Obasanjo, a professed born-again Christian who ruled between 1999 and 2007, and though Adeboye often speaks out against corruption, the church has clearly profited from its relationship to powerful figures. Recently it has come in for criticism in Nigeria for securing lucrative government concessions and for making extravagant expenditures, like Adeboye’s new plane.For all its transformations, however, the Redeemed Church’s primary appeal is still what it was in Akindayomi’s day: it offers its followers the chance to harness otherworldly forces. The Redeemed don’t deny that the gods of indigenous religions exist and possess real powers. But they say such spirits are satanic. A major theme of Redeemed teachings, to its Nigerian audience especially, is that becoming saved protects you from the curses, spells and sorcery that Africans, even Christian ones, commonly blame for all manner of misfortunes, from car accidents to impotence. Church officials in the United States are somewhat averse to talking about this aspect of doctrine. They are well aware of the ridicule that was heaped upon a Kenyan preacher after a video clip of his prayer to protect Sarah Palin from “the spirit of witchcraft,” offered during a guest sermon at her Alaska church, fell into the hands of bloggers. In fact, like many elements of Africa’s indigenous cosmology, the belief in evil spirits is entirely consistent with mainstream Pentecostal teaching, which holds that God and the Devil — an actual being — are engaged in continual “spiritual warfare.”At services I attended, James Fadele frequently prayed aloud against “divination” and “enchantment.” When I asked him what he meant by that — if he thought witches were real — he replied, cautiously, “Some people don’t believe it.” Then he quoted St. Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, which refers to “powers” and “principalities” and calls on Christians to “stand firm against the tactics of the Devil.” “So there are enemies around us,” Fadele said. “Because our eyes are not open doesn’t mean they are not there.”Redeemed pastors often attribute afflictions like poverty and addiction to demonic possession and preach against “generational curses,” which can explain everything from inherited illness to family dysfunction. Cheryl Broadus, the South Carolina follower, told me that Kwesi Ansah had proved his effectiveness in combating evil by performing an exorcism on a woman at her church. “She was slithering on the floor like a snake,” Broadus said. “My pastor was sound, firm, using the word of God as a weapon.”One winter night, in the poor southern part of Dallas, I attended a prayer service at a tiny Redeemed church overseen by a slight, earnest man in a blue hooded sweatshirt, Pastor Raphael Adebayo. A biting ice storm was on the way, and rain was already falling as wet and shivering people started filtering in. Every one of them was American, most of them were black, some were homeless and all of them were grasping for some kind of deliverance. Adebayo, who has made it his mission to win Dallas’s most desperate people over to the Redeemed Church, did what he could to offer it. One member of the congregation after another stood up to testify. One man said the church had helped him to stay out of trouble since he’d gotten out of jail the previous April. Another said Adebayo helped him to reconcile with his wife, who had sent him to the hospital by throwing scalding water into his face. “I am battling a huge addiction that I know is the Devil,” said a young woman in a gray puffy coat.Adebayo called for anyone else who was dealing with addiction to come to the altar, and almost everyone in the audience moved forward. He told the congregation to repeat after him: “Say: ‘Lord Jesus, I know by the way of Scripture, you did not create my life for disaster. You did not make me for shame. I am not an American by chance. I am in this country of plenty because you have a plan for me.’ ” The pastor pulled a bottle of olive oil from beneath his lectern and anointed each person’s forehead.After the prayer service, the pastor offered free fried chicken, and some members of the congregation began rummaging through boxes filled with secondhand clothes and odds and ends donated by a Nigerian-owned supermarket in Plano, Tex., that was going out of business. “I am from Africa,” the pastor told me. “So I know I have a lot obstacles. But I know one thing: If I give them clothes and food, they will come to me.”A convert from Islam, Adebayo was brought into the Redeemed Church by his wife, and he started ministering in south Dallas because he knew the place, having worked there as a gas-station attendant when he first came to America. “We don’t want to start from the top,” he said. “We want to start from beneath.”There has been some resistance to this bottom-up approach. Adebayo was one of several Redeemed pastors who expressed the opinion that some elements of the church may have become too focused on fund-raising and wealth-building and with creating a community for immigrant Nigerians rather than exporting the religion to others. Kwesi Ansah, a Ghanaian, told me that some non-Nigerians did not feel completely accepted by certain Redeemed pastors, who mostly still come from the Yoruba tribe. “Some of them think: let us keep it to ourselves,” he said. This is a common tension in young churches: St. Peter and St. Paul, after all, initially disagreed about whether the salvation of Christ was available only for those who followed Jewish law or, as Paul decisively argued, was meant for all believers. The experience of pastors like Raphael Adebayo suggests that if the church is serious about spreading its message among Americans, its best approach would be the one it had in the beginning, offering help to the needy.“The vision of the church is to reach out, but some people want to stay in the comfort zone,” Adebayo said. “That was not the original plan.”THE MOST IMPORTANT FIGUREin the early history of Christianity in Nigeria was a Yoruba named Samuel Ajayi Crowther. Born at the turn of the 19th century, he was captured by slave raiders as a boy, only to be freed from bondage by the British Navy and transported to the free colony of Sierra Leone, where he was converted and schooled by Anglican missionaries. In the early 1840s, Crowther returned to his homeland as a leader of the first Protestant missions. He translated the Bible into Yoruba and began the ponderous work of persuading his skeptical people to give up their gods, measuring success in terms of tiny footholds and handfuls of souls. Those few initiates who learned the Scripture, who were called “readers,” were often dispatched into the interior to preach in untouched regions. But every bit of progress was accompanied by many more frustrations, setbacks, even martyrdoms.Mission work has always been an exercise that pits faith against futility. At the time of Crowther’s death, his biographer wrote that the vast majority of Africa remained “utter heathen, living in the densest darkness of superstition and sin.” To contemporaries, the idea that the continent could ever become Christianity’s redoubt would have seemed as far-fetched as the Redeemed Church’s vision of an African-based world church.The Redeemed are fully aware of how impossible their mission appears: that’s why they speak in terms of miracles. Like the missionaries of old, they have put a great deal of effort into recruiting Americans who show interest in being trained as pastors — their own “readers.” Della Faye Sowunmi leads a volunteer group in her congregation, in which she urges the sometimes reluctant Nigerians to reach out to other African-Americans, and she says she hopes to one day lead a church herself. Kwesi Ansah told me that he hoped that Keith Green, one of his American parishioners, would become an effective emissary to the local black community. And last fall, when I first met him, Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran said he had particularly high hopes for one member of his congregation, a half-French, half-Dominican Bronx resident named Patrick Darge.Darge joined Ajayi-Adeniran’s church in 2003. At the time, he was facing a long jail term on federal narcotics-distribution charges. He attributes his relatively light sentence, three years, to God’s intervention. In prison, Darge was born again and became the head of the Christian fellowship, and when he got out he came back to the Redeemed Church. He is now one of Ajayi-Adeniran’s assistants and a constant sidekick. A slight, mild-mannered 36-year-old, Darge recently started ministering his own Spanish-language service, held on Sunday afternoons, which he has tailored with a mind toward breaking down what he calls “cultural barriers.” When I visited one Sunday, there were around 10 people in attendance, and Darge struggled valiantly to shake them out of their torpor, exhorting them to sing and shout as the Nigerian Pentecostals do.On an evening in October, shortly before Enoch Adeboye was to take the stage to preach at a revival in downtown Baltimore, Ajayi-Adeniran told me that, from this modest start, he hoped to soon plant Darge in his own church. Then that would divide, and divide again, and soon enough the Dominicans and Puerto Ricans wouldn’t view the Redeemed Church as African but as something their own. “I see us making a major breakthrough in the neighborhood,” the pastor said. “I can see new things happening now.”We were sitting at a Starbucks. Before we left, Ajayi-Adeniran made sure to chat up the fellow sitting at the table next to us, a Cameroonian as it turned out, and he invited him to see Adeboye speak. Later, the pastor took a seat on the floor of the First Mariner Arena, a 13,500-seat venue that is the home of Baltimore’s professional indoor soccer team. Around the subterranean dressing room where the general overseer was granting audiences, a phalanx of suited ministers and bodyguards were furiously tapping on their BlackBerrys. By 10 p.m., when Adeboye finally made his way to the stage, accompanied by a pair of American guest ministers, the arena was getting close to full, with an audience of mostly black faces.In his sermon, Daddy G.O. was his usual self. He spoke in a honeyed baritone, mixing talk of proofs and equations with colloquial parables, both biblical and African. Periodically, a startled expression would pass across his squarish face, and he would say, “Thank you, Father,” an indication of that he had received a message from above. The revelations were general and irrefutable. “Somebody here today, you will never lack again” went one. Another was: “This very night, the activity of witches in your family will come to an end.” As the clock approached midnight, Adeboye gave the audience a prophecy: “You will yet make history in this nation — amen!”Adeboye wrapped up with the altar call, in which those who are not yet saved are called forward to become members of the Redeemed. Hundreds of people streamed to the foot of the stage.“In Africa, we get excited when people give their lives to Jesus,” Adeboye instructed his flock. “Go ahead,” he said, “talk to the almighty.” And then it came, in a roar like a wave, thousands of voices raised in the unknowable language of heaven.'"

"'09-04-13,'0','The United States must do more to curb the spread of diseases like AIDS and hepatitis C in prison, where infection rates are high and inmates can easily spread disease through unprotected sex or by sharing needles.Drug treatment in prison is clearly part of the solution. But by some estimates, fewer than one in five inmates who need formal treatment are actually getting it. That’s alarming, given that about half the prison population suffers from drug abuse or dependency problems.Addicted prisoners cause problems outside the walls. After they’re freed, addicts with H.I.V. or AIDS can infect spouses and lovers. They feed their addictions by returning to crime, which lands them back in prison and starts the terrible cycle over again.The most effective programs provide inmates with high-quality treatment in prison and continue that treatment when prisoners return to their communities. Such programs have been shown to reduce both drug use and recidivism.But good programs are rare, according to a report earlier this year in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Prisons typically rely on the abstinence-only model, which fails miserably with heroin addicts. Moreover, prison officials are notoriously hostile to methadone maintenance and other chemically based therapies that have long been a standard for people addicted to opiates.Prison treatment is particularly disastrous in New York, according to a new report from Human Rights Watch. Imprisoned addicts, the authors say, are typically shut out of treatment until their sentences are nearly over because of ill-conceived policies that give priority to those who are about to be released.New rules created earlier this month should help address these problems. The rules give oversight responsibility for prison treatment programs to the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, an agency that develops treatment programs and licenses treatment providers.'"
"'09-04-13,'0','With a limited personal income and no owner behind him, he usually wound up with horses like Sometimes Sweet. A career also-ran whose win in a $7,500 maiden claimer on Jan. 28, 2006, was McCarthy’s last victory before General Quarters came around, Sometimes Sweet earned just $15,000 in her career. But when General Quarters showed up in a $20,000 maiden claimer last May at Churchill Downs, McCarthy thought he might have uncovered a horse who could turn around his career. He had coveted the horse a year earlier at a yearling sale, but had been outbid by Ken Ramsey, who owns one of Kentucky’s biggest stables.“I had seen his sire, Sky Mesa, win the Futurity at Keeneland and he so impressed me,” McCarthy said. “He was a perfectly balanced horse who seemed to have everything going for him. I thought that when he became a sire I’d love to train one of his babies.”Ramsey knew he was taking a chance entering a well-bred horse in a claiming race but he said the trainer Wesley Ward assured him the colt was “really slow.” General Quarters won by a neck that day and McCarthy was convinced he would only get better.General Quarters went on to lose seven straight races, but McCarthy was seeing steady signs of improvement. He ran second in two straight small stakes races at Tampa Bay Downs and then won Tampa’s Sam F. Davis Stakes. He then finished fifth in the Tampa Bay Derby, but had traffic problems under jockey James Lopez. Eibar Coa replaced Lopez for the Blue Grass and turned in a flawless, winning ride. General Quarters made $465,000 for McCarthy.“As much money as that is, that’s not what this was all about for me,” McCarthy said. “I’ve seen the Kentucky Derby over and over again; I’ve been to every one since 1954. Now to think that I am going there with a horse that has a shot is overwhelming. That’s the big thing for me.”The Blue Grass was the culmination of a long process that began when McCarthy claimed General Quarters some 11 months earlier. With no employees to help him and no other horses to train, he spends every second of his workday around General Quarters, always trying to find a way to bring out his talent. One of the keys, he said, has been to teach the horse to relax in his races.Julie Sheets, a freelance exercise rider who gallops the horse in the mornings, said: “I think that’s one of the reasons the horse has done so well; Mr. McCarthy is very thorough. He is so hands-on that he can take the very best care of a horse.”The Blue Grass win has emboldened McCarthy. He understands how difficult it is to win the Derby, but believes he has a horse good enough to do it. Still, he will be the underdog trainer with the overachieving horse, a team that will have a lot of people pulling for them.Ramsey said: “Sure, I wish I still had him, but I hope he goes on and wins the Kentucky Derby. This is a Cinderella story. You have this older gentleman with just one horse. How can you not root for him?”'"
"'09-04-13,'0','St. Louis Cardinals General Manager John Mozeliak said Saturday that he planned to discuss with Troy Glaus his admission to federal authorities that he used steroids in 2003 and 2004 while recovering from injuries to his right shoulder. Mozeliak said that he was concerned about Glaus because he was recovering from another injury to the right shoulder, which is likely to sideline him for the first two months of the season.The New York Times reported Sunday that Glaus told investigators in 2005 that he used steroids to recover from the shoulder injuries. Glaus said he obtained steroids from Ramon Scruggs, a California doctor, who sent him the steroids in the mail without first meeting him.“Any time something like this resurfaces in the context of him currently going through rehab, it’s concerning,” Mozeliak said, according to The St. Louis Post Dispatch. “We’re still hopeful it’s something he can work through and at the end it’s unrelated.”A spokesman for the Cardinals said Sunday that Mozeliak was not available for comment.The spokesman, Brian Bartow, said that Mozeliak planned to meet with Glaus, who is rehabilitating in Arizona, when the Cardinals are in Phoenix to play the Diamondbacks over the next three days.Glaus’s rehabilitation is being overseen by Keith Kouher, a Phoenix-based physical therapist who supervised Glaus’s recovery from shoulder surgery in 2004 to repair his rotator cuff and labrum. Glaus had surgery in January to repair a muscle in the shoulder.'"
"'09-04-13,'0','Speaking to protesters by a telephone link, Mr. Thaksin, who was ousted in a coup in 2006 and has since lived abroad, called for a revolution and said he was ready to return to join them.The emergency decree bans gatherings of more than five people, but bands of protesters roamed the city, defying deployments of soldiers and armored vehicles. The largest crowd gathered at the prime minister’s office, where demonstrations have continued for days, calling for the dissolution of the government.Protesters erected barricades, including parked vehicles, in case the military moved against them, and some were seen filling bottles with gas as makeshift bombs.The demonstrators, known as “red shirts,” support Mr. Thaksin, who will face an arrest warrant on corruption charges if he returns to Thailand.“Now that they have tanks on the streets, it is time for the people to come out in revolution,” he said in the telephone message to his followers on Sunday evening. “And when it is necessary, I will come back to the country.”Mr. Thaksin has been making nightly broadcasts to supporters in recent days, apparently from , .Speaking to the crowd at Government House, the prime minister’s office, a protest leader, Jakrapob Penkair, said a state of emergency was “a declaration of war against the people of Thailand.”He added: “They will try to disperse the crowds, but we will remain at Government House. We will start a people’s war.”In a televised speech to the nation, Mr. Abhisit said arrest warrants were being prepared for leaders of the demonstrations.“In the current situation, what I have to do is bring peace to the country, bring back governance and have a process of political reform,” Mr. Abhisit said. “The government will try every way to prevent further damage.”Mr. Abhisit’s emergency decree reversed a nonconfrontational approach critics said had contributed to the cancellation of the summit meeting on Saturday. At the meeting, in the beach resort of , hundreds of protesters broke through a thin line of security officers to enter the hotel complex where the leaders were gathered. Several leaders were evacuated by helicopter.The meeting was to have included the heads of the 10 members of the , the leaders of , and , the secretary general and the president of the . The officials had planned to discuss the global financial crisis.“Yesterday was a truly shameful day for our country, which had its international reputation destroyed,” The Bangkok Post said in a front-page editorial on Sunday. “It is one thing to refuse to use force; it is another to allow protesters to run riot into the summit venue, blocking access to the hotel and putting foreign leaders at risk.”Although the protests have slowed traffic in parts of Bangkok, they have not affected daily business or posed a difficulty to tourists. Bangkok’s airports, which were shut by huge protests in November, remained open and were functioning normally. Hotels were open, and foreigners said they did not feel threatened.“We feel very safe,” said Thibault Quetel, 20, from , who is studying economics here. “This is a problem between Thais. There hasn’t been any animosity toward foreigners.”Mr. Thaksin’s supporters, who mostly come from his base in the countryside, represent one side of a deep social and political divide that pits them against the “yellow shirts,” who demonstrated last year against a pro-Thaksin government.The yellow shirts generally represent the country’s established power centers, including the royalists, the elite and middle class, and the military, who feel threatened by Mr. Thaksin’s attempts to change the country’s balance of power.Political turmoil has continued since leaders of the coup returned the country to democracy last year and Thaksin supporters were voted back into office.As demonstrations by the Thaksin foes continued, court rulings forced the dissolution of two governments. Mr. Abhisit took office four months ago in a parliamentary vote that his opponents say was undemocratic.All sides pledge allegiance to King , 82, viewed as Thailand’s moral soul, who has been in ill health. Although the king holds no direct political power, uncertainty over the royal succession casts a shadow over Thailand’s politics.As several hundred red shirts marched past the palace on Sunday, they stopped to sing the national anthem and the royal anthem as a guard unit with rifles stood behind barbed wire.Several commentators said Sunday that they were discouraged that the confrontation had taken an unpredictable turn.“We need reconciliation, and I don’t see any sign that it is coming,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University. “Signs are pointing in the opposite direction, which is that things are going to get worse.”It is a situation that Mr. Thaksin may be hoping to exploit, Mr. Thitinan said, in which he could return as the only person to bring the red shirts under control.“Right now the red shirts are on the resurgence, and we don’t know where they are going with it,” Mr. Thitinan said. “But the pendulum is likely to swing to very suppressive tactics and brutal and harsh reactions from the right, the establishment.”'"
"'09-04-13,'0','DETROIT  The Treasury Department is directing General Motors to lay the groundwork for a bankruptcy filing by a June 1 deadline, despite G.M.’s public contention that it could still reorganize outside court, people with knowledge of the plans said during the weekend.Members of President Obama’s automotive task force spent last week in meetings and on conference calls with G.M. officials and its advisers in Detroit and Washington. Those talks are expected to continue this week.The goal is to prepare for a fast “surgical” bankruptcy, the people who had been briefed on the plans said. G.M., which has been granted $13.4 billion in federal aid, insists that a quick restructuring is necessary so its image and sales are not damaged permanently.The preparations are aimed at assuring a G.M. bankruptcy filing is ready should the company be unable to reach agreement with bondholders to exchange roughly $28 billion in debt into equity in G.M. and with the United Automobile Workers union, which has balked at granting concessions without sacrifices from bondholders.President Obama, who was elected with strong backing from labor, remained concerned about potential risk to G.M.’s pension plan and wants to avoid harming workers, these people said.None of these people agreed to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the process. G.M. declined to comment and the Treasury Department did not comment.One plan under consideration would create a new company that would buy the “good” assets of G.M. almost immediately after the carmaker files for bankruptcy.Less desirable assets, including unwanted brands, factories and health care obligations, would be left in the old company, which could be liquidated over several years.Treasury officials are examining one potential outcome in which the “good G.M.” enters and exits bankruptcy protection in as little as two weeks, using $5 billion to $7 billion in federal financing, a person who had been briefed on the prospect said last week.The rest of G.M. may require as much as $70 billion in government financing, and possibly more to resolve the health care obligations and the liquidation of the factories, according to legal experts and federal officials.Since replacing Rick Wagoner on March 31, G.M.’s chief executive, Fritz Henderson, has sent increasingly clear signals that bankruptcy is probable unless agreements are reached with labor and the bondholders by the administration’s June 1 deadline.Unlike Mr. Wagoner, who refused until his final days at G.M. to consider a Chapter 11 filing, Mr. Henderson has deployed staff to work with legal and government advisers, although he does not agree a bankruptcy is inevitable.Last week, he said G.M. was proceeding on a dual track, hoping to restructure out of court, but also preparing for a filing.“If we need to resort to bankruptcy, we have to do it quickly,” Mr. Henderson said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.John Paul MacDuffie, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said he saw little chance of an out-of-court restructuring, given that the Obama administration had rejected G.M.’s proposed revitalization plan in March. It was submitted without the concessions that were required from bondholders and the union, and which have still not been reached.“The simplest way to frame it is that they took the loans, there were conditions on the loans, they didn’t prove their case for financial viability, and they didn’t meet the deadline, either,” Professor MacDuffie said.Lawyers for G.M. and the government have much work to do before any bankruptcy case can begin, executives with bankruptcy experience said last week.First and foremost, G.M. would have to formulate a business plan that addresses virtually every aspect of the company that it hopes to transform while under bankruptcy protection.It would have to show how it would save billions of dollars through agreements with its bondholders and unions, how many dealers it plans to keep, and the plants and offices it plans to either close or preserve.The plan also needs to give a candid forecast of the car market, a tricky prospect given the sharp falloff in sales over the last few months, these executives said.Treasury has hired the Boston Consulting Group to help with the business plan, according to a notice posted April 8 on FedBizOpps.gov, a government procurement Web site.Participation from banks also may be needed, and because of the weak economic climate, lenders are likely to insist that G.M. wring as much out of its operations as possible.“It’s a complex system and you’ve got to be thinking big,” Professor MacDuffie said.Finally, legal experts said, G.M. would have to try to prevent panic among consumers in the event of a bankruptcy filing. The government has said it will guarantee G.M.’s vehicle warranties.'"
"'09-04-13,'0','Even Condé Nast’s magazines, filled with luxury ads and dispatches from far-flung locations, are cheap: 87 cents an issue for The New Yorker, 89 cents for Allure and just over a dollar each for Condé Nast Traveler and Bon Appétit.“Obviously, you can hardly even mail that particular issue for 80 cents, but what makes up the difference is the advertising,” said John Fennell, an associate professor of magazine journalism at the Missouri School of Journalism. It is a “model where magazines essentially try to gain as many subscribers as they can and allow advertising to pay the bills.”Most major magazines have cut prices recently as part of an effort to increase subscriptions. A New York Times analysis of circulation data for the 50 largest and most expensive magazines showed that in the last four years, as overall prices rose 14 percent, subscription prices dropped an average of 9 percent.Decreases at individual magazines were more substantial: Parents magazine’s price dropped 51 percent, Elle’s 41 percent and Fortune and Fitness’s 34 percent.“Think about the cost of a movie ticket. Think about the cost of your subscription for cable television. Think about the cost of going to a sporting event,” Mr. Clinton, the Hearst marketing chief, said. Those industries, he said, “have kept pace in passing on more of the cost to the consumer, and the consumer’s willing to pay for it.”The Economist is leading the charge on expensive subscriptions, and its success is one reason publishers are rethinking their approaches. It is a news magazine with an extraordinarily high cover price — raised to $6.99 late last year — and subscription price, about $100 a year on average.Even though The Economist is relatively expensive, its circulation has increased sharply in the last four years. Subscriptions are up 60 percent since 2004, and newsstand sales have risen 50 percent, according to the audit bureau.“We get more money out of our readers than advertisers, and that’s a very different model,” said Alan Press, senior vice president for marketing in the Americas at the Economist Group. “We’ll never discount the kind of content we have.”The Economist’s readers, it could be argued, are professionals who can afford price increases. But one of the most popular and expensive mass magazines, People, has also been raising its prices without losing readers.The subscription price for People has risen about 5 percent, to $104 a year, in the last four years. The cover price has risen 21 percent, to an average of $4.09 (including special issues, which cost more). In that time, People’s subscription and newsstand sales have both increased slightly.“Our strategy right now is to maintain a premium price on both sides of the equation,” said Paul Caine, who oversees People as the president and group publisher of Time Inc.’s style and entertainment group.Many publishers argue that these magazines are the exception, not the rule, and say they would lose too many readers if they raised their prices.“Sports Illustrated could theoretically charge $100 a year and have a much smaller circulation, but we wouldn’t be maximizing what the enterprise could make,” said John Reese, the vice president for consumer marketing in the Sports Illustrated group.“It’s amazing how price-sensitive people are,” said David Ball, the vice president for consumer marketing at Meredith, which owns magazines like More and Fitness. “Honestly, we’ve tested raising it 50 cents and we see a drop-off — sometimes startlingly high.”Interestingly, whether consumers pay $5 or $50 for a subscription does not affect their perception of the magazine, according to a study conducted four years ago by the media consultant Rebecca McPheters for publishers including Time Inc., Condé Nast, Hearst and Meredith.“There was no difference between the engagement of those who paid less and those who paid more,” Ms. McPheters said in an interview. “Since then, we’ve done a lot of work around public-place readership, and we find that public-place readers who pay nothing are almost as engaged as those who pay.”Given those findings, the price a consumer pays should not matter to advertisers, since it does not affect the reader’s attitude toward the magazine, said Robert A. Sauerberg Jr., the group president for consumer marketing at Condé Nast. Mr. Sauerberg said that prices were constantly tested, and “the fact is, the pricing comes as a result of what the consumer is willing to pay.”Still, he has raised prices on renewal subscriptions for The New Yorker and Vanity Fair recently, and Vanity Fair raised its cover price from $4.50 to $4.95 with the April issue. “When we can do it, we do it,” Mr. Sauerberg said.More magazines may follow as they watch others that have done it.Real Simple, for example, has raised its subscription prices 17 percent in the last four years and had an 18 percent rise in subscriptions. In the same period, Cosmopolitan has raised its subscription rate 8 percent and orders have risen 19 percent.Given the economy, it may not be “a propitious moment to launch this,” said Victor S. Navasky, chairman of The Columbia Journalism Review, but “to the extent that the publication is aimed at a segment of the population that can afford it, why not?”'"
"'09-04-13,'0','With the downturn arrive many perplexing terms, like “collateralized debt obligations” and “wraparound mortgage,” so in a way the timing of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt’s reference book, The American Heritage Dictionary of Business Terms, which went on sale March 25, could not be better. After all, inside are straightforward definitions of many newly ubiquitous terms, like “no-doc loans” and “cash-out refinancing.”But whether the timing is good news for the publisher depends on whether you tend to see your 401(k) account as half empty or half full.The book could strike some as instantly dated, since it went to press before the author, David L. Scott, could include such recently minted terms as “toxic assets,” “TARP” and “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.”“Of course there’s frustration with not having your book exactly up to date when it comes out, but I’ve written long enough to know that’s just the way the system works,” said Mr. Scott, a retired professor and author of more than two dozen financial books.A Google search of “toxic asset” yields more than 40 million results, but the term appeared in print fewer than 20 times before 2008, according to the Lexis-Nexis database.“I had never heard the term ‘toxic asset’ until the fall,” Mr. Scott said. “I don’t even know where it came from.”Publishing a book is slow going, and this one faced the headwind of persnickety lexicographers. Mr. Scott delivered the manuscript in January 2008 and added tweaks that April before pages were laid out, followed by a year of proofreading, printing and distribution. If not for the timing, he would have included a certain investor and insurance company to illustrate “Ponzi scheme” and “credit-default swap,” respectively.“I’d give my right arm to have been able to include the Bernie Madoff case and the A.I.G. case,” Mr. Scott said.'"
"'09-04-13,'0','The article about a government task force’s call for primary care screening and treatment of teenage depression overlooks a valuable partner in addressing children’s mental health needs: schools.Locating mental health services in schools has proved both effective and cost-effective. The article cites the lack of specialists available to treat children and teenagers, yet many schools have professionals trained for just such work. Research has documented the efficacy of prevention of depression and other psychiatric disorders through cognitive behavioral approaches, a natural fit for school settings.Students would clearly benefit if educational institutions combined teaching of math, science, history and literature with promoting the critical life skills for coping, stress management and emotional resiliency. Without government financing and support, however, the logical notion of offering medical and mental health services where children spend most of their waking hours cannot become a reality.The writer is director of the Fanya Gottesfeld Heller Doctoral Program at the Azrieli Graduate School of Jewish Education and Administration of Yeshiva University.The United States Preventive Services Task Force suggests routine depression screening for teenagers because the disorder has become so widespread. If it is indeed true that 6 percent of American teenagers, or close to two million adolescents, are clinically depressed, the solution is not more screening. The only thing this will accomplish is more diagnoses of even mild cases of the blues, more prescriptions for drugs, and more hours on the therapist’s couch.We should be focusing our money, time and resources on finding out why so many teenagers are depressed. Instead of pulling kids out of the proverbial river one by one, let’s focus on what is pushing them downstream in the first place.'"
"'09-04-13,'0','But Frances Berwick, executive vice president and general manager of Bravo Media, said that “the revenue from this is minuscule by comparison to what we think it’ll do for our brand.”“This is a fun way to satisfy what we’re hearing from our viewers: that they like our shows, that they like our taste,” Ms. Berwick said. “It’s about giving our viewers a greater immersion in the brand.”Licensing is increasingly popular among media brands, said Steven Ekstract, the group publisher of License Global Magazine.“A lot of media companies are losing advertising revenue, and so they’re looking for new revenue opportunities, and licensing their brand names out into other areas is the way to do that,” Mr. Ekstract said. He listed examples including American Idol Ice Cream from Dreyer’s, Animal Planet toys, and a Food Network kitchenware line at Kohl’s.The products Bravo could sell on the air helped drive the development of “The Fashion Show,” a series scheduled to begin on May 7.“It was developed with the idea that it would be, sort of, Main Street fashion that would be available for mass retail, absolutely,” Ms. Berwick said. “We could have gone a number of different ways with that, and we chose to control the manufacturing and sell that ourselves.”As the winning design is announced, the show will direct viewers to BravoTV.com, where copies of the clothes will be sold for about $150 and up. (A company called Brooklyn Equities is handling the manufacturing and production.)“Literally, fashion is stepping off the runway and into consumers’ living rooms for the first time, so it’s the ultimate fan experience,” said Jennifer Turner, vice president for licensing and strategic partnerships at Bravo.Other shows are planning more subtle placements. On “Top Chef,” the Teleflora bouquets will be shown in the background, and a graphic will appear on the screen to alert viewers to the product, said Thomas Mooney, chief marketing officer for Teleflora.Sample arrangements mix food and flora, featuring Gerbera daisies alongside clusters of brussels sprouts, and cinnamon sticks and asparagus stalks in place of decorative branches.For Teleflora, product placement is attractive because it can give the brand a stronger identity, Mr. Mooney said.“Unless we find a way to explain what makes us completely different from anybody else you can order a flower bouquet from, we can’t pique your interest,” he said.Kooba’s bags will appear on “NYC Prep,” a reality show chronicling the lives of rich Manhattan high-school students that is scheduled to have its premiere on June 16. Kooba designed exclusive colors for its bags, and the lead girls got to pick their favorite.At $595, the bags are expensive, said Michelle Cutter, vice president for marketing and new-business development at Kooba.“They’re just launching this merchandising strategy themselves,” she said of Bravo, “and for them to offer $500 to $600 priced handbags on their merchandise, they hadn’t really done anything that expensive before. Hopefully it’ll work.” Kooba has manufactured only 200 of the bags, hedging its bets.However, viewers are already complaining about the amount of product placement on Bravo — several Web sites have created drinking games suggesting gulps of alcohol at each blatant mention of a brand. Will they stand for sales pitches, too?“The way we’ve been successful with our branded integrations, and I do think it’s something we’ve done a lot of, starting from ‘Queer Eye’ on through, with our audience, they’re educated, they’re smart and discerning, and we are absolutely upfront about it,” Ms. Berwick said. “We’re not doing, sort of, subliminal messaging. We are saying, ‘This is what it is,’ and they seem to be responding well to it.”Asked if the potential for product tie-ins would affect how Bravo chose new shows, Ms. Berwick said that would not happen for a while.“I think it really depends on what the show is,” she said. “First and foremost, the creative of a television show is going to be driven by what we think is a great concept, not by what product is going to be derived from it. It will be a long time before that paradigm shift.”'"
"'09-04-13,'0','The seeds for the future were planted with the trades of Kidd and Jefferson. The team braced for a long season, yet remained teasingly close to a playoff spot. Its fate was sealed when Harris, averaging career highs of 21.5 points and 6.9 assists a game, sustained a shoulder injury that limited him in the stretch run.After ending the first half with a 19-22 record, the Nets have gone a 14-25.“Everybody was pretty happy with the way those things were going, and what transpires is your expectation level goes up,” Thorn said.The Nets were one of four teams in the conference that did not win a majority of their home games. Attendance dipped at Izod Center. The organization still seems confident of a proposed move to Brooklyn, although the Atlantic Yards project has been continually stalled by legal and financial obstacles. The Sports Business Journal recently reported that the Nets lost $27.8 million last year and were in danger of losing sponsors for the planned arena.On the positive side, Harris blossomed as an offensive player, and Lopez became a post threat and is a contender for rookie of the year. Carter played superbly and nurtured the young players, helping them remain focused even after they were eliminated from playoff contention, as evidenced by Saturday’s victory over the 58-win Orlando Magic.“I just want the mentality to be as a professional to finish your job,” said Carter, who is averaging 20.8 points and 5.1 rebounds.The moments that occasionally raised expectations were few, interspersed with meltdowns and losses to inferior teams. The Kidd deal brought dividends in Harris. The trade that sent Jefferson to the Milwaukee Bucks for Yi Jianlian and Bobby Simmons saved money and gave the Nets some youth and experience.Their season-long mantra, Frank said, was to serve “multiple masters” in developing Yi, and the rookies Lopez, Ryan Anderson and Chris Douglas-Roberts, while remaining competitive.“To me, from a disappointment standpoint, is the fact that this group will not be able to taste the playoffs,” Frank said. “Especially for the young guys we have, it would have been very, very nice, if they could have gotten a taste of it.”“When you perform sometimes and you play hard sometimes, you get a mediocre season, and that’s where we are right now,” guard Keyon Dooling said.The Nets enter a period of reflection and will have to decide whether to retain Frank, who has one season left on his contract.With more than five seasons at the helm, Frank is the longest-tenured coach in the conference. Frank said the decision was out of his hands, then spoke of coaching in general.“We just do our jobs, we love what we do and we’re all evaluated at the end of the year,” Frank said.This summer, player movement may be restricted by a sagging economy, which will probably result in a shrinking payroll. Thorn said he would probably home in on improving the team’s defense, which was prone to matador-type lapses.In trying to trim payroll, the Nets fielded calls from teams interested in Carter during the season and will again listen to offers. His age (32) and remaining salary ($33.6 million over the next two years) will be deterrents.The Nets will again head to the N.B.A. draft lottery. And they will again try to develop players while remaining competitive.“It’s headed in the right direction,” Vandeweghe said. “You always want to win games, but this year was not our year to go to the championship, and we realize that.”'"
"'09-04-13,'0','LONDON (Reuters) — President Obama’s half brother was denied a visa to return to Britain after giving a false name to the police last year when accused of an attempted sexual assault, British newspapers reported Sunday.A database showed that the British police arrested the half brother, Samson Obama, last November in Britain, accusing him of trying to sexually assault a girl, the newspaper News of the World said.Samson Obama, who lives in Kenya, gave officers a false identity at the time of his arrest, claiming to be Henry Aloo, the report said. He was fingerprinted but not charged, and he left Britain.He tried to enter Britain again to visit relatives while on his way to his half brother’s inauguration in January, but immigration officials barred him, News of the World said.His details were stored on a new government database of fingerprints and biometric statistics, which turned up a match when immigration officials checked it in January.

"'09-04-14,'0','Plan to Secure a Uniform Practice in the Use of the Caps and Gowns in This Country So that the Degree of the Wearer, the Faculty Under Whom It Was Obtained, and the Institution Conferring It May Be Readily Seen.The popular mind would hardly associate with the persons of college professors any particular gorgeousness of apparel; yet in the caps, gowns, and hoods which they wear on ceremonial occasions there are such a diversity of colors and richness of material as to create more than passing notice. The bright hoods worn by the clergymen of the Episcopal Church holding honorary degrees from the English universities are often noticed by churchgoers, who assign them to some clerical, rather than academic or university, form. For example, the clergyman who has received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from Oxford is entitled to wear a hood of scarlet cloth, lined with black silk; if, however, the same degree is conferred by Cambridge, the hood would be of scarlet cloth, but lined with pink silk. While it has been the custom of clergymen, Judges, college Presidents, and professors to wear gowns on occasions of ceremony, nevertheless it has only been within a comparatively short time in this country that the practice has become widespread, and that various colors and marks have been employed extensively in connection with the gowns, as indicative of various degrees and institutions.One of the first universities in this country to adopt a complete academic costume for its officers of instruction of all grades was Columbia College, and for many years its statutes have contained sections relating to this subject. Until quite recently two classes or robes were provided forone of scarlet, the other of black. The scarlet gowns were never generally worn, but sometimes, on very formal occasions, adorned the President of other high officials, or were worn by professors delegated to represent the college at centennials or celebrations at universities, either here or in Europe. The example of Columbia is cited, as the Trustees of that university have always made ample provision for an elaborate system of cap and gown, but other universities soon began to adopt systems of their own, and a great diversity of apparel among the professors of our leading institutions, when gathered together at celebrations, became evident. It was seen that a uniformity of costume among universities and colleges so closely connected as those of this country was to be desired, and that, instead of the traditional and arbitrary system of gowns and hoods that characterizes the English and Continental universities, the American colleges should adopt a code that, with certain modifications, should answer for all institutions adopting it.This scheme was originated by the authorities of Princeton University, and last year an intercollegiate commission on academic costume met at Columbia University. President [Seth] Low was appointed the Chairman, and J[ohn]. J. McCook of the Princeton Corporation, the Rev. Dr. Charles Roy Palmer of the Yale Corporation, and Chancellor [Henry M.] MacCracken of New-York University were active members of the committee. The object was to secure a uniform practice in the use of the cap and gown, so that from the cap, gown, and hood the degree of the wearer, the Faculty under whom it was obtained, and the institution conferring it might be readily seen.The Columbia statute was taken as a basis, but a number of important modifications were made. First, the form of the gown was decided on, and for this purpose, as well as for the hood and cap, three classes of degrees were consideredthe Bachelors of Arts, Science, Philosophy, Letters, or any other degree of this class by these regulations wear a gown of black worsted stuff with pointed sleeves of considerable length. The Bachelors' gown differs from that worn by undergraduates in that it has greater fullness in back and sleeves. The Master of Arts is more luxurious and wears a silk gown with long closed sleeves and a still greater amount of fullness. The Doctor wears a silk gown also, but with round open sleeves and faced down the front with black velvet and with three velvet bars across the sleeves. The facings and cross bars, however, can be of a brighter color of velvet, corresponding to the edging of the hood as described below.It is in the hoods that the striking arrangements of bright colors are to be noticed. The material in each case is the same as that of the gown, and black in color. The length and shape vary with the degree. The Bachelor's hood is three feet in length, while those of the Master and Doctor are four feet long, the latter having in addition panels at the side lined with silk and edged with velvet. The lining of the hood, which shows conspicuously at the back, is the color or colors of the institution conferring the degree; in the case of Yale, blue; Princeton, orange; Columbia, light blue and white, and so on through the list.The edging of the hood, which varies from three to six inches in width, signifies the Faculty to which the degree refers, and the following colors are prescribed: Faculty of Arts and Letters, white; Theology, scarlet; Law, purple; Medicine, green; Philosophy, dark blue; Science, yellow; Fine Arts, brown; Music, pink. This edging can be made of silk, satin, or velvet, the latter being the most commonly used, and forms the strap passing around the neck to support the hood.The black mortar-board, or Oxford cap, completes the costume, and is the same for all grades except that of Doctor, who is entitled to have the tassel of gold thread and to have the cap made of velvet. The foregoing costume has been officially adopted at Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, University of Pennsylvania, New-York University, Lafayette, the Catholic University of America, and others. The code will doubtless become widespread throughout the United States, and it will be possible at commencement to tell the precise status of a professor or instructor in respect to his Alma Mater or degrees by a glance at his gown and hood.The most brilliant gathering of professors in their robes that has been seen in recent years in this country will take place at the dedication of the new site of Columbia University, on May 2, at Morningside Heights. The 275 professors and other officers of instruction have been notified by the Trustees to appear in robes and hoods corresponding to their position, while a large number of professors representing sister institutions, and clergymen, will be on hand. The one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Princeton College next Fall will also see a similar display of academic costumes.'"

"'09-04-14,'0','The first is the traditional approach of going for a walk or visualizing your favorite place.But the other technique is more intriguing. In it, you treat stress as any other business problem.First, you do a causal analysis. “What’s the source of the stress?”Second, you propose a course of action to solve the problem.Third, you execute your plan, and then, fourth, adjust as necessary.POSITIVE SPIN I Being aware that you are under stress invariably increases your stress level. It gives you one more thing to worry about.But you don’t need to look at it that way, the people at BizHelp.24.com say.“Stress is a sign our body is preparing us for action. Your body is pumped with chemicals, your heart beats faster, your muscles tense and your mind becomes more focused. These changes allow us to master situations by making that deadline or giving that bad news to an important customer. More clearly, stress helps us complete tasks successfully under times of pressure.”POSITIVE SPIN II Here is an approach to dealing with stress that Michael Jackson, chairman of the British venture capital firm Elderstreet Investments, has found effective: Assume the very worst when faced with a problem.“I am often accused of being unduly pessimistic when I use this technique, but it works for me at the outset and provides me with a backup plan. I then feel better, remember it can’t get worse, and I don’t feel totally powerless and out of control.”RULES OF THUMB Writing on BusinessWeek.com, Mallary Tytel, president of Healthy Workplaces, offers these rules of thumb for reducing your employees’ stress. (The tips could also work for you.)¶Ensure that the workload is in line with workers’ capabilities and resources.¶Establish work schedules that are compatible with demands and responsibilities outside the job.LAST CALL Just about everyone agrees that keeping both perspective and your sense of humor can help deal with stress.Larry Wilde, who bills himself as “America’s good humor expert,” tells this story, which addresses both.“The chairman of the board of directors of a Chicago charity called the monthly meeting to order. ‘I have rather a stressful order of business,’ he announced. ‘We’re looking for a treasurer.’“ ‘But we appointed a treasurer just six months ago.’“ ‘Yes,’ said the chairman. ‘That’s the treasurer we’re looking for.’ ”'"

"'09-04-14,'0','The mayor’s remarks were in contrast to those he made a month ago when Ms. Stark, who is in charge of collecting $22 billion in tax revenues and of assessing $800 billion in taxable property, was found to have earned $90,000 in 2007 for her work as a member of the board of directors of an outside firm. She resigned from the board of that firm and the mayor said, “I have enormous confidence” in her.This time, Mr. Bloomberg offered no such defense, and appeared to be quite serious, even stern, in his comments.Ms. Stark, 48, has run the Finance Department since 2002, and her relationship with Ms. Ottley-Brown was first reported by The New York Post.Finance officials confirmed on Monday that in recent years the agency had employed three of Ms. Stark’s relatives in clerical or college aide positions: her late brother’s stepson, her half brother and a niece. In addition, the agency said it had hired Ms. Ottley-Brown’s ex-husband soon after the couple filed for divorce in 2007. He is working as a graphic artist for the agency, with a salary of $78,000.Ms. Stark, through her spokesman, said, “In my nearly eight years as finance commissioner, the department has hired close to 600 full-time employees and last summer alone hired 250 part-time student interns.“It is therefore not at all surprising or significant that a small handful of the hundreds hired by the department over that entire period would have had some connection to me, but during my tenure, I have never used my position to obtain any advantage for any relative or personal relation.”To diminish conflicts of interest, the New York City Charter regulates the relationship between public servants and their superiors and subordinates, specifying that they may not engage in business dealings.As recently as late Monday, the Conflicts of Interest Board announced it had issued a $750 fine to a Department of Finance parking judge, Richard Horowitz, for providing free representation to his supervisor, Deputy Chief Administrative Law Judge Brian Keeney, in Mr. Keeney’s divorce proceedings in 2006 and 2007.Ms. Stark, through her attorney, Randy Mastro, said that she had never had a personal relationship with any subordinate.Last month, several days after she resigned from the board of directors of Tarragon Corporation, Ms. Stark faced questions about the time sheets submitted by a parking judge for the agency who is also married to her first deputy commissioner. A year earlier, city investigators had found what they described as more than 100 discrepancies in time sheets submitted by the judge, Allan J. Patricof, and recommended that he repay the city $8,645.Initially, Ms. Stark took no action, saying her own review had found that the judge had worked the hours elsewhere, including in his car and at his home. But this year, when the findings of the city investigators surfaced, the agency said it would reassign him, although Ms. Stark and other finance officials defended the quality of Mr. Patricof’s work.'"
"'09-04-14,'0','An alarmingly sharp decline in state tax revenues could further undermine the finances of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, according to a new projection made public on Monday. Combined with other recent forecasts of plummeting revenue, the data made it likely that, without a financial rescue from Albany, the authority might have to resort to additional service cuts or fare increases beyond the measures already proposed.“What it suggests is that the M.T.A. will have to take additional actions in order to balance the budget,” said Gary Dellaverson, chief financial officer of the authority. He said that could include deeper service cuts or a second fare increase before the year is out, but he refused to give details of what was being considered.In the latest forecast, released Monday in materials for a coming bond sale, the authority said the state had informed the authority that it should expect a shortfall as large as $200 million in revenue this year from a basket of taxes dedicated to mass transit, including portions of the sales tax and a tax on corporate profits.That is more than double what the authority projected in February when it tried to gauge how its tax revenues would be affected if the decline in the region’s economy became much worse. At that time it estimated that if the economy hit bottom, its dedicated state tax receipts could be down by as much as $82 million.Making the picture even bleaker, the projected shortfall in dedicated taxes is in addition to a previously disclosed drop in revenue from taxes on real estate transfers and mortgages. For just the first three months of the year, those taxes were $123 million below the levels written into the authority’s budget.'"
"'09-04-14,'0','“It was important to us that people who had tickets for this game would be able to come on Monday or Tuesday,” said Dave Howard, the Mets’ executive vice president for business operations. “Our feeling for the inaugural opener at Citi Field was that you can’t just hope that the weather’s good that day. You want to have that cushion.”On Monday, the Cracker Jack was sweeter. The beer was colder. And, because this is Citi Field, after all, the lobster rolls were fresher. The scoreboard was brighter, too, and when it showed Mets 5, Padres 5 after Wright’s three-run home run sent the Home Run Apple (polished and shiny) a-bobbing in the fifth inning, the fans rumbled and roared, just as they did at the old place. But with Citi Field enclosed — unlike Shea Stadium — the noise lingered longer, and it almost felt — almost — as if baseball were being played indoors.“When you come out of spring, you can’t wait to show your team to your city,” Manuel said. “You’re proud of the guys you have. Obviously, you want them to perform very well in front of the home folks.”Besides a pocket of seats in right-center field, the stands were mostly filled a half-hour before the first pitch. A host of dignitaries, including Gov. David A. Paterson and Commissioner Bud Selig, as well as former Mets like Rusty Staub, Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry, were in attendance. Fans sat patiently through the national anthem, sang by the cast of the Broadway revival “West Side Story,” and as a football-field-size American flag was unfurled in the outfield. They stood and cheered as the Mets’ bullpen door opened and out marched two of the franchise’s iconic players. After throwing out the final pitch at Shea on Sept. 28, Tom Seaver and Mike Piazza left through the center-field gate. They entered Citi Field with their arms locked, chatting and waving on the long, slow walk toward the mound.Nervous he would bounce the pitch, Seaver threw a strike. A few minutes later, at 7:11 p.m., Pelfrey threw a first-pitch strike to Jody Gerut. The next strike he threw landed in the right-field stands, Gerut hooking a 1-1 pitch inside the foul pole for the first regular-season homer at Citi Field.According to the Elias Sports Bureau, Gerut is the first player to lead off a game with a homer in the first game at a new stadium.Maybe they took Seaver out too early.At Shea, the fan who caught Gerut’s homer would have thrown it back. Not here. Too good of a souvenir. The fans unleashed a torrent of boos — even more than descended upon Oliver Perez and Luis Castillo in pregame introductions. At that moment, it was clear the baseball was no longer a sideshow, the way it was last weekend in those exhibitions against Boston. They gave Daniel Murphy, whose drop Sunday led to the Mets’ loss, a mock cheer when he squeezed Chase Headley’s fly in the third; Murphy laughed.If there is anyone not expected to misplay a ball, it is Church, a superior defender. But as Rodriguez, a left-handed hitter, ripped a liner toward him, Church froze, then broke the wrong way.“By the time I got turned around and looked, the ball was already hooking, fading away from me,” he said. The ball clipped off his glove, and Rodriguez reached third. He scored when Feliciano flinched before a full-count pitch to David Eckstein.“A hundred times out of a hundred, I make that play,” Church said. “It’s a bummer in front of a packed house in the new stadium. You want to be part of history.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','President Obama has decided to restore the American Bar Association’s traditional role in vetting judicial nominees. There is a real value in having knowledgeable lawyers who have firsthand experience with the justice system vetting prospective judges.As the A.B.A. resumes this role, a new study suggests that it may have a liberal bias. There is little support for this claim. Indeed, there are signs that the group has been cowed by conservative critics in recent years into approving less-than-qualified nominees. The A.B.A. needs to ensure that its evaluators make assessments based on the nominees’ merits, not on political pressure.The A.B.A. reviewed prospective judges at the White House’s request for decades, until the Bush administration — responding to conservative charges that the group had a liberal bias — stopped asking for its input. The Senate Judiciary Committee continued to seek the A.B.A.’s evaluations.A study by a University of Georgia professor and two other political scientists reviewed those ratings from 1985 to 2008 and found that President Clinton’s nominees were 14 percent more likely than the Republican presidents’ choices to receive a “well qualified” rating.Rather than being a result of bias, this disparity may reflect the degree to which recent Republican presidents put ideology ahead of excellence in selecting judges. Based on the last eight years, it is especially hard to argue that the A.B.A. has been a liberal force on judicial selection. The group regularly gave “well qualified” and “qualified” ratings to some of President George W. Bush’s most deeply flawed nominees.The A.B.A. gave its highest rating to Leslie Southwick, a nominee to the New Orleans-based United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. As a state court judge in Mississippi, Judge Southwick signed on to terrible rulings, including one in favor of a white social worker who was fired for calling a black colleague a “good ole nigger” and one that berated a bisexual woman for having a homosexual relationship and took her child away.'"
"'09-04-14,'0','To the financial community, Mr. Bloomberg’s support is refreshing, and his refusal to hop on an antibusiness bandwagon underscores his understanding of economic realities.But to others, Mr. Bloomberg’s position suggests he is too cozy with his business-class brethren. He also runs the risk of seeming oblivious to the hurts and wants of the typical New Yorker.“When the economy is bad, people are angry, and they look to politicians to mirror that anger, and it creates a problem for Bloomberg because he cannot be an ‘I feel your pain’ candidate,” said Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College. “I think he’s gentler on people in the private sector on whom, in his view, the city is dependent. He just holds his tongue.”The mayor occupies a unique position among politicians, thanks to his entrepreneurial background and his chameleon-like politics. So Mr. Bloomberg — a Democrat turned Republican turned independent who is now running for a third term — has been a regular on national television as a nonpartisan commentator who can talk authoritatively about derivatives, liquidity and foreclosures.Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers last fall, Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly expressed his bullishness about the economy. He says that there is a “crisis of confidence,” yes, but that New York has “a great hand to play.”He has recommended that investors buy shares of General Electric, Saks and Macy’s — all companies with a strong New York City presence. He has brushed aside suggestions that the ratings agencies downplayed the perils of riskier investments, telling an audience of bankers in London in October that investors should bear some responsibility as well.“People are screaming about regulating the rating agencies,” he said. “Let me try to defend the rating agencies just a touch. It’s a little bit unfair to totally blame them.”And, exercising a reflex that he most notably displayed in 2006, when he defended Con Edison’s embattled chief executive, Kevin M. Burke, after a series of blackouts, Mr. Bloomberg has routinely applauded top management. His signature expression of approval is to call an executive a “competent guy.”When asked in September about the A.I.G. bailout, he mentioned that he had talked to Robert B. Willumstad, the company’s former chief executive. “I feel sorry for him,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “He didn’t have a chance to really make a difference. He’s a very competent guy.”When asked last month about the fate of General Motors, Mr. Bloomberg hailed the man helping to shape White House policy, Steven Rattner, an investment banker whose firm, the Quadrangle Group, manages Mr. Bloomberg’s wealth. “One of the people is a friend of mine — Steve Rattner — he’s a phenomenally competent guy.”Mr. Bloomberg has also declined to criticize federal officials who have overseen the markets — not Mr. Paulson, not Mr. Geithner, not Christopher Cox, the much-maligned former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.“I think Tim Geithner is exactly the guy that I would want there,” he said on “Meet the Press” last month. “He’s smart, he is a workaholic, he’s been there, he’s been part of the financial system for a long time, he understands how things work, how markets work, how people react.”Mr. Bloomberg’s views seem all the more striking when measured alongside those of other politicians.During his “Meet the Press” appearance in March, Mr. Bloomberg was flanked by two governors with whom he frequently collaborates on infrastructure issues, Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, a Republican. Both governors denounced the A.I.G. bonuses, while Mr. Bloomberg was far more circumspect.In New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, a Democrat and a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, has proposed raising income taxes on the wealthiest residents, reversing his earlier stance. He also sued Lehman Brothers in March, contending that the firm took fraudulent actions that caused the state’s pension fund to lose $118 million, and accusing top executives, Mr. Fuld included, of a “thirst for profit” and “simple greed.”Such accusations are not Mr. Bloomberg’s style. “You know, the yelling and screaming about the rich, we want the rich from around this country to move here,” he said during his weekly radio program on March 6. “We love the rich people.”He was one of the few politicians who questioned making the names of A.I.G. bonus recipients public, arguing that privacy was paramount. He criticized Congress for being rash in drafting the A.I.G. bonus tax bill, and suggested that members were hypocritical for taking money from the financial industry with one hand while slapping it with the other.“It’s time for Congress to stand up and say what’s right, even if it isn’t popular,” he said. “A lot of them have taken support from the financial industry so they have a little bit difficult time in being totally separate and dispassionate.”Then again, Mr. Bloomberg is hardly unaware of the perception among some that he is out of step with a nervous public. So he occasionally prefaces his comments by saying that he understands the public’s anger over Wall Street bonuses and the like. He has also begun to frame his optimism within the context of his own policies to help small businesses, nonprofit groups and homeowners.“The issue is not, ‘Am I out of sync?’ ” he said during a news conference on Thursday. “The issue is, ‘Am I correct?’ My job — you’re right — is to be optimistic. But it’s also to be accurate and try to do something about it. We’re not just optimistic; we’re trying to create the reason to be optimistic. We’re out there doing things every day.”No one would ever accuse Mr. Bloomberg, who is drawing a token salary of $1 a year, of pursuing public office for personal gain. But Eduardo Castell, who is managing City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.’s mayoral campaign, noted that Mr. Bloomberg had an extra incentive, perhaps, to cheer on the financial services industry, since the fortunes of his own company, Bloomberg L.P., hinge in part on other companies’ staying healthy and subscribing to the firm’s financial data terminals.Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign, called the Thompson campaign’s suggestion “laughable.” He added, “Mike Bloomberg and Bill Thompson clearly have different views of the economy, how to fix it and how to talk about it.”Still, Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a group that represents large corporations, said corporate executives were grateful that Mr. Bloomberg has been calm, confident and unwavering.“He’s somebody everybody calls for advice on how to deal with populist anger and the political ramifications,” she said. “I’m sure privately he’s as critical of some of the misjudgments as everyone else, but what good would it do to have the mayor of the city pile on?”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','BALTIMORE — With just a month to go before the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course here, the bankruptcy of the company that owns the track and the race has unleashed a wave of distress among politicians and the public over whether Maryland could lose its cherished second leg of the Triple Crown.On Monday the General Assembly passed emergency legislation authorizing the state to buy or seize the race course by eminent domain if necessary, declaring the Preakness “a sporting event of historical and cultural importance to the State of Maryland.”The bill, passed on the last day of the General Assembly’s session, also approved the purchase or seizure of the race’s trophy, the Woodlawn Vase; another track, in Laurel, Md.; a training center; and all trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property associated with the Preakness, including the name itself. All are owned by the Magna Entertainment Corporation, a Canadian company that declared bankruptcy in March, and said it expected to sell the property and other assets.Gov. Martin O’Malley, with the backing of legislative leaders and the state attorney general, proposed the legislation last week in an effort to ensure that Pimlico, the Preakness and the economic activity they generate remain in Maryland.“The centuries-old heritage of horse racing and horse breeding is woven deeply into the cultural fabric of Maryland,” Mr. O’Malley, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday, “and we will take advantage of every available tool to ensure it remains.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','WASHINGTON — A company that bought 12 chemical plants from DuPont five years ago has informed the Environmental Protection Agency of numerous violations at the plants and has agreed to spend $240 million to $500 million to correct them, the agency said Monday.The buyer, Invista, a subsidiary of Koch Industries, will also pay $1.7 million in civil penalties to the federal government and to Delaware, South Carolina and Tennessee.Invista reported more than 680 violations of rules related to air and water pollution, hazardous waste and emergency planning.Since 1995, the E.P.A. has offered to reduce or eliminate some penalties for violations if companies discover and report them and take steps to correct them and avoid future violations. Last August it broadened those incentives to encourage new owners to make a “clean start” at recently acquired facilities.Invista said the violations at the plants began before the 2004 purchase and continued afterward.The company, based in Wichita, Kan., makes chemicals and fibers sold to clothing, carpet and automotive businesses. Many of the violations were excess emissions of chemicals that cause smog or acid rain, the agency said; the plants also released toxic chemicals.'"

The new class will also include the poets Jorie Graham and Yusef Komunyakaa, the visual artist Judy Pfaff, the architect Tod Williams and the composers Stephen Hartke, Frederic Rzewski and Augusta Read Thomas. The new members will be inducted in a ceremony next month and will be allowed to serve on academy committees that award prizes, but otherwise they have no official responsibilities. According to The A.P., upon learning in 1999 that he had won a literary prize from the academy, Mr. Price said, “I thought maybe I get discounts at local restaurants.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','A young and healthy astronaut who spends six months in the International Space Station is likely to arrive back on earth with the muscles of an 80-year-old, according to a new analysis.The study, paid for by NASA and published in the April issue of The Journal of Applied Physiology, examined nine American and Russian astronauts who had each spent about six months in the station. They had access to various machines for aerobic and resistance exercise, and crew members kept logs of their exercise time.The researchers measured leg muscle volume with M.R.I. scans and muscle performance with dynamometers before launching, and again when the astronauts returned. They also did before-and-after calf-muscle biopsies.Using logs and videos, the researchers estimated that the astronauts averaged the equivalent of 50 minutes of aerobic activity and 30 minutes of resistance training a day. Clearly, this was not enough: by the time they returned to earth, they had lost an average of 13 percent of muscle mass and 20 to 29 percent in muscle performance.“We get exercise just walking to the water cooler,” said Scott Trappe, a professor of exercise science at Ball State University and the lead author of the study. “Astronauts don’t. Their modes of exercise are O.K., but they need hardware that will provide for much higher intensity.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','Mr. Obama is also allowing telecommunications companies to pursue licensing agreements in Cuba, in an attempt to open up communications there by increasing access to cellphones and satellite television. In a sign that the Cuba issue is a delicate one, the president left it to senior aides to explain his decision.“This is a step to extend a hand to the Cuban people, in support of their desire to determine their own future,” Dan Restrepo, the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the , said in announcing the move. “It’s very important to help open up space, so the Cuban people can work on the kind of grass-roots democracy that is necessary to move Cuba to a better future.”In a sense, the policy shift is an admission that a half-century of American policy aimed at trying to push the Castros out of power has not worked — as the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful lobbying group for Cuban exiles in , conceded last week. Cuba policy experts characterized Mr. Obama’s moves as important humanitarian steps but said they still left open the broader question of how the United States and Cuba plan to engage in the future.The State Department has said it was reviewing American policy toward Cuba, and Mr. Restrepo said the policy was not “frozen in time today” — a suggestion, some Cuba experts said, that the White House is laying a foundation for more far-reaching change.“We really don’t know yet what he’s got in mind for the long term,” said Sarah Stephens of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, which advocates a further loosening of the restrictions. She said the administration may be trying to take “baby steps toward building confidence” by letting the Cuban exile community in Miami, which has traditionally opposed any softening of American policy, get used to the idea.Mr. Obama is also facing pressure from Capitol Hill. The House and the Senate are considering legislation that would lift travel restrictions to Cuba for all Americans, not just those with family in Cuba. And some experts, like Philip Peters, a Cuba specialist and vice president at the Lexington Institute, a policy research center, argue that a president who is willing to engage and ought to be willing to engage Cuba.“This is a narrow set of measures,” Mr. Peters said. “It doesn’t at all get at the issue of broader contact between American society and Cuban society, and it leaves us in kind of an odd situation where one ethnic group has an unlimited right to travel to Cuba and the rest of us are under these cold war regulations.”Those who still support the Bush hard line denounced the decision. The Cuban government charges hefty fees on remittances, and critics like Representatives Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republicans and brothers who are Cuban-Americans, said Mr. Obama was making a “serious mistake” that would effectively put millions of dollars into the hands of the Castro regime.Yet those old animosities are giving way to an emerging interest in dialogue that is working in Mr. Obama’s favor, both in Washington and Florida.In Miami, the conservative old guard could still be found. On Radio, a -language station that often acts as a megaphone for Cuban-American conservatives, Ninoska Pérez Castellón, a popular host, echoed the concerns of the Diaz-Balarts. At Latin Café 2000 in Hialeah, Fla., José Soberón, 71, said he would never consider sending money or visiting the island he left years ago.But such opinions are no longer as dominant, especially among younger Cubans like Virgiro Lopez, 31, who said that while his entire family had left Cuba, he supported Mr. Obama’s plan as a way to “help bring a spirit within the people to fight for themselves.”Francisco J. Hernandez, the president of the Cuban American National Foundation, said the new policy would “help the Cuban people to become protagonists of the changes in Cuba.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','A small group of investors took Bernard L. Madoff to bankruptcy court on Monday, saying the disgraced financier bilked them out of nearly $64 million.A Manhattan judge cleared the way for the newly filed Chapter 7 petition last week by granting a request from the same investors to lift a temporary order barring bankruptcy for Mr. Madoff. They had argued that a bankruptcy case was needed to protect their rights amid a scramble to seize his assets.Mr. Madoff, 70, pleaded guilty last month to federal charges that his secretive investment advisory service was a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme in which he paid longtime clients with money from new ones. He is in jail awaiting a June sentencing for charges that carry a sentence of up to 150 years in prison.Federal authorities have begun forcing Mr. Madoff to forfeit property they say had been paid for by his fraud. In addition, a court-appointed trustee is liquidating assets from his securities firm to help pay claims from thousands of investors.The investors who sought bankruptcy believed it was the best way to make sure “all the property available would go to the victims,” their lawyer, Jonathan Landers, said Monday.Mr. Landers said he expected the bankruptcy court to appoint a second trustee to oversee distribution of his personal assets since Mr. Madoff “can’t conduct his affairs from jail.”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','But he said he had found solace in his den.“Sometimes, when I get a little down,” Justice Thomas said wearily, he goes online. “I look up wonderful speeches, like speeches by Douglas MacArthur, to hear him give without a note that speech at West Point — ‘duty, honor, country.’ How can you not hear those words and not feel strongly about what we have?”He continued: “Or how can you not reminisce about a childhood where you began each day with the Pledge of Allegiance as little kids lined up in the schoolyard and then marched in two by two with a flag and a crucifix in each classroom?”A favorite movie can be a comfort, too.“I have on many occasions or a number of occasions when things were becoming particularly routine gone down to my basement to watch ‘Saving Private Ryan,’ ” he said. “I can’t tell you why that particular movie, except we have it and it’s about something important in our lives — World War II.”The event, on March 31, was devoted to the Bill of Rights, but Justice Thomas did not embrace the document, and he proposed a couple of alternatives.“Today there is much focus on our rights,” Justice Thomas said. “Indeed, I think there is a proliferation of rights.”“I am often surprised by the virtual nobility that seems to be accorded those with grievances,” he said. “Shouldn’t there at least be equal time for our Bill of Obligations and our Bill of Responsibilities?”He gave examples: “It seems that many have come to think that each of us is owed prosperity and a certain standard of living. They’re owed air-conditioning, cars, telephones, televisions.”Those are luxuries, Justice Thomas said.“I have to admit,” he said, “that I’m one of those people that still thinks the dishwasher is a miracle. What a device! And I have to admit that because I think that way, I like to load it. I like to look in and see how the dishes were magically cleaned.”He was asked how his religious faith influenced his work on the court.“I think that it really gives content to the oath that you took,” Justice Thomas said. “You say, ‘So help me God.’ ”“There are some cases that will drive you to your knees,” he added. “In those moments you ask for strength and wisdom to have the right answer and the courage to stand up for it. Beyond that, it would be illegitimate, I think, and a violation of my oath to incorporate my religious beliefs into the decision-making process.”The questions from students were read to Justice Thomas, and the first one seemed to throw him off. “Since the Civil War, what has changed the way Americans view the Constitution the most and why?” an unidentified student asked.Justice Thomas gave a rambling response, touching on the Fourteenth Amendment, the rights of freed slaves, the application of parts of the Bill of Rights to the states and Justice John Marshall Harlan’s dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court decision that endorsed the doctrine of “separate but equal.”“I’m sure there are other things that have happened,” he said, wrapping up his answer. “So I would have to say just off the top of my head the Fourteenth Amendment. And I bet you someone’s going to hear that and say, well, no, it’s the dormant commerce clause or something.”That was a curious aside. Few Americans could name the dormant commerce clause, and it has no obvious connection to how popular views of the Constitution changed after the Civil War.In any event, Justice Thomas seemed a little sensitive to the sort of second-guessing that comes with the territory for those who sit on the Supreme Court.“This job is easy for people who’ve never done it,” he said later. “What I have found in this job is they know more about it than I do, especially if they have the title ‘law professor.’ ”'"
"'09-04-14,'0','WASHINGTON — President Obama vowed Monday to “halt the rise of piracy” off the coast of Africa following the dramatic rescue of an American merchant captain, foreshadowing a longer and potentially more treacherous struggle ahead as he weighs a series of problematic options.In permitting members of the Navy Seals to shoot the pirates holding the captain, Richard Phillips, Mr. Obama navigated a crisis that played out in full view of the world. But policy makers and experts said the precision killing of three Somali pirates with three bullets would certainly prove easier than wiping out the larger threat in the shipping lanes or reversing the instability that makes Somalia a breeding ground for pirates and Islamic terrorists.With the “Black Hawk Down” episode in Somalia still etched in the American consciousness 16 years after two helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed, Mr. Obama and his advisers are wary of becoming deeply involved in the region again. That wariness comes at a time when Mr. Obama is already trying to end a war in Iraq and win another in Afghanistan. White House officials on Monday played down suggestions that the United States could attack pirate bases on shore, portraying that as premature at best.Other options that the administration has before it, according to experts, are deploying more ships to patrol the region, pressing commercial shipping companies to stop paying ransoms and to do more to defend their vessels, get other nations to help capture pirates and bring them to justice, and doing more to build up a fledgling transitional government in Somalia.“All I can tell you is I am confident we will be spending a lot of time in the Situation Room over the next few weeks trying to figure out what in the world to do about this problem,” Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates told students and faculty members at the Marine Corps War College in Quantico, Va., according to a military news service. While the national security team discusses the long-term challenge, the Justice Department said it was deliberating whether to try the lone surviving pirate in the United States or to turn him over to Kenya for trial. Mr. Gates said the four pirates were 17 to 19 years old, but he did not give the age of the one who surrendered to Navy sailors before the fatal shootout Sunday.'"
"'09-04-14,'0','“The market is cheering, not so much that the banks are on the mend, but that they are not going to die,” said Les Satlow, portfolio manager of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Mass. “These are banks that are clawing their way back, literally from the brink of extinction. My view is that a key crisis phase of this economic downturn is behind us.”The Dow Jones industrial average fell 25.57 points, or 0.32 percent, to 8,057.81. The S.& P. 500-stock index gained 2.17 points, or 0.25 percent, to 858.73. The Nasdaq rose just 0.77 of a point, or 0.05 percent, to 1,653.31.The banking sector’s health has been a major worry since fallout from the financial crisis led the federal government to pump billions of dollars into institutions like Citigroup, which surprised Wall Street last month when it said it was profitable in January and February.That optimism has fed a monthlong recovery of the stock market from 12-year lows hit in early March. Since setting a bear market closing low on March 9, the S.& P. 500 has risen 27 percent.On Nasdaq, the bright spot was Express Scripts, up 15.5 percent at $56.81, after the company agreed to buy WellPoint’s NextRx subsidiaries for $4.68 billion.A brokerage raised its 2009 profit view for Wal-Mart, which lifted its stock 1.7 percent, to $51.53.But Boeing finished the day as the Dow’s biggest drag after the aircraft maker’s gloomy outlook. The stock tumbled 5.1 percent to $37.15.The prospect of bankruptcy for G.M. was another negative weight after the Treasury Department directed the struggling automaker to prepare for a bankruptcy filing by June 1 despite the company’s contention that it could reorganize outside court. G.M. slid 16.2 percent to $1.71.Interest rates were lower. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 17/32, to 99 2/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.86 percent, down from 2.92 percent late Thursday.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auctions of three- and six-month bills:'"
"'09-04-14,'0','China has in fact made substantial progress improving many social and legal protections over the past 20 years, Chinese and Western rights experts say. International right advocates also applauded Beijing officials for showing an interest in the issue with the action plan.But they cautioned that any implementation would require many years of work by local, provincial and national government agencies, many of which have shown little interest in initiatives that may limit their power.“It’s a step forward, I think; it’s also good there are some concrete benchmarks with 2010 as a deadline,” said Roseann Rife, the deputy program director for Asia and the Pacific at Amnesty International. Nevertheless, she said, “there are very serious abuses omitted from the plan.”Lawyers and others in China have been increasingly assertive in recent years regarding rights already promised under China’s Constitution. The release of the action plan could help these individuals by providing clearer guidance to local and provincial governments of the long-term direction of national policy.The official Xinhua news agency said, “The government admitted that ‘China has a long road ahead in its efforts to improve its human rights situation.’ ”But, as Ms. Rife indicated, the document fails to address some of the most glaring abuses for people who challenge the authorities in China. It does not propose phasing out the system of administrative detention, which gives broad powers to local law enforcement officials, including the ability to send people to prison camps for “re-education through labor” without a trial.There is also no promise to close the unregistered jails that municipal and provincial governments have set up in Beijing and elsewhere to detain petitioners who want to present their grievances.The “National Human Rights Action Plan of China 2009-2010” emphasizes economic and social rights instead.In some cases, the plan is quite specific about promises that may depend more on the health of the Chinese economy and even the global economy than on the efforts of human rights activists.There is a promise, for example, that unemployment will remain below 5 percent in 2009 and 2010 for urban residents who remain in the communities in which they are registered to live and do not try to migrate in search of better jobs. The plan does call for China to go considerably further in areas where it has begun making changes, like in releasing more information about decision-making and to extend to the countryside policies that so far have mainly benefited cities.'"

"'09-04-15,'1','Given the restructuring of the financial services industry, there is a “need to reconsider the original plan for 10 million square feet of office space at ground zero,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. The two sides are reluctant to discuss the details of negotiations because of confidentiality agreements. But executives who have spoken to both parties outlined their positions.Mr. Silverstein, who has received more than $150 million in development fees already, wants to push forward with at least two of the towers and reconfigure an agreement with the Port Authority. He has offered a characteristically optimistic view of New York’s rebound, saying there will always be companies willing to pay top dollar for new, modern buildings.Unable to finance the buildings himself, Mr. Silverstein wants the Port Authority to do it, a move that could cost $3 billion and a sizable portion of its capital budget. At the same time, Mr. Silverstein has pressed the state and the city, which agreed in 2006 to occupy a portion of the first of his towers, to pay a premium rent for space that would otherwise be unoccupied.Two weeks ago, according to executives on both sides, Port Authority officials offered a counterproposal: it would provide $800 million in financing for only the first tower, a 64-story, 2.3 million-square-foot building on Church Street, between Cortlandt and Liberty Streets. In keeping with the original agreement, the Port Authority would move its headquarters there, but pay a substantially higher rent.In return, Mr. Silverstein would have to invest his fees in the project, while providing the Port Authority with a financial stake in the building.Rather than flooding the downtown market with what it believes would be unneeded office space, the Port Authority has proposed delaying construction of the second, even larger tower until 2022 and the third until 2030.“We have to deal with the economic reality today,” said Christopher O. Ward, the authority’s executive director. “That starts with keeping the memorial and the other public infrastructure on the timeline and budget we’ve committed to.”Still, the authority says it would build the underground portions and the first few floors of the other two towers, because they contain ventilation systems, entryways and emergency exits for the transit center and the memorial. Mr. Silverstein, however, has argued that the authority’s proposal would leave much of the site unfinished and perhaps unoccupied. He also contends that it would be impractical, if not impossible, to build the first few floors of the second two towers and complete them later.“In 2006, all of the stakeholders — the city, the state, the Port and Silverstein — agreed that the best interests of both the city and downtown would be served by finishing the entire site simultaneously and as quickly as possible,” said Janno Lieber, who oversees the trade center project for Silverstein Properties. “One building surrounded by three half-finished blocks for the next 20 years does not make good on promises made to New Yorkers.”The recession and the collapse of the credit markets have taken a toll on the commercial market, as some banks fold or consolidate. Brokers predict that the vacancy rate in downtown office buildings will climb to 16 percent, from 11.7 percent today. JPMorgan Chase has quietly abandoned its plan to build a new headquarters for its investment banking division near ground zero.“The market doesn’t need seven million square feet of space and it’s not going to need it for a while,” said Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark Knight Frank, a real estate brokerage firm.The Bloomberg administration has remained neutral so far as to whether Mr. Silverstein should build one or two towers in the next couple of years. Mr. Silverstein is not without leverage. He can insist on adhering to the current development agreement. So far, the Port Authority has paid nearly $90 million in penalties for failing to turn over Mr. Silverstein’s construction sites in a timely manner. If the impasse continues, it could jeopardize the authority’s promise to open the memorial in 2011.“What Larry did is take out all his equity at the beginning, so he really doesn’t have a lot of skin in the game,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said last month. “He has an enormous amount of upside potential, which doesn’t leave the Port Authority with a lot of negotiating ability, because they’re the ones who have to put up the money.”Mr. Silverstein has about $964 million left from an original $4.5 billion pool of insurance proceeds, paid to cover his losses from the destruction of the two original World Trade Center towers.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','Mr. Wissman was also a managing director for HFV Asset Management, which manages money for the Hunts, the wealthy Texas oil family that owns the Kansas City Chiefs football team. An investment fund managed by HFV has been mentioned in court filings related to the investigation, but the Hunts themselves have not been implicated in the case.The records unsealed on Tuesday revealed that Mr. Wissman pleaded guilty March 31 to a felony securities fraud charge and a related misdemeanor, both under the Martin Act, a state securities law that gives the attorney general broad prosecutorial powers.“From 2004 to 2007, Mr. Wissman acted as a finder in connection with certain investments that were presented to the New York State Common Retirement Fund,” said William A. Brewer III, a lawyer for Mr. Wissman, in a statement. “Mr. Wissman acknowledges that he has pled guilty to Martin Act violations. He takes full responsibility for his conduct and is cooperating in the ongoing investigation by the New York attorney general’s office. As such, he declines to make any further statement.”A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo’s office had no comment Tuesday.Last month, Mr. Cuomo’s office brought a 123-count indictment against two aides to the former state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, accusing them of selling access to the state’s $122 billion pension fund and reaping millions of dollars for themselves. The two aides are Hank Morris, who was Mr. Hevesi’s top political consultant, and David Loglisci, who was the chief investment officer of the pension fund.The S.E.C. brought a parallel action against the two aides, accusing them of violating several securities laws. Lawyers for Mr. Morris and Mr. Loglisci have adamantly denied wrongdoing on the part of their clients.One of the steps Mr. Wissman took to curry favor was investing $100,000 in a film called “Chooch” that was produced by Mr. Loglisci, according to court filings.Mr. Hevesi resigned in late 2006 after pleading guilty to an unrelated felony.The Carlyle Group had no immediate comment on Mr. Wissman’s role in the case. Carlyle manages $1.5 billion of the state’s pension assets.On Monday, Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for the firm, said Carlyle was cooperating fully in what it called “an industrywide investigation” and had done nothing improper.Mr. Wissman’s involvement with Carlyle began because he was longtime friends with Mr. Loglisci, who was himself a friend of a top Riverstone executive, David Leuschen, according to court filings and people with knowledge of the investigation. Riverstone, which operated the energy investment fund along with Carlyle, denied any wrongdoing in a statement Monday.Mr. Wissman is described as having played a major role in encouraging the state pension fund to expand into hedge funds. The S.E.C. complaint brought against the Hevesi aides last month said that a hedge fund manager affiliated with HFV, then identified only as “Individual A,” paid Mr. Morris “in exchange for causing the Retirement Fund to expand its investment portfolio to include hedge funds” and to make the Hunt fund one of the first to attract state money.The latest court filings make clear that “Individual A” is Mr. Wissman.Mr. Wissman’s guilty plea is specifically related to his role in facilitating pension investments for Access Capital, a European company that markets a so-called fund of funds — an investment fund that invests in a variety of private equity firms.According to new court filings released on Tuesday, Mr. Wissman helped Access win more than $500 million worth of business from the New York State pension fund and was rewarded with $1.5 million in fees. But according to the felony complaint, he misrepresented to Access how he was getting the business.While he told the company he would not share his fees with a third party, he did just that, court records say. He was paid $2.4 million and “then secretly transmitted approximately 33 percent of that amount, more than $790,000” to two firms affiliated with Mr. Morris, according to the S.E.C. complaint.According to the court records unsealed Tuesday, Mr. Wissman “engaged in fraud, deception, concealment” and “made material false representations and statements with intent to deceive and defraud.”'"
"'09-04-15,'1','According to court papers unsealed in Manhattan on Tuesday, a central hedge fund executive has pleaded guilty to securities fraud and is cooperating with a state investigation of corruption at the state pension fund.Among the firms whose activities are being scrutinized is the Carlyle Group, one of the nation’s largest private equity firms. A string of other scandals, capped by the Ponzi scheme of Bernard L. Madoff, only adds to the worries at pension funds.Three years ago, the New Jersey state employees pension fund led the pack as an early, and enthusiastic, investor in hedge funds. Now, facing losses of $800 million, it is shying away. New Jersey has stopped putting more money into hedge funds, after its $4 billion investment shrank to under $3.25 billion. And, like many other public pension funds, it is beginning to rethink its relationship with hedge funds, and taking a harder look at all alternative investments that did not live up to their billing.“Clearly, it did not work out as well as we had hoped, and expected,” said William Clark, director of the New Jersey Division of Investment. “You cannot deny that as a general asset class, it didn’t deliver what investors were led to believe.”Many public employees — teachers, police officers and the like — may not even realize that part of their nest eggs are tied to hedge funds and corporate buyouts.In 2005, just 13 percent of all public pension funds invested in hedge funds. By 2008, 40 percent did so, having a combined $78 billion invested in such funds. About half now invest in private-equity funds.While such alternative investments, as they are known, account for a small fraction of public funds’ total portfolios, the hope was that they would generate outsize returns. But now the hedge fund industry is in the throes of an unprecedented shakeout. And private equity funds are struggling to make deals, and profits, now that the easy money that powered their business has evaporated.The good news for New Jersey, such as it is, is that its stock portfolio did even worse than its investments in 35 hedge funds. But that has not stopped the state, and public pension funds across the country, from beginning to slow what had been a headlong rush into hedge fund investments and begin to drive a harder bargain with hedge fund managers on a number of fronts.Public pension funds feel they may have some luck in gaining concessions on fees and greater view into often-secretive hedge fund operations.No less an industry leader that the California public pension plan known as Calpers, the nation’s largest, is heading an effort to reduce hedge fund fees and change the terms of its hedge fund investments. This comes after Calpers saw its hedge fund investments fall to $5.9 billion from a high of $7.6 billion.In addition, since beginning to invest in hedge funds in 2002, Calpers has experienced a modest 3.5 percent annual rate of return, far less than the market-beating returns that hedge fund managers had promised.“We don’t want to pay for failure,” said Clark McKinley, a spokesman for Calpers.Specifically, Calpers wants its hedge fund fees to be performance based, ending an arrangement where hedge fund managers could collect hefty fees regardless of whether the funds made or lost money. Calpers wants to segregate its money from that of other investors and have it individually managed, and it wants more timely information and greater transparency into the funds’ investments.Mr. McKinley said that, so far, none of the hedge fund managers doing business with Calpers have declined to consider Calpers’ demands. “They are willing to talk,” he said.While very few public pension funds invested with Mr. Madoff, the fallout from his Ponzi scheme has caused many public pension fund managers to ask for more detailed information on hedge fund operations. As a result, “many of these investors are running for the hills,” said Larry Powell, deputy chief investment officer for the $16 billion Utah Retirement System, which is trying to galvanize other public pensions to press for better terms with hedge funds.Mr. Powell said that he has already gotten better terms with 10 of the 40 hedge funds that Utah does business with.“There are too many hedge funds out there collecting fees that far exceed their operating expenses,” Mr. Powell said. The Utah fund is in the process of renegotiating fees with hedge fund managers.In New Jersey, there is a lively internal debate about the way forward. Critics, like Jim Marketti, a union representative on the State Investment Council, said that the state fund ignored the unions’ pleas over the last few years to move cautiously as it diversified into hedge funds. “If we had invested in the mattress, we would have done better,” Mr. Marketti said.Much of New Jersey’s foray into hedge funds came as Orin Kramer, a hedge fund manager, became chairman of the New Jersey funds’ oversight board. While New Jersey does not invest in Mr. Kramer’s fund, he remains a defender of these investments, saying that they still did better than the stock market.“You’ve got a mindset which assumes that major auto companies or banks or home-building companies, which lost 90 percent of their value, are appropriate investments,” Mr. Kramer said. “But even in 2008, hedge funds reduced volatility and were better places to be than these stocks.”Some experts, however, believe that the hedge funds, now more chastened, are not in any position to resist pressure from big pension funds.“Hedge funds are going to have to incorporate pension fund concerns if they want to be anything but fringe players,” said Edward A. H. Siedle, president of Benchmark Financial Services.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked city investigators to examine a series of questions that have arisen over the past month regarding the conduct of the city’s finance commissioner, Martha Stark.In recent weeks, Ms. Stark has attracted scrutiny for employing a parking judge whose method of billing for hours worked was questioned by city investigators; for working outside the city on the board of a national real estate company; and for potential conflicts created by her relationship with a former subordinate.“We’re asking the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board to look into these allegations,” Mr. Bloomberg said at a press conference on Tuesday. “Given that Martha Stark runs an incredibly vital city agency, we’re asking the board and the Department of Investigation to do this work as quickly as possible while still doing a thorough and complete job.”This week, it surfaced that Ms. Stark is dating a former assistant commissioner, Dara Ottley-Brown, and, in addition, that she has employed relatives including her late brother’s stepson, her half-brother and a niece.The City Charter bars employees from using their positions to benefit associated persons, who are defined by the charter as a spouse, parent, child, sibling, registered domestic partner or someone with whom the employee has a business or financial relationship.Last month, Ms. Stark resigned from the Tarragon Corporation after it was revealed she was paid $90,000 for her work on its board of directors in 2007. She also has faced questioning about her decision to retain a parking judge who filled out time sheets for office work when he was not in the office.'"

The Cowboys host the Carolina Panthers the next Monday night, in Week 3.The Giants have five appearances scheduled in prime time, including a Sunday night matchup with the defending National Football Conference champion Arizona Cardinals on Oct. 25 at Giants Stadium. The Giants open the season at home — their final season at Giants Stadium — against the Washington Redskins, the same team they played to open the 2008 season.They then go on a three-game trip — their longest in 15 years — and will play four of their first six games on the road. When the Giants won the Super Bowl two seasons ago, they were superb on the road, giving them hope that the unusual schedule will not put them in an early hole.“Two years ago, we talked about how we were the road warriors,” Coach Tom Coughlin said in a statement. “We are going to have to be road warriors again, without a doubt.”The Pittsburgh Steelers, the Super Bowl champions, are also scheduled for five prime-time games (so are the Cowboys and the Indianapolis Colts), including the Thursday night season opener against the Tennessee Titans, a Sunday night game against the San Diego Chargers (Oct. 4) and a Sunday night game (Nov. 29) against the Baltimore Ravens, whom they beat in the American Football Conference championship game last season.'"

Liverpool took a 4-3 lead on goals by Lucas Leiva in the 81st and Dirk Kuyt in the 83rd, putting the Reds a goal from victory in the series, but Lampard’s second goal sealed it for the Blues.Both teams were missing their captains: Chelsea defender John Terry was suspended, and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard was out with a groin-muscle injury.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','People with Type 2 diabetes may be at increased risk for developing dementia as they age, several studies have suggested. Now researchers say the higher odds may be linked to life-threatening drops in blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, usually caused by excess insulin.A long-term study of thousands of older patients with Type 2 diabetes in Northern California found that those who had experienced even one episode of hypoglycemia serious enough to send them to a hospital were at higher risk for developing dementia than diabetic patients who had not experienced such an episode. With each additional episode, the risk of developing dementia increased, the study found.The findings, to be published on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are significant given the high rates of Type 2 diabetes around the world, and the expectation that dementia rates will increase as the population ages.“We’ve known for some time that patients with Type 2 diabetes are at greater risk of dementia and cognitive problems,” said Rachel A. Whitmer of the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., one of the authors. “This adds to the evidence that balance of glycemic control is important, and that trying to aim for a very low glycemic target might not be beneficial and might even be harmful.”The study found that the risk of dementia among patients who had experienced a single episode of hypoglycemia that required hospitalization was 26 percent higher than the risk for patients who had never had an episode.Patients who had experienced two episodes faced an increased risk of 80 percent, while those who had experienced three episodes or more had a 94 percent increase in risk, or almost double the odds of developing dementia.“To see an effect after just one episode is remarkable,” said Dr. Alan M. Jacobson, a researcher at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. An earlier study of Type 1 diabetes and dementia found no connection, Dr. Jacobson noted.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','There have been two recent reminders of the cost of extremism. In , President signed a law that effectively sanctions marital . In , a video surfaced of the in the publicly flogging a young woman screaming for mercy. Pakistan’s government compounded the indignity on Monday by giving in to Taliban demands and formally imposing on the region.Such behavior would be intolerable anywhere. But the is heavily invested in both countries, fighting and the Taliban and financing multibillion-dollar military and development programs. The cases represent an officially sanctioned brutality that violates American values and international human rights norms. They also sabotage chances of building stable healthy societies in Pakistan and Afghanistan.In Afghanistan, particularly venal politics are at work. Mr. Karzai, whose popular support plummeted because of government ineptitude and corruption, is running for re-election in August. The new law, which affects family matters for the Shiite minority, seems a bald, particularly creepy, pander.It says of Shiite women: Unless she is ill, “a wife is obliged to fulfill the sexual desires of her husband.” That is licensed coercion.If let stand, we fear such rules — reminiscent of decrees issued when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan in the 1990s — could also have a negative impact on laws affecting the majority Sunni population. Instead of defending the law as he did, Mr. Karzai must ensure that it is rewritten to reflect principles of freedom and dignity for women.In Pakistan, the video of the woman’s flogging proves the bankrupt nature of the army’s strategy. Failing to defeat the Taliban on the battlefield, the army tried to appease them with a peace deal in February. It ceded the insurgents control of Swat, 100 miles from Islamabad, and allowed free rein for their repressive ways. The woman was beaten after declining a Taliban fighter’s marriage proposal, the head of the Peshawar Bar Association told reporters.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','DENVER — Western states that were among the first to feel the pain of the housing bubble’s collapse, especially Arizona, California and Nevada, continued to lead the nation’s downward spiral, as measured by falling state tax collections in the last three months of 2008, according to an analysis of state budgets released Tuesday.The report, by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, did not conclude that the recession was vastly worse in the West: indeed, of the 10 states that out-performed the national economy from October through December, all were west of the Mississippi River, led by the energy-producing economies of Alaska and Wyoming.But the sharp declines in tax revenue that are bedeviling governors and legislatures all over the country — the steepest fall-off in 50 years — clearly hit much of the West early and hard, the study said. Utah, for example, where construction-related employment has been battered, had the sharpest decline in personal income tax collections in the nation in the last quarter of 2008, down 18.5 percent from the same period in 2007.Sales tax collections, the budgetary lifeblood of states like tourism-dependent Nevada, also declined faster or sooner in the West than elsewhere in the country, as fewer homes were bought and furnished and fewer people felt free to unleash their wallets in Las Vegas.The sober-sided Plains States, by contrast — Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and North Dakota — which did not experience dizzying swoops in home prices, held relatively steady in sales and personal income taxes in the fourth quarter.The study said that preliminary indicators for the first few months of 2009 suggested that state budget stress was spreading geographically, with consumers continuing to cut back on purchases — thus hurting sales tax collections — and taxpayers reporting declines in capital gains and interest income that could compound budget troubles in states like Connecticut, New Jersey and New York that have lots of affluent families.'"

"'09-04-15,'1','MIAMI — Florida travel agencies that book trips to Cuba gained a victory Tuesday when a federal district judge here overturned a state law that required them to post a bond of $250,000 each.The judge, Alan S. Gold, said the law was in direct conflict with the federal government’s authority to set foreign policy.“The State of Florida,” Judge Gold’s decision said, “is not entitled to adopt a foreign policy under our Constitution or interfere with the exclusive prerogative of the United States to establish a carefully balanced approach to relations with foreign countries, including Cuba.”The decision coincides with the Obama administration’s move to ease restrictions on Cuban-Americans’ travel to the island.Enacted last year, the law never took effect. It was challenged by a group of travel agents who said the requirement would force them to raise prices and could drive them out of business. The plaintiffs obtained an injunction barring enforcement of the statute while it was under review.Proponents of the measure describe it as valuable antiterrorism legislation, and note that it required the bond of Florida travel agencies that provided direct flights to any country on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','He is a live wire, 5 feet 11 inches of crackling tension. MacKenzie’s idea of letting off steam is edging off 50-foot craggy cliffs or capsizing in his kayak on rushing rivers. After all the stressful experiences he has put his body through, it would seem that a bunker shot from a plugged lie or a 6-foot putt to survive the cut must not even trigger his heart rate.“I think I feel more stress on the golf course than I do when I was edging off cliffs,” MacKenzie said. “My mind was almost more at ease when I was going to do something crazy on a mountain or river. I think that those sports were more risky in terms of I could get injured physically. Golf just injures you mentally.” He added, “The trouble I have with golf is the walk in between the golf shots. There’s way too much thinking.”MacKenzie was 19 when he packed up his car in Greenville, N.C., his hometown, pocketed $100, the sum of his savings, and pulled out of his family’s driveway. He was headed toward the open road, veering far from the career path in golf that had seemed his destiny when he was a child.“What we realized at a real, real young age was Will had a nice rhythm and tempo,” Ken, the oldest of four MacKenzie brothers, said in telephone interview, adding, “He was just an exceptional athlete.”MacKenzie picked up golf trophies as easily as other children did colds. But he grew sick of the game’s demands. The summer circuit of tournaments cut into the time MacKenzie was able to spend playing other sports or staying at his family’s second home on the Pamlico River near Bath Creek, where he liked to sail and water ski and fish.When MacKenzie was 14, he blew a lead and lost an American Junior Golf Association event, and put away his clubs. “I was already really frustrated,” he said. “It was like: ‘Wow. This takes up too much time.’ ”In his last two years of high school at J. H. Rose in Greenville, MacKenzie played soccer and won the job as the kicker for the football team. Ken remembered Will, the second-youngest brother, making a game-winning 48-yard field goal in the driving rain.In the fall of his senior year, MacKenzie sat down with the football coach at East Carolina University, Steve Logan, who invited him to walk on to the team and compete for the starting job. Logan, who recently left Boston College to become the running backs coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, remembered the meeting.“He was the skinny, long-haired kicker,” he said in a telephone interview. “I told him if he wanted to clean up a little bit, he could come in and give it a whirl.”MacKenzie’s spirit was willing but his academics were weak. He raised his grades for a semester but soon fell back in with his surfing buddies, who liked to cut classes to catch waves. His grades kept him from considering East Carolina. “In hindsight,” MacKenzie said, “I wish I would have gone to East Carolina for a year and seen what happened.”He attended Lees-McRae, a small liberal arts college near home, but dropped out after a year. The finances of his father, Raymond, had experienced a downturn, and MacKenzie did not want to be a burden. “I thought: I can be more natural,” he said. “I don’t need all this stuff.”In 1994, he embarked on his extreme sports adventure, with the reluctant blessing of his mother, Ruggie. “I’m an educator,” she said by telephone. “Daddy was a dreamer. Will’s a lot like his dad.”After stops in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado, MacKenzie arrived in Big Sky, Mont., and set his minivan’s parking brake. For the next four years he slept in a down bag in the back seat and spent his days snowboarding, kayaking, rock climbing and fishing.To pay for his fun, he worked part time as a dishwasher at the Huntley Lodge and later as a dishwasher and line cook at Allgood’s Bar & Grill.“He was an interesting fellow,” Dick Allgood, the owner of the restaurant, said in a telephone interview. “Just a lot freer than others. I guess that’s the best way to put it.” He added, “He could wake up one day next year and decide to go hang gliding for the rest of his life.”In 1999, after a heli-boarding excursion to Alaska and a three-month surfing expedition to Costa Rica, MacKenzie returned to North Carolina. He watched the United States Open telecast with his parents and was so inspired by Payne Stewart’s victory over Phil Mickelson at Pinehurst, two hours from Greenville, he dug his clubs out of the garage.“I can see him right now on the back porch saying, ‘I want to get back into golf,’ ” his mother said. “Of course, his daddy was thrilled.”MacKenzie turned pro in 2000 and played the minitours in North Carolina and Florida. In 2002 his father died of complications from the flu. He was 59. “It’s so doggone sad that my dad’s not here to watch my career,” MacKenzie said. “When I started playing again, he was the only one who believed in me.”After experiencing success on the minor tours, MacKenzie joined the PGA Tour in 2005 after making it through qualifying school. In 2006, he won the Reno-Tahoe Open and last September he added the Viking Classic in Mississippi. His game is solid, but he has a hard time keeping his mind uncluttered, which explains the 47 missed cuts in 105 events in his first four seasons.At the Tour stop in Memphis in 2005, MacKenzie met Alli Spencer. Her first impression was that he seemed normal enough. His unconventional side, like a Polaroid, came into focus gradually during their two-year courtship.The picture became clear when they visited Montana and one of his friends informed her that MacKenzie had been the stinkiest of the stinky hippies. Alli could not say she was surprised. “I have to remind him to brush his teeth,” she said.The couple married in 2007. The arrival last July of a son completed and complicated their lives. To cut down on commercial airline travel with a toddler, which can be exhausting, Alli recently suggested they buy a recreational vehicle — a deluxe model with satellite TV and granite floors and a king-size bed — and drive it from tournament to tournament.She considers it the perfect marriage of practicality and adventure, but despite the upgrade from his previous home on wheels, MacKenzie put the brakes to the idea. “I wish I could make enough money,” he said, wistfully, “that I could buy private jet hours.”'"
"'09-04-15,'1','President Obama has done well with his first judicial nomination — David Hamilton, a well-respected federal district court judge in Indiana — for the Chicago-based United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. After eight years of Bush nominees, many of whom had thin credentials and far-right ideological agendas, the selection of Judge Hamilton is good news indeed. The Senate should confirm him quickly.Judge Hamilton has a long and distinguished record as a lawyer in private practice and as a jurist. His rulings appear to be guided by an honest belief in applying the law fairly and in providing a fair hearing to victims of injustice. That is no small point these days.Conservative judges have been on a campaign to close the courthouse door to plaintiffs through the overly aggressive use of a variety of legal doctrines. Among them is “pre-emption,” which holds that federal law sometimes invalidates the state laws under which people often sue. Last year, Judge Hamilton delivered a well-reasoned rejection of a major drug company’s claim that a wrongful-death lawsuit was pre-empted by federal law.Judge Hamilton has also stood up for little-guy plaintiffs when the law is on their side. Last year, he ruled in favor of an employee of an assisted-living center who claimed that she was fired after she refused to hide documents from state investigators. Although, like most employees, she could normally be fired without cause, Judge Hamilton ruled that her refusal to interfere with a health investigation put her in a protected category.Judge Hamilton has strong support not only from Democrats in his state but also from Richard Lugar, Indiana’s Republican senator. That makes it highly unlikely that Republicans will be able to block the nomination, but it does not mean that they are welcoming it. Conservative activists have been groundlessly attacking Judge Hamilton as a “judicial activist,” objecting to rulings on abortion and public prayer. Republican senators boycotted his Judiciary Committee hearing, insisting that the nomination was moving forward too quickly.Senate Republicans have already begun threatening to filibuster judicial nominees who do not meet with their approval. Mr. Obama will no doubt need to stand up to them to get some of his more controversial nominees through. Judge Hamilton is one that senators of both parties should be able to rally around.'"

"'09-04-15,'1','Intel reported net income a share, excluding one-time charges, of 8 cents, beating the consensus Wall Street estimate of 2 cents a share. The analysis consensus was that Intel would report revenue of $6.98 billion.Intel said it was not confident enough in the state of the economy to provide a revenue estimate for its second quarter. But it said that “for internal purposes” it was planning for flat revenue in the second quarter.Wall Street analysts had hoped for a rosier outlook. After its earnings announcement, Intel’s shares fell in after-hours trading Tuesday by 5.4 percent, to $15.14. It had closed Tuesday at $16.01, up 3 cents. Intel’s stock has had a mini-rally over the last month, rising from about $13.One area of the computer business that has been relatively strong has been the sale of low-cost, Internet-centric machines the industry calls mini-notebooks or netbooks. But Intel had a sharp drop in the quarter for sales of its Atom processor, a chip that powers some of these devices. The first-quarter sales of $219 million were down 27 percent from the fourth quarter of last year.Intel attributed the drop to computer makers’ using their excess inventory of chips. The company expects demand to return as those inventories grow leaner.Intel’s gross profit margins of 45.6 percent were several percentage points above what analysts had expected, but a number that was decidedly low by its historical standards.In the previous quarter, gross margins were 53 percent; they were 59 percent in the third quarter.Gross margins have not been this low since the third quarter of 2001, when they hit 46 percent, Edwin Mok, an analyst with Needham & Company, said. Intel forecast that margins would remain in the mid-40s in the current quarter.“This might be a little disappointing for the street,” Mr. Mok said.Mr. Yeung drew a distinction between the tepid reaction of the stock, which in Intel’s case tends to trade on projections of its gross margins, and the positive outlook that the computer market appeared to have hit a bottom.Citi projects, for instance, that the number of notebooks built in the second quarter will increase 10 to 15 percent from the first quarter. Netbook shipments are expected to grow 15 to 20 percent in the current quarter, and shipments of desktops are expected to be flat or down 5 percent.But Mr. Yeung said the market had a long way to go. He said that demand for computers was as far from average historical demand as it had been in more than a decade.“Fundamentally, business has been getting better since the beginning of February,” he said. But “it’s not like it’s going gangbusters.”'"
"'09-04-15,'1','RIGHT now my kitchen is teeming with bacteria, and I’m doing everything I can to make them feel at home. They’re lactic acid bacteria, the ones that ferment milk into yogurt and buttermilk, cream into crème fraîche. I’ve been making all of these, as well as milk thickened with reputedly beneficial “probiotic” lactic acid bacteria. And getting to know viili, a Finnish fermented milk that reminds me of the Japanese soy product natto. It’s slithery.I’ve made my own yogurt nearly every week for more than 10 years, beginning with a starter given to me by a friend from yogurt-loving India, and using the last spoonfuls of one batch to make the next. It’s a satisfying ritual of continuity and caretaking. And the yogurt is less expensive and better than anything I can buy. It’s free of stabilizers, sweeteners and waterlogged fruit, and it’s fresh tasting and tart, not sour. I start every day with a bowl of it.Even if cultured dairy products aren’t part of your daily regimen, they’re worth making once in a while just to know how good they can be, and to experience the everyday miracle of fermentation. You stir a little starter into warm milk or cream, let it sit, and in a few hours the bacteria have multiplied a hundredfold and created a tart, aromatic, thickened mass, with many billions of bacteria in every spoonful.A growing number of studies have found that some lactic acid bacteria do seem to offer health benefits, supporting the lore of traditional dairying cultures. The lactic acid bacteria are a group of microbes that share the ability to convert sugars into lactic acid, which suppresses the growth of their competitors. The lactic acid also causes the proteins and fat globules in milk to cluster into a continuous solid network, with the milk’s water trapped in its pores.The protein-fat network is fragile  it’s holding 25 times its weight in liquid  so the watery whey gradually leaks from it. This is why whey pools up in the yogurt container after you scoop out the first spoonful, and why manufacturers add stabilizers.Much less whey drains out of yogurt made from certain strains of lactic acid bacteria that can convert sugars into long starch-like molecules. These exopolysaccharides, or EPS, bind to the water and one another and make the whey less runny, thicker and more clingy.EPS producers are the bacteria that dominate in Finnish viili, which is so clingy that you can stretch it a foot or more between bowl and lifted spoon. You eat viili by cutting it into pieces.To make yogurt, first choose your starter yogurt. If no one offers you an heirloom, I recommend one of the ubiquitous global brands, sweeteners and stabilizers included. They tend to have very active bacterial cultures, including EPS producers, and the additives end up diluted to insignificant levels. Delicious specialty yogurts make less predictable starters.Then choose your milk. I prefer the flavor and consistency of yogurt made from whole milk. Many types of reduced-fat milk replace the fat with milk solids, including acid-producing lactose, and make a harsher tasting yogurt. Soy milk sets into a custardy curd that becomes very thin when stirred.Heat the fresh milk at 180 to 190 degrees, or to the point that it’s steaming and beginning to form bubbles. The heat alters the milk’s whey proteins and helps create a finer, denser consistency.Let the milk cool to around 115 to 120 degrees, somewhere between very warm and hot. For each quart of milk, stir in two tablespoons of yogurt, either store-bought or from your last batch, thinning it first with a little of the milk.Then put the milk in a warm jar or container or an insulated bottle, cover it, and keep the milk still and warm until it sets, usually in about four hours. I simply swaddle my quart jar in several kitchen towels. You can also put the container in an oven with the light bulb on.Once the yogurt sets, refrigerate it to firm its structure and slow the continuing acid production. To make a thick Greek-style yogurt, spoon it into a fine-mesh strainer or colander lined with cheesecloth, and let the whey and its lactic acid drain into a bowl for several hours. (Don’t discard the whey, whose yellow-green tint comes from riboflavin. It makes a refreshing cool drink, touched up with a little sugar or salt.)What can you do with yogurt beyond enjoying it as is? I use it to make especially tender pancakes and waffles, and in desserts, including a soft-frozen yogurt, barely sweetened. It’s also fun to explore the unusual soups and salads and sauces and drinks and sweets made in the yogurt belt from the Balkans through Central Asia to India.You can use the basic yogurt method to make versions of any cultured dairy product, provided your starter carries live bacteria. You can ferment cream with yogurt, or make a yogurt variant by adding buttermilk or a probiotic-drink to milk. You can combine starters and blend the apple-freshness of yogurt with the butteriness of buttermilk.Crème fraîche is trickier to make than yogurt. Commercial versions vary a lot, with flavors from creamy to buttery to cheesy, colors from pure white to golden, some of them stable enough to boil and others oily from the beginning. None that I’ve found makes a good starter. Use buttermilk instead, stirring it into heavy cream. The cream will set faster and firmer if you preheat it and keep it warm as you do the milk for yogurt.Heavy whipping cream comes in two main forms: one cream-colored, pasteurized and unhomogenized, the other white, ultra-pasteurized, homogenized, and stabilized with gums. The first has better flavor but tends to separate into thick and thin layers during the hours it takes to ferment, and is more likely to leak butterfat when heated.If you’re going to cook with the crème fraîche or blend it with other flavors, then stable homogenized cream will do. If you’re making crème fraîche simply to top fruits or pastries, then seek unhomogenized cream.And if you haven’t tasted it, try the combination that Eric Ziebold, the chef of CityZen in Washington, introduced me to: crème fraîche and french fries. Like sour cream on a baked potato, but even better.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','The British government has resisted calls for tighter oversight and has supported voluntary efforts by industry to monitor how user data is collected. This month, the Internet Advertising Bureau, a trade association for Internet marketers in Britain, asked its members to sign a voluntary code of conduct stating that no Web data would be collected without a user’s explicit consent.The initiative was endorsed by Ed Richards, the head of the British telecommunications regulator, OfCom.After investigating complaints about BT’s use of Phorm, the British information commissioner, Richard Thomas, concluded that Phorm’s technology, which relies on anonymous cookies and tracking of individual Web movements, had adequately eliminated ties to individual users. BT held another trial of Phorm’s technology from October through December using volunteers.Many companies involved in Internet advertising, including Google and other social networking services, use behavioral targeting. But because Phorm receives actual Web-use records from service providers, it says its technology is more accurate.An Internet association that has led the protest against Phorm in Britain, Open Rights Group in London, said the government had ignored European law to accommodate businesses interested in developing lucrative Internet advertising models.“What the U.K. government has done is lackeyed up to business and as a result we’ve been breaking E.U. law and now have this infraction proceeding as a result,” the executive director of the Open Rights Group, Jim Killock, said.Ms. Reding threatened to take Britain to court if the government did not step in and enforce European law. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, who did not want to be identified, confirmed that the government had received the notice from Brussels and would respond after analyzing the issue.Ms. Reding also called for stronger action by social networking services to protect the privacy of minors.Under the action announced Tuesday, the commission is threatening to begin an “infringement proceeding” against Britain, accusing it of failing to observe European privacy law.A spokesman for Phorm, Justin Griffiths, said the company felt it was being made an example in a broader regulatory struggle between Britain and the commission.“Phorm is very confident that it is compliant with the relevant U.K. laws and E.U. directives,” Mr. Griffiths said.Simon Davies, the director of Privacy International in London, said the case against Britain over Phorm was a broader test of the unclear legal landscape regarding a technique that allows companies to track the identity and Web habits of individual computers, traced by their unique Internet Protocol addresses.“The E.U. has been attempting to require the U.K. government to produce a definitive statement on behavioral advertising for more than a year,” Mr. Davies said. “But the U.K. government has refused to do that and now we have a total breakdown of regulatory oversight and the result is intransigence on the part of Britain.”'"

Allison Jr., the chief executive of Fannie Mae for the last six months, has emerged as a candidate to become the next head of the financial bailout program, government officials said.But the announcement of his possible appointment has been delayed because of major vacancies in the top ranks of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants seized by the government in September. David Moffett, the chief executive of Freddie Mac, announced his resignation last month.If nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Allison would succeed Neel T. Kashkari, who has stepped down as assistant treasury secretary for financial stability, a position created last year as part of the bailout effort.Mr. Allison worked for Merrill Lynch for almost 30 years, rising to the positions of president and chief operating officer. He later ran the finance committee for Senator John McCain’s 2000 presidential campaign and became the chairman and chief executive of TIAA-Cref, the large money management company.He began his career at Merrill Lynch in 1971 and worked for the company in New York, London, Paris and Tehran. In 1997, he vied to succeed Daniel P. Tully as the head of the firm, but lost when David H. Komansky was named chief executive.Mr. Allison was named president, but the partnership did not last long. In 1998, after a tumultuous period in the markets, Mr. Allison oversaw large layoffs at Merrrill. The next year, he resigned after being told he would not succeed Mr. Komansky. He left long before Merrill lost billions in mortgage investments and that caused the company to sell itself to Bank of America last year'"
"'09-04-15,'1','announced plans on Tuesday to ban the only genetically modified strain of corn grown in the , dealing a new blow to the American manufacturer, , and raising the specter of trade tensions with the .The German agriculture minister, Ilse Aigner, said that the move was intended to protect the safety of consumers and the environment. But she underlined that it would not represent a blanket ban on genetically modified crops.“My decision is not a political decision, it’s a decision based on the facts,” Ms. Aigner said. “I have come to the conclusion that there is a justifiable reason to believe that genetically modified maize of the type MON 810 presents a danger to the environment.”Kari Matalone, a spokeswoman for Monsanto, said the corn — which is engineered to resist pests — had been approved for cultivation in more than a decade ago and that no ill effects had been detected since then.“We don’t really understand where this decision is coming from,” Ms. Matalone said.Skepticism among consumers about the safety of genetically modified products and about their effect on the environment has made Europe one of the most difficult markets for Monsanto and for other makers of such crops.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','Retail sales declined in March, the government reported on Tuesday, ending two months of tentative gains and signaling more weakness in demand as worried consumers continue to tighten their budgets.The 1.1 percent monthly drop in retail sales displayed the fragility of some recent “glimmers of hope” in the economy cited by President Obama and other policy makers as they press the administration’s economic agenda.The Commerce Department reported that consumers spent less on a range of goods last month, including automobiles, home furnishings, gasoline and clothing. Spending on electronics and appliances dropped 5.9 percent in March from the previous month.“If consumers had turned the corner in January and February, they apparently did not like what they saw and quickly reversed course in March,” Richard F. Moody, chief economist at Forward Capital, wrote in a note.Retail sales were down 10.7 percent from last March, many of the declines stemming from a 34 percent drop in gasoline prices and a 23.5 percent drop in vehicle sales.Still, economists said the free fall in retail spending in the dismal holiday shopping season at the end of 2008 seemed to be relenting in the first part of the year. Retail spending jumped an unexpected 1.8 percent in January, and February’s numbers were revised upward from a decline of 0.1 percent to a gain of 0.3 percent.“Things are not contracting in the same way as they did at the end of last year,” said Dean Maki, co-head of United States economic research at Barclays Capital. “We’re not back to a booming consumer spending environment by any means, but it’s a stable one.”Speeches by Mr. Obama and Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Tuesday underscored that point.In an address at Georgetown University, Mr. Obama said the $787 billion stimulus plan and other recovery measures by the government and the Fed were “starting to generate signs of economic progress.”Also on Tuesday, Mr. Bernanke said there were “tentative signs that the sharp decline in economic activity may be slowing.” He pointed to data on home sales, home construction, consumer spending and auto sales, which have offered some hints of improvement  or at least less severe declines  in recent weeks.In another report on Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that wholesale prices showed more signs of weakness last month.The producer price index fell a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent in March, reflecting a substantial slide in energy prices from a month earlier. Producer prices declined3.5 percent from the same period in 2008, their largest yearly drop in more than 50 years, reflecting the decline in oil prices from more than $100 a barrel in March 2008.Producer prices excluding food and energy were flat in March, putting more focus on the government’s report on retail inflation, which will be released Wednesday morning.Another report released Tuesday showed that businesses were continuing to cut their inventories and clear excess supplies.'"
"'09-04-15,'1','This volatility on both sides of the Florida Straits has bedeviled every president since Kennedy, and even Mr. Obama, who has vowed to make greater use of diplomacy with enemies as well as allies, seems to have recognized the threat.Instead of lifting the trade embargo with Cuba, enacted in the 1960s in an unsuccessful attempt to force a change in government after Fidel Castro came to power, Mr. Obama is using his executive power to repeal Mr. Bush’s tight restrictions and the looser restrictions under President so that Cuban-Americans can now visit Cuba as frequently as they like and send gifts and as much money as they want, as long as the recipients are not senior government or Communist Party officials.Mr. Obama is also allowing telecommunications companies to pursue licensing agreements in Cuba, in an attempt to open up communications there by increasing access to cellphones and satellite television. In a sign that the Cuba issue is a delicate one, the president left it to senior aides to explain his decision.“This is a step to extend a hand to the Cuban people, in support of their desire to determine their own future,” Dan Restrepo, the senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the , said in announcing the move. “It’s very important to help open up space, so the Cuban people can work on the kind of grass-roots democracy that is necessary to move Cuba to a better future.”In a sense, the policy shift is an admission that a half-century of American policy aimed at trying to push the Castros out of power has not worked — as the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful lobbying group for Cuban exiles in , conceded last week. Cuba policy experts characterized Mr. Obama’s moves as important humanitarian steps but said they still left open the broader question of how the United States and Cuba plan to engage in the future.The State Department has said it was reviewing American policy toward Cuba, and Mr. Restrepo said the policy was not “frozen in time today” — a suggestion, some Cuba experts said, that the White House is laying a foundation for more far-reaching change.“We really don’t know yet what he’s got in mind for the long term,” said Sarah Stephens of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, which advocates a further loosening of the restrictions. She said the administration may be trying to take “baby steps toward building confidence” by letting the Cuban exile community in Miami, which has traditionally opposed any softening of American policy, get used to the idea.Mr. Obama is also facing pressure from Capitol Hill. The House and the Senate are considering legislation that would lift travel restrictions to Cuba for all Americans, not just those with family in Cuba. And some experts, like Philip Peters, a Cuba specialist and vice president at the Lexington Institute, a policy research center, argue that a president who is willing to engage and ought to be willing to engage Cuba.“This is a narrow set of measures,” Mr. Peters said. “It doesn’t at all get at the issue of broader contact between American society and Cuban society, and it leaves us in kind of an odd situation where one ethnic group has an unlimited right to travel to Cuba and the rest of us are under these cold war regulations.”Those who still support the Bush hard line denounced the decision. The Cuban government charges hefty fees on remittances, and critics like Representatives Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Republicans and brothers who are Cuban-Americans, said Mr. Obama was making a “serious mistake” that would effectively put millions of dollars into the hands of the Castro regime.Yet those old animosities are giving way to an emerging interest in dialogue that is working in Mr. Obama’s favor, both in Washington and Florida.In Miami, the conservative old guard could still be found. On Radio, a -language station that often acts as a megaphone for Cuban-American conservatives, Ninoska Pérez Castellón, a popular host, echoed the concerns of the Diaz-Balarts. At Latin Café 2000 in Hialeah, Fla., José Soberón, 71, said he would never consider sending money or visiting the island he left years ago.But such opinions are no longer as dominant, especially among younger Cubans like Virgiro Lopez, 31, who said that while his entire family had left Cuba, he supported Mr. Obama’s plan as a way to “help bring a spirit within the people to fight for themselves.”Francisco J. Hernandez, the president of the Cuban American National Foundation, said the new policy would “help the Cuban people to become protagonists of the changes in Cuba.”'"
"'09-04-15,'1','Six months after accepting a financial lifeline from Washington, a newly profitable Goldman Sachs is pushing to return the billions of taxpayer dollars that it received in an effort to extricate itself from heightened government control.Goldman, which rode out the final, tumultuous months of 2008 with the help of a federal rescue, reported strong quarterly profits on Monday and said that it would seek to raise money in the capital markets to repay the government.If successful, Goldman would become the first major bank to return funds received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Such a step would probably enable Goldman  long one of the most lucrative places to work on Wall Street  to free itself from government-imposed restrictions on compensation.Many analysts welcomed the news as the latest in a series of signs that the financial industry is stabilizing. But others warned of a looming divide between a handful of banks like Goldman, which may be strong enough to return their TARP money, and the many others that are too weak to go without government funds.It is unclear how quickly Goldman, which was also a beneficiary of a separate government rescue of the American International Group, might be allowed to return the $10 billion it accepted last October.In a conference call Tuesday morning, Goldman’s chief financial officer, David A. Viniar, said Goldman never viewed the taxpayer money as long-term capital.“We view it as our duty to return the funds as long as we can do it without negatively impacting our financial profile,” Mr. Viniar said.While Goldman’s latest results bolster its case for untangling itself from TARP, federal regulators are nonetheless concerned about the health of the broader financial industry and the implications such a move might have for other institutions. Goldman is not allowed to return the money without the approval of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, which both declined to comment on Monday.“The issue is really, will the government give Goldman special dispensation to get out first?” said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “Goldman can walk the halls of Congress waving a check, but is it in the best interest of the marketplace for them to pay it back?”Goldman indicated in early February that it would seek to repay the funds, and since then, several other banks have said they would like to do the same. Not all banks, however, are likely to bounce back as quickly as Goldman, despite expectations that other banks will report strong results for the first quarter.Goldman announced profits of $1.66 billion in the quarter, or $3.39 a share, a strong comeback from a loss in late 2008. Goldman’s profit was propelled by record revenue of $6.56 billion in its fixed-income, currency and commodities unit, where mortgage and other credit instruments are traded. Over all, Goldman’s revenue was $9.43 billion, up 13 percent from the first quarter a year ago./Mr. Viniar said on Tuesday morning that the bank was able to generate much of its revenue by trading “plain vanilla” investments. Margins were higher than usual, he said, in part because of the disappearance of some of Goldman’s former competitors, like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.“Many of our traditional competitors have retreated from the marketplace,” Mr. Viniar said.Goldman reported its results a day ahead of schedule, setting a positive tone for other bank results expected in the coming week. While several small banks have returned TARP money, Goldman so far is alone among large institutions to seek to do so.Last Tuesday, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, visited Washington to speak before an industry conference, and to meet with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. Though rumors have swirled about Goldman’s payback, it was only last week in that meeting that Mr. Blankfein formally asked to return the money and detailed his plan to raise more private capital. Goldman said on Monday that it would seek to raise $5 billion by selling new common stock and use the proceeds, along with other funds, to repay the government.The amount Goldman owes will be higher than the $10 billion because of warrants that the government was granted that must be valued by an independent firm. Goldman said in a statement on Monday that returning the TARP money depended on the results of a stress test that federal bank examiners were in the process of administering to Goldman and other big banks.Goldman did not address the bonds that it issued with government backing last fall.While Goldman reported a strong first quarter, it also reported a loss of $1 billion in the month of December, underscoring how quickly its fortunes can change. That month was reported on its own because Goldman is changing the timing of its fiscal year by a month, to match the calendar year. The loss was in part related to write-downs on high-yield bonds, as well as deterioration in real estate.Goldman did not detail its reasons for wanting to return the TARP money, but Mr. Viniar addressed the topic at a conference in early February.“We just think that operating our business without the government capital would be an easier thing to do,” Mr. Viniar said. “We’d be under less scrutiny, and under less pressure. Not that we’d be out of the public eye; we’re still going to be in the public eye.”Since then, the government added new requirements for companies that accepted taxpayer money, including stronger rules about bonuses. In a speech last week, Mr. Blankfein criticized one of the other new rules, which centered on visas issued by banks for foreign workers.The capital markets have been virtually dead for months, so it is unclear how Goldman’s stock offering will fare. Only two companies  HSBC, the big British bank, and Xstrata, a mining company  have issued more than $5 billion in equity this year without government backing, according to Dealogic.Some analysts were skeptical about Goldman’s intention to return the money. “If you look at most of the conditions in place that forced TARP onto the banks, those conditions have not changed,” said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital. Since the end of November, Goldman has reduced the number of its employees by more than 2,000, to 27,898, according to the statement. In the last year, the bank has cut 4,000 jobs.“Given the difficult market conditions, we are pleased with this quarter’s performance,” Mr. Blankfein said in the release. “Our results reflect the strength and diversity of our client franchise, the resilience of our business model and the dedication and focus of our people.”'"
"'09-04-15,'1','Jerome Cohen, a New York University law professor who specializes in China’s legal system, said that the action plan was the result of growing worries in the Chinese leadership about public dissatisfaction with security forces and even outright hostility to police officers. That hostility was visible in public support last year for a man who attacked a police station and killed six officers in revenge for what the man described as a beating at the station.The police denied any beating and the man, Yang Jia, was executed on Nov. 26. Two days later, the Communist Party Politburo met to discuss ways to improve the public standing of law enforcement officers, part of a continuing effort that helped lead to the plan released Monday, Mr. Cohen said.“There is a concern growing even at the Politburo level about the rising dissatisfaction of the people against the public security authorities,” he said.The release of the plan by the Information Office of China’s State Council, or cabinet, suggests that the plan is designed partly with public relations in mind, Mr. Cohen said. But if widely circulated in China — and the report received considerable attention in the Chinese state-run media on Monday — it could contribute to changes.Lawyers and others in China have been increasingly assertive in recent years regarding rights already promised under the Constitution. The plan’s release could help these individuals by providing guidance to local and provincial governments about the long-term direction of national policy.The plan’s release comes as China has also found itself under international pressure from several directions to improve its human rights record.Groups like the United Nations-affiliated Committee Against Torture have been calling on governments around the world to release action plans for improvements. The Beijing Olympics last year brought greater global scrutiny of China’s human rights record.This year brings two sensitive anniversaries that have refocused attention on that record. Last month marked the 50th anniversary of a failed uprising in Tibet against Chinese rule, while June will bring the 20th anniversary of the military suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests.Xinhua, the official news agency, said: “The government admitted that ‘China has a long road ahead in its efforts to improve its human rights situation.”’The document does not phase out China’s extensive and controversial system of administrative detention, which gives broad powers to local law enforcement officials, including the ability to send people to prison camps for “re-education through labor” without a trial.While the document guarantees a wide range of rights to detainees and petitioners, there is no promise to close the unregistered jails set up by municipal and provincial governments to detain petitioners who want to present grievances to higher levels of government.The ‘‘National Human Rights Action Plan of China 2009-2010” emphasizes economic and social rights instead, such as a “right of urban and rural residents to a basic standard of living.”The plan does call for China to go considerably further in areas where it has begun making changes, such as in releasing more information about government decision-making, and to extend to the countryside policies that so far have mainly benefited cities.“Governments at town and township levels shall make public the implementation of relevant state policies regarding rural work, their revenue and expenditure and their use of various kinds of special funds,” the plan said.While the plan calls for public opinion to play a larger role in decisions, the document does not set out any specific goals for turning China into a democracy in which the people have a say in choosing their country’s leaders.'"

"'09-04-16,'1','Statement by the Director of National Intelligence Dennis C. Blair upon the release of the Office of Legal Counsel memos.The Department of Justice released today four previous Office of Legal Counsel opinions which concluded certain harsh interrogation techniques used by CIA officers on suspected al Qa'ida terrorists were legal. The opinions spell out in graphic detail techniques used in questioning high value detainees suspected of involvement in, and plans for, terrorist activity against the United States and its allies.As the leader of the Intelligence Community, I am trying to put these issues into perspective. We cannot undo the events of the past; we must understand them and use this understanding as we move into the future.It is important to remember the context of these past events. All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain critical information from captured Al Qaeda leaders, and requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods. The OLC memos make clear that senior legal officials judged the harsher methods to be legal.Those methods, read on a bright, sunny, safe day in April 2009, appear graphic and disturbing. As the President has made clear, and as both CIA Director Panetta and I have stated, we will not use those techniques in the future. But we will absolutely defend those who relied on these memos and those guidelines.As a young Navy officer during the Vietnam years, I experienced public scorn for those of us who served in the Armed Forces during an unpopular war. Challenging and debating the wisdom and policies linked to wars and warfighting is important and legitimate; however disrespect for those who serve honorably within legal guidelines is not. I remember well the pain of those of us who served our country even when the policies we were carrying out were unpopular or could be second-guessed.We in the Intelligence Community should not be subjected to similar pain. Let the debate focus on the law and our national security. Let us be thankful that we have public servants who seek to do the difficult work of protecting our country under the explicit assurance that their actions are both necessary and legal.'"

"'09-04-16,'1','WASHINGTON — The White House said Wednesday that President Obama was imposing financial penalties on members of three Mexican drug cartels, designating the cartels as “kingpins” on the eve of a presidential visit to Mexico, where the issue of drug violence will be high on the agenda.Mr. Obama leaves on Thursday for Mexico City; he will be the first American president to visit that nation’s capital since President Bill Clinton traveled there 12 years ago. In the weeks leading up to the trip, the Obama administration has said it intends to work closely with Mexico to stem a rising tide of drug violence that is fueled, in part, by cross-border weapons trafficking.Mr. Obama has the right to identify drug traffickers and their related businesses for penalties under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act, a 1999 law that has been used to focus on several dozen foreign operations worldwide, including some in Mexico. On Wednesday, the White House identified three more Mexican drug operations that will carry the kingpin designation: Sinaloa Cartel, Los Zetas and La Familia Michoacana.The act allows the Treasury Department to freeze any assets of the cartels found in United States jurisdictions and to prosecute Americans who help the cartels handle their money.Drug violence has become so prevalent in Mexico that some experts warn that the country is on the verge of becoming a failed state. In an interview with ABC News that was being shown Wednesday evening, Mexico’s president, Felipe Calderón, dismissed that assertion. “Absolutely not,” he said, according to a transcript provided by the network. “Mexico is not a failed state.”'"
"'09-04-16,'1','The office was created in 2007 to be the central point within the vast Pentagon bureaucracy and far-flung military to coordinate the Defense Department’s overseas information efforts with the rest of the government, in particular the White House, the State Department and American embassies.But American military officers in Afghanistan in particular were angered last year by sets of “talking points” provided by the office for use in responding to queries on matters like civilian casualties. Officers who received the talking points predicted that the information would be seen by the Afghan public as blatant propaganda, and they refused to use them.Officials said the Pentagon would now play a supporting role to the White House and the State Department in communicating government messages to foreign audiences, with the efforts no longer centralized in one place but assigned to each Pentagon policy office and regional military combatant commander.Questions over the proper role of the Pentagon in public diplomacy have lingered since it was disclosed in 2002 that the Defense Department had created the Office of Strategic Influence; that office, a forerunner of the Pentagon public diplomacy office, was shut down after members of Congress expressed concerns that its behind-the-scenes efforts to shape public sentiment in wartime might undermine the military’s credibility.Even in a supporting role, the Defense Department has far greater resources in money, trained communications personnel and broadcast and print technology than any other government agency or department.Another senior Defense Department official briefed on the decision said the military, by its size and global reach, remained one of the government’s most visible tools for projecting American influence and defining its values, especially in operations short of combat, like humanitarian aid and disaster relief missions.“The goal should be to produce words and actions that are matched,” the official said. “There still is a great need for a concerted effort in the planning stages of policy, execution and communications.”The Obama administration has inherited a complex policy debate over how to communicate messages abroad during wartime, one that remained unresolved by the Bush administration despite a series of appointments of high-profile communications officials.There is no disagreement that extremist and terrorist ideology is spread over the Internet and by videos with an agility not matched by either the government or the military, but there has been no agreement on a detailed plan of how to respond.'"
"'09-04-16,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration on Wednesday named the first six companies participating in a $75 billion program intended to help millions of struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure.The administration said the companies would receive a maximum of $9.9 billion in incentive payments, meant to encourage mortgage companies to lower borrowers’ monthly bills. The government expects to finish arrangements with other companies in the coming months.Chase Home Finance, part of JPMorgan Chase & Company, will receive up to $3.6 billion, the largest amount among the six companies. The other recipients are: Wells Fargo & Company, GMAC Mortgage, the CitiMortgage unit of Citigroup, Select Portfolio Servicing and Saxon Mortgage Services.The program, announced on March 4, will offer homeowners the chance to obtain modified loans with lower monthly payments. It is being financed by $50 billion from the government’s $700 billion financial rescue program. The remaining $25 billion will come from other government sources.The plan is limited to borrowers who owe up to 5 percent more than their home’s current value and could help nine million struggling homeowners.'"

"'09-04-16,'1','The seminal event in Bill Scheft’s third comic novel, “Everything Hurts,” occurs “two years after souls had gorged themselves on chicken soup, two years before the same souls would stop sweating the small stuff while wondering who moved their cheese.” The year is 1995, and the self-help book craze is in full swing. Phil Camp, this novel’s perpetually achy hero, decides to write his own self-help book as both a joke and a means of paying alimony. He is getting over a marriage that “lasted three years, which apparently is as long as it takes to convince the average woman that you’re not kidding when you say you don’t want kids.”Phil uses the nom-de-guru Marty Fleck to write a parody called “Where Can I Stow My Baggage?” Among its chapter headings: “How Much Baggage Will I Claim?” and “Anything Else to Declare?” The book is an exercise in cynicism, but it’s just dopey enough to become a big hit, thanks especially to its author’s gift for bite-size oversimplifications. “Marty Fleck reduced childhood to ‘Yes or no: My mother wasn’t my type,’ ” Mr. Scheft writes.So far, so good: the self-help field is a satisfying target. Even better: Mr. Scheft throws right-wing talk radio into his story. Phil has a half-brother, Jim McManus, a “conservative radio gasbag” who has been addicted to painkillers. Since it is usual for a roman à clef to drop the real names of its targets in passing, Jim is said to be “a voice of almost-reason in a forest of Limbaughs.” Jim is also an ex-football player worth comparing to Tom Brady, which makes him by far the better physical specimen in the family. Jim and Phil don’t get along.Now comes the part about pain. By 2004, after writing a Marty Fleck advice column for years, Phil has developed a prostate problem and an aching back. Such complaints give “Everything Hurts” an old-guy spirit even if its 46-year-old main character isn’t all that ancient.For instance the combined effects of his physical problems keep him constantly hobbling toward bathrooms. (“Again?” he imagines people sitting behind him at ballgames or movies saying irritably. “Maybe that’s why he’s limping.”)Physical misery eventually sends Phil into the clutches of exactly the kind of person he wanted to skewer: a self-help author. He winds up amid the cult followers of a book called “The Power of ‘Ow!’ ”The many mordant one-liners in “Everything Hurts” underscore that Mr. Scheft is a skillful television comedy writer who can find laughs in unlikely situations. The less funny use of Phil’s back pain as a plot point is, sure enough, autobiographical. (“Count the doctors, win a prize!” he writes about the long list of people thanked in this book’s acknowledgments.)And the ability to set up comic ingredients better than he throws them together seems to be true of Mr. Scheft’s books generally. His previous baby-boomer comedy, “Time Won’t Let Me,” was at its best in its early stages, establishing its premise about a garage band forced to reunite  about 30 years too late.Like Peter Lefcourt (“The Deal,” “The Dreyfus Affair”), another high-concept humorist with show-business flair (Mr. Lefcourt is a screenwriter), Mr. Scheft has a gift for guy-minded grousing. So “Everything Hurts” enjoys wallowing in Phil’s suffering. (“It had been, as bouts of hysterical paralysis go, a productive four hours on the floor for Phil.”) It fumes about Dr. Samuel Abrun, the “Ow!” king, who is a doctor to patients who shuffle into his office “in a variety of pretzel shapes” and is their last best hope for recovery. “You either accepted his diagnosis,” Mr. Scheft writes, “or you moved along to the doctors uptown with the transparent nail polish and the unnecessary surgery.”How do all these elements, and Phil’s romance with Dr. Abrun’s daughter, manage to gel? They don’t; “Everything Hurts” is cheerfully messy. Marty Fleck is a mixed blessing. Phil’s prostate wears out its welcome. And the story risks veering toward sentimentality in its later stages.At least Phil gets the chance to wonder whether he is the first Jew ever to be compared to Hitler by his own brother (Jim McManus’s radio show uses Marty Fleck as a punching bag) before a spirit of reconciliation takes over. It may be warmly satisfying for Phil but it’s far less so for Mr. Scheft’s readers when the brothers reach the Erich Segal part of their relationship and hit a love-means-never-having-to-say-you’re-sorry note.Mr. Scheft achieves what is doubtless his desired effect by making Phil the most appealing part of a novel that seems to be autobiographical. After all, Phil is a guy whose exercise routine on his Nordic Track machine takes an extra five minutes “to remove all the clothes hanging on it.” Phil, in his Marty Fleck professional guise, can write: “Author’s note to self: find out if one can be sued for plagiarizing a fortune cookie.”Phil likes sports, is full of grumpy bonhomie and even knows his way around a newspaper, where a man of 62 is “114 in newsroom years” and “manual-typewriter reliable with his litigation-eligible remarks.” This is enough of an old-guy book to really relish its old-timers.'"
"'09-04-16,'1','He has already been the subject of obsessive news media coverage, and now he will be the subject of a children’s book. Bo the Portuguese water dog who recently became the first presidential pet in the Obama White House, is the star of “Bo, America’s Commander in Leash,” expected in stores by the end of the month. Mascot Books, a small independent publisher in Herndon, Va., specializing in titles based on university and school mascots, is rushing the book out to capitalize on the fervor surrounding the Obamas’ new dog. “Bo” is written by Naren Aryal, a founder of Mascot Books, and illustrated by Danny Moore, one of its employees. Mr. Aryal said he and Mr. Moore had been working on the project for about two months, leaving space for pictures of the dog, once it was chosen. Mr. Aryal said the Obamas’ two daughters aren’t named in the book because he wanted to protect their privacy.'"
"'09-04-16,'1','“Oh, they know they’re famous, and they definitely get an attitude,” she said.Like many people in the dog business, Ms. Ruggles takes a fairly anthropomorphic view of her animals’ cognitive abilities. “What distinguishes show dogs from other dogs is that they realize what’s going on, they know what they’re doing,” she said. “That’s what makes them who they are.”J. R., for instance, knows how to make an impressive entrance at a press conference. “He waves his paws — it’s his signature,” Ms. Ruggles said. “It’s not something we taught him to do, it’s just something he does.”But many dog owners are quick to tell stories about the precocity of their pets (often, long after the interest of the listener has waned), and skeptics chalk these tricks up to personality rather than brains. Even people who have studied the intelligence of dogs are doubtful that Bo has any clue he is an international media star.declared Stanley Coren, a professor of at the University of British Columbia and the co-author of “What Do Dogs Know? Dogs don’t know fame.”What dogs do know, said Professor Coren, is their position within their social group, whether they are at the top or the bottom of their pack.“They know about comfort, and they know how much they can demand and get away with,” he said. So with the first family treating him like royalty for the time being, “that might be equivalent to fame. He might think he has groupies.”By that standard, Bo’s perception of his surroundings won’t be all that different from any other well-pampered family dog, he said.“I’m certain there are hundreds of thousands if not millions of dogs who are owned by blue-collar workers who really feel that they are extremely special,” Professor Coren said.Based on the behavior of previous four-legged White House occupants, it is hard to draw too many conclusions. During the , Barney the Scottish terrier had his own Web page on www.whitehouse.gov (which he shared with the Bushes’ other dog, Miss Beazley), and showed his gratitude by biting a Reuters reporter during the administration’s waning days. Socks and Buddy, the Clintons’ cat and dog, drew enough mail that assembled a book of letters, though Socks’s nastiness to Buddy got him gifted to when the Clintons left the White House.Perhaps a better role model for Bo was Millie the springer spaniel, who not only “dictated” a book to her owner, , but also gave birth to a camera-ready litter of puppies.The idea that a dog could tell a red carpet from a housebreaking pad may sound far-fetched. For centuries, however, the mysteries of animal awareness have occupied some of mankind’s most respected thinkers.Thomas Aquinas, the 13th-century Catholic philosopher, believed that animals possessed just enough consciousness that people should spare them outright abuse, if not the frying pan. René Descartes, who divided the world into two distinct substances, mind and matter, said that animals were purely mechanical beings that lacked an inner life (a classification that rings hollow to anyone who has heard the noise a beagle makes when you step on its tail). Darwin, Aristotle and Immanuel Kant also tried, unconvincingly, to wrap their heads around animal minds.But canine cognition has become a serious science in the past few decades. More or less.Starting in the late 1990s, Marc Bekoff, then a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the , used his dog, Jethro, to conduct a landmark study he called “The Yellow Snow Project.”“For five winters I collected piles of yellow snow on the path where I walk my dog in the mountains outside of ,” he said. “Then I would move them along the path and watch what Jethro did.”“He basically spent a longer time sniffing the other dogs’ urine than his own,” Mr. Bekoff said.Professor Coren, who has studied Mr. Bekoff’s work (animal psychology is a tight-knit field), said that the yellow snow experiment offered proof that dogs have a sense of themselves versus other dogs. “It’s the first level of consciousness, knowing that you are there and a separate entity from everyone else,” Professor Coren said.His own claim to fame is a series of tests conducted in the early 1990s that measured how many sounds, signals and gestures dogs could comprehend. He concluded that the average dog had roughly the same cognitive abilities as a 2-year-old human, a finding that is now commonly cited among pet owners.“It’s helpful because when dealing with a dog, you can ask yourself, ‘What would I expect of a 2-year-old kid?’ ” he said.Still, no matter how many pointy-headed tests are dreamed up, there will always be pet owners who believe their dogs possess the magical ability to apprehend their larger place in the world.“People love to humanize their dogs,” said Mathilde DeCagny, the Hollywood trainer who worked on But Bo is not walking in the White House right now thinking, ‘I scored!’ ”Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Some animal rights advocates have criticized the Obamas for adopting a dog from a private breeder rather than from a shelter. But the choice somehow seems less cruel once you remove the suggestion of Oliver Twist-like emotional despair. “I have gotten so many e-mails today from people saying it’s too bad they didn’t get a mutt from the pound who would know that he is special,” Mr. Bekoff said.“But come on,” he laughed. “Bo doesn’t know that, and neither would a pound dog.”'"
"'09-04-16,'1','MUMBAI, India — The prosecution of the sole surviving gunman of the November attacks here got off to a rocky start on Wednesday when a judge dismissed the state-appointed defense lawyer for having a conflict of interest.The dismissal came moments before the trial of the gunman, Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani national, was set to begin. Judge M. L. Tahiliyani said the lawyer, Anjali Waghmare, could not represent him because she was also representing a witness to the attacks in a separate civil proceeding.The judge said another lawyer would have to be appointed for Mr. Kasab, though it was unclear how soon that would happen.Mr. Kasab, 21, was arrested in late November after 10 gunmen killed more than 160 people in luxury hotels, a Jewish center and a busy railroad station. The attacks heightened tensions between India and Pakistan, which have fought several wars since they became independent in 1947.The trial, in which prosecutors have charged Mr. Kasab with 12 crimes, including murder and waging war against India, had previously been delayed because of security concerns. The government has significantly increased security, including building a bomb-proof courtroom and installing a teleconference system through which the judge has previously talked to Mr. Kasab.'"

The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell 2.76 percent, from 2.78 percent late Tuesday.Data released on Wednesday offered some hints that the economy’s declines were slowing, or at least nearing a bottom.Industrial production slid again and consumer prices fell slightly in March, posting their first year-over-year declines in more than five decades.The Federal Reserve also reported that anecdotal evidence from across the country suggested that widespread economic trouble continued through March and early April, but also suggested that the pace of declines might have eased a bit.The major indexes have climbed more than 20 percent from their lowest point in 12 years on hopes that the financial crisis was easing and that the worst economic declines were over.But some analysts warn the stock markets have raced out too far ahead of the broader economy, which is still shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs each month.

Lisa T.

The Declaration recites a list of grievances against King George III that justified the American Revolution, for example, subordinating the civil power to the military. It established a “duty” to overthrow tyrannical governments that were deaf to grievances.The Constitution brims with individual rights, like freedom of speech, religion, association, habeas corpus, jury trial, private property and so on. To abandon reverence for rights and respect for grievances is to dishonor the Republic envisioned by the founding fathers.The writer is chairman of the American Freedom Agenda and the author of “Constitutional Peril: The Life and Death Struggle for Our Constitution and Democracy.”'"
"'09-04-17,'1','New York State, as Mayor Michael Bloomberg observed on Thursday, is where Susan B. Anthony began her struggle for women’s suffrage. It is the state where the N.A.A.C.P. was founded. Now New York can finally honor its historic commitment to personal freedoms by becoming the next state to end discrimination against civil marriage for same-sex couples.On Thursday, as he reintroduced a bill that will give same-sex couples the right to marry, New York’s governor, David Paterson, issued an appeal at once personal and universal. Mr. Paterson, the state’s first black governor, compared the fight for same-sex marriage to the battle to end slavery and discrimination. “Anyone who has ever faced intolerance of any kind,” he said, “knows the solemn importance of protecting the rights of all people.” And he reminded listeners that gay couples are often denied health benefits, the right to visit loved ones in the hospital and spousal rights to inherit property.What could be even more important was his response to New York’s new archbishop, Timothy Dolan, who said Wednesday that he would speak out against same-sex marriage. “This is a civil government,” the governor — who is Catholic — said. He is right. Religious organizations can make rules for marriage, but the state is separate and must treat people equally under the law.Mr. Paterson had plenty of supporters lined up with him at the announcement — Mayor Bloomberg, Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand and other members of Congress, union representatives and gay rights advocates. It will take hard work from all — especially Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Schumer — to get this essential legislation passed. They need to press the State Senate hard, with Mr. Schumer coaxing fellow Democrats and the mayor convincing his Republican allies.The Assembly is expected to pass the measure easily, but some advocates of same-sex marriage have said they want Albany’s legislators to make sure they can win before the Senate votes. Knowing the outcome in advance is the way law is usually made in Albany. But, as Mr. Bloomberg argued, “that is not democracy.” It’s time for Albany’s backroom specialists to allow full debates and real votes on whether thousands of New Yorkers should be allowed this basic right.'"
"'09-04-17,'1','“I have very serious concerns about the concentration of too much power in one agency,” he said. “Power over information is so important, and it is so difficult to monitor, that we need to have checks and balances.”Government officials have acknowledged that the agency has gone beyond the broad limits set by Congress last year for intercepting telephone and e-mail messages of Americans. Leading Democratic and Republican lawmakers and civil liberties groups voiced strong concerns Thursday after The reported the breach.Senator , the Democrat who leads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that “these are serious allegations, and we will make sure we get the facts.” The committee plans to hold a closed hearing on the issue soon, Mrs. Feinstein said.Representative Silvestre Reyes, the Democrat who leads the House Intelligence Committee, said his panel had already held four closed-door sessions on N.S.A. compliance problems, and he said it would continue to monitor the issue actively. Representative Peter Hoekstra, the Republican who is the ranking minority member on the committee, complained, though, that the intelligence community had failed to inform Congress of the problem in “a quick and timely manner.”Some lawmakers said hearings were not enough. Senator , a Democrat who was an outspoken opponent of the legislation that broadened the security agency’s wiretapping powers last year, said the wiretapping problems were part of “a tragic retreat from the principles that had governed the sensitive area of government surveillance for the previous three decades.” Mr. Feingold called for reforms in intelligence law as well as the public release of certain aspects of wiretapping operations “so that the American people can better understand their scope and impact.”, the director of national intelligence, defended the agency’s wiretapping operation in a statement Thursday as “vital work” in protecting national security, but he acknowledged that “on occasion, N.S.A. has made mistakes and intercepted the wrong communications.” Mr. Blair said the numbers of such mistakes were “very small” in the agency’s vast overall collection efforts, although officials would not quantify how many violations had occurred.Some experts said Thursday that the disclosure of excessive domestic collection of information by the security agency served as a warning against giving it greater control over cybersecurity.“The N.S.A.’s expertise, which is impressive and very, very deep, is focused primarily on the needs of the military and the intelligence community,” said Matt Blaze, a computer security expert at the . “Their track record in dealing with civilian communications security is mixed at best.”Agency officials declined to comment Thursday, but the N.S.A. — which has the greatest concentration of computing power and expertise in the government — has powerful allies in its bid for control. Mr. Blair told Congress recently that he believed the agency should be given the lead in cybersecurity, arguing that it has the computer “wizards” with the skills needed.In a recent interview, Dale Meyerrose, a retired Air Force general who was the chief information officer for the director of national intelligence until last year, agreed, saying that while intelligence officials need to be mindful of civil liberties concerns in the cybersecurity debate, the N.S.A. must have a leading role in that effort because of its technical expertise.“They are probably the premier cybersecurity, cyberorganization in the world,” General Meyerrose said.Like Mr. Beckstrom, others worry about giving a spy agency a virtual monopoly over information security.“There is a tremendous amount of expertise at N.S.A.,” said Amit Yoran, the former director of the cybersecurity division of the Homeland Security Department, “but I also agree that it would be a significant detriment to the nation to let the N.S.A. be the lead agency running cyberprograms. There is an inherent conflict of interest between their intelligence mission and the mission of the folks doing cyber.”'"
"'09-04-17,'1','On Friday, the G.M. chief executive Fritz Henderson emphasized the company’s desire for a quick bankruptcy case if the company ends up seeking Chapter 11 protection. He said G.M. was examining both pre-packaged elements to a bankruptcy, meaning it would reach agreements with creditors before filing, and the sale of assets under Section 363 of bankruptcy law that would allow G.M. to set up a new entity.“We are spending our time doing planning around going fast in bankruptcy if that’s needed,” Mr. Henderson told journalists on a conference call. A G.M. case “could include either of those two.”Mr. Henderson said the decision to seek bankruptcy protection would be one that G.M. management, its board and the Treasury Department “would arrive at together.”Casting aside the deliberative processes of bankruptcy would undoubtedly lead other companies to argue for the same treatment in the future.The judge would want to weigh carefully the stakes, given G.M.’s size and its close ties to companies around the world.Unionized employees and retirees would ask that their contracts be protected, and the Bankruptcy Code has provisions specifically requiring good-faith negotiations before labor agreements can be modified. Such talks could easily take many months.Bankruptcy cases often drag on far longer than anticipated, slowed by unexpected obstacles to reorganization. The auto-parts company Delphi, once a unit of G.M. and now a supplier, has languished in bankruptcy proceedings for four years, twice as long as originally planned, for example.Separating and selling off G.M.’s more valuable assets, a strategy pursued at troubled banks (usually outside of bankruptcy, it should be noted), would most likely pit the company’s financial advisers against those working for creditors.“Creditors may think Buick is their premier line, management may think Pontiac is their premier line,” Ms. Mayerson observed. That argument will delay important decisions about the company’s future, she added. “It really isn’t an asset problem at G.M. so much as a management problem.”Even if a judge went along with the government’s plan to split the company, that judge would want plenty of legal cover. Gathering and presenting evidence that the split-up is the best option would take time.Typically, companies sell off assets to third parties as part of a reorganization in Chapter 11. Plans for G.M. would go further, selling virtually all the viable parts of the company very quickly to a new one created solely to buy it.“What’s driving this is the concern that the customer is not going to stand for a three-year bankruptcy,” said a person briefed on the government’s plan who insisted on anonymity because discussions are continuing. “The revenues will just stall out.”Allowing the automaker to sell off the good assets would essentially sidestep the rest of the bankruptcy process, lawyers said, especially the nettlesome requirement that creditors approve a plan of reorganization. Once blessed, that tactic would be alluring to other troubled companies.“If you could do this, it’s too cheap a trick — everyone would do it,” said Lynn M. LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. “There would be no other kind of bankruptcy remaining.”Lehman Brothers conducted a sale within days of its bankruptcy filing, holding an auction under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, which the administration’s plan could also use. But in Lehman’s case, an outside buyer, Barclays, bid on the assets, Professor LoPucki said. “Here, there is no buyer,” he said. “G.M. is selling itself to itself. That transaction has no economic reality.”The transaction could have very real implications, though, for creditors and unionized workers. If union contracts on pensions, employment and benefits remain tied to the old G.M., employees and retirees could be devastated financially.If the contracts move to the new, good company, the surviving business would look considerably weaker. That creates a political problem that would make a rapid, clean bankruptcy unlikely.“It’s going to be about the union and the pensions,” said Ms. Mayerson, the bankruptcy lawyer. “And I don’t see any way that this is a quickie bankruptcy. After all, it took them 30 years to get into this mess.”'"

"'09-04-17,'1','Let me try to help. Goldman’s explanations sometimes do not ring true, even if they are. When it announced its profits this week, it buried an important fact in the tables on page 10 of a news release, and did not mention it in the text of the release. That fact was that Goldman had lost a lot of money in December, which would have been part of the quarter had the firm not changed its fiscal year. As a result, that loss does not show up in any quarterly number. Goldman won’t say if a December-to-February quarter would have been profitable.Was Goldman’s disclosure misleading? Legally, no. There was full disclosure. But the existence of the orphan month, with its big loss, was largely overlooked in the initial news stories. When it was reported later, Goldman was left looking as if it had tried to pull a fast one.Something similar happened with regard to Goldman’s relations with A.I.G., which owed Goldman a lot of money that it was able to recover thanks to the bailout. Mr. Viniar says that Goldman was fully protected if A.I.G. did default, and that A.I.G.’s bailout had little if any effect on Goldman’s earnings.When I talked to Mr. Viniar, he conceded to me, as he had to others, the obvious fact that Goldman would have been affected if an A.I.G. collapse had led to a systemic failure. But Goldman has not emphasized that, and at times has seemed to be denying it, as when it said that collateral put up by other firms would have protected it if those firms had collapsed as a result of A.I.G.’s failure.Then there is the matter of the $10 billion government investment under the TARP program. Goldman has proclaimed that it wants to pay it back, and get out from government control of things like bonus payments. But it did not mention the $28 billion it has borrowed with a guarantee from the government’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a guarantee that is worth a lot to Goldman. Mr. Viniar told me Goldman expected to borrow more, probably hitting the maximum $35 billion.He sees no contradiction in that. Wall Street competitors, speaking privately and perhaps simply showing they are jealous, see it as hypocritical.Goldman’s aura goes back at least a generation. When I was in business school in the early 1980s, getting a job there was viewed as the ultimate accomplishment. It should be no surprise that a firm that often got first choice in hiring ended up with some very good people. Nor should anyone be surprised by the jealousy and resentment Goldman has aroused, especially when it seemed to be willing to trade aggressively to exploit others’ weaknesses.The belief that Goldman has a pipeline to the administration in Washington — whichever administration that might be — has been around for a long time. But it took on far more importance last year as government officials, often Goldman alumni, gained the power to decide which firms lived or died.Once again, Goldman people seem shellshocked. “I’ve read the ‘Government Sachs’ articles,” Mr. Viniar told me, adding that he thought public service was to be encouraged, not rebuked. “For people to write stories that they were there to help Goldman Sachs is offensive.”It is an offense that began with Goldman’s competitors, who coined and popularized the term.Such carping has a long pedigree. Back in 1998, the troubled Russian government was able to borrow $1.25 billion in the international capital markets at a time when it was having great difficulties meeting its domestic obligations. I recall asking one money manager why he put up some of the money, given Russia’s obvious problems. There was, he assured me, no real risk. The Russian bonds were underwritten by Goldman, which would not have gotten involved without getting an assurance from Robert Rubin, the former Goldman chief executive who was then President Clinton’s Treasury secretary, that the American government would step up if needed to prevent a Russian default.It was as tidy a conspiracy theory as the current one that asserts A.I.G. was bailed out, and Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail, because that was what Goldman wanted. After all, Henry M. Paulson Jr., another former Goldman chief executive, was President Bush’s Treasury secretary.The 1998 theory turned out to be wrong. Russia did default, and the bondholders lost money. Goldman itself, however, escaped unscathed.As would happen nearly a decade later with mortgage securitizations sold by Goldman, by the time the Russian debt defaulted, the firm had reversed its exposure and may have even been in a position to profit from the default. Part of Goldman’s problem now is that there is confusion as to whether the bank bailouts are the corporate equivalent of welfare checks or Social Security benefits.If they were simply aimed at invigorating the financial system, with the money going to banks that could use it to increase lending, then there logically should be no public outrage at bonuses for executives of healthy financial institutions. No one is offended to see a wealthy Social Security recipient embarking on a luxury cruise.But there is a big difference if these are seen as bailouts for the undeserving rich. If you don’t like buying coffee for a beggar, how about Champagne?Unfortunately for Goldman and other banks, the public has decided TARP is welfare. “It’s become a scarlet letter,” Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said Thursday as he announced his own bank’s $2.1 billion quarterly profit.This is hardly the first time that outrage over welfare payments stretched the facts. Sixty years ago, A. J. Liebling, then the press critic of The New Yorker, wrote a hilarious piece about how the New York newspapers had gone crazy over a “Lady in Mink” who was collecting welfare benefits. The eventual discovery that the coat was, in Mr. Liebling’s words, “rather mangy,” and that she deserved the money, received less attention.Goldman appears to be prospering now, while its competitors struggle and the rest of the world endures a recession caused in no small part by Wall Street excesses. The firm has every right to try to get out from under rules that could limit bonuses, and to give nice raises to the employees it did not lay off. It deserves to feel proud that its risk management systems worked while others failed.But it should not expect such success to bring popularity. Misery loves company, and there would be no little joy on Wall Street if Goldman, having paid back the TARP money, was forced by some new crisis to go to Washington, hat in hand, asking for the money again.'"
"'09-04-17,'1','How does it feel to plummet from the peaks of global finance to an unpaid gig at a fledgling company? A few dozen laid-off New Yorkers are about to find out.They are the first group of out-of-work professionals to be paired up with small businesses that need help getting started or expanding. The matchmaking experiment, which began this week, was one of the ideas New York City officials hatched as a response to the growing ranks of unemployed professionals in the metropolitan area.With investment banks and other financial companies continuing to eliminate jobs at a fast pace, officials of the city’s Economic Development Corporation began to fear an exodus of educated, previously well-paid residents. So they contracted with the Levin Insititute of the State University of New York to set up a boot camp in entrepreneurship for about 50 former financiers who were willing to spend 10 weeks sharing their skills with start-up companies and small businesses free of charge.That’s right: free, as in unpaid. The development corporation is putting up just $50,000 for what city officials hope will be the first of several sessions of the program, which is known as JumpStart NYC, held at the institute’s offices on the Upper East Side.On Thursday, after a few days of classes and a few more speeches from officials of the city and the institute, the participants learned which companies they had been assigned to.Some of the entrepreneurs were clearly thrilled about the prospect of tapping the brains of people who as recently as last month were earning more than many Americans ever hope to.Jonathan D. Harber, chief executive and president of Schoolnet, a company that develops technology for schools, said he was looking for somebody to study whether his company should expand into the community college market. Ideally, he said, the consultant assigned to Schoolnet would determine that the idea was potentially profitable and would stay on to create and run a new unit of the company.“That’s the grand-slam home run,” Mr. Harber said with an anticipatory grin. The participants seemed to be filled with a mix of eagerness and trepidation about signing on with start-ups. Jamaal Glenn, an investment banking analyst at JP Morgan Chase until he lost his job last month, said some of the participating companies were so small that he probably would have to fix his own computer if it broke.But, Mr. Glenn, 26, added, “I think everyone here is open to something drastically different.”Accepting the need to consider a career beyond Wall Street is the first step, said Garrick Utley, the institute’s president.“It’s about networking, but it’s really about stepping over that psychological hurdle: ‘I’m not going to be a Master of the Universe,’ ” Mr. Utley said. “It’s a question of: when do you realize it’s changed?”Rodneyse Bichotte said she was ready for a career change after three years of working for giant banks. Out of work since early August, she said she was energized by the meetings with the other participants and the hope of returning to a working environment.“This week has really kind of rejuvenated me,” said Ms. Bichotte, 36. “It’s sad waking up and realizing that the opportunity of getting another job is really slim.”Ms. Bichotte, who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, said she expected to continue collecting unemployment benefits while consulting with the company with which she was matched. But she added that she hoped that the program would quickly lead to a paying position. Some of the entrepreneurs had specific tasks they wanted the consultants to perform, but David Hung, an executive of Peek, which sells a portable e-mail device, said he thought the program was too good to pass up.“We’re just looking for smart people who are willing to learn new things,” he said. “Free, talented labor  how can you say no to that?”'"
"'09-04-17,'1','Hours after the Boston Celtics announced that they could be without Kevin Garnett for the playoffs, General Manager Danny Ainge was hospitalized because of a mild heart attack.Ainge, 50, was expected to remain at Massachusetts General Hospital for several days, according to a statement by the team. He will probably miss the start of the team’s first-round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls when it opens Saturday in Boston.Coach Doc Rivers had disclosed earlier that Garnett’s bothersome knee would make him unavailable to begin the playoffs and possibly sideline him for the duration of the postseason. Rivers said he made the decision after he watched Garnett work out, eventually cutting the session short.“If he can’t get through biking and working out without swelling and his leg locking, I don’t know how you can play in the playoffs,” Rivers said on the sports radio station WEEI-AM. “This was an honest run today, you couldn’t fake your way through it. The guy’s a warrior, you see him try to mask his way through it. But after 20 minutes of running, I didn’t see it. After today, there’s no way he can play.”The Celtics won the title in 2008 after Ainge brokered two key trades, importing Garnett and the sharpshooter Ray Allen. The Celtics already faced longer odds of reaching the finals after failing to capture home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, a crucial component to their championship run.'"

"'09-04-17,'1','Representative John P. Murtha, the Pennsylvania Democrat who is chairman of the House defense appropriations subcommittee, and Representative Neil Abercrombie, the Hawaii Democrat who leads a defense subcommittee that oversees Air Force programs, have said that splitting the order might be the only way to go. They said it could also save money over time if the companies had to keep competing for additional parts of the order.Mr. Gallois said that his team would bid on another “winner takes all” sweepstakes, though he expressed concern about whether the Pentagon would stick to the same bidding rules.He and Ralph D. Crosby Jr., the top executive of EADS North America, said that last year’s bidding was based on “best value.” The Northrop Grumman-EADS team won not only because its bid was cheaper but because the Air Force viewed its larger planes as having more capabilities.But in trying to develop a simpler process, Pentagon officials have talked of awarding the contract based on the lowest bid that is technically acceptable.Mr. Gallois and Mr. Crosby said they believed their team would win again if both price and capabilities were considered. But, they said, it would be hard to predict the results if the criteria were changed.EADS, which makes the Airbus planes, is Boeing’s biggest competitor for commercial airliners. It has also been pushing hard to expand its military contracting in the United States.Randy Belote, a spokesman for Northrop Grumman, said it would also support a split contract if the Pentagon decided that was the quickest way to start replacing the tanker fleet, which dates to the Eisenhower era.William A. Barksdale, a spokesman for Boeing, which is based in Chicago, said the company had taken no position “on which direction our customer should take” in awarding one contract or two.Mr. Gates has said he wants to seek bids this summer for a single contract and pick the winner by early next year.But with orders for commercial planes slowing at Boeing and Airbus, the stakes are rising. Mr. Murtha has said he might insert a provision to require a split contract in a supplemental financing bill before Congress if he does not think the Pentagon can develop a workable bidding process.Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican who is supporting Northrop Grumman and EADS, recently placed a hold on President Obama’s nomination of Ashton Carter to be the Pentagon acquisition chief. Mr. Shelby said he would like assurances from Mr. Carter that the competition would be “conducted in an open and transparent manner based on a best value process.”Mr. Belote said Northrop Grumman was also concerned that rebidding the contract would unfairly help Boeing.He said that after Northrop Grumman and EADS won the competition last year, Air Force officials provided detailed cost information from their bid to Boeing in explaining how the decision had been reached.“So if we get back into a re-competition, we would ask the question if this is irrevocably flawed,” Mr. Belote said.'"
"'09-04-17,'1','But the decision by Pfizer and Glaxo to form a joint venture focused on an entire drug category represents a new model of industry collaboration.“It does stand as a first,” said Kevin Scotcher, an analyst with Liberum Capital, an investment bank based in London and New York. H.I.V. drugs are a lucrative market, with global sales last year of about $12.3 billion — $7.2 billion of it in the United States, according to IMS Health, a market research firm.Glaxo will initially have an 85 percent equity interest in the joint venture. The combined entity, which will not have a name until the expected closure of the deal in the last quarter of this year, could save about $90 million annually by merging sales and management infrastructure, the companies said. Glaxo has been struggling to maintain its share of the H.I.V. market in the face of looming patent expirations on several of its drugs and rising competition.H.I.V. is typically treated with a cocktail of medications — including one kind of drug to stop the virus from entering cells and other kinds of drugs to inhibit it from replicating. Glaxo formerly led the field with Combivir, a pill that combines two H.I.V. drugs and is taken twice a day.But three years ago, Gilead introduced a pill that combines three drugs and can be taken once a day. The pill, called Atripla, combines two Gilead drugs with one from Bristol-Myers Squibb.Last year, Gilead’s H.I.V. franchise had sales of about $4.3 billion.And there are newer competitors. Isentress, a novel H.I.V. drug introduced by Merck in late 2007, had worldwide sales last year of $361 million.Glaxo’s H.I.V. franchise has had effectively flat sales for the last three years of about $2.2 billion annually, according to a note to investors from Alexandra Hauber, a JPMorgan analyst.Glaxo “had their lunch stolen by Gilead because they lost focus on the H.I.V. business,” said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink Swann.Pfizer, which is trying to complete its more than $62 billion acquisition of Wyeth, has not been an H.I.V. powerhouse. For its minority stake in the Glaxo partnership, it stands to gain access to Glaxo’s established marketing presence and distribution channels in the H.I.V. field.Glaxo’s portfolio would gain longevity with Selzentry, a new H.I.V. drug from Pfizer that does not face patent expiry in the United States until 2021, as well as several drugs Pfizer has under development. The joint venture could also develop new combinations of the companies’ existing drugs, Mr. Fernandez said.Shares of Pfizer rose 4 cents, to $13.90 on Thursday. Shares of Glaxo fell a penny, to $30.82. Shares of Gilead rose 31 cents, to $44.85.'"
"'09-04-17,'1','OTTAWA — Burdened by both debt and rapidly falling demand for its products, AbitibiBowater, the world’s largest newsprint maker, filed for bankruptcy protection on Thursday.The company is the product of several pulp and paper company takeovers and mergers. Those transactions left it controlling about 45 percent of the North American newsprint market but also struggling to refinance much of the $8.78 billion in debt it took on.At the same time, attempts by AbitibiBowater to raise newsprint prices by closing mills and reducing production were unable to keep pace with the precipitous fall in demand from the troubled newspaper industry.That combination led AbitibiBowater to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday in Delaware. Seth Kursman, a spokesman for the company, said that the company would make a separate request for protection under Canada’s creditor laws in its hometown, Montreal, on Friday.Mr. Kursman said the filing would have no immediate effect on the company’s 25 pulp and paper mills and 30 wood products plants. (Mills operated by AbitibiBowater units in Britain and South Korea are not covered by either bankruptcy filing.)But he declined to comment on what restructuring measures the company would propose to the two courts.“The paper and forest products industry is in a very turbulent period,” he said.A rapid decline in advertising has prompted some newspaper closings and industrywide cutbacks in the size, and in some cases the frequency, of newspapers. The Pulp and Paper Products Council, which is also based in Montreal, reported that in February alone newsprint demand in North America fell by 33 percent compared with the same month a year earlier.'"
"'09-04-17,'1','Unlike coalitions of the past, this time, political alliances will be stitched only after results are announced, adding to the uncertainty about what kind of government to expect. The elections take place as a worldwide financial crisis has begun to clip India’s economic growth, but the campaign has been dominated by debates over religion, caste, poverty and a variety of local issues. Every party has appealed to voters by promising bundles to the poor, from an expansion of a federal jobs program to free television sets.Here in Andhra Pradesh, one of 17 states where voting began Thursday, turnout was reported at 65 percent, voters’ concerns ranged from the parochial to the philosophical. In a working-class enclave called V. V. Girinagar, a woman named Vijaylakshmi, 33, said she would reward the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party because its local legislator had financed brick lanes in the neighborhood. P. Kishtaiah, 52, said that at election time every politician promised to legalize his illegally built slum, but that so far no one had kept that promise.Nearby, in a middle-class precinct, Uma Shekar, 40, who works at a software consulting firm, said he was fed up with corruption. He said his family had traditionally voted for Congress, but had turned to other parties in recent years as well. “Nothing is working,” he said.His father, Dasaratha Rama Iyer, 78, held himself up on his cane, and said he kept coming to vote for a higher cause.“God has allowed me to live to see that democracy is not demolished,” he said.Andhra Pradesh, with a population of more than 70 million, is one of the states that could make a difference in who rules India next. It is also a microcosm of the political trends in the country as a whole.Consider the flip-flop of its regional party boss, Chandrababu Naidu. He was once feted for bringing the technology companies to Hyderabad. His Telugu Desam Party had joined the B.J.P.-led coalition government in the center. Then he was defeated and so, too, the coalition.Today, with an eye on the political weathervane, Mr. Naidu has changed course. He shares the stage with communists and promises free televisions to the poor. He now believes the B.J.P.’s Hindu nationalist agenda — Hindutva, as it is called here — will not yield votes. “Everybody is worried about a bright future. They are not interested in this Hindutva,” he said in an interview.He is part of a new alliance called the Third Front. It vies to form a government without the two national parties; its chances are seen as slim, but it is still a thorn in each party’s side.The subtext of Indian politics is caste, and this year, there is a new entrant on the Andhra political stage: a movie star named Chiranjeevi, who casts himself as an alternative to Congress and Mr. Naidu’s party.The other day, as his campaign caravan crawled through the coastal city of Vishakhapatnam, he stood on top of a truck, arms outstretched, like a victorious boxer. He assailed corruption.“These days, politics is bad, it’s a business,” he said. “Enough is enough.”When the poll results come in, at least a half dozen smaller parties, representing India’s many regions and castes, are likely to jockey for government portfolios. There is even a small chance that one of their leaders could vie to be India’s next prime minister. India Today, a newsweekly, has called it “the rise of so many little Indias.”'"

"'09-04-18,'0','“We are satisfied that the court has clearly said that what they were doing was wrong,” Mr. Kennedy said.In the near term, the decision may have little effect on the day-to-day operations of Pirate Bay; the defendants have vowed to continue running the service as they appeal.Mr. Kennedy said music and movie industry groups planned to file additional litigation to try to get the site shut down. He said that while he expected the defendants to “hand over the baton” to others, that might be more difficult.Over the last decade, media companies have won a series of court victories around the world against file-sharing services like Napster, Kazaa and Grokster.But unauthorized copying remains a big problem, in particular for the record business. The music industry federation estimates that 95 percent of music downloads involve pirated work.Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Forrester Research, said the decision Friday would not result in a “meaningful” decrease in piracy. Internet users are turning to new ways to share music, including streaming and messaging services, which are harder for copyright owners and enforcement officials to detect.But he said the ruling was “good P.R.” for the music and movie industries.“There’s a lot of value out of it, even though its value is not going to be a meaningful reduction in file sharing,” Mr. Mulligan said. “They have to be seen to be doing something, in the same way that customs fights drug trafficking — as a deterrent.”Mr. Mulligan said the decision could encourage more music listeners to turn to services that provide “free” digital music legally, as part of a broadband subscription or with the support of advertising.“The best way to fight free is with free,” he said.The decision could also help alter perceptions of Sweden as a haven for piracy. A new law that took effect this month makes it easier for copyright owners to pursue illegal downloaders through the courts. Figures from Netnod, which operates Internet exchanges in Sweden, show that the volume of Internet traffic plunged as the law took effect — suggesting, analysts said, that some file-sharers may have been deterred.Pirate Bay could not be reached for comment on the decision. On the site, a notice was posted calling the decision a “crazy verdict.”“But as in all good movies, the heroes lose in the beginning but have an epic victory in the end anyhow,” it said. “That’s the only thing Hollywood ever taught us.”Pirate Bay is one of the largest so-called Bit Torrent trackers, which facilitate downloads of large digital files by enlisting the help of other computers.The defendants had maintained that they were innocent because they did not actually host any of the copyrighted material on their servers.As the media industries battle pirates in court, they have also been lobbying for tougher legislation against unauthorized file-sharing, but with limited success.In France last week, the National Assembly rejected a government proposal to cut off the Internet connections of persistent copyright pirates, in a surprise vote. President Nicolas Sarkozy has said the government will reintroduce the measure at the end of the month.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','The United States ’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis issued a report last week suggesting that current political and economic conditions are energizing right-wing extremist groups, that many of these groups follow extremely conservative ideologies and that some may seek to recruit and “radicalize” veterans returning from and .But, conservatives reacted by throwing a knee-jerk hissy fit. They twisted the report’s meaning to imply that they, and more importantly our war heroes, were being vilified by a partisan document.Their argument seeks to suppress and subjugate two rather unfortunate facts: while only a tiny number of conservatives and veterans are members of hate groups, nearly all hate groups do indeed follow far-right ideology. And they covet members with military experience.A report issued last summer by former President Bush’s entitled “White Supremacist Recruitment of Military Personnel since 9/11” said that “military experience is found throughout the white supremacist extremist movement” and that these groups “have attempted to increase their recruitment of current and former U.S. military personnel.”So, which soldiers are most vulnerable? According to the Homeland Security report, it would probably be those “facing significant challenges reintegrating into their communities.” This could be a large group because far too many soldiers come back from war broken men. According to a RAND study released on Friday, 300,000 veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan reported some sign of or . It said that only about half of those will seek help and only half of those seeking it will receive “minimally adequate” treatment.These soldiers could prove fertile ground for men hoping to prey on their fear, loneliness and dispossession.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','“If this succeeds, it’s going to be very hard for utilities to say, ‘Oh no no, you can’t do this,’ ” said Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist whose work inspired the proposal.The plan may get an attentive hearing in Washington, where President Obama has installed a team at the Energy Department and other agencies that is determined to put new clean-energy plans into effect.The Linden proposal builds on the work of Mr. Schrag and one of his graduate students, Kurt Zenz House. In a paper in 2006, they argued that layers of rock beneath the ocean floor might be the best place to bury the huge amounts of carbon dioxide that industrial societies emit into the atmosphere.SCS Energy, which hired Mr. Schrag as a consultant after learning of that work, has specialized in tricky projects. Despite intense opposition, it succeeded in building a power plant fired by natural gas that began operating in Astoria, Queens, in 2006.The company has struck a deal to pay $95 million for an old DuPont chemical factory site at Grasselli Point in Linden. The site is near rail lines and barges that can deliver coal. More than a dozen permits are needed from state and federal agencies, and those are likely to take years.In an unusual twist, SCS says it intends to bolt a fertilizer plant onto the power plant to improve the economics. When power prices are high, the plant would concentrate on making electricity, but when they are low, it would also make nitrogen fertilizer.Richard J. Gerbounka, the mayor of Linden, said he was “very excited about the project,” which would help redevelop a desolate industrial area.A buried steel pipe, two feet in diameter, would transport liquid carbon dioxide from the power plant to a site 70 miles offshore, beneath half a mile of water. A well would inject the carbon dioxide to a depth of about a mile below the sea floor, into a layer of ancient sandstone. Mr. Schrag said the carbon dioxide would stay there for millions of years, kept down by a thick layer of mud and the weight of the sea. Not even earthquakes or underwater landslides would be likely to dislodge it, he said.“The worst thing that could happen is a little bit of CO2 escaping into the atmosphere,” said Dean Malouta, the manager of technology for exploration and production for Shell’s Americas region, which has financed some related research.A well would be drilled to reduce the pressure and release the seawater displaced by the carbon dioxide, providing a better way to manage pressure than is possible on land, Mr. Schrag said.Already, some oil companies pump carbon dioxide into their drilling fields in places like Texas, to help squeeze out more oil. The carbon dioxide put underground has mostly remained there, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere.But capturing carbon dioxide from power plants is expected to be costly, adding 25 percent or more to operating expenses, in addition to higher construction costs. In this country, utilities are planning only modest demonstration projects. One larger project in Illinois, FutureGen, was abandoned by the Bush administration as costs escalated.Worldwide, more than a dozen projects are under way to store power plant emissions. Norway is the only country to have undertaken a large project to bury greenhouse gas emissions under the sea floor, at the Sleipner gas field 155 miles off the coast in the North Sea. That project has been going safely for 13 years, but it buries less than a quarter of the amount of carbon dioxide as proposed in New Jersey.Environmental groups have been divided over whether this approach is a good idea. “The burden of proof is clearly going to be on the project developers” to prove the geological suitability of undersea storage, said Mark Brownstein of the Environmental Defense Fund.Partly because of tight regulations and environmental opposition, no coal-fired plants have been built in New Jersey since the mid-1990s, and even renewable energy projects can be hard to site along the East Coast because of the difficulty of obtaining permits.“It’s an exciting project, but it’s an unproven technology at the scale proposed,” said Elaine Makatura, a spokeswoman for the Department of Environmental Protection in New Jersey, which has had preliminary meetings with the developers.The company sees the main hurdle as financing. SCS has begun informally talking with banks, and hopes to sidestep the credit crisis because it will not need large sums until about 2011. “As a business investment in the electricity industry, it’s an attractive investment,” said Frank Smith, a founder of SCS.The company hopes to tap close to $100 million a year in federal tax credits for its technology and says it believes it can turn a profit without additional grants. The plan features not only the fertilizer plant, but also other aspects that would improve the finances.For instance, the carbon dioxide disposal pipe would be large enough to carry emissions not only from the power plant but also from factories nearby, a potentially valuable service if the government cracked down on emissions.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','LOS ANGELES (AP) — Jody McCrea, best known for acting in the “Beach Party” movies in the 1960s, died on April 4 in New Mexico, where he had become a cattle rancher. He was 74.The cause was cardiac arrest, Mr. McCrea’s brother Peter told The Los Angeles Times.Mr. McCrea appeared in a string of “Beach Party” movies, comedies starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, including “Muscle Beach Party,” “Bikini Beach,” “Pajama Party,” “Beach Blanket Bingo” and “How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.”Mr. McCrea also appeared in other films and television shows, a number of them western-themed, including “Wichita Town, ” “The Broken Land,” “Young Guns of Texas” and “Cry Blood, Apache.”Mr. McCrea, originally Joel Dee McCrea, was a son of the movie stars Joel McCrea and Frances Dee. His wife, Dusty, died in 1996.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','Mr. O’Hare resigned in January 1966, and Mr. Dodd dismissed other members of the staff. In the first case before the newly created Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, renamed the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in 1977, senators questioned whether Mr. Dodd had misused his influence to help a lobbyist representing West Germany.The next year, the committee looked into possible financial improprieties, with Mr. O’Hare using documents to support his accusation that Mr. Dodd had sent travel expense bills for speaking engagements to both the Senate and the group he was addressing, as well as misusing $116,083 in campaign contributions.Mr. Dodd strongly rebutted Mr. O’Hare’s testimony, called his bookkeeping “sloppy,” and said his previous confidence in the aide was “misplaced.” Mr. Boyd suggested that the senator needed to discredit Mr. O’Hare’s testimony because “it could put Dodd in jail if it wasn’t broken.”As a result, the case often became the word of the senator against the word of his bookkeeper. The two gave different accounts about who had signed the senator’s personal checks at various times. Ms. O’Hare said that if her husband had not lent his authority to the investigation, “it wouldn’t have stuck — and Dodd knew that.”In March 1967, Pearson and Anderson wrote a column purporting to explain Mr. Dodd’s lapses. They said he was an alcoholic, an accusation Mr. Boyd said was correct. The columnists, presumably quoting Mr. O’Hare, said he ordered whiskey for the senator, called his home to say Mr. Dodd would be late on Senate business when he was inebriated, and then took him home when he had sobered up sufficiently.On June 23, 1967, the Senate censured Mr. Dodd, by a vote of 92 to 5, for using campaign money for his personal benefit. They exonerated him, 51 to 45, of double-billing, in part because Mr. O’Hare was the only witness on that point. The New York Times said that another reason was the skittishness of senators who worried that they might have accidentally double-billed themselves. The Senate later formulated an ethics code that was clearer on such matters.Mr. Dodd held his Senate seat until January 1971, after losing a re-election bid in 1970. He died in May 1971.Michael Vincent O’Hare was born on Jan. 25, 1936, in Jersey City. He graduated from high school at 17, served in the Marines from 1953 to 1956, then graduated from Catholic University, where he majored in sociology after starting in engineering.After being fired by Mr. Dodd, he worked for Southern Railway, Big Brothers, the Overseas Development Council, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Naval Medical Research Center.A previous marriage, to the former Pauline Parpey, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Kate O’Hare Giovanello; two children from his second marriage, Owen and Margaret O’Hare; his sister, Catherine Simon; and his brothers, Edward, Robert and Jack.The intensity of the Dodd controversy showed dramatically in June 1966. On a day when ethics committee hearings were being held, Mr. O’Hare passed a table in a Senate coffee shop where the senator’s son Jeremy was sitting. The younger Mr. Dodd said, “Wait a minute, Mike.”According to a report in The Times, Mr. O’Hare said Mr. Dodd then poked a finger in his chest and said, “When this thing is over, I’m going to follow you to your grave.”'"
"'09-04-18,'0','“From a purely aesthetic perspective, it’s very different,” Mr. Arnett said. “It takes a little bit of getting used to.” Most of the time, he added, “you end up forgetting” that the backdrops are photographs.The dysfunctional high school concept is adapted from Australia, where a live-action version of the series was shown in 2001. Mitch Hurwitz, an executive producer and co-creator, envisioned the American edition as a live-action sitcom, too, but TV executives thought his script was “too broad” and directed him to revise it.“I didn’t want to rewrite it and make every character plausible,” he said in a telephone interview, so instead he pitched it to Fox as an animated sitcom.“I was being lazy,” he said.Mr. Hurwitz asked Mr. Willems, a Brooklyn author whose “Knuffle Bunny” books for children have combined photographs and hand-drawn characters, to design the characters. (Because of the content, Mr. Willems asked not to be credited on the show.)Mr. Hurwitz has said that the photographs help to reset the comedy bar for the writers, “so that you don’t expect animals to talk or U.F.O.’s to land.” (“American Dad,” another creation of Mr. MacFarlane’s, features a talking fish and a space alien.)It also helps distinguish “Shut Up” from the other shows. Mr. Hurwitz said he knew that he could not compete with “The Simpsons” or “Family Guy.”“I’ve always personally been interested in trying to do something new,” he said.In the first minutes of the first episode of “Shut Up,” the characters will start tapping on the fourth wall of television. “They’re slightly aware that they’re in a TV show,” Mr. Hurwitz said.Jason Bateman plays the gym teacher Larry Littlejunk, perhaps the only person in the school who would pass a teacher certification test. In the first episode, while Larry talks about a science teacher who climbed naked out of a papier-mâché monkey to rebut the theory of evolution, he asks out loud, “Can I get a flashback on this?” Refused a flashback by the imaginary director, Larry and the acting principal joke about whether the presumed censors will allow the phrase “fuzzy monkey.”Mr. Hurwitz said he added another TV reference near the end of the premiere episode, when the football coach rallies the team by saying to the students, “You can win this one; it’s the pilot!” In a later episode a character refers to six hours spent in a harness for a special-effects shot that the show will never end up using.Mr. Hurwitz said the characters’ self-awareness “kind of emerged” in the writing process. “It wasn’t really a choice,” he said.“ ‘Family Guy’ has been so ambitious and so brilliant in its referencing of popular culture,” he said. “You’ve got to find some way to go further. You certainly can’t beat them with that stuff.”On a couple of occasions, he added: “The writing staff would put in a talking animal, and I would take it out. It seemed like we were doing someone else’s act.”Mr. Hurwitz’s awareness about “Family Guy” extended to the setting of his series. When it was ordered by Fox last year, the show was set in a fishing town in the Northeast. The fact that “Family Guy” is set in Rhode Island influenced the show’s relocation to Florida.Fox’s next animated series, a spinoff of “Family Guy” titled “The Cleveland Show,” will feature two talking bears in its cast. Both “Sit Down, Shut Up” and “The Cleveland Show” are part of Fox’s effort to expand its animation brand. The network canceled “King of the Hill,” a 12-year-old animated series about a family in a small Texas town, earlier this year.The producers hired a number of well-known actors for the character voices. They recruited Mr. Arnett, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Winkler, whom Mr. Hurwitz had worked with on “Arrested Development,” along with Will Forte, Cheri Oteri and Kenan Thompson of “Saturday Night Live” fame. Mr. Winkler, best known for playing the Fonz on “Happy Days,” plays a gray-haired German teacher who is best summed up by his catchphrase: “If I believed in reincarnation, I’d kill myself tonight.”The show is likely to attract some viewers who still long for “Arrested Development,” an eccentric look at an extended family that was canceled by Fox three years ago. Mr. Arnett said, “The jokes and the stories are of the same tenor.”Mr. Arnett said viewers could expect a strain of social commentary in the series, something Mr. Hurwitz was known for with “Arrested.” The first episodes include some jokes about inadequate financing of schools. But Mr. Hurwitz said too heavy a dose of commentary would distract from the series, especially given the country’s political and economic climate.Referring to the series’s live-action roots, he sarcastically said, “If anything, I’m attacking the Australian school system.”'"
"'09-04-18,'0','“There was a real herd mentality to get into investment banking,” said Ms. Levy, noting that prestige, peer pressure and parents often channeled students to Wall Street. But because of the crisis, “there was suddenly permission to pursue something you were interested in that your parents three years ago would have said absolutely no to.”For many students at Wharton, part of the University of Pennsylvania, the Wall Street crisis has fostered a sense of relief. Some students now acknowledge that they were pursuing investment banking jobs largely to placate parents who, having invested nearly $200,000 in their children’s educations, were eager for them to earn top dollar — and some prestige too.Of course, many students who coveted Wall Street jobs have landed them: the prestige firms that remain are doing plenty of hiring, although substantially less than in years past. And some finance majors shut out of Wall Street jobs have accepted back-up options, often lesser banks in smaller cities. But many who thirsted for big investment banking bonuses are looking at decidedly down-market alternatives, everything from Teach for America to computer engineering.“It’s always been about the brass ring and it’s always been about the brand recognition, and for a lot of students that meant jobs at Goldman Sachs,” said Emanuel Sturman, director of career services at Dartmouth College. “It’s premature to say the bloom is off the rose totally, but I think students are starting to look at a wider array of brass rings.”College officials say that the sweeping changes on Wall Street will affect not only finance-minded members of the class of ’09 but also tens of thousands of juniors, sophomores and freshmen, as well as future students, leading them to rethink their majors and their career goals.After doing an internship at Goldman Sachs last summer and not being offered a full-time job there, Katie Shea, a senior at the Stern School of Business at New York University, is instead pursuing her dreams of entrepreneurship. She has founded a shoe company that designs and imports collapsible shoes that women can wear while walking to work and then stuff into their pocketbooks.“For me, the Wall Street crisis was a blessing in disguise,” said Ms. Shea.Not everyone feels that way. For many undergraduates with their eyes on Wall Street, the financial sector crisis created panic — and confusion in their job searches. Ms. Levy says she interviewed at Lehman Brothers one day, and it filed for bankruptcy the next day.“Over the past three years, you saw 10 to 12 kids from Wharton going to each of the top five banks,” said Jeremy Cohn, a Wharton senior. “This year there are probably zero to 2 or 3 students going to each of those banks.”Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other banks declined to discuss how much they have reduced job offers. But college officials estimate the decline in financial sector job offers is 10 to 50 percent. And it is also affecting M.B.A. students.Jana Kierstead, director of M.B.A. career services at Harvard Business School, said the number of job postings over all had declined 30 percent from last year, with a 40 percent drop among financial institutions.“The number of firms coming to campus was relatively the same, but the number of positions they’re recruiting for has been reduced,” she said.Ms. Kierstead said 78 percent of Harvard’s second-year M.B.A. students had job offers, down from 90 percent at this time last year.At Wharton, the number of on-campus interviews for the school’s 600 undergraduates fell 20 percent, from 13,000 last year.Last year, starting salaries for undergraduates going to top financial firms typically ran from $55,000 to $70,000, with an $8,000 signing bonus. And their annual bonus often equaled their starting salary. This year, starting salaries are roughly the same, with signing bonuses often falling to $4,000. As for expectations of fat bonuses, they have gone the way of Bear Stearns.Some students have grown frustrated and suspended their job search. As a result, Patricia Rose, the University of Pennsylvania’s director of career services, recently sent out a message saying: “We are hearing from some students that they are discouraged, and have stopped applying for jobs because so many other candidates are competing with them, some undoubtedly more qualified. Resist this impulse! By not applying, you are rejecting yourself.”She reminded them, “You are attending one of the world’s finest universities.”“So hang in there,” she concluded. “And most importantly, believe in yourself.”While some Wharton seniors are struggling, many have done well. Jeremy Cohn, for example, has been hired by Lazard Freres’ real estate group. Mickey Ashmore, a former Goldman Sachs intern, has accepted an offer with Microsoft’s finance division. Anthony Orlando and Nanxi Ling will work for Oliver Wyman, a Manhattan consulting firm that advises floundering banks.But Oliver Wyman has asked them to push back their start date to January.“We’re all young; we’ll all get a job,” Mr. Ashmore said. “This isn’t going to last forever.”A job offer can, of course, make all the difference.Daniel Miller, the student who was contemplating rabbinical school, had suspended his job search, intent on savoring his last few weeks before graduation.“I have the next 60 years of my life to worry about work,” he said. “I’m fortunate I don’t have any college debt and have a very supportive family. I can’t imagine what it’s like for someone less fortunate than me.”But last Thursday, a real estate investment firm outside Philadelphia offered him a job. Rabbinical school can wait.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','Brandeis University said on Friday that it would allow its Rose Art Museum, above, to remain open while its fate is being decided. University trustees voted in January to close the museum with the goal of selling artworks to raise money to aid Brandeis’s ailing endowment. After the vote, the university backtracked, saying that no works would be sold in the immediate future and that the building would remain open as an art-study center. The Massachusetts attorney general’s office is reviewing Brandeis’s plans. In a letter to the university on Friday, Marty Wyngaarden Krauss, Brandeis’s provost, said the museum’s current exhibitions would be extended through May 17 and then closed while the shows are taken down and an exhibition of works from the permanent collection, chosen by a three-member professional staff, is hung. The museum will reopen to the public on July 22.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','A footnote to another of the memos described a rift between line officers questioning Abu Zubaydah at a secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand and their bosses at headquarters, and asserted that the brutal treatment may have been “unnecessary.”Quoting a 2004 report on the interrogation program by the C.I.A. inspector general, the footnote says that “although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within C.I.A. headquarters still believed he was withholding information.”The debate over the significance of Abu Zubaydah’s role in Al Qaeda and of what he told interrogators dates back almost to his capture, and has been described by Ron Suskind in his 2006 book, “The One Percent Doctrine,” a 2006 article in The New York Times and a March 29 article in The Washington Post asserting that his disclosures foiled no plots. (His real name is Zein al-Abideen Mohamed Hussein.)But interviews with current and former government officials who have direct or indirect knowledge of the Abu Zubaydah interrogation suggest that the United States began the waterboarding, labeled as illegal torture by top Obama administration officials, based on a profound misunderstanding of its captive.In March 2002, when Abu Zubaydah was captured in Pakistan after a gunfight with Pakistani security officers backed by F.B.I. and C.I.A. officers, Bush administration officials portrayed him as a Qaeda leader. That judgment was reflected in the Aug. 1, 2002, legal opinion signed by Jay S. Bybee, then head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel.The memo summarizes the C.I.A.’s judgment that Abu Zubaydah, then 31, had risen rapidly to “third or fourth man in Al Qaeda” and had served as “senior lieutenant” to Osama bin Laden. It said he had “managed a network of training camps” and had been “involved in every major terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda.”The memo reported the C.I.A.’s portrayal of “a highly self-directed individual who prizes his independence,” a deceptive narcissist, healthy and tough, who agency officers believed was the most senior terrorist caught since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.His interrogation, according to multiple accounts, began in Pakistan and continued at the secret C.I.A. site in Thailand, with a traditional, rapport-building approach led by two F.B.I. agents, who even helped care for him as his gunshot wounds healed.Abu Zubaydah gave up perhaps his single most valuable piece of information early, naming Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, whom he knew as Mukhtar, as the main organizer of the 9/11 plot.A C.I.A. interrogation team that arrived a week or two later, which included former military psychologists, did not change the approach to questioning, but began to keep him awake night and day with blasting rock music, have his clothes removed and keep his cell cold.The legal basis for this treatment is uncertain, but lawyers at C.I.A. headquarters were in constant touch with interrogators, as well as with Mr. Bybee’s subordinate in the Office of Legal Counsel, John C. Yoo, who was drafting memos on the legal limits of interrogation.Through the summer of 2002, Abu Zubaydah continued to provide valuable information. Interrogators began to surmise that he was not a leader, but rather a helpful training camp personnel clerk who would arrange false documents and travel for jihadists, including Qaeda members.He knew enough to give interrogators “a road map of Al Qaeda operatives,” an agency officer said. He also repeated talk he had heard about possible plots or targets in the United States, though when F.B.I. agents followed up, most of it turned out to be idle discussion or preliminary brainstorming.At the time, former C.I.A. officials say, his tips were extremely useful, helping to track several other important terrorists, including Mr. Mohammed.But senior agency officials, still persuaded, as they had told President George W. Bush and his staff, that he was an important Qaeda leader, insisted that he must know more.“You get a ton of information, but headquarters says, ‘There must be more,’ ” recalled one intelligence officer who was involved in the case. As described in the footnote to the memo, the use of repeated waterboarding against Abu Zubaydah was ordered “at the direction of C.I.A. headquarters,” and officials were dispatched from headquarters “to watch the last waterboard session.”The memo, written in 2005 and signed by Steven G. Bradbury, who worked in the Office of Legal Counsel, concluded that the waterboarding was justified even if the prisoner turned out not to know as much as officials had thought.And he did not, according to the former intelligence officer involved in the Abu Zubaydah case. “He pleaded for his life,” the official said. “But he gave up no new information. He had no more information to give.”Abu Zubaydah’s own account, given in 2006 to the International Committee of the Red Cross, corroborates that what he called “the real torturing,” including waterboarding, began only “about two and a half or three months” after he arrived at the secret site, according to the group’s 2007 report.Since 2002, the C.I.A. has downgraded its assessment of Abu Zubaydah’s significance, while continuing to call his revelations important.In an interview, an intelligence officer said that the current view was that Abu Zubaydah was “an important terrorist facilitator” who disclosed “essential raw material for successful counterterrorist action.”His interrogation “made it possible for the United States to chip away at Al Qaeda, link by link, disrupting its operations and saving lives,” the intelligence officer said.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','The opening sequence of “Nearly Ninety” is an accumulation of male-female duets (the genre in which it is easiest to recognize Mr. Cunningham’s pre-eminence among today’s dance-makers) until five couples are onstage together. The tempo remains adagio, the mood lunar, with certain recurrent arm motifs. The detailed accentuation that makes every couple singular is one of many marvels.Next comes a “Ronde” sequence of male-female duets: Mr. A dances with Ms. B, then Ms. B with Mr. C, then Mr. C with Ms. D, and so on. Here both the entrances and exits of each performer are special events. Most of the men come running onstage and then stop with a marvelous chugging hop-skip and bend, but Brandon Collwes enters with a quietly grand “hail” gesture. Among the women’s entries, Emma Desjardins’s slow, weighty one causes a frisson.Each duet is a paradox, taking ideas of human connection and independence (sometimes simultaneous, sometimes alternating) further than before — often the two dancers meet without facing each other — climaxing in a long duet for Daniel Squire and Jennifer Goggans that passes through several moods.Always you feel Mr. Cunningham’s mind inquiring, “What’s a duet?” Or “Is this a duet?”: frequently man and woman dance different solos at the same time without apparent interest in each other, only to rejoin, as if inevitably.Superb as these duets are as both dance and drama — Part 2 has a yet more remarkable one for Mr. Mitchell and Ms. Weber — the best parts of “Nearly Ninety” occur in its trios and solos. Part 1’s series of three trios, each for two men and one woman, brings one amazement after another: Mr. Cunningham’s imagination, so often like Haydn’s in its wit, here recalls the composer of the late piano trios, pressing forward into uncharted terrain.The first trio is the most immediately striking: Holley Farmer (the most authoritative and audacious of Mr. Cunningham’s current dancers, never more riveting), with Koji Mizuta and Silas Riener. In one image Ms. Farmer is pivoted in a diagonal line (about 30 degrees off the floor) between the two men; Mr. Riener is on his back, Mr. Mizuta upright. The concentration of all three (Mr. Riener is doing as much to push Ms. Farmer upward as Mr. Mizuta is to keep her from falling) is sensational. The image changes, but the concentration continues. Then, halfway through the trio, she takes charge, seeming to pull the two men slowly but adamantly across the stage.The next trio (Melissa Toogood, with Mr. Collwes and Mr. Squire) is in a wholly fresh tone: full of changes of direction, rapid (Ms. Toogood is held at that same 30-degree angle, but briskly), the three more often apart than together. Then in a third trio Ms. Weber is supported by Mr. Mitchell and Daniel Madoff in a series of ravishing adagio bends, falling or bending forward or backward, pacing or rotating this way or that.Part 2’s outstanding sequence is its series of eight solos, danced by Mr. Collwes, Marcie Munnerlyn, Mr. Mizuta, Ms. Toogood, Mr. Madoff, Ms. Weber, Mr. Riener and Mr. Mitchell. Each solo is quite unlike — and yet better than — the last; each abounds in brilliant self-contradictions. And each is dramatic, not least in the ways in which Mr. Cunningham develops the focus of each dancer’s head and eyes.A few images brand the memory: the way Mr. Collwes, standing, very slowly turns his gaze in a horizontal arc beyond 180 degrees. How Mr. Mizuta, holding his body off the floor as if in push-ups, crosses his legs at the ankle and turns sideways, propping himself in a diagonal line on one hand, stretching one arm high; then he gradually turns his head to look up its length. A fast series of powerfully witty waddling steps on the spot by Mr. Riener. And — above all — a slow, pendulumlike side-to-side swing of the pelvis by Mr. Mitchell, his feet wide apart and his knees bent.But all these solos are miraculously unpredictable and diverse; here is the clue to Mr. Cunningham’s conception of human nature. Who could, for example, guess in advance how Mr. Mitchell, after that startling pelvic beginning, would end his solo? (An exuberant circuit of jumps around the stage. Each one hovers and strikes a different shape.)The music, composed and performed by John Paul Jones, Takehisa Kosugi and Sonic Youth (Kim Gordon, Thurston Moore, Lee Ranaldo, Steve Shelley), sounds now like a rock musician’s worst hangover, as if the pot and the kettle were calling each other every color under the sun before settling down and breeding a whole tribe of tintinnabulations. One powerful guitar chord out of the blue happened on Thursday to coincide with the most electrifying gear change in the Goggans-Squire duet, but even such moments are mere effects.Benedetta Tagliabue’s 3-D metallic-looking décor behaves as if it were the show’s star. Seen first in silhouette but later advancing to center stage and requiring eight stagehands to rotate it, it looks like an ugly science-fiction cross between various Marcel Duchamp works (“Nude Descending a Staircase,” “The Bride and the Bachelors”) and some “Star Wars” battleship. It houses the musicians, one of whom aims his guitar around as if to vacuum it.At one point the set even opens an upper level, on which Julie Cunningham dances a solo. (It’s as if pirates were making her walk the plank.) This music and set are among several trying-to-be-trendy errors of artistic judgment in recent years from Mr. Cunningham and his collaborators. (The worst was Ernesto Neto’s repulsive décor for the 2004 work “Views on Stage.”)But several of Franc Aleu’s video effects in Part 1 (close-ups of ripples and liquids) are appealing. And Romeo Gigli’s costumes — each dancer wears three sets of patterned all-over tights — are very fine: the third set features blue bouquets across the chest, like birthday greetings to Mr. Cunningham. Brian MacDevitt’s lighting often helps to make the movement all the more tremendous.The two factors that make “Nearly Ninety” exceptional, though, remain the choreography and the performances. Mr. Cunningham’s dance imagination actually appears more fertile than ever before. Onward!'"
"'09-04-18,'0','The program is a joint effort by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; the Roll Back Malaria Partnership; the governments of Norway, Britain and the Netherlands; and the Unitaid partnership of 30 countries raising money through airline ticket fees.Heavily subsidizing the private malaria medicine market was first proposed in 2004 by a committee of the Institute of Medicine of the American Academy of Sciences led by Kenneth Arrow, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Clinton Foundation backed the plan.The United States has declined to put any money in yet. Dr. Bernard Nahlen, deputy coordinator of the President’s Malaria Initiative, said that he wanted more studies proving that subsidies would work before hundreds of millions of dollars were invested in them.“I sometimes joke that this is the biggest faith-based initiative in the world of malaria,” he said. “I’m perfectly willing to be convinced, but sometimes the advocacy gets out ahead of the evidence.”Mr. Adeyi of the World Bank task force said that “a few pilot studies” had convinced the plan’s backers that it would work, but Dr. Nahlen dismissed those as “two highly controlled Clinton Foundation studies in two districts in Tanzania.”The law that Congress passed last year authorizing $48 billion for AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria specifically forbids donations to the Affordable Medicines program until the head of malaria activities for the government has “compelling evidence of success from pilot programs.”The program will be rolled out in Cambodia and 10 African countries, and re-evaluated after two years.At the base of the dispute are a few details that make fighting malaria different from fighting AIDS or tuberculosis. Those diseases kill slowly, and drugs for them are handed out at public health clinics.But cerebral malaria can kill a child in 24 hours, so antimalaria drugs must be sold everywhere, ideally within walking distance of even the remotest village. Many brands are stocked by pharmacies and even in small huts whose owners sell soap, matches and cooking oil.The World Health Organization now endorses first-line treatment only with cocktails of artemisinin and at least one other drug. Artemisinin, a derivative of artemisia annua or sweet wormwood, was developed by the Chinese in the 1970s — originally on the orders of Mao to help the North Vietnamese.The intent of the subsidy is to crowd out of the market older drugs like chloroquine and Fansidar, to which resistance is common, as well as artemisinin monotherapy, because taking any drug by itself greatly increases the chance that the parasite will develop resistance.Only three companies — Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis and Ajanta, an Indian generics company — now make cocktails of two drugs in one pill that have been accepted by the World Health Organization. Several other drugs made by other companies are expected to qualify soon.Drug companies usually sell artemisinin combination therapy at $1 to governments but $4 to private wholesalers. By the time it reaches village level, it may cost 10 to 40 times as much as chloroquine, which reduces fever the way that aspirin does but does not kill parasites.Complicating matters further is the lack of diagnosis before treatment. Fearful parents often buy malaria drugs whenever a child spikes a fever, but some studies show that up to 90 percent of fevers are not malaria. In those situations, subsidies are costly and wasteful.Dr. Nahlen endorsed programs like those in Ethiopia, in which 30,000 village health workers are taught to use rapid test kits. But those are not widely available in Africa yet.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Herbert M. Allison Jr., 65, who has been chief executive of Fannie Mae since it was seized by the government in September, has been chosen to oversee the $700 billion financial bailout fund, the White House said Friday.Mr. Allison’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the Senate before he can succeed Neel T. Kashkari and become Treasury assistant secretary for financial stability.In that role, Mr. Allison will be charged with overseeing several federal programs meant to improve the availability of credit, aid major automakers and bolster the housing market.Mr. Allison was named chief executive of Fannie Mae in September as the housing market soured and pushed the company and its sibling agency, Freddie Mac, to the brink of collapse.He had spent more than 25 years with the investment bank Merrill Lynch before becoming chairman and chief executive of the pension fund giant TIAA-CREF.After six years as the head of TIAA-CREF, Mr. Allison retired in 2008 and was asked by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., to become conservator of Fannie Mae, the nation’s largest source of housing finance.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','Facing Vinnie Chulk with no outs, Damon on first and the Indians leading by a run, Teixeira saw a changeup tailing away. Instead of serving the pitch to left or taking it, Teixeira tried to pull it, bouncing a weak squibber off the end of his bat.Chulk fielded it, squared his feet — and threw the ball away. Damon chugged home as the ball skipped past first base, and the game was tied, 5-5. That allowed Yankees Manager Joe Girardi to call for his hottest pitcher, Brian Bruney.Bruney said he had gotten away with some pitches lately, fastballs down the middle or hanging breaking balls. But after another scoreless inning Friday, these are the results of his last six appearances: 17 batters retired in a row, 12 with strikeouts.“He’s been extremely good,” Girardi said. “He was extremely good last year. We just continue to put him in tough situations and he continues to do the job. That’s what you expect of a guy who has the type of stuff Bruney has.”Bruney earned his second victory in three days because Jeter connected off Jensen Lewis in the eighth. Jeter was hitless in his first four at-bats, striking out on a wicked slider from Joe Smith with a runner on second to end the sixth.But he delivered in the eighth, after Lewis struck out the first two hitters but fell behind in the count, 3-1. When Jeter crossed the plate, he met Teixeira, who said he told him simply, “You’re a great player.” The fans agreed, calling Jeter from the dugout for a familiar curtain call.“It’s the same dimensions, same field,” Jeter said. “It’s a little different in the stands, but it felt about the same.”The Yankees’ starter, Joba Chamberlain, was not the same pitcher who looked so sharp in Kansas City last Sunday. He threw 47 balls and 46 strikes on Friday, walking five and allowing six hits and five runs. Girardi pulled him with two outs in the fifth after Ryan Garko doubled off the left-field wall.The Indians ran aggressively on Damon, scoring twice from second on hard-hit singles to left. But Chamberlain hurt himself by putting too many runners on base.Chamberlain stands on the third-base side of the rubber, and when he tried to locate pitches on that side of the plate, he said, his command was sharp. But it was shaky to the first-base side, as pitches he tried to fire to the corner wound up down the middle.As a result, Chamberlain was gone early, leaving four relievers to collect the last 13 outs. The pitchers who faltered in the home opener, Jose Veras and Damaso Marte, did not pitch.“Everybody presses the panic button when the bullpen does whatever,” Chamberlain said. “But those guys are awesome down there.”They were on Friday, and so were the hitters, at least on five big swings. Besides Damon, Teixeira and Jeter, Melky Cabrera and Robinson Cano hit home runs for the Yankees. Every one — plus another by Cleveland’s Mark DeRosa — was to right field.DeRosa made the game’s final out against Mariano Rivera, who allowed two singles with one out but struck out Grady Sizemore and DeRosa for the save. Rivera was throwing to Jose Molina, who replaced Jorge Posada for defense in the ninth.Girardi said he would do this sometimes, especially early in the season in close games, because of Molina’s superior arm strength. Posada is recovering from shoulder surgery but threw out Sizemore on a stolen-base attempt Thursday.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','On Sunday, I returned from vacation, picked up the mail and found a disturbing letter from Charles Schwab & Company. It said that it had discovered unauthorized money transfers out of accounts associated with the financial planning firm I use.The situation was even worse than I had feared. It was my own planner, who was under investigation for siphoning off what appeared to be millions of dollars from client accounts. And, as Schwab’s note helpfully suggested, it might be a good idea to take another look at my statements for the last few years.In case it is not glaringly obvious, I write a personal finance column for a living. I am also the kind of person who derives joy from reading the fine print on bank statements and runs spreadsheets on my credit card spending. I thought I knew what I was doing. So if I can get mixed up in something like this, trust me, it can happen to anyone.So how did this happen?It starts, oddly enough, with one of my old articles. In 2003, when I was at The Wall Street Journal, I did a sort of secret shopper column on seeking financial advice. My wife and I had a couple of questions that we needed to answer, and we put them to five different types of advisers.One of them was Matthew Weitzman, who had started AFW Asset Management (now known as AFW Wealth Advisors) a few years earlier with his high school friend Jay Furst. We liked Mr. Weitzman’s advice and demeanor. His disciplinary record was clean and he had gone to good schools (Cornell undergraduate, Columbia M.B.A.). While we didn’t talk to him much over the next six years, his advice was always wise, and he was willing to work with us even though we had less money than his other clients.Fast-forward to last weekend and cue my jaw hitting the floor as I realized what the note from Schwab was implying. Sure enough, the next day AFW sent me an e-mail message  which another planner there said I should have received before the Schwab letter arrived  offering a bit more detail.According to AFW’s note, there were “certain irregularities in a limited number of client accounts.” The firm said it believed that less than 5 percent of client assets were missing but added that it might find more accounts that were short some money.Within 24 hours of learning of the problem, AFW said, it notified the Securities and Exchange Commission, the United States attorney’s office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The first two declined to confirm or deny that there was any investigation, and an F.B.I. spokeswoman did not return my calls.AFW also said that “in a related matter,” Mr. Weitzman was now on leave, was not expected to return (ever) and would have “no further contact with any client accounts.”It is too early to say exactly what happened and who is responsible. Mr. Weitzman did not respond to my repeated attempts to speak with him this week. But his lawyer, Marc Mukasey, who leads the white-collar criminal defense practice at Bracewell & Giuliani in New York, called me back. “Matt Weitzman has not been charged with a crime or any violations,” he said. “We’re looking forward to a resolution of this matter that satisfies everybody.”After I scoured five years’ worth of account statements and crosschecked online, I found nothing missing from our Schwab accounts. But I still wanted to know, as both a reporter and a client, how others’ money could disappear. So I called Schwab and asked.Under normal circumstances, clients can allow a range of access and trading privileges on their investment accounts. Some trusting types grant full power of attorney to their advisers, even allowing check-writing privileges. Other customers allow read-only access to account statements and balances, preferring to make any trades or wire transfers themselves.One possible explanation of what went on here, according to Schwab, is a case of forged signatures. At least one client with missing money claims never to have authorized the transfers. Yet there are signed documents granting permission to move the funds. The question investigators have to answer now is who signed the names.“AFW views these potentially unauthorized transactions as the isolated acts of Mr. Weitzman,” AFW said in a statement in response to my request for comment. Mr. Furst added, “AFW, its many clients and I are saddened, angered and betrayed by the apparent actions of Mr. Weitzman.” The statement added, “AFW is sorry for any harm this has caused to its clients.”Getting the money back to its rightful owners would be a good way to make good on the apology. Unfortunately, neither Schwab nor AFW can yet say for sure exactly how or when that will happen. If you are an AFW client, or if you know Mr. Furst or Mr. Weitzman personally and would like to weigh in on what may have happened here, please send me a note at the e-mail address below. I hope to write about this situation again soon.It’s hard to thwart someone intent on committing a crime. But you can at least put your advisers on notice by not letting them trade on your behalf at all. That’s what we did with Mr. Weitzman, simply because we don’t think it is a good idea to give anyone that authority. If, for any reason, you need help putting an adviser’s plan into action, have the adviser show you how to make the trades or transfers yourself on the Web site of the firm where you keep your money. Or, at the very least, make it clear, in writing, to your advisers that they are not to make any trades or transfers without your permission.Janice Fetsch, head of compliance for Smith Barney and its fleet of stockbrokers, also warns people never to sign blank or even incomplete documents. And she tells her branch managers to be on the lookout for financial advisers who are suddenly living beyond their means. Smith Barney’s brochure for clients on how to protect their accounts, which I’ve linked to on the Web version of this story, reads like a mini encyclopedia of investor paranoia. And I mean that as a compliment.Credentials are supposed to mean something when selecting a financial planner. Mr. Weitzman and Mr. Furst belong to the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, an organization of financial planners who have sworn off commissions and make money only through fees they charge their clients. Members have made a lot of noise in recent years about ethics and the importance of acting as a fiduciary, in a client’s best interests.I’ve always believed that advisers in the association were plenty smart and morally upright, but it’s hard to recommend them now without at least including an asterisk. Indeed, Mr. Weitzman isn’t the only member under investigation of late. Earlier this month, the S.E.C. in a civil action accused Julie Jarvis, a financial planner in Columbus, Ohio, of stealing money from elderly clients and using it to buy property in the Caribbean.Am I being too harsh here? “The Napfa brand hasn’t changed,” said Diahann W. Lassus, the group’s chairwoman. “The majority of people who take the fiduciary oath sign it, mean it and live by it.”But when they don’t, you may be hard-pressed to stop their fraud before it occurs. So there are a few last rudimentary tips that bear repeating. You can limit any damage by not letting a bad situation get worse. Trust but verify. Open your mail. Confirm the accuracy of your trades and fund transfers. Read your account statements. Every month. Every number. Every single word.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','DETROIT — The chief executive of General Motors, Fritz Henderson, said Friday that it was “still feasible” for G.M. to meet the administration’s demands by June 1 without filing for bankruptcy, but he acknowledged that executives were preparing to seek court protection if necessary.Mr. Henderson said G.M. was essentially operating on two tracks — it is developing a restructuring plan that it expects to make public as soon as this month while simultaneously readying itself for a potential bankruptcy filing. G.M. executives and directors along with officials from the Treasury Department will jointly determine whether G.M. ultimately must file for bankruptcy, he said.“Our preference remains to accomplish this outside of bankruptcy. We have until June 1,” said Mr. Henderson, who succeeded Rick Wagoner in late March. “If we can’t accomplish it outside of bankruptcy by June 1, we would do it inside of a bankruptcy.”G.M. is still trying to obtain concessions from the United Automobile Workers union and bondholders that carry some $28 billion in company debt. Talks will probably ramp up in May, he said, because the union has been focusing on reaching an agreement with Chrysler, which was given a May 1 deadline by the administration.The White House’s rejection of G.M.’s original restructuring plan, which it filed in February, meant that negotiations essentially had to be restarted, Mr. Henderson said.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','Tired of being asked if you made it out to the new stadium yet? It’s early, there’s time. And by most accounts, the new Yankee Stadium was a big winner in its debut even if the home team was a 10-2 loser. It’ll be there all summer, while memories of the home opener may not.In The Los Angeles Times, Jeff Jacobs said that you could feel “all $1.5 billion” and that “this place was built for memories.” USA Today says the park “touches all the bases.” And the view from Boston, at least from The Globe’s Nick Cafardo, is that the stadium is absolutely spectacular.Will the Red Sox have stadium envy? Cafardo asked Commissioner Bud Selig if he’d like to see a new Fenway, and he responded by saying, “There’s something about Fenway and Wrigley that I’d like to see preserved.” Like the stadiums, right?In Cleveland, there was a different feel to the coverage. In The Plain Dealer, Paul Hoynes notes that the Hall of Fame collected Grady Sizemore’s grand slam bat and that the game was special for the Indians, too.Closer to home, Keith Olbermann lamented the Yankees’ middle relief, but on the subject of the building, he said the franchise got it right And in The Times, Tyler Kepner writes about other bungled openers, like the White Sox’ 16-0 loss to the visiting Tigers in 1991. Oops.'"
"'09-04-18,'0','One Con Edison crew has come up with its own solution: a plastic battery-powered owl that swivels its head and makes a hooting noise, bought at a local nursery.The idea came from Gerry Goodwin, 65, a 44-year Con Edison veteran who tired of continually replacing the 24,000-volt feeder reclosure on a pole on 11th Avenue, just off Clintonville Street in Whitestone, Queens, which has become a main parakeet habitat, along with Canarsie and Midwood in Brooklyn.“These things cost about $20,000 to replace, and we’ve gone through five in the past couple years,” Mr. Goodwin said of the feeder reclosures. “These nests are killing us.”Pondering the problem, Mr. Goodwin recalled that a co-worker had installed a plastic owl on his boat to keep sea gulls away.“I figured, ‘If it works for sea gulls, it’ll work for parakeets; let’s put one up on the equipment,’ ” Mr. Goodwin said. So last year, they bought an owl and named him Hootie.Hootie worked like a charm. Months went by with no new nests. But suddenly the nests were back, and again they caused the feeder reclosure to short-circuit and catch fire.Hootie’s batteries must have run out, the workers said, and the birds immediately detected him as a fake and built their nest next to him.“I think one of them married Hootie,” joked Sam Maratto, a Con Edison supervisor.At any rate, when Mr. Goodwin took Hootie down, he saw that he had been damaged by the fire. So Mr. Maratto drove to a nearby plant nursery and bought another one, and a set of fresh batteries.On the way, Mr. Maratto pointed out some huge nests in the area. When the nests become wet, he said, they conduct electricity and cause the devices to short-circuit and explode.“They’re all over, and they’re huge,” he said.He stopped at a device on a pole near Seventh Avenue and 150th Street “smothered” by a huge nest.“Look at that capacitor bank — it’s a condominium,” he said. “It’s engulfed. That’s a piece of Con Ed equipment; you can’t even see it.”According to the prevailing theory, the birds escaped from cargo at Kennedy International Airport and now proliferate mostly in Brooklyn and Queens, with perhaps 300 nests that cause “a tremendous cost” to Con Edison, Mr. Williams said.The men said working in Whitestone had given them double duty as parrot home wreckers (though parrot sympathizers should know that the birds rebuild their homes within several days). When working on nest-infested equipment, Con Ed workers must wear protective suits and face masks.“These birds don’t go easy,” said one worker, Patrick Chery. “They hover right around you, and if they have eggs in the nest, they’ll attack you.”Mr. Goodwin said that the Hootie solution seemed like the way to go citywide, except for the need to change the batteries every few months. He has asked Con Edison engineers to come up with a way to feed low-voltage direct current from the lines to power the owls.Last week, Mr. Chery mounted the new Hootie. Within minutes, a parakeet flew over to take a look.Steve Baldwin, who runs BrooklynParrots.com, a Web site devoted to chronicling the wild urban parakeets, said the parakeets have strong instincts to return to their original nesting spot. They will not be fooled for too long by a plastic owl, he said. A better solution might be using recorded hawk calls to deter the parakeets, he added, and providing “alternate nest platforms” on poles.“I know there are people who think Con Edison is killing them, but I think they’re pretty humane about removing the nests,” he said. “It would be nice if, on our Con Ed bills, there was a box you could check to donate $5 for humane monk parakeet nest removal.”'"
"'09-04-18,'0','Mr. O’Hare resigned in January 1966, and Mr. Dodd dismissed other members of the staff. In the first case before the newly created Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct, renamed the Senate Select Committee on Ethics in 1977, senators questioned whether Mr. Dodd had misused his influence to help a lobbyist representing West Germany.The next year, the committee looked into possible financial improprieties, with Mr. O’Hare using documents to support his accusation that Mr. Dodd had sent travel expense bills for speaking engagements to both the Senate and the group he was addressing, as well as misusing $116,083 in campaign contributions.Mr. Dodd strongly rebutted Mr. O’Hare’s testimony, called his bookkeeping “sloppy,” and said his previous confidence in the aide was “misplaced.” Mr. Boyd suggested that the senator needed to discredit Mr. O’Hare’s testimony because “it could put Dodd in jail if it wasn’t broken.”As a result, the case often became the word of the senator against the word of his bookkeeper. The two gave different accounts about who had signed the senator’s personal checks at various times. Ms. O’Hare said that if her husband had not lent his authority to the investigation, “it wouldn’t have stuck — and Dodd knew that.”In March 1967, Pearson and Anderson wrote a column purporting to explain Mr. Dodd’s lapses. They said he was an alcoholic, an accusation Mr. Boyd said was correct. The columnists, presumably quoting Mr. O’Hare, said he ordered whiskey for the senator, called his home to say Mr. Dodd would be late on Senate business when he was inebriated, and then took him home when he had sobered up sufficiently.On June 23, 1967, the Senate censured Mr. Dodd, by a vote of 92 to 5, for using campaign money for his personal benefit. They exonerated him, 51 to 45, of double-billing, in part because Mr. O’Hare was the only witness on that point. The New York Times said that another reason was the skittishness of senators who worried that they might have accidentally double-billed themselves. The Senate later formulated an ethics code that was clearer on such matters.Mr. Dodd held his Senate seat until January 1971, after losing a re-election bid in 1970. He died in May 1971.Michael Vincent O’Hare was born on Jan. 25, 1936, in Jersey City. He graduated from high school at 17, served in the Marines from 1953 to 1956, then graduated from Catholic University, where he majored in sociology after starting in engineering.After being fired by Mr. Dodd, he worked for Southern Railway, Big Brothers, the Overseas Development Council, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Naval Medical Research Center.A previous marriage, to the former Pauline Parpey, ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter from his first marriage, Kate O’Hare Giovanello; two children from his second marriage, Owen and Margaret O’Hare; his sister, Catherine Simon; and his brothers, Edward, Robert and Jack.The intensity of the Dodd controversy showed dramatically in June 1966. On a day when ethics committee hearings were being held, Mr. O’Hare passed a table in a Senate coffee shop where the senator’s son Jeremy was sitting. The younger Mr. Dodd said, “Wait a minute, Mike.”According to a report in The Times, Mr. O’Hare said Mr. Dodd then poked a finger in his chest and said, “When this thing is over, I’m going to follow you to your grave.”'"
"'09-04-19,'0','Much of the first half of what was expected to be a defensive struggle between two of the East’s roughest teams was an offensive extravaganza.When Rasheed Wallace dropped a short shot in the lane to pull the Pistons to 37-36, Detroit was shooting an eye-popping 65 percent (15 of 23) from the field against the league’s best defense. Cleveland was nearly as hot, shooting about 60 percent.The Pistons cooled, missing 12 of their final 15 shots in the first half, and the Cavaliers took off. James fed a no-look pass across the lane to Smith for a dunk, igniting a 20-9 run that gave Cleveland its 12-point halftime edge.James dismissed the idea that the Cavaliers were expected to win a title.“Great expectations have been placed on the Celtics and Lakers,” he said. “Not us. We just got to go out there and do what we’ve been doing all season.”MAVERICKS 105, SPURS 97 Winning a postseason road game for the first time since 2006, Dallas rode Josh Howard’s 25 points to a victory against San Antonio in a first-round Western Conference series. The sixth-seeded Mavericks had lost nine straight playoff road games.It was the fourth home playoff loss since 2007 for San Antonio. Tim Duncan had 27 points, and Tony Parker added 24 for the Spurs, whose versatile guard Manu Ginobili is out for the playoffs with an injured ankle.OKUR MAY NOT PLAY Utah Jazz center Mehmet Okur is questionable for Sunday’s playoff opener against the Los Angeles Lakers with a strained right hamstring. He has been out since straining his hamstring on Monday night against the Clippers and did not practice last week. The Jazz said Okur’s status would be decided before the game, but his teammates said they did not expect him to be in the lineup.AINGE MISSES GAME 1 Boston Celtics General Manager Danny Ainge, who had what the team described as a minor heart attack Thursday, was not at TD Banknorth Garden in Boston for the team’s playoff-opening loss to Chicago. A team spokesman, Jeff Twiss, said Ainge could be released from Massachusetts General Hospital by Sunday.TAPSCOTT TO STAY The Washington Wizards’ president, Ernie Grunfeld, said the interim coach Ed Tapscott would stay with the team in a role that not been determined. Tapscott was Washington’s director of player development before Grunfeld fired Coach Eddie Jordan after a 1-10 start. Tapscott finished 18-53, and the Wizards’ 19-63 record matched their worst in franchise history. Flip Saunders has reportedly agreed to become the Wizards’ new coach.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','INSECTS have been conscripted as weapons of war, tools of terrorism and instruments of torture for thousands of years. So should we be surprised by the news that the C.I.A. considered using these creatures to instill fear in Abu Zubaydah, a terrorist suspect? Yes, and here’s why.The earliest hypothesized uses of insects in human conflicts involved bees and wasps. During the Upper Paleolithic period, nests of stinging insects — evidently contained within baskets or pottery — were heaved into rocky caves or thorny stockades to drive an enemy into the open. Employing insects to destroy crops or transmit disease would not develop until modern times (unless we include Yahweh’s assaults on Pharaoh in Exodus). However, entomological torture continued to play a role throughout history.The ancient Persians developed a gruesome practice called scaphism, which involved force-feeding a person milk and honey, lashing him to a boat or hollow tree trunk, and then allowing flies to infest the victim’s anus and increasingly gangrenous flesh. Siberian tribes simply tied a naked prisoner to a tree and allowed mosquitoes and other biting flies to deliver as many as 9,000 bites per minute — a rate sufficient to drain a person’s blood by half in about two hours. And the stories of Apaches staking captives on anthills to ensure lingering and painful deaths are not merely the stuff of Hollywood westerns.The epitome of insectan torture was developed by a 19th-century emir of Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan. He threw political enemies into a bug pit, a deep hole covered with an iron grille and stocked with sheep ticks and assassin bugs. The bite of the latter has been compared to being pierced with a hot needle, and the injected saliva digested the victims’ tissues until, in the words of the emir’s jailer, “masses of their flesh had been gnawed off their bones.”So what’s surprising about the United States exploiting a prisoner’s entomophobia? This appears to be the first case in which insects would have been used to inflict psychological terror. Solzhenitsyn described the use of bedbug-infested boxes in the Soviet gulags, but it seems that these were intended to cause physical suffering — and the Central Intelligence Agency operatives evidently planned to use a physically harmless insect. (A caterpillar was mentioned.)After having seemingly exhausted the nefarious uses of insects as unwitting agents in human conflict, the United States managed to find a new way — 100,000 or so years after humans first inflicted pain on one another with bees and wasps — to exploit the natural world as a means of creating suffering.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','“What Tho. Jefferson Knew About Pirates” (Week in Review, April 12) overlooks a historical link between Morocco and the United States by leaving a possible impression that Morocco supported the pirates.In 1786, Morocco and the United States signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship — a joint commitment to combating acts of piracy targeting American ships sailing the Atlantic. It is the first such recorded treaty in United States history and is the longest unbroken American agreement with any nation.Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently noted that cooperation with the United States’ oldest ally has been under way for generations. “We worked together to end piracy off of the coast of Morocco all those years ago,” Secretary Clinton said. “And we’re going to work together to end this kind of criminal activity anywhere on the high seas.” This relationship, borne from mutual respect, is as important today as ever before for Morocco and the United States.Aziz Mekouar Ambassador of Morocco to the United States Washington, April 13, 2009'"

"'09-04-19,'0','With its echoes of Wilkie Collins, “The Meaning of Night” was praised by reviewers for its propulsive plot and keen reconstruction of a vanished world. Some critics quailed, though, at the novel’s self-consciously extravagant prose and sheer physical mass: it is 703 pages.Mr. Cox wrote a sequel, “The Glass of Time,” published in the United States by Norton last year.Michael Andrew Cox was born on Oct. 25, 1948, in Finedon, Northamptonshire. As a child, he had a chronic ear infection, which confined him to bed with the Victorians for long periods. In a treatment widely used at the time, radium rods were inserted into his ears; Mr. Cox later came to believe that this was responsible for his cancer, his wife said.Besides his wife, the former Desda Crockett, whom he married in 1973, Mr. Cox is survived by his parents, Eileen and Gordon Cox; a daughter, Emily Cox; two stepchildren, Miranda de Freitas and Barnaby Craike-Pickering; and three grandchildren.As a teenager, Michael played guitar and keyboards with a local group and began writing songs. While he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, he was asked to write and perform music to accompany a friend’s silent film. A record producer was in the house the night that the film was screened and encouraged Mr. Cox to pursue a career as a rock musician.After graduating in 1971 with a degree in English literature, Mr. Cox released two solo albums and several singles under the name Matthew Ellis; later, with his own band, he released an album and singles as Obie Clayton.He left the music business in 1977, and worked as an editor for a British health-book publisher. He wrote a well-received biography of the English scholar and ghost-story writer M.R. James before joining Oxford University Press as an editor.At Oxford, Mr. Cox edited many literary anthologies, among them “The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories” (1986) and “Victorian Ghost Stories” (1991), both in collaboration with R. A. Gilbert; “Victorian Tales of Mystery and Detection” (1992); and “The Oxford Book of Spy Stories” (1996).Since his undergraduate days, Mr. Cox had been consumed with the idea of writing a Victorian novel of his own, but for decades it existed only as a sheaf of aborted first chapters.“I’d read Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle and I knew they always started at the end of the puzzle and worked back,” he told The Times of London in 2006. “I wasn’t confident that I could do it, and I couldn’t do it for 30 years.”Then, in the early 1990s, his cancer was diagnosed, and in the years that followed, Mr. Cox underwent operations to remove tumors from his nasal cavity, spine and brain. He took early retirement from Oxford in 2002, with a modest pension and few prospects.In 2004 Mr. Cox began to lose his sight, partly as a result of a brain tumor. To prepare for surgery, he was given a powerful steroid to reduce the pressure of the tumor on the optic nerve. The drug gave him almost superhuman energy. He threw away his early chapters and in a sleepless frenzy began to write “The Meaning of Night.”After the operation, which restored his sight temporarily, Mr. Cox returned to his manuscript. Before long it had become the subject of a fevered publishers’ auction. (An editor at John Murray placed the winning bid by telephone while fleeing down a fire escape during an office fire alarm, the British press reported at the time.)In interviews since then Mr. Cox expressed amazement at the bidding war his manuscript engendered. “As an ex-publisher, I was realistic about its prospects,” he said in The Times of London interview. “I thought that if I got 10 grand out of this, I’d be laughing.”'"
"'09-04-19,'0','“She would have a huge impact on Nascar,” said Humpy Wheeler, the chairman of the Wheeler Company consulting firm and the former president of Lowe’s Motor Speedway in North Carolina. “Sixty percent of the Nascar crowd is male, and they like the current drivers, but there’s not any pretty ones out there.”Max Muhleman, the principal of Private Sports Consulting in Charlotte, N.C., agreed.“She would be a ticket-selling machine, there’s no doubt about that,” he said. “She would rock the turnstiles. As a woman and a cute girl, she would be a special kind of sensation.”Patrick’s popularity and level of recognition seem suited to Nascar, according to data compiled by Millsport, a sponsorship consulting agency in Charlotte. Ken Cohn, the vice president at Millsport’s Charlotte office, said the agency’s Davie Brown Index, which measures “a celebrity’s ability to influence brand affinity and consumer purchase intent,” showed Patrick to be one of only three current drivers who elicits more than 50 percent awareness among the United States population. The others are the Nascar superstars Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr.“And she’s not only well known; she’s well liked,” Cohn wrote in an e-mail message, adding that Patrick ranked fourth in appeal. “Danica entering Nascar would certainly provide the sport with a deep level of marketing impact,” Cohn said. “And it would provide Nascar with one of the biggest stories of the year, generating a significant amount of media coverage, consumer and fan engagement, and corporate attention.”Appeal does not guarantee success. Several top I.R.L. drivers who made the move to Nascar have struggled, including Dario Franchitti, Juan Pablo Montoya and Sam Hornish Jr.Several observers suggest Patrick would be best served taking the best I.R.L. deal she can find.“She’s exactly where she needs to be,” said Eddie Gossage, the president of Texas Motor Speedway, which hosts Nascar and I.R.L. events. “I would love to hand her the winner’s trophy at an I.R.L. race here. I think it would be a horrible mistake for her to go to Nascar,” adding that he thought Patrick was “arguably one of the two or three best-known female athletes in the world.”Janet Guthrie, 71, was a trailblazer in American motor sports in the 1970s, when she became the first woman to compete at the highest level in open-wheel racing and in Nascar.“She should stay where she is,” Guthrie said. “She is in the best possible situation in I.R.L., in the catbird seat with one of the few teams that is capable of winning.”Patrick, however, made clear that she saw herself as a brand as well as a driver, and that business considerations would play a part in where drives in 2010.“One of the things I think of is the exposure level that you get in Nascar with the ratings and viewership,” she said. “Their numbers are so much larger than ours, and with that comes a bigger following, comes more popularity, comes more demand for you to endorse other products. So I think it would be an exponential sort of growth.”Guthrie said she never raced for the money and seemed disappointed that Patrick might be driven by a net-income imperative. “Like many people, I really regret seeing those soft-porn photos that will be around forever on the Web,” Guthrie said, referring to Patrick’s appearances in Sports Illustrated and other magazines. “But if that’s what she wants to do, it’s worked for her. She made, what, $7 million last year?”Patrick said she saw Formula One as an unlikely place for her to land because she did not want to travel the world. And there are elements of the Nascar experience that concern her, including the length of the Sprint Cup schedule, 36 races, compared with the I.R.L.’s 18. She added that she would need to join one of Nascar’s elite teams to have a fair expectation of success.But an I.R.L. season beckons before Patrick can answer the question of where she will she race in 2010.“I’m excited to see what comes up and who shows interest,” she said.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','About one in four youths in the are immigrants or children of one, and most appear to be elevating fine: working, studying and advancing at rates comparable to nonimmigrant peers. But a troubled minority offers cause for alarm.Raised in blighted neighborhoods, alienated from parents and school, disheartened by the prospect of dead-end jobs, these youths risk joining what some scholars have warned could be a “rainbow underclass.”The Latin American Youth Center, whose branch Jesselyn sought help from, can be thought of prosaically as a social services agency or more grandly as a modern settlement house — kin to the centers of immigrant aid that arose more than a century ago. If these poorest families are to succeed, as many previous ones did, their progress may depend in part on the efforts of such groups.The problems of young people like Jesselyn are sometimes called failures of assimilation. But they can also be seen as assimilation to the wrong things: crime, drugs and self-fulfilling prophecies of racial defeat.As Jesselyn tells it, she assimilated to the surrounding values of gangsta rap. Writing in her eighth-grade yearbook, she celebrated friends as “my nigga!” and labeled enemies “crackers, bamma” and “whyte.”“If you’re Hispanic, people already expect you to steal, to fight, to be rude, to be ghetto,” Jesselyn said. “If everyone thinks wrong of you, eventually you’re going to start thinking wrong about yourself.”In the past, the work of helping immigrant families largely occurred in established gateways, cities like New York or with mature safety nets. Today’s immigrants are widely dispersed, often in places that are unused to their presence and unprepared to meet their needs.Nationwide, about half of immigrants live in the suburbs, including more than 40 percent of the immigrant poor, according to Audrey Singer and Jill H. Wilson of the . Many live in places that did little to promote immigrant mobility even in good times; now, vanishing jobs and strained safety nets increase the risk of downward assimilation.Like similar groups nationwide, the youth center is struggling to serve teenagers who are increasingly suburban and increasingly disadvantaged. It has decades of experience in the District of Columbia, but its expansion to the Maryland suburbs three years ago was unexpectedly difficult. The troubles of youths ran deep, money was hard to raise, programs that worked well in the city were hard to replicate.Relationships between blacks and Latinos proved so sensitive that the center felt forced to strip the words “Latin American” from its suburban affiliate’s name.“There was a sense of, What have we gotten ourselves into?” said Luisa Montero, the group’s Maryland director.Ms. Morning, a jobs counselor, sometimes felt the same. A week after she urged Jesselyn to try harder, the teenager appeared at her door.“I don’t have an attitude,” Jesselyn said, adding that she had reconciled with her boss.“She was driving you hard because she sees your potential,” Ms. Morning said.No one was surprised a few days later when Jesselyn walked off the job.A windowless room with rummage-sale décor does not typically draw teenagers on a Saturday morning. But a dozen yawning girls roused themselves for what Ms. Morning called her “No Más” class, six weekly sessions of free-wheeling talk.While their concerns echoed those of teenagers everywhere — romance, parties, parental conflicts — the girls’ immigrant roots showed. One wondered whether would have sided with illegal immigrants. Another boasted of the Spanish cursing she had given someone who called her a “black wannabe.”“Girl, you know your Spanish is no good,” Ms. Morning said.Then, jaws dropped when Ms. Morning disclosed that she had once had a ; her point was that no one is immune.“I always thought S.T.D.’s was like for trashy people,” one girl said.“Does she really keep it this real?” another asked.Although Ms. Morning describes herself as a “Puerto Rican chick from ,” her story is more complex. Her father vanished early, and her mother remarried a police officer; a talent search program for minorities took her to the elite Nightingale-Bamford School on the Upper East Side of . At 28, she saw the teenagers’ struggles as her own, and her successes as potentially theirs.A posting on a jobs Web site called brought Ms. Morning to Langley Park. A tangle of strip malls and traffic jams 10 miles from the Capitol, the area sprang to life in the 1950s as a cheap white suburb; it drew blacks fleeing the city in the 1970s, and became a haven in the 1980s for Salvadorans escaping poverty and civil war.Now nearly two-thirds Latino and foreign-born, it has the aesthetics of suburban sprawl and the aura of . Laundromats double as money-transfer stores. Jobless men drink and sleep in the sun. There is no city government, few community leaders, and little community.Part of what sets the area apart is the strain between immigrant parents and their Americanizing children, who wince at their accents and dirty jobs. Langley Park is an immigrant neighborhood where it is an insult to be called an immigrant. Teenagers call the rough-looking newcomers “hinchos,” or “hicks.”“Hinchos try to look black, but they’re not as good at it as we are,” said Jesselyn’s 14-year-old brother, Victor Jr.Weak parental authority abets strong gangs. The dominant force in many young lives is Mara Salvatrucha-13, or MS-13, which is known for its violence and international reach. But there are scores of lesser cliques — Street Thug Criminals, Sexy but Stupid — that strive to live up to their name.Jesselyn’s father, Victor Bercian Sr., was 18 when he slipped across the Mexican border in 1984 and joined two brothers in Langley Park who got him hired on their construction job. Her mother, Edith Grenados, came three years later to work as a maid. They soon married and both became legal residents; Mr. Bercian learned English and acquired citizenship. By the time their third child arrived, he had a union job as a painter, a $112,000 townhouse and an immigrant’s storybook faith.“You can achieve what you want here,” he said.As a Latino schoolgirl in a rough neighborhood, Jesselyn felt otherwise. She struggled with reading, and her academic progress was slow. Her mother, who does not speak English, felt frustrated she could not help. Setbacks reinforced Jesselyn’s vague sense that Latinos were destined to fail. Report cards noted potential but warned that she was too eager for the approval of peers, a description she accepts.“I wanted to be known,” she said. “I wanted to have trillions of friends.”Sixth grade brought the thrill of renown when she beat up an older girl. Seventh grade brought an arrest when she was caught smuggling a knife into school. She joined a clique called Locas Till Death and hung out at drunken “skipping parties” instead of going to class.Though she tried her best to act her worst, Jesselyn never fully took to her gangster identity. She joined a Pentecostal church. She gave money to people on the street. But when friends said she was too nice, she worked to prove them wrong. “I had this bad reputation I had to live up to,” she said.Jesselyn dropped out in the ninth grade and followed friends into a group they called Puras Vatas Locas — Pure Crazy Gangsters. Crinkled snapshots show them as 15-year-olds, swilling vodka and flashing gang signs. They look more campy than menacing, a gang spoof more than a gang.But a thin line separated posed depravity from the real thing. That fall, an MS-13 crew lured two teenage girls to a Langley Park cemetery, killed one and left the other for dead. The survivor identified the young man who buried a knife in her chest as Jesus Canales, who before he joined the gang had been Jesselyn’s boyfriend.The violence was startling, but immigrant gangs have a long history: Irish, Italian and Jewish gangsters spread urban mayhem a century before MS-13. Yet, as today’s optimists point out, each of the previous ethnic groups came to be seen as an assimilation success.On average, children of immigrants today are progressing well, with levels of earnings and education similar to peers whose parents are native born. Concerns about downward mobility mostly focus on the children of the least-educated immigrants, particularly poor Mexicans and Central Americans who account for more than a third of today’s second generation.Some scholars predict that they will follow poor Italians, who rose more slowly than other groups but rose nonetheless. Others worry that they may repeat the experience of poor African-Americans, with a significant minority mired in long-term poverty and social disorder.The most prominent warnings have come from Alejandro Portes of and Rubén G. Rumbaut of the University of California, Irvine, the sociologists who coined the phrase “rainbow underclass.”About 18 million youths 17 or younger are immigrants or the children of immigrants. In an interview, Mr. Portes estimated that as many as 20 percent face elevated chances of long-term poverty — suggesting a risk pool of more than 3.5 million. While he predicts that only a minority of that group will experience the depth of disadvantage implied by the word “underclass,” he says their numbers are large enough to warrant policymakers’ concern.“Most children of immigrants are doing well,” Mr. Portes said. “But a sizable minority is certainly left behind and in danger of downward assimilation.”Mr. Portes and Mr. Rumbaut contend that today’s generation faces a bigger challenge than in the past. Good jobs require more education, often a college degree. Unlike their European predecessors, the majority of today’s immigrants come from , and Latin America, which some analysts say could make them more vulnerable to persistent discrimination. And while previous was mostly legal, today millions of children have parents who live marginalized lives as illegal residents.In addition, the scholars say, a seductive youth culture encourages poor teenagers to denigrate work and school and find valor in violence. Unwilling to take bad jobs, unable to get good ones, teenagers like Jesselyn often seek satisfaction in the streets.“I’m not going to scrub someone’s toilet,” she said.Though “assimilation” and “upward mobility” are often used as synonyms, Mr. Portes and Mr. Rumbaut emphasize that they are not the same thing. Some groups move up by resisting assimilation; they study and work in ethnic enclaves. Others assimilate to values and behaviors of the American ghetto.That is what Jesselyn said she and other poor, streetwise Salvadorans had done: followed the example of poor streetwise blacks.“They’re like a role model,” she said. “We’re a lot like them.”Sometimes she said that both groups simply react to the same forces of poverty and prejudice. (“We’ve lived the same thing.”) But she also talked of consciously imitating what she sees as the strengths of poor blacks. (“They don’t let themselves get pushed around.”)Either way, she saw herself behind a color line, with success beyond her reach.“I thought the American dream was just meant for white people,” she said. “The big house with the two beautiful kids, the dream car, and the dream career — when the hell you hear a Spanish has that?”A few months after her 16th birthday, Jesselyn found a new boyfriend, Erik Ortiz, and sensed her friends growing jealous. Soon, her gang friends jumped her.Cut off from the friends she considered family, Jesselyn spent three years drifting among church, short-lived jobs and bouts of depression. Then she heard about a youth center that helped high school dropouts earn General Educational Development diplomas, or G.E.D.’s. On the application, Jesselyn wrote that she had been lying awake, “thinking of what a disaster I had become.”Jesselyn was across the hall, mulling geometry, while Ms. Morning, the jobs counselor, yelled into her speakerphone. A teenager had called to say that she had aced a job interview. Only a urine test separated her from a paycheck.“I need help,” the girl said. “I was dealing with some stuff and trying to feel better.”“My first advice to you is to stop weed,” Ms. Morning said.Her next bit of advice was metabolic. “Drink and pee!”“The drug test is like the final step, baby girl,” she said. “I’m so proud of you!”The Latin American Youth Center has been pairing mentors and teenagers since 1968. Once a humble storefront affair, it now serves 4,000 youths a year, with 150 employees and a charismatic leader, Lori Kaplan.As gentrification pushed clients to the suburbs in the early 2000s, the center saw the need to follow. Its Washington neighborhood, Columbia Heights, is a services bazaar, with legal aid, shelters, clinics, day care centers and gyms. The Langley Park safety net is so threadbare that the Catholic church meets in an elementary school.Suburban youths seemed especially troubled, with weaker families and stronger gangs. Langley Park attracts a lot of “sequential migration,” in which mothers come first and children follow years later, with and without legal permission, furious at having been abandoned. (The center generally does not ask youths about their immigration status.)In Prince George’s County, which is two-thirds blacks, racial conflict cost the center a new headquarters. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington offered to build a $12 million services complex, with a church, a clinic and a gym, and rent-free space for the youth center. But the proposed site was occupied by a foundering Boys and Girls Club with a mostly black clientele. The deal collapsed when a club leader protested that Latinos were trampling the rights of black youths.In 2006, when the youth group finally opened its Maryland branch, it had a de-Latinized name — the Maryland Multicultural Youth Centers — and a cramped office suite invisible from the road. Among its first programs was a G.E.D. class with a part-time teacher and no curriculum; the pass rate, less than 20 percent, made center officials wince. When Jesselyn arrived last spring, both she and the center were trying to get back on track.Standing Out From the StartTechnically, the topic was math, but a truce between warring reggaetón barons had students talking. The teacher, Claudia Vasquez, asked how black rap had influenced Latino .“Do you think we imitate each other?” she asked, to a room of nodding heads.Instead of glorifying street violence, Ms. Vasquez said, she wished more Latino stars would sing about positive things, as did. “Those songs were meant to create a revolution — to fight what’s holding you back,” she said. Why not sing about going to college?“Who’s going to listen to that?” one student asked.She moved on to Tupac, the slain rapper who had street cred but still knew “how to talk when you’re with the white man.” Then she discovered no one had done the math assignment.Some snickered. Some looked bored. Jesselyn did the overdue homework and alone got it right.In a class of disaffected youths, she stood out from start; she was friendly, focused and filled with plans. One classmate said he hoped to become an “assassin.” Jesselyn said she hoped to dine at the Eiffel Tower and become a social worker.She reached out on MySpace to end old feuds. She put in a dozen job applications, and worked, however briefly, at the mall. She returned to her Pentecostal church and wept when the preacher promised she would be saved. And after years of sworn enmity, she made up with Chunky, Pooh Bear and Nena, the girls who had jumped her.Jesselyn saw the renewed friendship as the show of a forgiving heart. But around them, she started partying more. She skipped class and took pains to curse and act jaded. “They say, ‘You talk like a white girl,’ ” she said.Erik, whom she now called her fiancé, also seemed uneasy at times with Jesselyn’s ambitions. A laid-off dishwasher who left school in the ninth grade, he complained — jokingly, he said — that Jesselyn would go to college and leave him.They were at a thrift store one day when they spotted Erik’s cousin Joker, a teenager who had run away from home and boasted about joining MS-13. Jesselyn had urged him to quit, but he was wearing gang colors. The next day he was stabbed to death, in what the police have called a feud with a rival gang.“I told him to stay out of the streets,” she fumed as she left his funeral.One day, Jesselyn arrived in class eager to share a story she had written called “El Romance.”Ms. Vasquez cut her off. “Fix your grammar,” she said.It was hardly the worst blow Jesselyn had suffered, but for a moment it felt that way. She was stalking out of the building — and in her mind, the program — when Ms. Morning caught up with her.“Ohhh, she makes me so mad,” Jesselyn said. “If I talk about it, I’m going to cry!”“I’m not saying you’re wrong,” Ms. Morning said.Jesselyn vented. Ms. Morning listened. Then she told Jesselyn she did not have to leave to protest; instead, she could talk to Ms. Vasquez’s boss. When Jesselyn did, on her way back to class, she even leavened her complaint with a kind word for Ms. Vasquez.“She wants the best for us,” she said.In youth center jargon, Ms. Morning had provided “connectivity”— she got Jesselyn to stick around. The center has found that the youths who do best join multiple programs after bonding with someone on the staff. With a line of teenagers crowding her door, Ms. Morning was connectivity personified. But she was also battling an occupational hazard: incipient disillusionment.In college she had told an adviser, “I could live on passion alone.” Now with a salary of $38,000 and a baby on the way, she skipped meals and defaulted on her . One student physically threatened her. Another stole her cellphone.Ms. Morning told her boss she needed support and criticized the management of the office. Her boss put a note in her personnel file, faulting her attitude.Ms. Morning was on maternity leave when the G.E.D. class ended. Of the 22 students who started, five did well enough to earn referrals to the real test. Jesselyn was among them, though barely. With her math score failing, the center took pains to offer her a month of tutoring. She overslept the first day.In a different world, someone like Ms. Morning would have sounded the gong — roused her with a lecture or a picture of the Eiffel Tower. But Ms. Morning was on her leave and soon resigned to look for a better-paying job. No one from the center called. Jesselyn never went for tutoring.This was a problem of her own making, like many that had come before. It would be easy to lose faith in her efforts; she could be unsteady, immature, slower to work than to dream. Still, she was making an effort to overcome her mistakes, in a place where most people just compound them. If that was not yet a significant achievement, it was at least the start of one.Unprepared for the G.E.D. exam, Jesselyn broke up with Erik and fell into a funk. By the time they got back together, the test was in the graders’ hands.Awaiting the results, Jesselyn got a job in a furniture store that overlooks an eerie Langley Park shrine, a makeshift memorial to a triple homicide. Three rough crosses rise from the spot where, a few years back, three sleeping immigrants had their throats slashed.One night, Jesselyn walked home past the drunks who sleep there and updated her MySpace page. She had been partying again with Chunky and Nena. She had missed several meetings the youth center scheduled to talk about financial aid. But she posted a picture of the Eiffel Tower and boasted of her plan to start community college this year.Soon after, a notice arrived, and it filled her soft face with a grin.“Congratulations on achieving the Maryland diploma,” it said.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','SINCE Fidel Castro gave up power last year, the long standoff between Cuba and the United States has taken on the measured rhythms of a minuet, delicate steps from Havana met with restrained advances from Washington, each side hiding behind a pose of purpose that may mask their true intentions.In his first 100 days after formally taking over for his ailing older brother, Raúl Castro made it seem as if he was interested in changing Cuba’s relationship with the United States. He quickly lifted a number of restrictions so that Cubans on the island could stay at tourist hotels, buy cellphones and toasters, and in certain cases, farm state land, things Fidel Castro never allowed.Some parts of “la familia Cubana” — the extended family of Cubans on the island and Cuban-Americans in the United States — welcomed the steps as long overdue indicators of a new, post-Fidel era. But many others in the family felt the steps were superficial, and a year later, it appears that they were mostly right. Those changes have not turned out to be the precursors of a major shift toward freedom, democracy or a better life for the Cuban people. It is not even clear that Fidel Castro, who has not been seen in public in over two and a half years, is not still pulling the strings. Political prisoners remain in prison, cellphones remain luxuries for the few, and Cubans are no freer to express their opinions.Now it is Washington’s turn to lead. Last Monday, before the end of his first 100 days in office, President Obama fulfilled a campaign promise to lift restrictions so Cuban-Americans could visit relatives on the island as often as they like and send them as much money as they want. Mr. Obama also said he would make it possible for American companies to vastly increase cellphone service in Cuba, enabling Cubans whom Raúl Castro allowed to buy cellphones to actually get to use them.Once again, reaction to the changes is split, with some members of la familia Cubana feeling the moves don’t go nearly far enough, and should have been extended to all Americans, as a bill before Congress proposes. In that, they agree with Fidel Castro himself, who wrote that he considered the moves “positive although minimal,” because the 47-year-old economic embargo was left in place. Others say that lifting the restrictions gives the Castro brothers too much without their giving anything in return. Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart, Cuban-American brothers who represent southern Florida in Congress, issued a joint statement calling the changes “a serious mistake” that will help the Castro regime, rather than force it to change.But Mr. Obama is appealing to a broader audience than just Cubans and Cuban-Americans, politically powerful though the latter may be. It was no accident that the reshaping of Cuba policy came at the beginning of the equivalent of a Latin American sweeps week. Given all the other issues on the president’s plate, Latin America is not likely to remain in the spotlight for long. But for at least this last week, it has been near impossible to miss the administration’s outreach to the region.'"

"'09-04-19,'0','Until now, it has relied mostly on a strategy of “finding the worst houses on the block, and turning them around one by one,” said Patrick Morrissy, the group’s executive director.In fact, several days before the activity in Orange, Hands expanded on its primary strategy with the announcement of a nonprofit alliance to buy 47 abandoned and neglected houses in Essex County — all foreclosure properties owned by the former Washington Mutual Bank.The houses are in Orange, West Orange, Newark and Irvington, all communities hit especially hard by foreclosures.“We have to keep up this critical work,” Mr. Morrissy said, “because the current crisis is threatening the impact of all we have done in the last 25 years.”The downturn is also delaying — if not threatening — the success of several community redevelopment projects that Hands (an acronym for Housing and Neighborhood Development Services) has initiated with the approval of city officials. The projects include the conversion of several vacant factories into housing, and the establishment of an arts district within walking distance of downtown Orange.“You’ve got to open a city up and bind it together,” Mr. Cantal-Dupart said as he stood with Ms. Jackson of the city’s planning and economic development office in the parking lot of the Orange train station, which is only one block off Main Street yet seemingly isolated from it.“Look what you see here when you get off the train,” he said. “You are in a ‘box’, looking at cars, and viewing the backs of some boring buildings, and you have no idea where Main Street is, because it is cut off from view.”Mr. Cantal-Dupart proposed that a parking deck be built near the station, thereby freeing the parking lot for use as a plaza with a performance stage, quick-service carts, public art, and visual cues pointing the way toward shops and restaurants.“As soon as tomorrow,” Mr. Cantal-Dupart said, local musicians looking for a showcase could be encouraged to see the parking lot as performance space, particularly on weekends when there are fewer cars parked in it.More broadly, though — as a first, easy step in a somewhat forbidding economic climate — Mr. Cantal-Dupart suggested putting up large and cheerful signs welcoming people to Orange and making a feature of its history. He followed that with a series of low-cost ideas to change the ambience without having to depend on financing to become available for reconstruction work:He urged city planners to summon the spirit of Thomas Edison, who invented the phonograph in his laboratory in nearby West Orange, by broadcasting music in the streets, in addition to using the train station parking lot and the steps of the public library on Main Street as live performance venues.Noting the few trees in the planters along Main Street, he said: “This is the Garden State. There are not enough trees to reflect your history.”Gazing at shop windows covered with placards and stickers, he called for a cleanup, followed by a competition to provide art for Main Street windows.Mr. Cantal-Dupart pointed out that the city had been “scarred” twice across its middle by its railroad line and Interstate 280, creating a sort of dead zone where the “beating heart” should be.He suggested installing colored lights along the underside of the pedestrian bridges over the highway to give those crossing over them a more pleasant experience, and also to provide Orange with a recognizable signature for those driving under them. The same thing could be done to illuminate the pedestrian bridges under the elevated sections of the rail lines, he said.As for any other redevelopment plans, the architect said, they should adhere strictly to the principle of “openness.”Stopping on the group tour at Monte Irvin County Park, some blocks south of the tracks, Mr. Cantal-Dupart and Ms. Jackson discussed how fencing on three sides had helped foster “racial and social segregation.”“We have an enormous responsibility to understand the evil of segregation by architecture,” said Mr. Cantal-Dupart, whose remarks were translated by his friend Robert Fullilove, a professor of public health at Columbia University. (His wife, Mindy, a fellow professor who has written several books about segregation and its causes and effects in cities, was another participant.)“Closing things off kills a city,” Mr. Cantal-Dupart declared. “It leads to ghettos and crime, and then we have to spend money to combat problems.”'"
"'09-04-19,'0','“A friend once told me that New York is a bunch of small villages, really,” said Ms. Adams, who today is co-editor of Murray Hill Life, a newsletter and frequents local favorites like Barbès, a Moroccan restaurant on 36th Street. “I find that Murray Hill certainly is one of those villages.”The neighborhood skews younger now than it did 10 years ago, and it is growing up physically, too. Far from immune to the building boom of the last few years, Murray Hill continues to sprout new towers that mix in with the old, from the spires along the East River to wide new luxury apartment houses on 34th Street, and even an understated high-rise at 45 Park Avenue designed by Costas Kondylis. Others are still under construction, or stopped midrise, a source of angst for some residents.Aside from the bar scene on Third Avenue, some locals have groused lately about East Side Access, a long-term construction project that will route trains to . Until recently, said Toni Carlina, the district manager of Community Board 6, workers were jackhammering on Park Avenue with floodlights until the early morning hours, though after many board meetings, the noise now ends earlier.It is commonly held that the younger, more bar-centric area south of the neighborhood in the upper 20s and lower 30s is part of Murray Hill; after all, the Murray Hill Diner sits at 33rd and Lexington, and a bar called the Hill, reportedly backed by reality TV stars, packs them in at Third and 29th. But longtime locals (and their community board) will tell you that Murray Hill begins at 34th Street and extends to 42nd Street; its other boundaries are Madison Avenue and the East River.Above all, contrasts make the area distinctive: Town houses abut white-brick buildings, which abut office and apartment towers. The common theme is that there is no common theme.Of the town houses remaining in what was once a bastion of 19th-century high society, several are stunners; a small historic district was created in 2002 and then enlarged to protect them. A few Gilded Age palaces remain, too, like the building that is now the Polish Consulate, on Madison Avenue at 37th Street, and an 1891 McKim, Mead & White house at Park Avenue and 35th Street, now a co-op for a few lucky residents. Just off 36th Street is another small wonder, at Sniffen Court, an alley of 10 Civil War-era carriage houses.“There are nice little pockets of quiet everywhere,” Ms. Adams said.But that is not exactly how you would describe the scene a few blocks away, along First Avenue, with its imposing row of East River high-rise buildings, among them the intimidating Corinthian on 38th Street, which has 57 floors.Farther up the avenue, massive gravel-filled lots sit vacant, once home to hulking buildings and the planned site of a $4 billion 3,000-unit apartment and commercial complex from the developer Sheldon H. Solow. There is no evidence of any work being done; Citibank, Mr. Solow’s lender, was reported to have filed suit against him in December.Second Avenue in Murray Hill is notable for delis and take-out joints; Third Avenue for shops, restaurants and, yes, bars. Lexington and Park keep to a more residential feel, and Madison has an office vibe. Though Murray Hill in theory extends to 42nd Street, 39th seems a more clear-cut line of demarcation with Midtown and its office towers.Along with the rest of the city, the sales market in Murray Hill began to fade last October, and prices have shifted accordingly.“I would estimate that many sellers who have had proper guidance from their brokers are asking 20 percent below what they would have asked in January,” said Julie Perlin, a broker at Stribling & Associates.At the Vanderbilt, an East 40th Street high-rise, Sachiko Goodman, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, originally listed a three-bedroom condominium with 1,562 square feet for nearly $2 million. After six months on the market, it sold earlier this year for $1.5 million.“Today, somebody really has to be the lowest one on the market if they want to sell,” said Elaine Clayman, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens.In general, Ms. Clayman explained, one-bedroom condos begin in the high $500,000s, two-bedrooms under $1 million; co-ops are generally $100,000 less. Last month, Ms. Perlin of Stribling sold a one-bedroom two-bath 38th-floor condo on East 38th for $800,000.Brownstones, Ms. Perlin said, range from the high $2 millions through the low $3 millions, with a premium for buildings in the historic district.Rentals are still moving, though these days it’s a tenants’ market, Ms. Goodman said; owners have resorted to covering broker fees, offering free months, and lowering rents. One-bedrooms now rent for $2,500 to $3,500 a month, and two-bedrooms go for $3,500 to $5,000, depending on view and amenities.WHAT TO DOOn May 17, the neighborhood association will have its annual Murray Hill Festival on Park Avenue, with music performances, arts and crafts activities and plenty of on-street shopping. On Sundays, the local PTA sponsors the Murray Hill Market at Public School 116 on 33rd Street, with goods for sale both outside and in.Over on Madison Avenue at 36th Street, J. Pierpont Morgan’s library is Murray Hill’s whirring cultural space, offering art exhibits, programs for kids, concerts, film screenings, lectures and library tours. For fans of mainstream cinema, the AMC Kips Bay multiplex is just south of the area, on Second Avenue at 31st Street.Residents sing the praises of P.S. 116, on East 33rd Street. In 2008, 94.8 percent of all students met standards on state English language arts tests and 94.5 did so in mathematics; the citywide percentages were 61 and 80.One middle school near Murray Hill is Junior High School 104 on East 21st Street, also known as Simon Baruch, where 77.2 percent of all students met standards on 2008 state math tests, and 70.4 percent on English tests. The citywide percentages were 60 and 43.At Norman Thomas High School, also on 33rd, 2008 SAT averages were 365 in reading, 367 in math and 358 in writing, versus 502, 515 and 494 statewide.Technically, one could step over the border of Murray Hill and be in Midtown, specifically the 42nd Street border. For those heading to the financial district or points farther afield, the No. 6 train stops at Grand Central Terminal, and 33rd Street at Park Avenue.The Murrays of Murray Hill were Mary and Robert, Quakers who bought land between 33rd and 39th Streets in the 18th century; the area was known at that time as Inclenberg.It was in the 19th century that fashionable society arrived, among them the Astors and the Morgans, and their mansions.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','Kenneth Clark’s book “Landscape Into Art, ” which surveys the history of European landscape painting, ends with a lament for the absence of landscape in contemporary art and an interesting observation: For many people, landscape is synonymous with beauty in art, so perhaps the declining fortunes of landscape art in our era are tied to the modernist war on beauty?Whatever the reasons behind the contemporary art world’s lack of interest in the genre, it remains alive and well on the East End of Long Island, where the Spanierman Gallery presents an annual exhibition of local landscape art. Titled “Light of Spring,” the show is devoted to artists who live and work on the East End and draw their inspiration from the color, atmosphere and light of spring.This year’s show, the third, is a fresh, sun-kissed exhibition of about 45 paintings by four artists, all of whom happen to be women, and all of whom combine abstract and representational elements in their paintings of marshes, sand dunes, creeks, flowers and fields. All of them are also definitely interested in beauty or visual pleasure, although they have very different ideas of what that means.Deborah Black is the star of the show. She has been included in the spring exhibitions here before, but her work is so good that I am always glad to see more. This year she is showing mostly gouaches with crayon depicting cool, windswept landscapes that at times recall the work of Eugène Boudin, or Claude Monet’s early pastels of sunsets and fields on the Seine or in Normandy that for the most part were done outdoors, rapidly, with little thought or planning.Like Monet, Ms. Black paints empty, enigmatic scenes in which the subject is not instantly apparent. She also favors low horizon lines, creating more room for her wide, tumultuous skies, as in “Keepers of Secrets 6” (2000), “Keepers of Secrets 7” (2000) or “The Inlet” (1999). But unlike Monet, she mostly excludes direct signs of human habitation, with the exception of dirt roads.Ms. Black’s paintings run the gamut of atmospheric effects. The wind batters a lone, cone-shaped tree in “Unseen Tree 7” (1995), while overcast, gray skies in several of the pictures may suggest rain. The chalky freshness of the earth in “Keepers of Secrets 7” could be snow, though that seems at odds with the exhibition theme. No matter; it is a great picture.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','During the interview, Mr. Hannity was strongly in the corner of Ms. Kelo, the woman who repeatedly said no when New London, devastated by job losses and budget shortfalls, tried to take her house and many others as part of a plan to leverage Pfizer’s arrival in the city — and, it was hoped, create new jobs. Like many other commentators and citizens around the country, Mr. Hannity had been outraged by the Supreme Court’s 5-to-4 decision in 2005 that allowed the city the rights to the Fort Trumbull neighborhood.Ms. Kelo’s answers to Mr. Hannity’s questions were short and only what was required. On the one hand, the interview brought up difficult memories. On the other, she saw opportunity to remind viewers that a home is supposed to be a sanctuary, not a place where wolves are always at the door. When the taping ended, the host put his hand on her knee and said, “You don’t like this, do you?” Ms. Kelo replied, “No, I don’t.”And yet a kind of national stardom has been thrust upon her since the case went to the Supreme Court. When Congress asked her to testify later as it took up the question of how to legislate eminent domain, she gave her name and said, “I am the Kelo in Kelo v. City of New London.”The journey from courtroom to bookstore was not instant, however. Amazingly, although the case, a classic David and Goliath story, was widely discussed, no authors followed up in a timely fashion with a book proposal. Mr. Benedict himself had been busy with other projects. (He has written several books and had a brief fling at politics, losing the Democratic nomination in a run for the House of Representatives from Connecticut’s Second District.)When he knocked on Susette Kelo’s door without an appointment, he girded himself for a cold reception. Mr. Benedict introduced himself and said he was an author. She stared at him and said: “I know who you are. What took you so long?”Ms. Kelo’s colleagues at work had mentioned her case as a natural book, and one of them had talked specifically about Mr. Benedict, whose hard-edged investigation a decade ago, “Without Reservation,” questioned the authenticity of the Mashantucket Pequots who built Foxwoods, one of the largest casinos in the world.Mr. Benedict knew that to have a book he had to have Ms. Kelo’s story. And he would also need the stories of other players in the drama — including that of Claire Guadiani, who as president of Connecticut College when the case took shape, was a perfect foil for Ms. Kelo. Mr. Benedict conducted more than 300 interviews, and finally wrote what he called the “the most complicated book I’ve ever worked on.”Even so, Mr. Benedict, who wrote much of the narrative in the attic of his grandfather’s house in Niantic even as he accepted a teaching position at Southern Virginia University, has produced what a critic in The New York Times Book Review called “a fascinating narrative.”It points out, too, that the state of Connecticut has yet to pass an eminent domain bill that would prevent the taking of homes for private development, and also that Ms. Kelo now lives in nearby Groton. Her former house was saved from demolition when it was moved, with the help of state funds, to another part of New London. The tract of land on which it sat and which Ms. Kelo defended so staunchly is now empty. No buildings, no enterprise, no jobs. And yet a barren reminder of one woman’s courage.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','I find the debate over the best show peculiarly off target. Music is a deeply personal experience. There are no absolutes.All shows were unique, and many had moments worthy of superlative. To try to identify one show or even one period that surpasses all others misses the point, placing ego ahead of a true understanding of the experience, which often had a spiritual component.Though the Dead that many of us knew is gone, the music lives on in the recordings that remain. Put on a disc, grab a good glass of wine, listen carefully, and perhaps you will realize a sense of joy that approaches those persistently fading memories of the Grateful Dead shows of the past.'"
"'09-04-19,'0','With its echoes of Wilkie Collins, “The Meaning of Night” was praised by reviewers for its propulsive plot and keen reconstruction of a vanished world. Some critics quailed, though, at the novel’s self-consciously extravagant prose and sheer physical mass: it is 703 pages.Mr. Cox wrote a sequel, “The Glass of Time,” published in the United States by Norton last year.Michael Andrew Cox was born on Oct. 25, 1948, in Finedon, Northamptonshire. As a child, he had a chronic ear infection, which confined him to bed with the Victorians for long periods. In a treatment widely used at the time, radium rods were inserted into his ears; Mr. Cox later came to believe that this was responsible for his cancer, his wife said.Besides his wife, the former Desda Crockett, whom he married in 1973, Mr. Cox is survived by his parents, Eileen and Gordon Cox; a daughter, Emily Cox; two stepchildren, Miranda de Freitas and Barnaby Craike-Pickering; and three grandchildren.As a teenager, Michael played guitar and keyboards with a local group and began writing songs. While he was an undergraduate at Cambridge, he was asked to write and perform music to accompany a friend’s silent film. A record producer was in the house the night that the film was screened and encouraged Mr. Cox to pursue a career as a rock musician.After graduating in 1971 with a degree in English literature, Mr. Cox released two solo albums and several singles under the name Matthew Ellis; later, with his own band, he released an album and singles as Obie Clayton.He left the music business in 1977, and worked as an editor for a British health-book publisher. He wrote a well-received biography of the English scholar and ghost-story writer M.R. James before joining Oxford University Press as an editor.At Oxford, Mr. Cox edited many literary anthologies, among them “The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories” (1986) and “Victorian Ghost Stories” (1991), both in collaboration with R. A. Gilbert; “Victorian Tales of Mystery and Detection” (1992); and “The Oxford Book of Spy Stories” (1996).Since his undergraduate days, Mr. Cox had been consumed with the idea of writing a Victorian novel of his own, but for decades it existed only as a sheaf of aborted first chapters.“I’d read Agatha Christie and Conan Doyle and I knew they always started at the end of the puzzle and worked back,” he told The Times of London in 2006. “I wasn’t confident that I could do it, and I couldn’t do it for 30 years.”Then, in the early 1990s, his cancer was diagnosed, and in the years that followed, Mr. Cox underwent operations to remove tumors from his nasal cavity, spine and brain. He took early retirement from Oxford in 2002, with a modest pension and few prospects.In 2004 Mr. Cox began to lose his sight, partly as a result of a brain tumor. To prepare for surgery, he was given a powerful steroid to reduce the pressure of the tumor on the optic nerve. The drug gave him almost superhuman energy. He threw away his early chapters and in a sleepless frenzy began to write “The Meaning of Night.”After the operation, which restored his sight temporarily, Mr. Cox returned to his manuscript. Before long it had become the subject of a fevered publishers’ auction. (An editor at John Murray placed the winning bid by telephone while fleeing down a fire escape during an office fire alarm, the British press reported at the time.)In interviews since then Mr. Cox expressed amazement at the bidding war his manuscript engendered. “As an ex-publisher, I was realistic about its prospects,” he said in The Times of London interview. “I thought that if I got 10 grand out of this, I’d be laughing.”'"

"'09-04-20,'0','Still, critics say the image of Internet providers as restaurants about to go broke serving an endless line of gluttons simply does not match the financial or technological realities of the industry.They point out that providers’ profit margins are stable, and that in network equipment is generally falling.These plans to charge for above-average Internet use “are unjustifiable for almost everywhere in the country except for rural America,” Richard F. Doherty, the research director of the Envisioneering Group, a consulting firm that studies cable technology.Cable or telephone networks have little in common with a restaurant, the critics say, because there is no electronic equivalent of food to buy. If all customers decided one day not to check their e-mail or download a single movie, the company’s costs would be no different than on a day when every customer was glued to the screen watching one video after another.That is because their networks are constantly being expanded to handle ever-greater peak periods. It is the modern equivalent of how the old was said to have built the long-distance network to handle the number of calls expected on Mother’s Day.“All of our economics are based on engineering for the peak hour,” said Tony Werner, the chief technical officer of . “Just because someone consumes more data doesn’t mean they drive more cost.”Yet even as the providers continually upgrade their networks, the cost of the equipment needed to do so is shrinking steadily, reflecting the well-worn economics of computing.Indeed, the equipment needed to add capacity to any household costs a fraction of one month’s Internet service bill. Comcast, the nation’s largest cable provider, has told investors that doubling the Internet capacity of a neighborhood costs an average of $6.85 a home.The cost of providing Internet service is about to fall even more, as cable companies install new technology, called Docsis 3, that will both increase their capacity and allow them to offer much faster download speeds.So far, however, companies in the have chosen to use Docsis 3 as an opportunity to offer far more expensive Internet plans. Comcast has introduced a new 50-megabit-per-second service at $139 a month, compared with its existing service that costs about $45 a month for 8 megabits per second. Time Warner just announced it will charge $99 for 50 megabits per second.By contrast, JCom, the largest cable company in , sells service as fast as 160 megabits per second for $60 a month, only $5 a month more than its slower service.Why so cheap? JCom faces more competition from other Internet providers than companies in the United States do.Cable systems in the United States use the same technology and have roughly the same costs. Comcast told investors that the hardware to provide 50-megabits-per-second service costs less than it had been paying for the equipment for 6 megabits per second.Questions about the speed, availability and affordability of Internet service in the United States will be central to the study Congress has required from the next year. And cable and phone executives are worried that the commission may call for more regulation of Internet service, which currently is free from any government price controls.Time Warner Cable abandoned its plan to expand a test of what it called “usage-based pricing” in four cities after Senator , Democrat of New York, announced his opposition to the idea in a meeting with Glenn A. Britt, the company’s chief executive.'"
"'09-04-20,'0','“And most importantly, we have the people of New Orleans, who are known for our hospitality. Not only have we recovered, but we’re open for business.”Fonseca said the business of tournament golf, and notably the brand-building benefits that accrue to the companies of tournament sponsors, has been unfairly criticized by politicians unfamiliar with the impact a PGA Tour event has on charitable giving in its community.“This tournament equates to a more than $30 million annual impact to this region,” Fonseca said, “but more importantly, it helps us serve the local children’s charities. This is our 51st year of producing a PGA Tour event in New Orleans and with Zurich’s help we’re not only able to showcase New Orleans to the world, but we’ve been able to give back more than $1 million a year to local children’s charities.”St. Michael Special School is among the 41 charities the tournament assists through its foundation, Fore!Kids. The school has received tournament proceeds for more than a decade, and its children have done a presentation for the employees and guests of Zurich the past five years.Jane Silva, the principal at St. Michael, has the same concern for special-needs children she had when she arrived 17 years ago. When talking about how Schiro sent her an e-mail message checking on her and telling her the school was O.K. after he inspected hurricane damage from a helicopter, she choked up and lengthened her stride to prevent a visitor from seeing her watery eyes.“All I know about that man,” she said of Schiro, “is that he will get down on the floor, with the kids, just as if he were a teacher.”Schiro, born and raised in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and educated at St. John’s University, is considered one of the most influential chief executives in America. He has a reputation as a visionary with traditional views about the importance of things like customer service.Months after Zurich’s first experience as a tournament sponsor, Katrina hit and the company had more than 20,000 claims from businesses and homeowners. Schiro called Kenneth Feinberg, who had overseen the resolution of 5,300 claims for the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund, with only 94 going to litigation. He told Feinberg he wanted him to set up the same type of operation for Zurich’s claims in New Orleans.“I told Ken that we could distinguish ourselves with the way we handled the claims,” Schiro said. “People buy an insurance policy expecting to never use it. But when they want to use it, we ought to be there, not making life difficult for them.”Within 18 months, all but 100 claims were settled.This year, the Fore!Kids foundation will look into financing the St. Bernard Project, a volunteer house-refurbishing operation founded in March 2006 that has rebuilt 204 homes and has 30 more such projects under way in Chalmette, one of the most devastated areas of New Orleans. The work there is overseen by two people with Washington roots: Zack Rosenberg, a former criminal defense lawyer; and Liz McCartney, the executive director of a community-based nonprofit there.“Zurich and their guests will pitch in and work on their houses for two days during our tournament,” Fonseca said. “Zack will also give a presentation to the players wife’s association during the Emeril luncheon, and a donation will be made to the St. Bernard Project from the players wife’s association at the event.“This is a great story about the kind of things that can happen because of golf when great partners come together.”'"
"'09-04-20,'0','Each conversion of this type would force the administration to decide how to handle its considerable voting rights on a bank’s board.Taxpayers would also be taking on more risk, because there is no way to know what the common shares might be worth when it comes time for the government to sell them.Treasury officials estimate that they will have about $135 billion left after they follow through on all the loans that have already been announced. But the nation’s banks are believed to need far more than that to maintain enough capital to absorb all their losses from soured and other loan defaults.In his budget proposal for next year, Mr. Obama included $250 billion in additional spending to prop up the financial system. Because of the way the government accounts for such spending, the budget actually indicated that Mr. Obama might ask Congress for as much as $750 billion.The most immediate expense will come in the next several weeks, when federal bank regulators complete “stress tests” on the nation’s 19 biggest banks. The tests are expected to show that at least several major institutions, probably including , need to increase their capital cushions by billions of dollars each.The change to common stock would not require the government to contribute any additional cash, but it could increase the capital of big banks by more than $100 billion.The White House chief of staff, , alluded to the strategy on Sunday in an interview on the ABC program “This Week.” Mr. Emanuel asserted that the government had enough money to shore up the 19 banks without asking for more.“We believe we have those resources available in the government as the final backstop to make sure that the 19 are financially viable and effective,” Mr. Emanuel said. “If they need capital, we have that capacity.”If that calculation is correct, Mr. Obama would gain important political maneuvering room because Democratic leaders in Congress have warned that they cannot possibly muster enough votes any time soon in support of spending more money to bail out some of the same financial institutions whose aggressive lending precipitated the .The administration said in January that it would alter its arrangement with Citigroup by converting up to $25 billion of preferred stock, which is like a loan, to common stock, which represents equity.After the conversion, the Treasury would end up with about 36 percent of Citigroup’s common shares, which come with full voting rights. That would make the government Citigroup’s biggest shareholder, effectively nudging the government one step closer to nationalizing a major bank.Nationalization, or even just the hint of nationalization, is a politically explosive step that White House and Treasury officials have fought hard to avoid.Administration officials acknowledged that they might still have to ask Congress for extra money. Beyond the 19 big banks, which are defined as those with more than $100 billion in assets, the Treasury has also injected capital into hundreds of regional and community banks and may need to provide more money before the financial crisis is over.Treasury officials say they have more money left in the rescue fund than might be apparent. Officials estimate that the fund will have about $134.5 billion left after the Treasury completes its $100 billion plan to buy toxic assets from banks and after it uses $50 billion to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.In practice, the toxic-asset programs are not expected to start for another few months, and it could be more than a year before the Treasury uses up the entire $100 billion. Likewise, it will be at least a year before the Treasury uses up all the money budgeted for homeowners.But the biggest way to stretch funds could be to convert preferred shares to common stock, a strategy that the government seems prepared to use on a case-by-case basis.Ever since the Treasury agreed to restructure Citigroup’s loans, officials have made it clear that other banks could follow suit and convert their government loans to voting shares of common stock as well.In the stress tests now under way, regulators are examining whether the big banks would have enough capital to withstand an economic downturn in which unemployment climbs to 10 percent and housing prices fall much further than they already have.As their yardstick, regulators are expected to examine a measure of bank capital called “tangible common equity.” By that measure of capital, every dollar a bank converts from preferred to common shares becomes an additional dollar of capital.The 19 big banks have received more than $140 billion from the Treasury’s financial rescue fund, and all of that has been in exchange for nonvoting preferred shares that pay an annual interest rate of about 5 percent.If all the banks that are found to have a capital shortfall fill that gap by converting their shares, rather than by obtaining more cash, the Treasury could stretch its dwindling rescue fund by more than $100 billion.The Treasury would also become a major shareholder, and perhaps even the controlling shareholder, in some financial institutions. That could lead to increasingly difficult conflicts of interest for the government, as policy makers juggle broad economic objectives with the narrower responsibility to maximize the value of their bank shares on behalf of taxpayers.Those are exactly the kinds of conflicts that Treasury and Fed officials were trying to avoid when they first began injecting capital into banks last fall.'"

At the turn, Don decides to replace his driver for the back nine because his grip is extremely wet. Gregg goes to the pro shop to buy rain gloves to use on the back nine, and Jon stops to get a towel to wrap around the grips of his clubs while hitting his shots for the rest of the day. Who will be penalized on the back nine?D. All three players will be penalizedThe correct answer is (A) Don only. A club is not unfit for play simply because the grip is wet. The club cannot be replaced (Decision 4-3/5). Plain rain gloves may be worn, and a towel may be used to grip the club during a stroke (Rule 14-3c).Later, the three players arrive at the 18th green in a downpour. Jon, the only player with an umbrella, holds it over Gregg’s head while Gregg addresses his ball, then moves away a few seconds before Gregg putts. Jon holds the umbrella over Don’s head while Don is making his stroke and holds it over his own head while he putts. Who incurs a penalty?The correct answer is (C) Don only. A player may protect himself from the elements (Decision 14-2/2), but he may not receive protection from anyone while making a stroke (Rule 14-2a). Because Don received assistance while making a stroke, he incurs a two-stroke penalty.Contributed by Bernie Loehr, the manager for the Rules of Golf, United States Golf Association.'"
"'09-04-20,'0','“The Dysfunctional Human Rights Council” (editorial, April 11) correctly notes that as a member of the Human Rights Council, the United States would often have to raise its voice “on behalf of repression’s voiceless victims.”But successful diplomacy will not rest on “forging compromises and building consensus.” There is no way in which we can build a meaningful consensus on human rights issues with those members of the council that are committed to the repression of freedom and to the politicization of the council.The task of diplomacy at the Human Rights Council is to reach out to fellow democracies and join with them in speaking out for the principles set forth in the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Through effective diplomacy it should be possible to build a majority for that cause.

"'09-04-20,'0','You can argue all you like, as historians and theologians have for centuries, about which of them has the greater claim to the English throne. But after seeing the terrifically exciting new production of Friedrich Schiller’s “Mary Stuart,” which opened Sunday night at the Broadhurst Theater, you won’t doubt that both the queens it portrays are born to rule. So, I might add, are the actresses who play them.That would be Janet McTeer, as Mary Queen of Scots, and Harriet Walter, as Elizabeth I. And they embody what may be the most storied rivalry in English history with a transfixing willfulness and devious artistry that could easily make the susceptible lose their heads. This being the year of our Lord 2009, no such sacrifices will be demanded literally. But it’s hard not to be at least a little in love with — and more than a little in awe of — the very leading ladies in Phyllida Lloyd’s crackling revival (first seen at the Donmar Warehouse in London) of this 1800 tragedy of double-dealing politics.Ms. McTeer, who won a Tony Award in 1997 for her emotionally supercharged Nora in “A Doll’s House,” and Ms. Walter (last seen on Broadway with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1983), have long been royalty of the British Theater, actresses equally and regally at home in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Yasmina Reza. They are exceptionally well equipped not only to command an audience’s attention, but also to make the case that, historically, she who would be queen has always of necessity been a great actress.At first the hot-blooded Roman Catholic Mary (long a prisoner of the English crown when the play begins) and the ice-blooded Protestant Elizabeth (who sees Mary as a fiery rebel in need of extinction) would seem to belong to different species — mammal and amphibian. Ms. McTeer and Ms. Walter make it piercingly clear that their characters are as alike as they are different.Both have grown up on public stages, where their every gesture is analyzed, and know, as Elizabeth puts it, that “the world thinks through its eyes.” Both are dependent on the approval of restless and fickle audiences. (Elizabeth’s style is crisp, tight and severe, while Mary’s is expansive and passionate, but they’re both major grandstanders.)And, ah, the ultimate rub: They are “female kings,” as Peter Oswald’s juicy new adaptation of Schiller’s German text has it, in a land where men are used to being governed only by men. This production, designed by Anthony Ward, ingeniously emphasizes the disparity by having only the female cast members in period Elizabethan costumes. The men wear latter-day Westminster business suits, and the expert actors inside them convey all the thorny ambivalence of having to bow to sweeping skirts.In other words, don’t hate Mary and Elizabeth because they’re powerful. On the other hand, don’t love them just because they’re lonely. These are dangerous times they live in, and they are undeniably dangerous women. They share only one scene, yet you are always aware of each as the shadow of the other, looking over her shoulder for her doppelgänger cousin. As for that one time they meet? It can only be described as elemental. Mary isn’t wrong when she speaks of her and her cousin as fire and water.The classical combination of strengths, weakness and circumstance that define tragic heroes has seldom been parsed with such flash, vigor and lacerating insight. Those who know Ms. Lloyd only as the director of the stage and film versions of the shrewdly mindless “Mamma Mia!” may be surprised by the crystalline intelligence she brings to a text more likely to be read than staged. (Donizetti’s opera “Maria Stuarda,” adapted from Schiller’s play, is more familiar to New York audiences.)This production makes you wonder why “Mary Stuart” hasn’t been seen on Broadway in more than three decades. Admittedly American audiences are averse to costume dramas (by anyone other than Shakespeare) in which royal genealogy and canonical law are points of fine debate.

The last such summit meeting, in in 2005, was marked by violent riots and anti-American rants by Mr. Chávez.Leaders left here almost shell-shocked by the lack of tension at this year’s gathering, with , ’s president, saying he was “extremely surprised” by what transpired.Prime Minister of said, “The most remarkable thing about this conference was the failure to fulfill expectations of great confrontation.”Despite the warm feelings, some old tensions remained. President of confronted Mr. Obama during a private session on Saturday with a charge that the United States had plotted to assassinate him. Mr. Obama responded on Sunday, saying, “I am absolutely opposed and condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments.”And President of , an old Washington nemesis, sought to embarrass Mr. Obama in a nearly one-hour speech filled with anti-American vitriol in which he likened the American embargo of Cuba to the Berlin Wall.Summit meeting organizers on the island of Trinidad, which was transformed into a virtual police state for three days, tamped down Mr. Chávez’s impulses to grandstand before the cameras by keeping the meetings closed-door. By the conference’s end, Mr. Chávez said he was ready to send an ambassador to the United States.Still, Mr. Obama said Sunday that the Venezuelan leader’s inflammatory rhetoric had been “a source of concern,” adding that “the test for all of us is not simply words, but also deeds.”Mr. Obama said he was not worried about the political fallout, saying that he tries to figure out “what’s right in terms of America interests. And on this one, I think I’m right.”Hoping to push the process forward, leaders from Latin America and the Caribbean have volunteered to aid in a reconciliation between the United States and Cuba. “Brazil would be able to help,” Mr. da Silva said Sunday. In an interview published Sunday in the Spanish newspaper ABC, he said the United States should not wait for Cuba to take the next step in efforts to end their half-century of feuding.While Cuba did not dominate all the deliberations, it overshadowed closed-door discussions here about regional energy needs, , regional drug policy and the global economic crisis. The leaders ultimately agreed to work to strengthen the Inter-American Development Bank to assist countries struggling with a lack of access to .Mr. Manning said that the final declaration from Port of Spain did not properly reflect the current global crisis because negotiations over the document began more than a year and a half ago.He denied that conflicts at the 2005 meeting, or Mr. Chávez’s history of using such events to rail against the United States and others, had anything to do with keeping the leaders’ discussions private. Public scrutiny “stifles a full and free expression of views,” Mr. Manning said, which “could lead in some instances to posturing.”Mr. Chávez took the initiative Saturday, saying he was naming Roy Chaderton, Venezuela’s representative to the , to be his new ambassador to Washington.Mr. Chávez had ejected the American ambassador to Venezuela in September, saying he had discovered an American-backed plot to remove him from power. Washington responded in kind.The State Department said that Mr. Chávez approached Secretary of State to discuss returning ambassadors to their respective posts in and Washington. The State Department called it “a positive development.”'"

"'09-04-21,'1','WASHINGTON  The Treasury Department’s most ambitious plans to rescue troubled banks  partnerships between the government and private investors, backed by the Federal Reserve  are inherently vulnerable to fraud and should not be started without stronger safeguards, a top government investigator warned in a report to be released Tuesday.The report also warned that the Treasury’s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program has evolved into a $3 trillion effort of “unprecedented scope, scale and complexity” and comes with too little oversight and too little information about what companies are doing with the taxpayer money they are getting.“The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used,” wrote Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general assigned to monitor the bailout program, in his second report to Congress.Mr. Barofsky was particularly critical of the Treasury Department’s refusal to demand detailed information from banks and other financial institutions about what they are doing with the money they receive.Noting the widespread public outrage unleashed over the Treasury’s huge payments to the American International Group, the failing insurance conglomerate, Mr. Barofsky warned that Treasury officials were jeopardizing the credibility of their efforts by not requiring companies to disclose far more about their use of taxpayer money.“Failure to impose this requirement with respect to the injection of yet another $30 billion into A.I.G. would not only be a failure of oversight, but could call into question the credibility of the government’s efforts,” he said. He was referring to bailout money that had been pledged, but not yet delivered, to the insurance giant.The inspector general was particularly pointed in his criticism of the Obama administration’s plan to buy up questionable assets from banks. That plan calls for the Treasury to spend $100 billion to buy up troubled mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.The plan also calls for multiplying the total volume of those asset purchases to almost $1 trillion by allowing private investors to borrow money at low interest rates from the Federal Reserve.Mr. Barofsky said the plan posed “significant fraud risks,” especially when it came to buying up securities backed by exotic mortgages made during the peak of the housing bubble, when the excesses of poorly documented loans and no-money-down loans reached their zeniths.The report said that the Federal Reserve intended its lending program, known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, to finance new lending rather than to buy up existing assets. It warned that the Fed was not currently planning to examine the securities that it would finance, and would be relying instead on the evaluation by credit rating agencies that originally failed to spot the dangers of subprime mortgages.“Credit ratings, cited as one of the primary credit protections in TALF as currently configured, have been proven to be of questionable value,” the report said. “The wholesale failure of the credit rating agencies to rate adequately such securities is at the heart of the securitization market collapse, if not the primary cause of the current credit crisis.”Mr. Barofsky also warned that the Treasury’s plan might allow investors to double up on government subsidies for buying up troubled assets. The Public-Private Investment Program would have the Treasury invest alongside private investors. But the partnerships would also be able to borrow money from the Fed through “nonrecourse” loans. If the investments flopped, the investors could walk away from the loans and leave taxpayers with most of the losses.The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have not yet begun the asset purchase programs.The two agencies started up a limited version of the TALF program last month, which is mainly focused on financing consumer and small-business loans.In February, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced the broader Public-Private Investment Program, which is aimed at buying up both mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Part of the plan calls for marrying the public-private program with the Fed’s lending program, but the program still appears to be at least a month or two away from starting.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said some of the inspector general’s criticisms about buying up “legacy assets”  usually troubled mortgage-backed securities  made sense.“There are a few problems with using the TALF program to buy up legacy assets,” he said. “First, it’s rewarding the worst behavior  buying no-doc loans.” Second, he said, the public-private program “is a very rich subsidy program to begin with. You have to ask whether it needs the extra enrichment of TALF, particularly when it involves the most egregious of mortgages.”Treasury officials had no comment on Mr. Barofsky’s report. But Mr. Geithner is scheduled to discuss it on Tuesday at a hearing of a Congressional panel that oversees the financial bailout program.Both the Treasury and the Fed have increased the amount of information they are making public about their various rescue plans. Treasury officials have pushed the banks to provide information about their lending volumes, and they are demanding more information about what banks are doing with their money.But Treasury officials have argued that it is almost impossible to get meaningful information about how banks are using money under the troubled-asset program, in part because the money came with few conditions. Treasury officials have also noted that if the funds are allocated for one purpose, like mortgage lending, they free up other money that can be used for a very different purpose, like making acquisitions.'"

"'09-04-21,'1','DETROIT — Chrysler’s lending arm will not get an additional $750 million loan from the federal government after some executives declined to go along with its restrictions on pay, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said Monday.This person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because talks on the matter are private, said the Treasury Department withdrew its offer to further aid Chrysler Financial because some of its 25 top executives would not agree to compensation waivers.Chrysler Financial, which already has received $1.5 billion in aid, denied that executive compensation was related to a decision last week to seek additional funding from private lenders rather than the Treasury.In a statement, the company said it had “adequate private capital funding to cover the short-term needs of our dealers and customers” and did not need more funding from the Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.“As such, executives have not been presented with any new demands with regard to executive compensation,” the statement said. “As a TARP recipient, the company remains in full compliance with current executive compensation requirements.”'"
"'09-04-21,'1','The Housing Authority, which provides low-rent apartments subsidized by the federal government to poor and moderate-income families, maintains 3,338 elevators in 2,618 buildings.Ricardo Elías Morales, the Housing Authority’s interim chairman, said he could not comment on the specifics of a lawsuit that he had not seen and that had not been filed. But he added, “The vast majority of our elevators are safe and provide the kind of service that they’re supposed to.”Mr. Morales said he would unveil a plan to overhaul the elevators in a matter of weeks. Managers have described several improvements since Jacob’s death, including expanding inspection teams and spending $107 million to replace about 550 elevators in the next five years.“Some of our elevators are in need of repair,” said Mr. Morales, “which is obvious, and we have a plan for that.” He added that agency officials met with the Disabilities Network of New York City on April 7, but elevators were not raised as a concern.He said tenants who have difficulty walking or who use wheelchairs can call the agency during a breakdown and arrange to have a stair-lift machine brought in.Both before and after Jacob’s death, residents at many of the city’s 340 complexes have complained about elevators. A public housing elevator is out about once a month, according to the Housing Authority, and residents typically wait about 10 hours for repairs.Phyllis Gonzalez, 61, one of the tenants in the lawsuit, refers to the times when both elevators go out in her building in the Chelsea Houses as “double-headers.” Ms. Gonzalez, who lives in a 12th-floor apartment and uses a wheelchair because of arthritis and other health problems, recalled the day a few years ago when, during a double-header, she went down 12 flights of stairs, sitting on one step at a time.The lawsuit is being prepared by the nonprofit New York Legal Assistance Group and the Manhattan law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, which is providing pro bono legal services. It does not seek monetary damages, but instead seeks a court order requiring the agency to maintain elevators in working condition, repair them in a reasonable time, fix them effectively to avoid repeated breakdowns and provide accommodations for residents who are disabled or have difficulty using the stairs when the elevators are out.Jane Greengold Stevens, director of litigation for the New York Legal Assistance Group, said there were at least 7,000 public housing tenants who had what she called mobility impairments and had been “deprived of the full use of their homes by elevator failures.”The lawsuit is to be filed in federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, shortly before a news conference announcing the suit, lawyers involved in the case said.The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, whose office has been working with the lawyers, said he continues to receive phone calls from tenants about faulty elevators. “Let’s face it,” Mr. Stringer said. “If million-dollar co-ops had these elevator problems, there would be outrage. Because these elevators are in housing for the poorest among us, there’s no action.”'"

"'09-04-21,'1','WASHINGTON — It has been more than a quarter century since the Supreme Court last recognized a new category of speech with so little value that it did not deserve the protections of the First Amendment. On Monday, the court agreed to decide whether depictions of cruelty to animals should join obscenity and fighting words as speech unworthy of constitutional protection.The new case arose from the conviction of Robert J. Stevens, a Virginia man sentenced to 37 months in prison for selling videos of pit bulls fighting each other and attacking other animals. A 1999 federal law makes it a crime to create or sell such videos and other depictions of cruelty to animals.All 50 states ban the cruelty itself. The federal law is aimed solely at depictions of it.In Mr. Stevens’s case, his lawyers told the court, “there is no claim that the defendant was himself involved in acts of animal cruelty or was even present at their commission.” The lawyers also said that many, if not all, of the acts documented were lawful in the jurisdictions in which they were filmed.Some of the footage on the videos Mr. Stevens sold was decades old, and some of it showed dog fights in Japan, where they are legal. But the 1999 law requires only that the activities shown be illegal where the video was bought or sold. The law contains an exception for materials of “serious religious, political, scientific, journalistic, historical or artistic value.”Last summer, by a vote of 10 to 3, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, reversed Mr. Stevens’s conviction and struck down the law under the First Amendment. The majority said that if the law stood it could make it a crime to sell videos of bullfighting in Spain or of hunting out of season.'"
"'09-04-21,'1','Re “Stomach Bug Crystallizes a Threat From Antibiotics” (Well, April 14): Though taking antibiotics puts patients at risk for Clostridium difficile, the actual cause of this infection is poor hygiene. The germ almost always enters the patient’s body through oral fecal transmission, meaning that traces of one patient’s feces get into another patient’s mouth. Inadequate cleaning is at fault.Hospitals need to thoroughly clean rooms and furniture with bleach, which kills C. difficile spores. Patients need to clean their own hands frequently, especially before eating. Alcohol-based, waterless hand cleaners do not kill C. difficile, but washing with soap and water can remove the spores in most cases. Blaming antibiotics ignores the real culprit: inadequate cleaning in hospitals and nursing homes.The writer is a former lieutenant governor of New York and the founder of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.Hand washing, hand washing, hand washing! As a nursing student at the University of California, San Francisco, I have had this mantra drilled into my head since my first week of training. Hospital-acquired infections of C. difficile are indeed preventable. One key to the prevention of infection lies in meticulous hand washing with antibacterial soap and water.The alarming trend of rising infection rates has not gone unnoticed. The Joint Commission, an organization that accredits hospitals, lists “preventing multi-drug resistant organism infections” — including C. difficile — as one of its 2009 safety goals. Patients, families and visitors can do their part by washing their hands and demanding that their health care providers do the same.'"
"'09-04-21,'1','But their primary concern has been finding insurance for Jake, who, after four operations, two transplants and round after grueling round of , has been -free for a year.He continues to face a significant threat of recurrence and requires regular monitoring for at least two years. His twice-a-year CT scans cost $3,000 each, and quarterly blood tests and X-rays run more than $1,000.Late last month, in a race against the clock, the Walkers obtained a short-term policy for Jake through , where he is a junior studying animal science on a scholarship. Doing so could be crucial to his future insurability because federal law allows insurers to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions when there has been a gap in coverage of at least 63 days.With a week to spare, they scraped together $335 to pay the quarterly premium by delaying a house payment and pleading with the power company for a 10-day extension. But the policy will expire on May 16, and its coverage limits will afford minimal protection against bankruptcy if the cancer returns before then.Now the Walkers face the possibility that Jake will no longer be seen at Houston’s renowned M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, which they for his remission.“You realize how vulnerable you really are,” said Ms. Walker, who exhibits the maternal ferocity of a black bear. “You just — not give up — but you just feel that you’re at a loss, that you’re at your wits’ end. I ask myself, ‘Do I really have to lose my home to save my son’s life?’ ”Neither of the Walkers has been able to land a job with the kind of large group coverage that would disregard Jake’s health status. His cancer history effectively makes him uninsurable on the individual market. He is too old to qualify for as a child, and it is virtually impossible in to qualify as an able-bodied adult.Because the Walkers own their modest house, they have been told they do not merit other government assistance. With little predictable income beyond Ms. Walker’s $688 unemployment check every two weeks, the family cannot afford the state’s high-risk insurance pool or continuation coverage through the federal Cobra law.To date, Jake’s treatment has cost nearly $2 million. Almost all of it has been paid by under a preferred-provider family policy that Ms. Walker paid $426.28 a month for through DHL, the troubled shipping company where she worked as a billing agent.Until last fall, Mr. Walker was the co-owner of a business that supplied DHL with trucks and drivers, but it too fell victim to downsizing. The feed store, the last in an area where suburbs are swallowing ranchland, has been losing money.What has made the Walkers feel most helpless, though, is that their son has been left so exposed, after all he has endured.“Your job as a parent is to protect your children at any cost,” Ms. Walker said. “I really felt like I had let him down.”At 6-foot-2 and 285 pounds, Jacob Walker often dwarfs the prize livestock he parades in the show ring. He first noticed that his left testicle had become larger than the other as a senior in high school. He waited a few weeks to tell his parents so he would not miss the county fair, where his favorite heifer and goat both won grand-champion ribbons. By then, the cancer had spread to his abdomen, and he received a Stage 3 diagnosis.Over the next two years, surgeons would remove the testicle and slice off diseased sections of his abdomen and liver. The chemotherapy preceding the stem cell transplants was so toxic that it peeled his skin.Through it all, Jake maintained an optimistic determination. “Life’s tough,” he would say. “Sometimes you have to get a helmet and run with it.”His mother left the hospital once in 26 days during the stem cell transplants. When he started college online from his hospital bed, she read to him from his world-literature text. His father, not often given to emotion, started telling his son every day that he loved him, before going home to cry. During Jake’s chemotherapy, his buddies in Future Farmers of America shaved their heads in solidarity.Late in 2007, Jake’s doctors at Texas Children’s Hospital told him that they had done all they could and gave him a 20 percent chance of surviving the next year. The Walkers were not ready to quit, and sought out Dr. Lance C. Pagliaro, a specialist at M. D. Anderson.Dr. Pagliaro recommended an experimental chemotherapy regimen, and Jake has shown no sign of cancer since the treatments ended in March 2008. “Needless to say, we’re very pleased with how he’s doing,” Dr. Pagliaro said.But during Jake’s check-up in December, Ms. Walker told the hospital that her son would be uninsured at the end of January. She said a hospital official then told her that if she was not able to pay up front, she should take her son elsewhere.Dr. Pagliaro pledged that he would do what he could to make sure that Jake would be seen. “To deny him the relatively inexpensive follow-up that is so crucial,” he said in an interview, “just makes absolutely no sense.”But the doctor has yet to intercede with the business office about waiving fees, saying it would be premature. Last month, when the Walkers showed up for an appointment with Jake’s oncologist, only a last-minute dispensation enabled him to be seen without payment in advance. The Walkers left with the impression they would be billed $700; the hospital says it will be $1,507. In either event, they have no way to pay it.The hospital has suggested that Jake have his next tests elsewhere and send the results to Dr. Pagliaro to review, with payment to be negotiated in advance.The Walkers are now completing the voluminous paperwork to apply for M. D. Anderson’s charity care program for Texas residents. The hospital, which had $2.2 billion in net patient revenue last year, spent $209 million on such uncompensated care.But Dr. Ron Walters, the hospital’s vice president for medical operations, said economic pressures had made it more difficult to assist patients who were not under active treatment. Dr. Walters said it had been “good financial counseling” to advise the Walkers to explore other options, and questioned whether they would qualify for charity care because they had assets. Among the criteria, he said, is whether a patient can receive comparable treatment elsewhere.Dr. Walters said requests for deferred payment by uninsured patients had risen tenfold in four years. But Ms. Walker said she could not help taking the hospital’s stance personally.“You feel like you’ve been kicked to the curb,” she said. “It’s like, ‘As long as you have insurance, we’re willing to go over the moon to see you and make sure that everything is taken care of.’ And the minute you don’t, they don’t want you.”The Walkers had not heard about the Texas Health Insurance Risk Pool, which provides coverage to 26,550 otherwise uninsurable people. Once they learned about it, they concluded they could not afford the most useful policy for Jake, a plan with a $1,000 deductible that would cost $414 a month.Now they are revisiting whether they might extend their P.P.O. coverage under Cobra, which allows laid-off workers to continue their insurance at full price for up to 18 months. When Ms. Walker first investigated, she learned it would cost $1,359 a month to replicate her coverage.The recently enacted federal stimulus package includes a 65 percent subsidy for nine months of Cobra coverage for the newly unemployed. That would reduce the Walkers’ price to $476 a month, which they said they still could not afford.They are now inquiring about whether they can cover only Jake. If they can find a policy for him for less than $200 a month, Ms. Walker said, she would find a way.“It will happen,” she said, “if I have to walk up and down the street and collect tin cans.”'"

But even prices in normally stable sectors like drugs and medical treatments fell 0.7 percent in March, and there were slight declines in footwear, clothing and prices for household electronics.“Alarm bells are going off,” said Lorenzo Amor, president of the Association of Autonomous Workers, which represents small businesses and self-employed people. “Economies can recover from deceleration, but it’s harder to recover from a deflationary situation. This could be a catastrophe for the Spanish economy.”Deflation is not just a Spanish concern. , and have reported price drops, too. While the declines have been slight — and prices rose modestly after factoring out food and energy prices, which can fluctuate widely — other figures released this month suggest the risk of deflation is growing.In Germany, wholesale prices dropped 8 percent in March from a year ago, the steepest fall since 1987. In Japan, wholesale prices fell 2.2 percent on an annual basis. In the , the fell 0.4 percent in March, year over year, though prices rose 0.2 percent excluding food and energy.“It doesn’t mean it will spread here to the U.S., but we need to look closely at Spain and other places to understand the dynamic,” says Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the and a former chief economist for the . “It’s like the front line of a new virus outbreak.”The trends have unnerved even well-established businesses. “There is such a huge lack of confidence in the politicians, in the and in the ,” said Arturo Virosque, 79, president of Valencia’s chamber of commerce and the owner of a local logistics company. Ticking off crises going back to the Spanish Civil War in his youth, he said, “this is different. It’s like an illness.”After price cuts by competitors, Mr. Virosque’s company reduced charges for storage and transportation, and slashed its work force to about 170, from 250. “The worst thing is that we have to cut the young people,” he said, because higher severance makes it too expensive to fire older workers.While unemployment traditionally is higher in Spain than in much of , the sharp increase has many here nervous. The jobless rate for those under 25 is at a Depression-like level of 31.8 percent, the highest among the 27 nations of the European Union.Before cutting prices in early 2009, Mr. Maestre ordered several rounds of job cuts at his company, Fermax, as sales of the intercoms collapsed with Spain’s housing bubble.“It’s a question of survival for everybody,” he said. Still, the lower prices have not translated into higher sales. Fermax’s orders fell 25 percent in the first quarter. Prices for some intercom parts that he buys, like video screens, have also come down, but it is not enough to make up for the sales drought. “Prices have to come down more and we will have to spend less,” he said.The effects of this downward spiral are evident at Valencia’s principal soup kitchen, in an imposing stone building constructed a century ago as an alms house. Each day, a line forms around the block by noon. The Casa de la Caridad, or House of Charity, is helping three times as many people as it did a year ago. More than 11,000 meals were served in March, and it expects to top 12,000 this month.As the economic decline has broadened, so has the range of people seeking help. In the past, most were out-of-work immigrants or the homeless, said the center’s director, Guadalupe Ferrer. Today, “it’s more and more people like us who had a house, a respectable job, but are now unemployed.”The employed worry that falling prices will endanger their jobs as well.Yolanda Garcia has worked as a butcher under the arches of Valencia’s soaring Art Nouveau central market for a decade, but she’s troubled that a drop in the price of chicken, to 5.99 euros a kilo, from 6.99, has not attracted more customers to her stall.“Of course, we’re worried the boss will have to reduce staff,” said Ms. Garcia, 38, whose husband, a construction worker, was laid off two months ago.All this has made deflation, once a subject largely reserved for economists who studied the Great Depression, into front-page news here.The American economy is less vulnerable to deflation, in part because of the ’s decision to cut interest rates to near zero and increase lending by $2 trillion. The has also cut rates, though more slowly, and it has resisted the lending measures adopted by the Fed and the to prop up spending.When Spain had its own currency, the peseta, the central bank could have simply devalued it, or cut interest rates to zero. But that is not an option in the era of the euro, when monetary policy is controlled from the European Central Bank’s headquarters in , said Santiago Carbó, a professor of economics at the University of .“If we enter into a deflationary period, we won’t have the monetary tools to sort it out,” Mr. Carbó said.'"
"'09-04-21,'1','In 1996, Congress passed legislation allowing a limited number of public airports to solicit private investors. Only two airports have tried going private, and both have encountered problems.Stewart International Airport in Newburgh, N.Y., was purchased by the National Express Group of Great Britain in 2000. The British company, unable to make a profit, sold the airport to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2007. In Chicago, a consortium of investors agreed to purchase Midway Airport for $2.5 billion, but the credit crisis threatens the completion of the deal. The city of Chicago earlier this month granted the purchasers an extension on the due date for their next payment.For Branson Airport, however, all has gone smoothly. The owners bought 925 acres in the Ozarks and constructed a runway, control tower and 58,000-square-foot terminal building in less than two years. Commercial passenger flights are scheduled to begin May 11.“I think it’s some kind of record,” Jeff Bourk, executive director of the airport, said of the speed of the construction. “On other projects I’ve been involved in, there’s a lot more red tape.”Because Branson eschewed federal assistance, it was free of the restrictions that accompany government aid. That allowed the owners to offer exclusive contracts to AirTran and Sun Country airlines on certain routes to Branson.“We don’t want suicide fares, two or three airlines bashing each other over the head until someone says ‘uncle’ and leaves,” said Mr. Peet, explaining why the airport agreed to protect the airlines from competition. “We want to build real service, sustainable service.”Restricting competition could result in higher prices, said Richard L. de Neufville, an engineering systems professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who specializes in airports. He has seen it happen before. “At first, local people are glad there is something where there was nothing,” Mr. de Neufville said. “As people get used to it there will be a concern about a monopoly jacking up the prices.”Mr. Peet insists the airport has nothing to gain by that. “If we don’t provide a good product at a reasonable price, we’ll cut our nose.”As a money-making venture for Mr. Peet and his fellow investors, the airport has a limited life span. In a deal to finance the airport with tax-free bonds, his Branson Airport L.L.C. gave the airport and the 420 acres on which it sits to Taney County, retaining the right to operate the airport for 45 years.“Saving us money on the cost of debt service was more valuable than owning the airport,” Mr. Peet said.With the clock set to start ticking next month, every possible way is being considered for maximizing the profit-making potential of the airport. Airlines are being wooed with a range of services so complete that the carriers need not hire a single employee. Security at checkpoints, of course, is provided by the Transportation Security Administration.“We’re trying to make it as easy as possible for the airlines, with no station set-up costs, no installation of computers,” Mr. Bourk said. “You come up to the counter and it’s a Branson airport employee who will process your ticket and get you onto the flight.”The airport also negotiated an $8.40-a-head fee from the city of Branson for every tourist arriving by air, a revenue stream that could bring in as much as $2 million a year. Ticket booths for downtown performances will be found in passenger arrival areas, and even the right to name the airport is up for sale.Mr. de Neufville, who studies the issues involved in privatization of public properties, said airports as private for-profit enterprises that continue to receive federal money face unique challenges. “Governments do not permit their privatized major commercial airports to engage in practices that are routine in most other industries,” he noted in a study he conducted several years after the privatization trial program began in the United States. For example, they cannot set their own prices or restrict access to their products.That is why Branson Airport is so intriguing. It is in the singularly liberating position of being able to ignore some of the business restrictions that every other commercial airport must follow.“The airport industry doesn’t know what to make of Branson Airport,” said Steve Steckler, a transportation development consultant in Maryland. In this time of transition, it is the airport itself that put Branson, Mo., on the maps of aviation insiders. As Mr. Steckler put it, “It’s show time.”'"
"'09-04-21,'1','Every spring, college basketball fanatics become swept up in the romanticism of the underdog, the thrill of the upset and the madness of March. The N.B.A. seems primed for its own zany month. Are you ready for April Absurdity?Four of the N.B.A.’s eight underdogs won their playoff openers over the weekend, none of them more shocking than the Chicago Bulls’ 105-103 defeat in overtime of the defending champion Boston Celtics. In the other victories by lower seeds, sixth-seeded Philadelphia beat No. 3 Orlando, No. 5 Houston defeated No. 4 Portland and sixth-seeded Dallas beat No. 3 San Antonio.If the N.B.A. teams played a single-elimination tournament, as the college teams do in the N.C.A.A. tournament, Dick Vitale would have spontaneously combusted.The N.B.A.’s best-of-seven format favors the higher seeds (which have more home games) and provides a hedge against fluky upsets. But consider the most quoted statistic of the weekend: 78.6. That is the percentage of Game 1 winners who have gone on to win a best-of-seven series since the N.B.A.’s inaugural season in 1946.If the trend holds, this will be a spectacular year for upsets, starting with the Celtics. Since 1970, only five defending champions have failed to make it out of the first round (including the 1998 Bulls, who missed the playoffs). The last time it happened was 2007, when the Bulls swept the Miami Heat in the first round. That same year, eighth-seeded Golden State stunned top-seeded Dallas.But those moments are rare. Since the N.B.A. adopted the 16-team playoff format in 1984, 47 of the 50 teams seeded No. 1 have won their first-round series. Forty-six of the No. 2 seeds have prevailed. Even the No. 3s have been fairly reliable, winning 36 of 50 series.'"
"'09-04-21,'1','Not only Mr. Obama but also one of his rivals for the presidency, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had promised during their campaigns to renegotiate the accord — a politically popular position in some electorally important Midwestern states that have lost thousands of manufacturing jobs.Thea Lee, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. policy director, said that the workers federation would have preferred “more definitive” language on addressing key labor concerns, but that it was understandable for a new administration to start its review with a less confrontational approach.“We were obviously very encouraged by what Obama the candidate was saying on the campaign trail in terms of needing to recognize the deficiencies of Nafta and to strengthen it,” said Margrete Strand Rangnes, a labor and trade specialist with the Sierra Club.Her group opposed Nafta from the start as lacking adequate environmental provisions, and contends that the side agreements added later have proved inadequate. “You have an environmental side agreement that doesn’t have as many teeth as the commercial provisions of the agreement,” she said. “You have an investment chapter that allows companies to basically file suit against common-sense environmental and public health measures.”But she said the Sierra Club recognized that change would not come easily, and added, “We’re eager to work with the administration in having that conversation.”Since the election, neither the president nor Mrs. Clinton, now secretary of state, has said much about trying to move side agreements on labor and the environment — which are subject to limited enforcement — into the main part of the trade pact, a potentially tangled and protracted process. As candidates in the Democratic presidential primaries last year, both said they would renegotiate or even opt out of Nafta, citing flaws in its labor and environmental provisions, while trading accusations over past support for the agreement.Mr. Kirk, who as mayor of Dallas was known as a strong advocate of free trade, also said the administration planned expeditious reviews of pending trade agreements with Colombia and Panama.He said that Colombia had made “remarkable progress” in reducing violence — attacks against labor activists have been a key sticking point — but that other issues remained, and he vowed intensive consultation with Congress on the matter.The Bush administration signed the agreement with Colombia in November 2006. But Congressional Democrats and United States labor groups have said the Uribe government must do more to stop the antilabor violence and hold perpetrators accountable, a position Mr. Obama supported during his campaign.Regarding Panama, Mr. Kirk said that differences on labor standards, and the question of the country “possibly being a tax haven,” needed resolution.Mr. Obama and Mr. Kirk met with leaders of both countries during the Trinidad meeting.'"
"'09-04-21,'1','A large new study has provided added evidence that larger waist size alone, even in people of normal weight, significantly raises the risk for heart disease.Researchers used data on 80,360 Swedish men and women ages 45 to 83 who were enrolled in two long-term health studies over a seven-year period ending in 2004. During those years, 1,100 of them were either hospitalized for heart disease or died from it.The researchers measured waist size, waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, and B.M.I., or body mass index, a weight-to-height ratio. All four measures were associated with heart disease, but waist circumference alone predicted heart disease risk regardless of other measures. B.M.I. was a significant predictor in women only if they had a large waist size. The study appeared online April 7 in the journal Circulation: Heart Failure.The researchers found that a four-inch increase in waist size was associated with about a 15 percent increase in risk for heart disease, both in people of normal weight with a B.M.I. of 25 and in the obese with a B.M.I. above 30.“If people are using waist size to monitor body weight, that’s fine,” said Emily B. Levitan, the lead author and a research fellow at Harvard. “But what we really found is that excess weight, no matter how you measure it, is associated with increased risk.”'"

The lawyer said Phurbu Tsering Rinpoche had been forced to confess after four days of police interrogation and threats that his wife and son would be detained if he did not comply.

"'09-04-22,'0','Caterpillar reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years on Tuesday, hurt by plunging sales and the cost of laying off thousands of workers. It also said the Obama administration should have allocated more money for roads, bridges and other public works under its stimulus plans.The $112 million loss highlighted the depth and breadth of the global downturn, as Caterpillar recorded double-digit sales declines in most of its businesses. Its vast geographic reach and array of products, including bulldozers, engines for cargo ships and mining trucks that haul materials like iron ore, make it a bellwether of the global economy.The company, which is based in Peoria, Ill., also said the global slowdown was worse than it had predicted, despite government stimulus plans and better-than-expected commodity prices. With lending still tight and the United States recession tougher than expected in the first quarter, Caterpillar cut its outlook for the year.Revenue at Caterpillar, dropped 22 percent, to $9.22 billion, from $11.8 billion in the first quarter a year ago.The company posted a loss of $112 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with a net income of $922 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. The 2009 results included charges of 58 cents a share for layoffs. Without those charges, Caterpillar would have earned 39 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 4 cents on revenue of $8.54 billion.This year Caterpillar will have “the most significant percentage decline in our sales since the early ’30s,” James W. Owens, the company’s chief executive, said in a conference call. “We modeled a worldwide recession, but not one quite as severe as we’re currently seeing.”'"
"'09-04-22,'0','CHICAGO — Rod R. Blagojevich, ousted governor of Illinois, will have to settle for the drama of his real life here at home.On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected a request by Mr. Blagojevich, who is awaiting trial in a corruption case, that he be allowed to travel to a Costa Rican jungle to take part in the taping of a “Survivor”-type reality television show, “I’m a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!”Mr. Blagojevich, who once had national political aspirations, said outside court that to support his family, he needed the television work, which would have brought him $123,000 had he survived 12 episodes and been dubbed “king of the jungle” over other contestants like Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag of the MTV reality show “The Hills.”His lawyer, Sheldon Sorosky, urged the court to change the conditions of Mr. Blagojevich’s bond to allow him to leave the country. Mr. Sorosky said NBC, which will broadcast the series this summer, was ready to pay for “two or more people” — retired F.B.I. agents or former federal marshals, perhaps — to supervise Mr. Blagojevich around the clock in Costa Rica. (It was unclear how they were to fit into the show’s narrative.)But prosecutors argued that it was uncertain whether Mr. Blagojevich could be extradited back home if he insisted on remaining in Costa Rica.In the end, the judge, James B. Zagel, said Mr. Blagojevich would most likely need to spend the coming months reading evidence to be provided by the government in its 16-count corruption case against him. The defendant, Judge Zagel said, does not yet fully grasp “the position he finds himself in.”'"

"'09-04-22,'0','She slept with some of her bosses, and dated both Jack Dempsey and Ron Getty, son of the oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. (“A lady’s love should pay for all trips, most restaurant tabs and all liquor,” she later advised.)She instinctively knew, however, as she would later counsel other women: “You can’t sleep your way to the top or even to the middle, and there is no such thing as a free lunch. You have to do it yourself, so you might as well get started.” Within a few years she landed a job at an advertising agency and became the most highly paid female copywriter on the West Coast. In 1959, when she was 37, she married David Brown, an older, twice-married film producer. It was his idea that she write “Sex and the Single Girl,” but it was her bright, no-nonsense voice that brought the book to life.The early 1960s was not a cheerful time for single women in America; they were viewed with pity if not outright suspicion. As Ms. Brown put it, the prevailing attitude was: “If you were female and not married by age 30, you might as well go to the Grand Canyon and throw yourself in.” Ms. Brown knew, the author writes, that single women “wanted to feel good about rather than ashamed of the life choices they made or contemplated.” The single girl, she proclaimed, “is a giver, not a taker, a winner and not a loser.”In “Sex and the Single Girl,” Ms. Brown was direct about sex. “You inherited your proclivity for it,” she wrote. “It isn’t some random piece of mischief you dreamed up because you’re a bad, wicked girl.”The book was also a groundbreaking financial primer. “Being smart about money is sexy,” Ms. Brown said. A child of the Great Depression, she was a proud penny pincher, brown-bagging her lunch nearly every day of her professional life.Ms. Scanlon notes, interestingly, that some of Ms. Brown’s most provocative writing — on topics like contraception, abortion (which was still illegal), and lesbianism — was cut from “Sex and the Single Girl” by male editors. Nevertheless, the book went on to be a best seller and a cultural phenomenon. Ms. Brown became, the author writes, the 10th-most-frequent guest on “The Tonight Show.”Some of the best chapters in “Bad Girls Go Everywhere” contrast Ms. Brown’s career with that of Friedan, whose book “The Feminine Mystique” came out a year later. Ms. Scanlon is sympathetic to both women, but fiercely loyal to her subject. Unlike Ms. Brown, she writes, Friedan, who attended Smith College, was simply “not one of the women she purported to speak for.”The book’s second half chronicles Ms. Brown’s 32-year tenure as the editor of Cosmopolitan, where her fundamental message was little changed.Ms. Scanlon writes well about Ms. Brown’s sparring with feminists like Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, who once led a group that invaded Cosmo’s offices. Ms. Brown never could get with the whole hippie thing.“Those back-to-goodness-and-nature hippies are certainly not natural,” Ms. Brown explained. “They may not wear makeup, but some of them bleach their hair and their fringy, furry, funky costumes certainly didn’t grow on their bodies (though they sometimes smell like it); the clothes are carefully, ‘unnaturally,’ collected from thrift shop and Army surplus stores.” Ms. Brown was justly criticized, Ms. Scanlon notes, for not allowing certain subjects into her magazine. These included the existence of children, and topics like AIDS.As Ms. Brown aged, she grew no less provocative. In her 1993 book, “The Late Show,” aimed at older women, she wrote: “Welcoming a penis just seems more womanly to me than baking chocolate chip cookies or doling out money for a grandchild’s college tuition.” She was gently forced out of the editorship of Cosmopolitan in 1997.“Bad Girls Go Everywhere” is the first biography of Ms. Brown; I suspect there might be more. Ms. Scanlon covers this territory gracefully and concisely, but the bite in this cocktail is provided by Ms. Brown, who is by far the livelier writer.You finish this book with little doubt that, as Ms. Scanlon writes, had Helen Gurley Brown “sought to trademark the Cosmo Girl, she would have had to present herself as evidence.”'"
"'09-04-22,'0','The company acted under a 2002 law intended to make ports more secure — Bayer CropScience brings barges in on the Kanawha River — and said that it was under the jurisdiction of the Coast Guard, an agency that does not have extensive experience in chemical processing.In response to questions, Mr. Buckner said that the company later found that 88 percent of the 2,000 documents it had marked as being “security sensitive” were not.Mr. Stupak said he thought the company was trying to overwhelm the C.S.B., and the committee, by giving them thousands of pages marked that way so that they could not disclose the documents.He said the committee would consider changes to the law, perhaps instituting penalties for excessive use of the “security sensitive” designation.Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, the ranking Republican on the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, “Allowing inappropriate use of sensitive security information designations to hide inconvenient facts is not acceptable, and undermines public safety.”Mr. Buckner also said that the company had inadvertently withheld information from emergency responders in the hours after the explosion. A plant official had tried to send word to the fire personnel at the main gate about what was going on, but, he said, the information had been garbled by a security guard.The committee released transcripts of the 911 operator and various officials in extended exchanges in which they said they had no information about what was happening.The plant was previously owned by Union Carbide, which also owned the plant in Bhopal that had released tons of MIC in December 1984. Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, noted that the same month in 1984, he had held a hearing at the West Virginia plant, near Charleston, to inquire about safe use of the chemical.“I think it’s finally time to ask whether it makes sense to allow Bayer to continue producing and storing such massive amounts of this highly toxic chemical,” Mr. Waxman said Tuesday.Committee investigators found internal Bayer documents that detailed a company strategy to “marginalize” a local citizens’ group and the local newspaper, The Charleston Gazette.The company endangered people in the area by giving no meaningful information for hours and turning away six emergency responders, officials said.W. Kent Carper, president of the Kanawha County Commission, said, “You can’t dispatch someone if nobody will tell you what’s going on, where to send them, or what’s the nature of the emergency. We get more information on a car wreck than we got that night.”Eventually, Mr. Carper said, officials blindly decided “to issue an order to shelter in place.” Sheltering in place means telling the public to stay indoors and close all doors and windows; it works best if done early.Mr. Carper, after hearing committee members and others stumble over pronunciation of methyl isocyanate, said, “I can’t pronounce it either,” but he added, “If you’re going to store a lot of it, you’ve got to tell your neighbors what you’re doing.”'"
"'09-04-22,'0','With few exceptions, commercial users of wind power in New York do not generate this power on site, but rather buy it from companies like ConEdison Solutions and its competitors, including Accent Energy and Energetix.In 1998, ConEdison Solutions, a unit of Consolidated Edison, began giving its residential customers the option of purchasing a combination of wind and hydro power; in 2002, it expanded this program to include commercial customers.Today, commercial customers can choose to use 100 percent wind power, a combination of wind and standard power, or standard power. If they purchase wind, they can specify whether they want wind produced regionally (in New York and Pennsylvania) or nationally.Nationally produced wind power is cheaper than power produced regionally. Wind power can cost 0.5 to 2.5 cents more a kilowatt hour than electricity generated by other means, which costs approximately 10 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour.Once ConEdison Solutions buys power from wind farms, the farms deliver it to the electricity grid. That purchase of wind power is verified by an independently audited system.Chelsea Piers converted to 100 percent wind power last October. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, that makes it the largest commercial user of 100 percent of wind power in New York City, though it uses only about a sixth of the power used by New York University, the largest 100 percent user of wind power in the state, according to the E.P.A.David A. Tewksbury, executive vice president of Chelsea Piers Management, which runs the complex, said its annual power bill of $3.8 million was projected to rise only $100,000 annually as a result of the conversion.Chelsea Piers is a huge building, with parts reaching out onto Pier 59 through Pier 62, west of the West Side Highway, from West 17th to West 22nd Streets.Its major components are a golf facility, which has a 15,000-square-foot clubhouse and 200-yard driving range with four tiers of 52 heated stalls; two event spaces totaling 50,000 square feet; a 130,000-square-foot health club; an 80,000-square-foot skating rink; and an 80,000-square-foot gymnastics and sports club. The complex also has 260,000 square feet for fashion photography and film and TV production.Chelsea Piers consumes some 22 million kilowatt hours of power a year. By comparison, the Empire State Building and its tenants use 60 million.Still, ConEdison Solutions said Chelsea Piers’ annual purchase of wind offsets 13,344 metric tons of electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of taking 2,856 cars off the road, or planting 12,300 acres of trees.“We run a healthy business, are socially aware of the planet and understand what our customers are like,” Mr. Tewksbury said. “When oil was going for $150 a barrel, it just became painfully obvious to us we couldn’t be a fully oil-dependent company.”John Masters, founder of John Masters Organics, has been a 100 percent wind power customer of ConEdison Solutions since 2007, and publicizes this through a sign in his salon.Barcade, a bar on Union Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that specializes in craft beers and vintage video games, has been a 100 percent wind power customer of ConEdison Solutions since 2004. Paul Kermizian, a co-owner, said he and his partners had gone in this direction because “we have a big electricity footprint with the video games, and felt we needed to be a little more responsible with our energy use.”Commercial customers of ConEdison Solutions that purchase a combination of wind and other types of power include Brooklyn Industries, a company that designs clothing for men and women and has nine stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn; O’Melveny & Myers, a multinational law firm that occupies nine floors of 7 Times Square; and the Durst Organization, a real estate developer. One-tenth of all power in Durst’s 10 commercial buildings, covering 8.5 million square feet, is from wind.Constantine E. Kontokosta, a professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University with expertise in green building, called Chelsea Piers’ wind power initiative “an important positive indication of the growing concern among commercial real estate companies of the environmental impact of the built environment.” He noted, however, that wind power’s higher cost could make it less attractive in the current economic climate.Besides ConEdison Solutions’ “green power” program, other wind initiatives under way or in the planning stages in New York City include lighting provided by rooftop wind turbines and wind and solar-powered streetlights, both unveiled this month at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a 300-acre campus that is home of 240 small manufacturers.On Monday, the Long Island Power Authority and Con Ed said they would be collaborating with state and New York City organizations on a possible off-shore wind farm off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, which could be the country’s largest wind farm.'"
"'09-04-22,'0','“It kind of threw me off a little bit,” Rose said. “It’s a learning process for me, the playoff game.”Rose, 20, is even-keeled and seasoned beyond his years. His mannerisms do not change with his play. They did not waver after Game 1, and will probably stay the same after Game 2. In Armstrong, Rose found someone who walked the path before him.“With B. J., I can say anything to him,” Rose said. “I ask him, did he see how somebody played? I ask him how his kids are doing. Anything. He’s just like a big brother to me.”Armstrong is relatively new as an agent. He works under the umbrella of the powerful agent Arn Tellem’s Wasserman Media Group.Initially, Armstrong was hesitant to discuss Rose. He is proud of him, very much so. But the agent in him is sprouting. Armstrong prefers the spotlight to be focused solely on Rose, and deservedly so.But even Armstrong cannot exactly pinpoint where Rose’s intangibles were born.“I know it’s not sexy or anything, but all this kid cares about is winning,” Armstrong said. “All the other things that happen, they don’t resonate with him other than winning the basketball game. That’s just who he is. He’s just a humble kid and he’s just trying to go out there and do his thing.“I wish I could say some secret formula or training method, but sometimes you got to let things be. That’s who Derrick Rose is.”In his playoff debut, Rose did something that Jordan was never able to accomplish: lead the Bulls to a postseason victory over the Celtics. The comparisons between Jordan and Rose are inevitable, but they are about a decade premature and possibly forever unfair.“M. J. was M. J.,” Armstrong said. “His body of work speaks for itself. We’ve seen his career, we’ve dissected his career and had the chance to watch it. That’s done. Here’s Derrick Rose, let’s look at him. Here’s the first we’re seeing of him. Here is a young man that will come out and compete and play.”Rose’s playoff debut served as an extension, a well-timed one, of his play throughout his rookie year. “If people aren’t familiar with Derrick, then they’re not basketball fans,” Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro said. “The kid has just been phenomenal all season.”The Celtics, with an assist from the officiating crew, limited Rose on Monday. Even so, Celtics Coach Doc Rivers is still exploring and examining how to fully stop him. When asked how to keep him from dominating the ball, Rivers responded: “You don’t. He’s the point guard. If you can figure that one out, we’ll have a whole new way of guarding everybody.”That way has yet to be figured out. Armstrong was a sidekick for Jordan, watching as teams tried in vain to scheme against him. In Armstrong’s second season, 1990-91, the Bulls captured the championship. They repeated twice, and in the third title season, Armstrong started.Chicago fully embraced Jordan. And after years of futility and frustration, it could happen again with Rose.“He’s from there,” Armstrong said. “He grew up there. He understands the city of Chicago. His family is from here, this is home for him. In many ways, he is Chicago.”Rose grew up watching the Bulls, who introduced him to Armstrong. When Rose declared for the N.B.A. draft after a stellar freshman season at Memphis, he and his family met with Armstrong.In honesty, Rose watched Armstrong only after he first saw Jordan.“Then, of course, you’ve got to watch the guy passing Michael the ball,” Rose said with a laugh. “But he was in a lot of the film.”'"
"'09-04-22,'0','“Ultimately though we have to look at two things,” Mr. Geithner said. “One is, do the institutions themselves have enough capital to be able to lend? And does the system as a whole, is it working for the American people for recovery? And that’s the standard we’re going to look at.”Mr. Geithner also defended the Obama administration’s efforts to stabilize the banking system, which include performing “stress tests” to test the health of big banks, and buying troubled assets from major banks using a public-private partnership.As he testified, a top government investigator was scheduled to release a report warning that the Treasury Department’s most ambitious plans to rescue troubled banks — partnerships between the government and private investors, backed by the Federal Reserve — are inherently vulnerable to fraud and should not be started without stronger safeguards.The report also warned that the Treasury’s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program has evolved into a $3 trillion effort of “unprecedented scope, scale and complexity” and comes with too little oversight and too little information about what companies are doing with the taxpayer money they are getting.“The American people have a right to know how their tax dollars are being used,” wrote Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general assigned to monitor the bailout program, in his second report to Congress.Mr. Barofsky was particularly critical of the Treasury Department’s refusal to demand detailed information from banks and other financial institutions about what they are doing with the money they receive.Noting the widespread public outrage unleashed over the Treasury’s huge payments to the American International Group, the failing insurance conglomerate, Mr. Barofsky warned that Treasury officials were jeopardizing the credibility of their efforts by not requiring companies to disclose far more about their use of taxpayer money.“Failure to impose this requirement with respect to the injection of yet another $30 billion into A.I.G. would not only be a failure of oversight, but could call into question the credibility of the government’s efforts,” he said. He was referring to bailout money that had been pledged, but not yet delivered, to the insurance giant.The inspector general was particularly pointed in his criticism of the Obama administration’s plan to buy up questionable assets from banks. That plan calls for the Treasury to spend $100 billion to buy up troubled mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.The plan also calls for multiplying the total volume of those asset purchases to almost $1 trillion by allowing private investors to borrow money at low interest rates from the Federal Reserve.Mr. Barofsky said the plan posed “significant fraud risks,” especially when it came to buying up securities backed by exotic mortgages made during the peak of the housing bubble, when the excesses of poorly documented loans and no-money-down loans reached their zeniths.The report said that the Federal Reserve intended its lending program, known as the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, to finance new lending rather than to buy up existing assets. It warned that the Fed was not currently planning to examine the securities that it would finance, and would be relying instead on the evaluation by credit rating agencies that originally failed to spot the dangers of subprime mortgages.“Credit ratings, cited as one of the primary credit protections in TALF as currently configured, have been proven to be of questionable value,” the report said. “The wholesale failure of the credit rating agencies to rate adequately such securities is at the heart of the securitization market collapse, if not the primary cause of the current credit crisis.”Mr. Barofsky also warned that the Treasury’s plan might allow investors to double up on government subsidies for buying up troubled assets. The Public-Private Investment Program would have the Treasury invest alongside private investors. But the partnerships would also be able to borrow money from the Fed through “nonrecourse” loans. If the investments flopped, the investors could walk away from the loans and leave taxpayers with most of the losses.The Treasury and the Federal Reserve have not yet begun the asset purchase programs.The two agencies started up a limited version of the TALF program last month, which is mainly focused on financing consumer and small-business loans.In February, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner announced the broader Public-Private Investment Program, which is aimed at buying up both mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Part of the plan calls for marrying the public-private program with the Fed’s lending program, but the program still appears to be at least a month or two away from starting.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said some of the inspector general’s criticisms about buying up “legacy assets” — usually troubled mortgage-backed securities — made sense.“There are a few problems with using the TALF program to buy up legacy assets,” he said. “First, it’s rewarding the worst behavior — buying no-doc loans.” Second, he said, the public-private program “is a very rich subsidy program to begin with. You have to ask whether it needs the extra enrichment of TALF, particularly when it involves the most egregious of mortgages.”Treasury officials had no comment on Mr. Barofsky’s report. But Mr. Geithner is scheduled to discuss it on Tuesday at a hearing of a Congressional panel that oversees the financial bailout program.Both the Treasury and the Fed have increased the amount of information they are making public about their various rescue plans. Treasury officials have pushed the banks to provide information about their lending volumes, and they are demanding more information about what banks are doing with their money.But Treasury officials have argued that it is almost impossible to get meaningful information about how banks are using money under the troubled-asset program, in part because the money came with few conditions. Treasury officials have also noted that if the funds are allocated for one purpose, like mortgage lending, they free up other money that can be used for a very different purpose, like making acquisitions.'"
"'09-04-22,'0','The pull is being felt strongly, something like an evil undertow we suspect is powered by something lurking in Mel Kiper Jr.’s hair.

"'09-04-22,'0','At a meeting of industrial and developing countries in this month, and other leaders pledged $1.1 trillion more for the fund and, to a lesser extent, the World Bank.Now, the I.M.F. must figure out how to turn those pledges into hard cash — no easy task, insiders and outside experts say — and how to marshal the money to steady teetering economies including those of and .“We’d be deluding ourselves if we think it is going to solve the crisis,” said Desmond Lachman, an expert on the fund at the in Washington. He was speaking at a conference organized by the institute titled “Can the I.M.F. Really Save the World?”The answer, most participants agreed, was no, but its vastly increased resources have turned the fund into a crucial player.“Anytime you raise expectations, it’s important that you deliver,” said , the president of the World Bank. “Part of this week’s meetings will be about how you deliver.”Analysts said the $1.1 trillion sum assumed huge contributions by the United States, and other countries, which may or may not come through. It also counts some contributions more than once, and it counts some in the form of a synthetic I.M.F. currency that is not hard cash.Using funds on hand, the World Bank said it would triple its in social safety-net programs to $12 billion over the next two years. The goal, Mr. Zoellick said, is to protect the most vulnerable people in developing countries from facing poverty, hunger or disease because of the crisis. “It’s vital that we make this more than a discussion of high finance,” he told reporters on Tuesday.The reality is that the Washington meetings will be dominated by talk about the escalating losses weighing on the world’s leading banks, companies and pension funds. The fund’s report said the recession was magnifying the impact of the squeeze on them.“Shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks’ balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending,” the fund said in its report, released twice a year, which has become a barometer of the severity of the crisis.As banks struggle to cleanse their balance sheets, the fund said, capital flows to emerging-market economies have plummeted, throwing Eastern Europe into crisis. That threatens to spill over to Western Europe, because its banks are major lenders to , and other countries.Among European countries, the fund has already agreed to more than $55 billion in loans to Hungary, , , Iceland, , and . More may yet need to be bailed out.On Tuesday, became the second Latin American country to seek aid, requesting $10.4 billion. Last Friday, the fund approved a $47 billion line of credit for , making it the first country to qualify for a loan from a program that extends credit to emerging economies that are considered well managed. also said this week that it would seek a $20.5 billion credit line under that program.With so many loans flowing out the door, experts said, the fund would run out of money without the infusion.“They really need to nail down this financing, especially from emerging markets,” said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at and a former head of the China division at the I.M.F.In a twist that leaves some experts shaking their heads, the fund needs money from cash-rich developing countries, like China and India, to help more developed but strapped countries, like those in Eastern Europe.Western Europe looms as the next front in the crisis, according to the fund’s report. It estimates that financial institutions will have to write down $1.19 trillion in loans and securities originating there. And they have gotten off to a much slower start than their American counterparts.In the United States banks reported $510 billion in write-downs by the end of 2008, and they face an additional $550 billion in 2009 and 2010, the fund said. In the countries of zone, banks reported just $154 billion in write-downs by the end of last year and still face $750 billion in projected write-downs, the fund said.'"
"'09-04-22,'0','Members of the panel, which oversees the government’s $700 billion financial bailout, prodded Mr. Geithner on several issues, including how the administration would deal with institutions that wanted to repay bailout funds. Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have said they want to pay back the billions in aid from the government.Mr. Geithner said regulators would look at the health of each bank and the broader financial system to make that decision.“Ultimately, though, we have to look at two things,” Mr. Geithner said. “One is, do the institutions themselves have enough capital to be able to lend? And does the system as a whole, is it working for the American people for recovery?”Mr. Geithner also assessed the state of credit markets as mixed. Some rates have improved recently under government programs to ease lending among banks, for home mortgages and commercial loans and for small businesses, he said. But he acknowledged that the programs had not cured all the problems.On Tuesday, a gauge of banks’ willingness to lend money, known as the Ted spread, showed signs of improvement, dropping to 0.96 points, while the London interbank offered rate was unchanged at 1.1 percent.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to 98 4/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 2.9 percent, from 2.84 percent late Monday.Investors also absorbed a mixed menu of corporate earnings that included falling profit at Bank of New York Mellon, a first-quarter loss at the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and better-than-expected results from some technology companies. Those results did little to assuage larger concerns about company profits in the midst of a deep recession, but they offered investors some room for hope.Investors also weighed concerns about the global finance system, as the International Monetary Fund said total losses from the credit crisis could surpass $4 trillion. In a report released Tuesday, the fund estimated that institutions would have to write down $2.7 trillion in loans and securities originating in the United States from 2007 to 2010.Following are the results of Tuesday’s auction of four-week bills:'"

"'09-04-23,'1','Of all the parties in talks over Chrysler’s fate, none has more to lose in a bankruptcy than the U.A.W. A bankruptcy filing would jeopardize the union’s painstaking efforts to get financing for a health care trust to cover the future medical bills of 81,000 union retirees and surviving spouses.“Ultimately, the union is very hostile to the idea of bankruptcy,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “They see all the uncertainty, all the risk, and the chance that they could lose big in court.”People close to the talks say the U.A.W. has tentatively agreed to accept Chrysler stock to finance half of the company’s $10.6 billion obligation to the health care trust. But Chrysler would still have to contribute more than $5 billion in cash over the next decade to the trust.Those cash contributions conflict directly with the interests of the consortium of banks and hedge funds that hold $6.9 billion in Chrysler’s secured debt.The steering committee for the lenders has rejected demands by President Obama’s auto task force that they take 15 cents on the dollar for their debt.The counteroffer by the banks, made on Tuesday, was far apart from what the government proposed — a 35 percent reduction in debt in exchange for as much as 40 percent of Chrysler’s stock.The disparity underscores how the lenders, led by JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are upset at what they view as preferential treatment by the presidential task force for the U.A.W.Mr. Gettelfinger has proved to be an astute negotiator in contract talks in the past. He has managed to get the three Detroit companies to provide generous buyouts to tens of thousands of excess workers, while holding on to the union’s hard-won health care benefits.He has also been supportive, so far, of a proposed alliance with Fiat that could preserve some of the U.A.W.’s remaining 26,000 jobs at Chrysler.But Mr. Gettelfinger has little control over the festering dispute between the government and the lenders on Chrysler’s debt.People close to the talks said Mr. Gettelfinger has appealed to members of the auto task force to consider the human toll that a bankruptcy would have on active workers and retirees.But the banks see bankruptcy as a means to recover more of their loans than they can get at the bargaining table. If Chrysler were liquidated and sold off in parts, the secured lenders would be first in line to be paid.“I’m not predicting a strike, but sometimes we forget that hardball can be played by more than one party,” Professor Shaiken said. “There’s a danger in these hardball approaches.”The Canadian Auto Workers union, which is not tied to the U.A.W., is facing its own vulnerabilities in the Chrysler restructuring.After vowing repeatedly not to reduce labor costs for Chrysler’s 8,000 Canadian workers, the C.A.W. on Wednesday appeared close to backing down.Chrysler executives have said that without big concessions from the C.A.W., the company could close its manufacturing operations in Canada.While the two unions contend with Chrysler’s problems, General Motors is said to be laying plans to cut their vehicle production drastically in the United States this summer.G.M. is trying to restructure in advance of a June 1 deadline set by the government. The company declined to confirm media reports Wednesday that it would temporarily close the bulk of its United States plants this summer for several weeks to reduce inventories.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','In life, the playwright August Wilson had an all-but-official rule: No white directors for major productions of his work, which was one reason that no film with a theatrical release was ever made from his 10 plays about African-American life in the 20th century. “Fences,” one of the two awarded the Pulitzer Prize, foundered in Hollywood because of his insistence on a black director.Yet in the years since Wilson died in 2005, an increasing number of white directors have staged his plays, and last week came a milestone: “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone,” which opened on April 16, is the first Broadway revival of a Wilson play since his death and the first ever on Broadway with a white director, the Tony Award-winning Bartlett Sher.The selection of Mr. Sher by the producer, Lincoln Center Theater, has prompted concern and even outrage among some black directors, who say this production represents a lost opportunity for a black director, for whom few opportunities exist on Broadway or at major regional theaters. Wilson himself felt that black directors best understood his characters, and he saw his plays as chances to give them high-profile work. Wilson’s widow, Constanza Romero, however, approved Mr. Sher as director.This production of “Joe Turner” also stands as an unusual collaboration, and by all accounts a happy one, between a white director and an almost entirely black cast on Broadway, a rarity itself. At times the actors were directing the director, as they discussed the ways that black Americans relate to one another and to their white neighbors and nemeses.“I’ve learned more from this cast than any group that I’ve ever worked with,” said Mr. Sher, who won a Tony for “South Pacific.” “But I also learned an enormous amount about the lack of opportunity in theater today. More Ibsen should be directed by black directors. More Shakespeare. More Chekhov.”Several black directors, in interviews, raised the same issue, but also expressed sharp disappointment in commercial and nonprofit producers for failing to create those opportunities.“Straight up institutional racism” was how one black director of Wilson’s plays on Broadway, Marion McClinton, described Lincoln Center Theater’s selection of Mr. Sher, to a Minnesota newspaper this winter. In an interview this week, Mr. McClinton said choosing white directors for Wilson plays not only denied opportunities for black directors, but also reflected a double standard because so few black directors were chosen for major productions of canonical works by white playwrights.Kenny Leon, the Broadway director of the last two works in the 10-play Wilson cycle  “Gem of the Ocean” and “Radio Golf”  said Broadway lacked “a level playing field” for black directors.“I have to work with my agent to remind people that, yes, I direct comedies, I do musicals, I do plays about all races of people just like other directors do,” said Mr. Leon, who earned a Drama Desk directing nomination for his one other outing on Broadway, “A Raisin in the Sun” in 2004.Several other black directors have written or called André Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, expressing similar concerns, Mr. Bishop said. “It’s not so much about Bart, but about wanting to work,” he said. “This experience has started a conversation about opportunities for black directors, and I’m taking it very seriously.”This revival of “Joe Turner,” originally produced on Broadway in 1988, started with Mr. Bishop’s looking for another play to do with Mr. Sher, who became resident director at Lincoln Center Theater last year. Mr. Bishop said he was drawn to the play not only “as a magnificent piece of writing,” but also as a match for Mr. Sher. Just as Mr. Sher’s “South Pacific” mixes xenophobia and powerfully symbolic characters like Bloody Mary with deep emotion and a naturalistic environment, so is “Joe Turner” rich in both racial and social metaphors.At the same time, Mr. Bishop said he “thought a lot” about whether to hire a white director. “Obviously I was very aware that the Wilson estate might say no, and I also didn’t want to risk offending people,” he said. He added that Mr. Sher was the only white director he would have chosen. It fell to Mr. Sher to seek the rights to the play, and here he had some advantage. As artistic director of the Intiman Theater in Seattle, where Wilson lived, Mr. Sher had met the playwright on a few occasions, and he had become close to Wilson’s widow, Ms. Romero, the executor of his estate.“I called Constanza and told her I wanted to direct ‘Joe Turner,’ and the only thing I asked was that she not answer me for three days,” Mr. Sher said.“I wanted to give her time to think it all through,” he said.Ms. Romero, who was born in Colombia, said in an interview that she and her husband had talked about who should direct his work. Wilson was widely known as a passionate advocate for blacks in theater and film; in the 1990s, he and the director and writer Robert Brustein sparred at length in print and in person about the role of race in everything from a playwright’s vision to casting.“While August had been this heavyweight champion of black culture and the African-American experience on stage, that was his work when he was alive,” Ms. Romero said.“My work is to get these stories out there,” she said, “and to help ensure that audiences walk out of the plays with a deeper understanding for these American stories and for the ways our cultures intertwine.”Mr. Sher’s experience on “Joe Turner,” set in a boarding house in Pittsburgh in 1911, has been an object lesson in this regard. His cast and Ms. Romero offered advice and insights on everything from the kind of coat that a central character would wear to the staging of the juba, an African dance at the end of Act I.“When they told me Bart was directing, my first response was, ‘But isn’t he white?’  so I was intrigued,” said LaTanya Richardson Jackson, who plays the boarding-house matron Bertha. “And from the start he was so collaborative. He would say, ‘I know this,’ and we would say, ‘Yeah, but you don’t know this.’ ”“As directors go,” she said, “he was an amazing listener.”Still, the choice of Mr. Sher has set a precedent in the eyes of some veterans of Wilson’s plays  a precedent that they believe the playwright would not like.“August told me himself that the reason he did not want white directors was because if one ever had a chance to do one of his plays on Broadway, it would be very unlikely that a black director would ever be chosen again to direct his plays on that level,” said Charles S. Dutton, who starred in the original production of “Joe Turner” at Yale Repertory Theater in 1986.“We’ll see what happens now that Mr. Sher is being lauded as a major new interpreter for August’s work,” Mr. Dutton added.It is up to Ms. Romero to sign off on future productions of Wilson’s work, on Broadway and off, and she said she had no plans to apply a racial litmus test to directors.“It’s the quality of the work that matters now,” she said.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','But oil futures in New York have since rebounded and have been fluctuating between $40 and $50 a barrel. Oil settled at $48.85 a barrel on Wednesday, up $2.34. This week, despite a broad swoon in the markets, oil never fell below $45 a barrel.As a result, American drivers should expect to see higher prices at the pump this summer, when driving is at its peak. Gasoline prices could rise to an average of $2.23 a gallon this summer, according to government estimates. Prices had fallen as low as $1.60 a gallon in December but have been holding above $2 a gallon for several weeks.Serious questions loom over the global economy that would suggest lower, not higher, prices. Unemployment is rising sharply in the United States, the Chinese economy is sputtering and its exports are falling, Europe is stagnant and Japan is contracting. The World Bank forecasts that the global economy will shrink by 1.3 percent this year, the first decline in global output since World War II.“At some point, you’d think that reality has to set in,” said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. “All the news is pretty negative, and certainly demand continues to take a hit. And yet prices are still hanging on.”The action of oil producers has been critical in providing a floor for prices. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have shown uncharacteristically strong discipline in recent months in sticking with their pledges to reduce output.Saudi Arabia and other producers have slashed their overall production by about 3.5 million barrels a day since September, according to estimates by the Middle East Economic Survey and others, amounting to 75 percent of their commitments to reduce production.OPEC’s success has provided an opening for investors to renew their bets on oil prices. The perception remains well ingrained in the market that oil supplies, while plentiful today, may prove insufficient once demand picks up again.Unrest in Nigeria, where crude oil exports have again been interrupted, is also lending support to the market.“Investors have come back, yes, but not in a huge way,” said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting firm. “One of the main reasons that oil is at $50 is that you had a sharp curtailing of supply.”Investor enthusiasm for oil could prove to be ill-timed. In the United States, the world’s biggest consumer of oil, demand is down sharply, pushing up commercial oil stocks, which have now reached their highest level since 1990.China is faring only marginally better. Because of a $585 billion stimulus plan, the Chinese economy is projected to grow 5 to 7 percent this year, according to various estimates. But that is less than half the country’s recent growth rate, and not enough to lift the rest of the Asian economies, according to a report from PFC Energy this month.“This is a measure of just how abruptly the world economy has fallen in recent months, and how dire and uncertain its future prospects have become,” PFC said in a recent report. “De-globalization may already have begun.”Oil demand is expected to tumble this year. In its latest forecast, the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations, expects oil consumption to fall 2.4 million barrels a day this year, or 2.8 percent, to 83.4 million barrels a day, the steepest decline since the early 1980s.Prices could yet fall if the economy weakens further or if the stimulus measures adopted by the United States and other nations fail to take hold.“The market is trying to work out whether the economy is improving,” said Costanza Jacazio, an energy analyst at Barclays Capital.Some experts also fear that even at today’s prices, oil companies will slash their investments in new production. Once the economy picks up, say in 2010 or 2011, these analysts predict that another price spike is likely.“It makes you wonder how much longer we can hang on before another downdraft,” said Mr. Bentz of BNP.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','After Mr. Edwards retired from the company, he sold the collection for about $6 million through auctions at Christie’s in New York.Benjamin Franklin Edwards III was born in St. Louis on Oct. 26, 1931, the only son of Presley W. Edwards, then managing partner of A. G. Edwards, and Virginia Barker Edwards. Except for four years at Princeton, from which he graduated in 1953, and two years in the Navy, Mr. Edwards lived in St. Louis.In 1956, Mr. Edwards joined the firm that his great-grandfather, Albert Gallatin Edwards, founded in 1887. He started in the syndicate department, working his way up until he became president in 1967 on his father’s retirement.Longtime employees said that Mr. Edwards’s goal was to operate the business according to the do-unto-others principle of the Golden Rule — and still turn a profit. Mr. Edwards answered his own phone, personally greeted all new employees on their first day and never laid anyone off, they said.When bigger brokerage houses began expanding into financial products like real estate or insurance, Mr. Edwards decided that A. G. Edwards would not sell proprietary products. He wanted brokers to choose the best outside mutual funds or annuities for clients while being free from pressure or incentives to steer clients’ money back to their own company. When other brokerage houses borrowed large sums to try to increase returns on equity, Mr. Edwards decided that A. G. Edwards would shun risky debt.Mr. Edwards is survived by his wife of 55 years, Joan Moberly Edwards; two sons, Scott and Tad, both of St. Louis; two daughters, Pamela Bunn of Raleigh, N.C., and Susan Medart of St. Louis; 11 grandchildren; and two sisters, Elizabeth Collins and Judy Bayer.Mr. Edwards, who retired in 2001, had always joked to clients that in the event of a hostile takeover of A. G. Edwards or an unwelcome sale of the company, he would open his own new company across the street.In 2007, the Wachovia Corporation, now a division of Wells Fargo, acquired A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion. Mr. Edwards opposed the sale, believing that a big bank would dilute the company’s core values.In 2008, Tad Edwards, a 30-year employee of A. G. Edwards, founded a new brokerage company — not across the street, but eight miles away in a suburb of St. Louis. His father had an office and sat on the board of the new company, Benjamin F. Edwards & Company.“We had a 120-year history of the firm with really one purpose and six generations,” Tad Edwards, who is chief executive of the new brokerage company, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “There are just a lot of people who wanted to see that continue. The only person more excited than me was my dad.”'"
"'09-04-23,'1','“We’re going to see a growth in outcomes guarantees for pharmaceuticals, and it’s very healthy,” said Robert Seidman, a consultant who was formerly the chief pharmacy officer for WellPoint, an insurance company.Traditionally, discounts and rebates that drug companies offer insurers have been based on how much drug is used, not how well patients do. But the emerging, outcomes-based contracts would — in theory — better align the incentives of insurers, drug companies and the employers that provide health coverage toward improving people’s health.Such pay-for-performance contracts started to take hold a few years ago in countries with national health systems, in which the government could effectively block a drug from being used if it was too costly.Johnson & Johnson set what is considered the prototype deal in 2007 with Britain’s national health system, which had tentatively decided not to pay for the cancer drug Velcade. To avert that decision, the company offered essentially a money-back guarantee. If Velcade did not shrink a patient’s tumors after a trial treatment, the company would reimburse the health system for the cost of that patient’s drug.In the United States, where insurance companies do not have national monopolies — and where Medicare, by law, is precluded from negotiating drug prices — insurers have less leverage with drug makers. Even so, they can give favorable treatment to certain drugs, by reducing the required co-payments, for example.Under the Actonel deal, if a patient insured by Health Alliance suffers a nonspinal fracture despite faithfully taking Actonel, the drug makers will help pay for the medical care — spending $30,000 for a hip fracture, for instance, and $6,000 for a wrist fracture.This clearly lowers the cost of the drug to Health Alliance, a small insurer in Illinois and Iowa. But Procter & Gamble and Sanofi-Aventis might benefit as well. The deal could reduce the pressure on the insurance company to move patients off Actonel, which costs about $100 a month, to less-expensive generic versions of Fosamax. And the insurer has kept Actonel in a tier of its drug list that requires a smaller co-payment than for a competing brand-name drug, Boniva.The deal between Cigna and Merck is more complex.Rather than getting paid more for good results, Merck will actually give Cigna bigger discounts on Januvia and Janumet. Some discounts will be granted if more people diligently take the drugs as prescribed. This helps both Cigna, because people who take their pills are likely to have fewer complications from the disease, and Merck, because it sells more pills. The assumption is that Cigna will push for patient-compliance programs that urge people to take their medicine at the right times and in the proper doses.Moreover, in an unusual move, Merck will offer even greater discounts to Cigna on Januvia and Janumet if patients’ blood sugar is better controlled — regardless of whether the improvement comes through Merck’s drugs or other medications.In effect, though, Merck is betting not only that its drugs prove superior but that Cigna’s incentives to reap the benefits of the deeper Januvia and Janumet discounts will prompt the insurer to try to keep patients on those drugs.As part of the agreement, too, Merck will get better placement for Januvia and Janumet on Cigna’s formulary, meaning a lower co-payment for patients than for some other branded drugs. The deal was made with the pharmacy benefit management division of Cigna, which manages prescriptions for 7.1 million people.Merck declined a request for an interview. In a statement the company said it was “committed to finding new approaches to demonstrate the value of our products to patients, physicians and payers.”Januvia, approved in 2006, costs about $150 a month. Janumet, approved a year later, is a combination of Januvia and metformin, a widely used generic drug.Eric Elliott, the president of Cigna Pharmacy Management, said his company was negotiating similar contracts with other drug makers.“We wanted a contract that drives performance,” he said. “Getting this one out will provide more momentum.”'"
"'09-04-23,'1','“If the order comes, we will fulfill it on time, and well,” he said.The truck is sold under the brand names Avalanche-Hurricane and, for a smaller model, the Storm. Shrouded in steel armor, it comes standard with brick- and cobblestone-resistant window grilles, sprinklers attached to a tank of chemical irritant like pepper spray, speakers that can emit ear-splitting noise and, of course, a powerful, joystick-operated water cannon. The cannon can topple protesters from dozens of yards away.Economically related social unrest has already arisen throughout the lands of the former Soviet Union. Used-car dealers have taken to the streets in Vladivostok to protest tariffs. In Ukraine, where tens of thousands of steel workers are newly unemployed, protesters gathered on the central square in Kiev. Most recently, in Moldova, an angry crowd stormed the Parliament building and hurled furniture out the windows. Among the protesters were unemployed young people with little prospect of finding jobs in Moldova.In that riot, incidentally, the pitfalls of using an off-the-rack fire truck for crowd control were on full display. News photographs showed protesters, pumping their fists in excitement, climbing on the dented hood of a standard-issue red-and-white fire truck, its windshield smashed and its crew long gone.In Russia, the economy is doing an about-face from 6 percent growth in 2008 to an expected 2.2 percent contraction this year, according to government figures that are probably too optimistic, many economists say. With unemployment rolls swelling, protests are likely, said Yevgeny S. Gontmakher, a member of the board of the government-affiliated Institute of Contemporary Development, a research organization in Moscow. “The social consequences will grow all this year, we can say that with certainty.”In one measure of discontent, 39 percent of Russians in a national poll answered yes when asked if they had noticed a “rise in the mood to protest” among their acquaintances.The factory here in Vargashi, in the western part of Siberia, is the only plant in Russia with a government certificate to make water cannons, Mr. Kazakov said. It is also, paradoxically, situated in the type of struggling one-factory town where Mr. Gontmakher and others have said industrial unrest is most likely.A glum ensemble of gray apartment blocks and muddy streets, bisected by the trans-Siberian railway, the town is wholly dependent on the plant. Of 12,000 residents, 600 work there. Workers grumble that salaries are already falling.The plant’s fortunes followed the trajectory of the Russian economy as a whole; it flourished in the late Soviet period, producing 3,000 fire trucks a year and selling them to 27 countries, including Mongolia, Tanzania and Vietnam. In those days it had branched out into tank trucks for milk, and even produced a model called the spirtovoz, or spirit carrier, designed to transport vodka in bulk. A faded Communist-era mural that says “Glory to the Working Class!” still adorns a building here. In the current crisis, the plant is struggling. Production of fire trucks fell to 35 trucks in February from 70 in December.Anton Y. Sinagnoyev, a laid-off construction worker, said he supported the factory’s new product, even if it was used against other laid-off workers like himself. He said he was happy that the plant had prospects. “If we didn’t make them, somebody else would,” he said.Factory managers said they hoped that police departments in Russia and elsewhere would trade up to customized crowd-control vehicles for the financial crisis. The trucks are far more effective in safely dispersing large, hostile groups than standard fire trucks, mounted police officers or lines of police officers with shields are, Mr. Kazakov said.But for now, though, the new business strategy remains just that. Even if the company manages to sell the two or three water cannon trucks it hopes to sell this year, that will not begin to make up for the lost revenues from fire trucks, Mr. Kazakov conceded. “The situation in the country is not at that point,” he said.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','The company daintily avoids mentioning the screamingly obvious, and much more controversial, uses for the Zoombak: secretly tracking the movements of your spouse, children or employees. The Zoombak can certainly be used this way — it works even when it’s hidden inside a glove compartment. But you might blow your cover when you retrieve it for charging every three or four days. And you’ll have a lot of explaining to do if your subject discovers the thing.All right then. Suppose you have no ethical qualms, or at least you’ve managed to squelch them. Here’s how it works.The transmitter itself is 2.9 by 1.7 by 0.8 inches, 2.5 ounces, ruggedly built with a waterproof cover for the charging jack (clearly a nod to nomadic-dog applications). It has a single rubber on-off button — you hold it down for several seconds — and a single blinking green indicator light. (It’s so small, in fact, that I actually managed to lose the first unit that Zoombak sent me for review; the battery died before I noticed. To lose a tracking device... how embarrassing is that?)At , you can have all kinds of fun. You can click Find Now to see where the transmitter is at the moment, accurate to within a few yards and displayed on a Earth map. Frankly, the map is too small — you have to do a good deal of zooming and panning to figure out what you’re looking at — but at least it gives you a choice of road map, satellite view or aerial view (photos taken by airplanes from different angles of the same spot).You can also look at a bread crumb trail of where your locator has been recently, although this information is generally sent to the Web site only once every four hours.(Alternatively, you can turn on “continuous” mode, which generates five-minute bread crumbs in an hourlong burst.) Successive location reports are indicated by pushpins on the map, cleverly filled by fainter colors as they age.You can also set up the Zoombak to notify you, by text message or e-mail, when someone tries to turn the thing off, or when the battery dies.Most intriguingly, you can define up to five “safety zones”: addresses or other points with a radius that you specify. You might define a 200-yard circle as OurHome and a two-mile region as CollegeCampus.Once you’ve done that, you can set up automatic, free alerts for those locations. When your trackee enters or leaves one of these zones, you get a text message, an e-mail message or both saying, for example, “Chris has arrived at IrresponsibleFriendsHouse.”You can also ping the Zoombak at any time from your cellphone, once you’ve registered that phone on the Web site. You may feel as if you’re doing your all over again — you have to type out your password, a comma, a space and then its name (“1823, Spybot7” or whatever). But in seconds, you get a text message that says something like, “Your Zoombak locator Spybot7 is currently located near 500 West 57th St, New York, NY.” It’s creepy good.When all of this works, it’s awesome. As long as your wily subject doesn’t toss the Zoombak into the back of a passing truck, à la “The DaVinci Code,” you’re getting pure peace of mind for $15 a month.So why wouldn’t it work? Why are the customer reviews on all over the map?First, Zoombak’s price, features and reliability have come a long way since its debut a year and a half ago. It used to cost $200, not $100, and there were plenty of technical glitches and missing features at the outset. (There’s also a pet version, also $100, which includes a Velcro pouch to attach it to the pooch’s collar, and a car-kit version, $150, that includes a cigarette lighter cord as well as a hard-wired trunk-installation kit.)Second, that safety-zone alert system depends on the Zoombak’s 15-minute ping schedule. If your dog runs into a zone and then runs out again within 15 minutes, you won’t even know it happened. This also means that whoever kidnaps your child or hot-wires your car has at least a 15-minute head start.Finally, and most important, once Zoombak determines its location using GPS, it transmits that information to you using the cellular network. Unfortunately, it’s T-Mobile’s.As you probably know, T-Mobile’s American coverage is not, ahem, blanketlike; huge swaths of this country out West, and far too many smaller swaths everywhere else, have no signal at all. In those areas, the Zoombak falls into radio silence — useless. If I were a car thief or dognapper, I’d set up shop in .That’s the biggest downside, but it’s not the only one. For example, although the Zoombak has a 30-day guarantee, you can never change its account information. When old Rover finally arrives at the big kennel in the sky, your Zoombak can’t protect another family’s deserving critter.The Web site needs a lot of design help, too — should you click Save or Finish? Locator or Tracking? — and it’s incompatible with the Safari Web browser. There have been plenty of complaints online about Zoombak’s -based tech support department, too, although Zoombak swears that that’s improved recently, and at least it’s available 24 hours a day, toll-free. For some people, there’s a certain flakiness to those e-mail and text-message alerts, too.So who knew? There really is such a thing as compact tracking devices, just like the ones in the spy movies. This one is nicely priced, well built and, fortunately, undergoing constant refinement.Even so, Hollywood still has a ways to go before it attains accuracy in its depiction of real-world technology. Just once, I’d like to see the hero of “Mission: Impossible” lose the villain’s trail, swat his forehead and mutter, “Dang that T-Mobile network!”'"

You can change the voice used to navigate the iPod Nano’s menus by spoken-word audio cues, but you have to do it on the computer side of the connection. Your voice choices there depend on which ones are installed on the computer for its built-in text-to-speech functions.In Windows Vista, go the Start menu to Control Panel and select the Classic View options from the sidebar. Open the Text to Speech icon and choose another voice (if your system has them installed). You can also preview and adjust how fast the voice speaks here as well.The steps are similar in Window XP: go to the Start menu, to Control Panel and open the Speech icon. Pick a new voice from the pop-up list and adjust the rate of speech.On a Mac OS X 10.5 system, go to the Apple menu and select System Preferences. Open the Speech icon and click on the Text to Speech tab in the box. Choose a new voice from the pop-up menu and adjust the speaking rate with the slider in the top part of the box. Click the Play button to hear a sample.For all systems, you need to re-sync the Nano to the computer after you make the changes so the new voice preferences get transferred over.

"'09-04-23,'1','MOST people cannot afford the decorating effects seen at a show house. But the 2009 Kips Bay Decorator Show House — which continues through May 17 at 22 East 71st Street — proves that not all high design requires a high budget.For example, Juan Montoya, one of the more than 30 decorators and decorative artists working on the house, furnished his ample second-floor room as a studio apartment with oversize couches, a large table and a daybed. He explained that he “wanted to present a room that visitors could learn from,” that would show them how to “embellish their homes and be comfortable and positive without spending a lot of money.”True, the upholstery might set you back a bit, but some of the artwork would not — particularly the giant blue painting over the couches. “I did that painting,” Mr. Montoya said. “And you can, too.” Just buy a blank canvas, he said, choose a latex paint color and roll it on.'"

Few Afghan women currently use modern contraceptives. As a consequence, women in Afghanistan bear an average of nearly seven children, and the Afghan population is on pace to double in size over the next 25 years.

"'09-04-23,'1','Mr. Sacconaghi also remarked on the high spirits of Mr. Oppenheimer and the company’s chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, during a conference call with analysts and shareholders.“Their enthusiasm about their product portfolio is something investors care deeply about,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. “Even though they weren’t specific, that level of excitement potentially foreshadows exciting products to come. It is something investors care deeply about and get excited over.”Apple watchers anticipate that the company will unveil new iPhones at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June and perhaps a tablet device later in the year. Discussing rumors that the company would develop a so-called netbook — a small, low-cost laptop with limited features — Mr. Cook expressed little interest.“When I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens,” he said. “And just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on, quite frankly.”Mr. Cook also said that the iPod Touch or iPhone were worthy alternatives to “small computers that do browsing and e-mail.”When pressed about the condition of Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive, who is on a leave of absence to deal with health matters, Mr. Oppenheimer was upbeat. “We look forward to Steve returning to Apple at the end of June,” he said.The earnings news sent Apple’s stock up 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. The earnings report offered more proof that Apple’s strategy of selling must-have digital accoutrements at a premium price to people who can afford them is a smart, if counterintuitive, strategy for navigating the recession.“For a consumer company to be growing 9 percent in this economic environment is a testament that the products are strong and the company is in touch with its customers,” Mr. Sacconaghi said.Apple said it sold 2.22 million Macs in the quarter ended March 28, down from 2.3 million last year. But it sold 3.79 million iPhones, up from 1.7 million a year ago, in part because of expanding sales of the device around the globe.Mr. Cook said that the App Store for the iPhone, which offers software from third-party developers, was within hours of approaching its one billionth download.The planned summer update to the iPhone’s operating system, which will include features like the ability to make payments within applications and multimedia messaging, “unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else,” he said.As usual, the company was cautious in the guidance it offered Wall Street. The company projected that it would have revenue of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and earnings of about $1 a share in the current quarter.Analysts applauded the company’s earnings report but cautioned against taking Apple’s gains as a sign of the wider industry’s improving.“Apple is a big company, but they are really addressing only the upper ends of their target markets, and those are arguably the parts of the market that are most resistant to the economic downturn,” said Shaw Wu, a senior research analyst at Kaufman Brothers.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','Mr. Melton admits to ordering the demolition, but has said he should be exonerated because he acted with the good intention of cleaning up crime in a drug-infested neighborhood. A state jury acquitted him in 2007, and his first federal trial ended with a hung jury in February, but prosecutors believe they can now convict him by dropping one of the charges and selecting new jurors.These circumstances have left Mississippi’s capital at a crossroads. Leslie B. McLemore, president of the City Council, described the political uncertainty these days as “the most bizarre situation that I’ve ever had the occasion to witness.”“Frank Melton could be re-elected, he could go into a runoff, he could be convicted, he could go to jail,” Mr. McLemore said. “The possibilities are fairly legion.”By most accounts, the mayor’s future looks bleak. His own Democratic Party tried to remove him from the ballot for residency violations, although he sued and was returned. He faces nine challengers in the Democratic primary on May 6. Five days later, his trial begins.After the primary, there may be more elections for Mr. Melton. If no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the primary, the top two will enter a runoff on May 19. If he wins the runoff, Mr. Melton will face four independents and a Republican in the general election on June 2.“I’m the target,” Mr. Melton said, explaining why he does not plan to attend campaign events with rival candidates. “I don’t want all of them shooting arrows at me.”Councilman Marshand Crisler, who is running against Mr. Melton, said voters were exhausted with the current direction of Jackson politics. “It’s an anxious electorate,” Mr. Crisler said. “They’re almost to the point of desperation.”But Mr. Melton has a record of beating expectations. In 2005, as a first-time candidate, he triumphed over the incumbent, Harvey Johnson Jr., in the primary and coasted to victory with 88 percent of the vote in the election. This year, he is among the top three candidates in most polls.“Frank Melton has more than nine lives,” Mr. McLemore said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he walks in this third trial and gets re-elected.”The mayor, who is black, has cobbled together an unlikely coalition of supporters, including liberal blacks and conservative whites, primarily by talking tough about inner-city crime, an issue that energized both races.Advocates of a hard line on crime have praised him. “We were rooting for you,” the Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera told Mr. Melton after his acquittal in the state trial.But Jackson had 73 homicides last year, the most in more than a decade, and property crimes rose 5.6 percent in the first half of 2008, according to the most recent data available from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Malcolm McMillin, the police chief who resigned in protest this month and endorsed one of Mr. Melton’s opponents, attributes the increase to a lack of resources and the mayor’s over-involvement.“This whole county is in turmoil,” Mr. McMillin said. “We need some stability in government. We need a new direction.”Mr. Melton attributes the rise in crime to a police department more interested in bureaucracy than action. What Jackson needs, he has said, is a mayor who understands the city’s concerns.The office work of being mayor should only take “two, maybe two and a half hours” a day, Mr. Melton said. Even with a trial and an election on his schedule, he said, that still leaves plenty of time to patrol the streets.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','Companies typically die slow, lingering deaths, the victims of changing technologies or tectonic shifts in global trade. But it is possible to kill a company really fast.Consider the case of Coast Institutional Review Board. Until recently, Coast was doing a banner business, getting paid by makers of drugs and medical devices to oversee human studies involving their products.In the four-year period between 2004 and 2008, its revenue had more than doubled to $9.3 million. And earlier this month, the company was overseeing 300 active studies on behalf of major medical manufacturers.But Coast, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., was apparently the kind of company that just couldn’t say no. Its decline began not long ago, when it said yes to the wrong people — federal investigators who had set up a sting operation. The agents were trying to see how much due diligence companies like Coast perform before approving a medical study.In Coast’s case, the answer was not much. The firm green-lighted the trial proposed by the undercover investigators. Had Coast checked, it would have discovered that the trial involved a make-believe product and was to be run by doctors who did not exist.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','Some research has suggested that consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, used as a sweetener in a wide variety of foods, may increase the risk of obesity and heart disease. Now, a controlled and randomized study has found that drinks sweetened with fructose led to higher blood levels of L.D.L, or ""bad"" cholesterol, and triglycerides in overweight test subjects, while drinks sweetened with another sugar, glucose, did not. Both L.D.L. and triglycerides have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.The study was published online on Monday in The Journal of Clinical Investigation.Researchers at the University of California, Davis, assigned 32 overweight men and women, whose average age was 55, to groups consuming either fructose-sweetened or glucose-sweetened drinks over a 10-week period. The drinks, specially formulated for the study, contained only pure fructose or pure glucose.For the first two weeks, the volunteers lived in a clinical research center, consuming a balanced diet high in complex carbohydrates and undergoing various blood tests and measurements of body fat. This phase established baseline measurements for the study.As outpatients for the next two weeks, the subjects ate their usual diets, plus either fructose- or glucose-sweetened drinks consisting of 25 percent of their energy requirements. After returning to the center for more tests, the participants spent six more weeks as outpatients on their usual diets, then finally two more weeks in the clinic on the high-carbohydrate diet while drinking the sweetened beverages.While outside the hospital, the subjects’ diets were tracked with daily phone calls, and compliance with consumption of the drinks was measured by urine tests.The two groups had been matched for age, weight, fasting triglyceride levels, insulin concentrations, total cholesterol and other factors. But by the end of the study, the researchers found, those participants consuming fructose beverages had significantly increased blood levels of triglycerides and L.D.L., compared to those consuming drinks sweetened with glucose.Although there was a similar moderate weight gain in both groups, the fructose drinkers also had larger increases in fat inside the abdomen, also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.The study was intended only to learn more about the metabolic impacts of glucose and fructose consumption, the authors noted, not the health effects of high-fructose corn syrup, which is a mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar also contains both glucose and fructose, as do many fruits and some vegetables.Dr. Peter J. Havel, the senior author and a nutrition professor at the University of California, Davis, said that the findings “do not imply that anyone should avoid fruit, which contains only small amounts of fructose and has other important nutritional benefits.”John S. White, a biochemist who has published widely on nutritive sweeteners and was not involved in this study, said that the experimental setup did not reproduce a real-life diet. The study did not test high-fructose corn syrup, he said, and judgments should not be made about it from the findings.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','Translated, softball did not want to be aligned with a sport that is awash in drug scandals and offers competitions, like the World Series and the World Baseball Classic, that may be considered more prestigious than the Olympics.By contrast, the Olympics represented the height of international softball competition for the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 Summer Games before the sport was eliminated, many believe, because of American dominance.All of the world’s top softball players would be expected to participate in the 2016 Summer Games. Or as Porter said in another recent statement, in a thinly veiled reference to baseball, “The Olympic Games would not be just another competition in an overcrowded schedule for softball.”Rebuffed by softball, baseball chose to pair its Olympic proposal with women’s baseball, which is rarely played in the United States but, officials say, is played in more than 30 countries by more than 100,000 participants. Still, it is much less visible than softball, which officials said is played in 127 nations by 8.5 million participants.Harvey Schiller, president of the International Baseball Federation, said the pairing was made to address the I.O.C.’s insistence that Olympic sports be played by men and women and to counter softball’s support for a men’s Olympic tournament.Donna Lopiano, a former executive director of the Women’s Sports Foundation, will chair the women’s baseball committee, Schiller said, adding that he had received thousands of e-mail messages in support.“You can’t believe the outpouring, people saying it’s about time,” Schiller said. “Our women are anxious to do it. And female baseball players like playing on the larger field.”Even so, few expect that women’s baseball will be added to the Olympic calendar. Men’s baseball may have a stronger argument to make if it can ensure the participation of some major leaguers, especially if the 2016 Games are awarded to baseball-mad cities like Chicago or Tokyo.Major League Baseball officials have suggested one possible solution: extending the All-Star Game break to five days to fit in a compressed Olympic schedule. Perhaps the season could be started a few days earlier, Schiller said.In any case, the major league season would not shut down for the entire 16-day Olympics, and teams would not likely be composed fully of big-league players, Schiller said. But, he added, “We’re making commitments to use a representative group of the best players.”Schiller emphasized that drug testing was now more thorough in baseball and that screening for the recent World Baseball Classic was done in compliance with the World Anti-Doping Agency. He said that more than 300 tests were performed in association with the Classic, compared with only 21 for the 2008 world softball championships.“If baseball’s not in the Olympics, it would be the world’s largest sport not in,” Schiller said. “That shouldn’t be.”Porter, of the softball federation, said he believed more than 21 screenings had been conducted during the 2008 world championships and reiterated that softball, in contrast to baseball, had been free of doping scandals.He is attempting to spread the sport to Muslim countries in the Middle East and in Africa, trying to demonstrate to I.O.C. officials that softball is universal and not just a game played indifferently outside the United States.Perhaps the best argument for softball’s return was that the Americans lost the gold to Japan at the 2008 Beijing Games after dominating the three previous Olympics.Asked what he thought softball’s chances were for reinstatement, Porter said, “It’s hard to say; you hear different vibes.”'"
"'09-04-23,'1','BERLIN — The trial of four Islamic militants charged with plotting a series of deadly bombings in Germany began in Düsseldorf on Wednesday. The highly anticipated proceedings have been billed here as the biggest terrorism trial since the top leaders of the far-left Red Army Faction were prosecuted in the 1970s.The four men are accused of planning attacks against high-profile targets, including the airport in Frankfurt and American military installations like the Ramstein Air Force Base. If the attacks had been carried out, prosecutors say, the toll could have surpassed the nearly 200 deaths in the 2004 bombings of commuter trains in Madrid.German authorities arrested three of the four suspects in September 2007 who they said had 26 military detonators and 12 drums of hydrogen peroxide, the main chemical in the explosives used in the London suicide bombings of July 2005.All four men have been held without bail. The trial is expected to involve some 200 witnesses and take up to two years to complete. Video from the courtroom on Wednesday showed the four men, all with beards grown since their incarceration, protected by a high barrier of bulletproof glass and separated from one another by guards.According to the German news agency dpa, one of the suspects, Adem Yilmaz, a Turkish citizen, refused to stand when the presiding judge, Ottmar Breidling, was administering the oath to an interpreter. “I only stand up for Allah,” Mr. Yilmaz said.'"
"'09-04-23,'1','After holding up during a day of disappointing earnings, stocks turned sharply lower in the last minutes of trading, dragged down by financial companies. Major banks and smaller regional financial chains slid lower, and Morgan Stanley fell 9 percent after reporting first-quarter losses.For yet another day, analysts said, bank stocks led the broader market around by the nose. Leaps and bounds in financial stocks have fueled a rally that has lifted the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index about 25 percent since early March. But those gains have wavered this week.“It’s the locomotive on the train either going uphill or downhill,” said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Financial Management. On Wednesday, he added, “The financials seemed to give up the ghost.”The Dow Jones industrial average, which teetered all day between gains and losses, ended the day down 82.99 points, or 1 percent, at 7,886.57. The S.& P. 500 was down 0.8 percent, or 6.53 points, to 843.55.The Nasdaq composite index finished slightly higher, gaining 2.27 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,646.12, bolstered by gains among some microprocessor makers and technology companies.'"

It cited research by the Wharton School indicating that tougher construction codes could reduce damage from coastal storms by more than 60 percent.Spokesmen for the coalition acknowledged at a telephone conference that the report’s recommendations were not new.

"'09-04-24,'1','“An agent will call up and will say, ‘So and so is doing this,’ ” Hunter said. “And you say, ‘Well, are you prepared to go on the record?’ ‘No, I don’t want to go on the record.’ Well, how can we justify investigating this guy and taking action against him if you’re not willing to help us get the evidence?“So that’s always the problem, that agents will call up to make an accusation, but then they want to remain anonymous,” he continued. “There have been agents that we have suspended. We’ve suspended quite a few of them, when we have the evidence to do it.”In general, union investigations are dependent on people’s willingness to talk, and the union cannot compel anyone to do so.“You’ve got to keep in mind, we don’t have subpoena power,” said Hunter, a former federal prosecutor. “I worked for Justice for 18 years. I was a prosecutor. So I know how to investigate and put a case together. But I don’t have the tools here to do it.”Hunter cited the case of Calvin Andrews, an agent with Bill Duffy Associates, who is serving a one-year suspension for recruiting improprieties involving O. J. Mayo, the former University of Southern California star. The case first came to light through a report on ESPN. But Hunter said that the person who made the allegations on television refused to talk to the union. The reporter who broke the story also declined to cooperate, he said. And Mayo, who was soon to become part of the union, likewise could not be compelled to talk about the relationship with Andrews.“So who are we going to talk to?” Hunter said. “We run into these walls. We get frustrated here.”Without cooperative witnesses, and lacking the authority of a law-enforcement agency, Hunter said the union had to tread carefully, or risk being sued for defamation by the accused agents.“You can’t go where you want to go,” he said, “because you don’t have the proof.”Sounding frustrated, Hunter said the onus was on state governments to “enforce their statewide rules relative to sports agents.”“And they don’t,” he said. “They don’t do anything.”'"
"'09-04-24,'1','Individual stocks have often been sent reeling because of a fake press release or unfounded rumor. In September, United Airlines lost $1 billion in value when an old news item about bankruptcy resurfaced. But the broader sell-off in financial stocks after Mr. Turner’s report shows the velocity of news, true or not, in a market where jittery investors are wired to react quickly to information, positive or negative.Because Mr. Turner’s report seemed to be having an impact on the stock market, mainstream news organizations also took notice. A blog posting on the Web site of The Financial Times linked to it, which it called “something of a scoop,” while also describing Mr. Turner as a white supremacist. A second posting on The F.T.’s Web site said that Mr. Turner, who often writes about financial matters, was “widely derided as a racist crank.”Reuters and Bloomberg News wrote articles about the market reaction and the Treasury’s response, as did the DealBook blog of The New York Times.Meanwhile, investors were already fretting about the health of the country’s financial system, and bank stocks were falling. Many factors are to blame, but some traders said that Mr. Turner’s report fed in to already rampant fears about the banking system.“It really seemed that they did take it seriously, that this was a leak,” said Lou Brien, a market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago, adding that the market had already taken a pessimistic view towards the outcome.“The story may have struck a chord with the market as regards to how the tests will look,” Mr. Brien said. “We reacted for about 20 minutes or a half hour.”Mr. Turner, in an e-mail message Thursday, said, “My report was accurate.”He has declined to publish the actual documents he says were leaked. “I have the results,” he wrote in the message. “I will wait until the government releases whatever they release on or about May 4, then rebut the government ‘spin’ with facts.”Mr. Turner casts a long public shadow. In 2003 the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, placed him on its list of prominent right-wing radicals, “a belligerent, foul-mouthed talk show host, Turner is the maestro of radio hate.”Referring to the report about the stress tests, Mark Potok, director of the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said, “People who bought in to this are real fools.”'"
"'09-04-24,'1','But Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, acknowledged that he had not yet lined up the $500 billion that leaders from the Group of 20, which represents industrialized and developing countries as well as the European Union, had pledged this month in London. That money was the biggest single part of the $1.1 trillion commitment.“We are not there yet, but I am confident we will be there by the end of the year,” Mr. Strauss-Kahn told reporters.The United States is still somewhat at odds with European leaders over how much countries should be stimulating their economies. American officials are pushing for bigger efforts, but European countries like Germany say they have done as much as they can.But that debate has been restrained in recent days. Mr. Strauss-Kahn said the total size of the stimulus plans announced so far was roughly in line with what the International Monetary Fund had been recommending, an amount equal to about 2 percent of global economic output.Finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations will meet Friday in Washington, followed by a meeting of ministers from the Group of 20, which includes countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia.The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will hold their annual spring meetings here this weekend.Much of the attention will be on whether finance ministers can get closer to their goal of raising $500 billion for the fund.The United States, Japan and European nations have pledged about $300 billion so far, and China has pledged $40 billion. That leaves the specific commitments still more than $100 billion shy of the goal. Fund officials are hoping to round up more commitments this weekend, which they view as an important barometer of international collaboration.“The closer they can get to $500 billion, the better the outcome,” said Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','In a few cases, countries that have caught piracy suspects accused of attacking their own citizens have chosen to prosecute them back home. That was demonstrated this week, when a wide-eyed young Somali man landed in New York to face charges that he had kidnapped an American sea captain. But according to maritime law experts, that is not necessary.“The law on piracy is 100 percent clear,” said Kenneth Randall, dean of the University of Alabama School of Law and an international law expert. “Any country can arrest these guys and prosecute them at home.”When it comes to putting pirates on trial, there are some practical complications, like serving papers to witnesses who may be Filipino or Kenyan sailors with no mailing addresses who spend all year at sea. Or finding a Somali translator in Mumbai, India, or Copenhagen.In light of those problems, most nations have been hesitant to undertake piracy trials. As a result, there is growing support for the Kenyan solution. Today, more than three dozen Somali pirates sit behind bars in Shimo la Tewa, Mombasa’s notoriously decrepit prison, which just so happens to be a few miles up the beach from some of this country’s most magnificent palm-fringed resorts.Western diplomats are hoping that this courtroom effort, coupled with a reinvigorated military response involving warships from more than a dozen nations, will put a dent in Somalia’s stubborn piracy problem. At a meeting in Brussels on Thursday, donor nations pledged more than $200 million for Somalia, much of it for security, on land and at sea.Last year, Somali pirates hijacked more than 40 ships, netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom. Many major shipping companies are now opting to sail all the way around Africa instead of risking the Somali seas.Antti Lehmusjarvi, a legal adviser for the European Union who came to the Mombasa courthouse on Thursday to observe the arraignment of the 11 piracy suspects, said Kenya was the best solution — for now.“Obviously, Kenya needs assistance,” Mr. Lehmusjarvi said. He rattled off all the help the European Union was providing, including computers and money to bring more qualified Kenyan judges to Mombasa. “But the law here is very clear,” he said. “And in Somalia, a stable legal framework doesn’t exist.”Section 69 (1) of the Kenyan penal code reads, “Any person who, in territorial waters or upon the high seas, commits any act of piracy jure gentium is guilty of the offence of piracy.” The punishment can be life in prison.But Mr. Kadima, a former magistrate himself, takes issue with this. Kenya has not ratified international maritime conventions, he said, and the recent agreements signed with other countries were not approved by Kenya’s Parliament and therefore are not enforceable.“You can’t just go around making up laws, you know,” he said. “There is a process.”Mr. Kadima, 50, who took on his first piracy case in March, said he had yet to see a shilling from any of his piracy cases, though he conceded that the publicity was good for business.He said all of his clients had uttered the same excuse for why they had been caught on the high seas with serious firepower.“They said they were just fishermen,” he said. “Fishermen who needed to protect themselves.”Does he really believe that?“A lawyer doesn’t need to believe,” Mr. Kadima explained. “He goes by what he is told.”'"
"'09-04-24,'1','A group of library users and residents of Midtown Manhattan are fuming over what they are calling the inept and heartless handling of the Donnell Library, which was known for its rich holdings of movies, music, foreign language materials and children’s books until it closed last year.The New York Public Library shut the Donnell branch, which opened in October 1955, last August, as part of a deal announced in November 2007 to sell the building to Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. for $59 million. The five-story building, at 20 West 53rd Street, was to be razed to make way for an 11-story hotel, but a new library branch would occupy space on the first floor and in the basement. The deal fell apart in March, however, with the hotel company backing out, citing the financial and credit crises.Now, there is neither the library nor the money that was supposed to come from the hotel deal. Outraged library patrons have called on the City Council to compel the New York Public Library, a nonprofit organization that gets much of its financing from the city, to reopen Donnell.“This is a tragedy being ignored,” RitaSue Siegel, who had been using the library since the 1970s and is an organizer of the campaign to reopen Donnell, said in an interview. “The N.Y.P.L. board must be hammered with tales of their irresponsibility.”Another Midtown resident, David J. Schneiderman, a married father of two who regularly used Donnell, said in remarks to a meeting of Community Board 5 on April 16: “It is a disgrace to eliminate a public library from a neighborhood and, as a result, deprive our youngsters of the benefits associated with a concerned staff that knows and cares for its young patrons. In this age of impersonal communication, we should not allow a bona fide community library to disappear.”The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who attended the meeting, called the closing of Donnell “a huge blow” and vowed to investigate what could be done, according to several residents who were present. And Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the committee that oversees the city’s libraries, also vowed to look into the matter.Officials at the New York Public Library have stood their ground, saying the 1955 library was crumbling and in dire need of repairs that the library system could not afford.“Our goal was and is to create a new, state-of-the-art library on the Donnell site, replacing an aging, out-of-date building,” said Heidi Singer, a spokeswoman for the library system. “We’re now evaluating various alternatives.” She said the library system hoped that Orient-Express Hotels “honors its commitment to the library,” but would not specify whether the library system planned to sue the hotel chain.Ms. Singer added in a statement: “We understand the disappointment of Donnell users at the closure of their library and continue to keep them informed, through Community Board 5, as developments move forward. In the meantime, all of the materials and services offered at Donnell are or will shortly be available at other Midtown locations.”Ms. Singer cited a March 31 meeting at which George D. Mihaltses, the library’s vice president for government and community affairs, and Teresa Myrhol, a librarian, sought to assuage public concerns. But Ms. Siegel and others who attended that meeting said the library representatives were noncommittal and would not offer specifics.Next Wednesday, the New York Public Library plans to formally open a 12,000-square-foot Grand Central branch at 135 East 46th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. Ms. Singer called the new branch “open, inviting and full of light,” with “double-high front windows and beautiful, sustainable bamboo cabinetry,” along with wireless Internet access for laptops and a sizable holding of popular fiction, documentary videos and audio materials.She said that Donnell’s renowned children’s holdings had been moved to the main branch of the library system, now known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, while its musical holdings were transferred to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.But Ms. Siegel said the new branch was hardly a substitute for the 88,000-square-foot Donnell. She and other residents plan to picket the opening of the new branch.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','American Express reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Thursday. It also said it intended to repay government bailout funds as soon as regulators complete stress tests on the company.American Express reported first-quarter net income of $437 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 85 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding an after-tax gain of $136 million from legal settlements with Visa and MasterCard, the company posted earnings of 20 cents a share, beating analysts’ forecast of 14 cents.Revenue was $5.93 billion, an 18 percent drop from $7.24 billion in the quarter a year ago.“While we did see some recent improvement in early delinquency rates, overall credit indicators reflected rising unemployment levels and the broad-scale weakness in the economy,” the company’s chief executive, Kenneth I. Chenault, said in a statement.Net charge-offs, a measure of bad loan write-offs, rose to 8.5 percent from 7 percent in the previous quarter. The charge-off rate is likely to rise by 2 to 2.5 percentage points in the second quarter, and an additional half a percentage point in the third quarter, the company said.Shares of American Express rose $1.54, or 7.93 percent, to $20.97, and were up more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. The company reported earnings after the markets closed.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','There is plenty of sheep-counting even in the best of financial times. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 30 percent of Americans have trouble sleeping and 10 percent have some form of insomnia; their daytime symptoms include moodiness as well as impaired concentration and memory.But economic factors do weigh heavily. A survey done by the market research firm Experian Simmons in 2008 found that those with household incomes under $25,000 were 48 percent more likely than the general population to have sleep disorders, and those with no employed adults in the household were 45 percent more prone.According to a recent report by the market research firm Packaged Facts, the age group most likely to suffer from insomnia are people 55 to 64 years old, who may suffer from arthritis or other ailments and are 26 percent more likely than the average consumer to buy pain-relieving sleep aids.“Not only does this age group have to deal with the pains of getting old, but they are also most affected by the financial crisis, a huge headache in and of itself,” the Packaged Facts report said.In an Advil PM television ad now running broadly — by Grey New York, part of the Grey Group division of WPP — a couple on a camping trip tuck into side-by-side sleeping bags — hers blue with the Advil PM logo, his red like Tylenol PM packaging.Then, a third pajama-clad actor, holding a lantern outside the tent, announces it is the “middle of the night,” and the woman is shown sleeping peacefully while the man rubs his lower back and neck, grimacing.“With Advil PM, she’s spending less time lying awake with aches and pains, and more time asleep,” the actor says. “He should switch to Advil PM. Maybe you should switch too.”Sales of Advil PM, which was introduced in 2006, grew 17 percent in 2008, making it the fastest growing product for Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, whose overall sales for the year were “slightly down,” according to Doug Petkus, a spokesman for the company. The company has done comparative ads that mention Tylenol PM since Advil PM’s introduction, he said.Nearly two decades ago, Tylenol PM was the upstart, challenging Excedrin PM, which introduced the first nighttime pain pills in 1969. In 1992, the year after Johnson & Johnson introduced Tylenol PM, a judge dismissed a lawsuit by Excedrin PM claiming that its new competitor’s use of “PM” and its packaging constituted a trademark violation.Representatives from both McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson & Johnson division that makes Tylenol PM, and Novartis Consumer Health, which makes Excedrin PM, declined requests for interviews.Packaged Facts estimates the entire over-the-counter sleep aids market for 2008 at $604 million, and painkilling sleeping pills account for 61 percent of that ($370 million). Leading the nighttime analgesics market is Tylenol PM, with a 50 percent share, followed by Advil PM (23 percent), store brands and other private labels (19 percent) and Excedrin PM (7 percent), according to Packaged Facts.The active ingredients in most over-the-counter sleeping pills are antihistamines, like those in allergy pills. Sominex, Advil PM, Tylenol PM and Excedrin PM all contain diphenhydramine — the same active ingredient as Benadryl, an allergy medicine. (Benadryl describes diphenhydramine on its label as an “antihistamine” while the sleeping pill labels describe it as a “sleep aid.”)Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the sleep disorders program at Northwestern University, says she has had patients for whom over-the-counter pills have been effective, but she added that the medicines were not risk-free and discouraged using them more than occasionally.“If you take something like Advil PM intermittently when you have pain and can’t sleep, that’s a reasonable approach,” Dr. Zee said. “But I don’t think there really have been long-term studies to look at their safety and efficacy when taken on a long-term basis.”In a 2005 report about insomnia, the National Institutes of Health cited “significant concerns about risks” of such antihistamine sleeping pills, including “residual daytime sedation, diminished cognitive function and delirium, the latter being of particular concern in the elderly.”For those lying awake worrying about money, meanwhile, one way out of their financial predicament might be to develop solutions for people lying awake worrying about money.Packaged Facts projects that sleeping aids — not just medication but a host of products including herbal supplements, travel aids like neck pillows, sound machines and sleep masks — will continue to grow as much as 10 percent annually through 2013.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','At the board’s public meeting on Thursday night, which a standing-room-only crowd of more than 300 residents attended, Bayer’s plant manager, Nick Crosby, said the company was trying to learn from the accident.“We have conducted an extensive internal investigation that identified the factors leading to this incident,” Mr. Crosby said. “Based on these findings, we have implemented several measures — including safety improvements, additional operational procedures and safeguards, and an extensive training and compliance regimen — to ensure that this kind of incident will not occur in the future.”In the public-comments part at the meeting, Regina Hendrix, 73, of Charleston told the board that even though she had been born in the region and had retired here 11 years ago, “I’ve been so frightened by the incident with the chemicals here that I’m moving.”Ms. Hendrix said she had been about to buy a new home here, but would now move to the northern part of the state this week.Critics of the plant said they were glad to hear the safety board’s results, but wanted even more action.“We come before you today asking that you will finally hear our voices and stop the systematic exploitation of our community,” Maya Nye, spokeswoman for People Concerned About MIC, a local group that has pushed to eliminate a particularly toxic chemical at the plant, methyl isocyanate, or MIC. “We are tired of the smoke and mirrors and cagey nonanswers. Our lives are in your hands, and we deserve to know the truth about the dangers that exist in our community.”At the news conference, the chemical safety board’s chairman, John S. Bresland, said that because of the chemicals in use, the 400-acre Bayer site was among the most hazardous chemical plants in the country.Mr. Bresland said he would not feel comfortable if he lived near the plant, which is 10 miles west of Charleston, the state capital, and next to West Virginia State University, where 1,000 students live and 4,000 more attend class.“If I saw evidence of a really good, solid safety program with no incidents and no releases, I’d feel more comfortable than I do today,” he said.According to the chemical safety board’s findings, the explosion occurred at 10:35 p.m. on Aug. 28 in the “residue treater” of the unit where the plant makes a raw material called methomyl that is then used to produce an insecticide called Larvin.While the plant routinely produced methomyl, it was an unusual, and inherently more dangerous, production process on Aug. 28 for two reasons.First, it was the first start-up of the unit after a three-month shutdown and renovation, and start-ups and shutdowns of chemical plant operations are always dangerous. Second, the renovation involved installing a new computer control system for which, the board said, Bayer had not created a proper training system or operating procedures.Beyond that, there were at least three major missteps that led to the explosion. First, an undersize heater that had long been used for the unit was not generating enough heat, requiring a “workaround” that would generate the required temperature in the residue treater. Second, to generate more heat, employees deactivated two safety valves to allow more methomyl into the treater. Third, for some reason employees forgot to add a solvent, which allowed the methomyl concentration to reach dangerous levels.Rather than blame the individual employees who made each of these mistakes, the board’s lead investigator, John Vorderbrueggen, said: “The bottom line is, it’s the management systems that failed and allowed the operators to make these decisions.”In addition, the board said the unit operators, including the two men who died — Barry Withrow, 45, and Bill Oxley, 58 — had routinely been working 12- to 18-hours a day, with little time off, in the three months leading up to the start-up of the methomyl unit.“So worker fatigue may have been a factor,” Mr. Bresland said.For at least one relative of the men who died, that was not a revelation.In the months leading up to the explosion, Mr. Oxley “had complained about the plant and working so much,” his mother, Lesta Knuckles, said in an interview.“As far as I’m concerned,” Mrs. Knuckles said, “the plant worked them like animals rather than humans. I think the whole unit was exhausted. The night it happened, they were all working overtime, is what I was told.”'"
"'09-04-24,'1','HOUSTON (AP) — ConocoPhillips said Thursday its first-quarter profit tumbled 80 percent from a year ago on sharply lower crude and natural gas prices.But the results easily beat Wall Street’s expectations and ConocoPhillips shares rose 4.9 percent, or $1.87, to $39.93.The company, based in Houston, said net income for the quarter was $840 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, ConocoPhillips’s profit was 52 cents a share.Revenue fell 44 percent, to $30.7 billion, from $54.9 billion in the period a year ago.ConocoPhillips was the first of the major oil companies to report first-quarter results, which as a whole are expected to be the worst in years as the global economic downturn saps demand for energy. After peaking around $150 in July, the price of crude tumbled hard and fast and today is less than $50 a barrel.In January, Conoco announced 1,300 job cuts and, anticipating a difficult 2009, has reduced its capital spending budget by 37 percent this year.Across the oil sector, producers large and small are scaling back spending on oil and gas projects as the global recession crushes energy consumption.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','Most of the movie consists of the former champ sitting in a house near the Pacific Ocean, speaking into the camera as if no one else were around. This produces an effect of almost unnerving intimacy — it is a bit scary to be so close to him — but also an upwelling, perhaps unexpected, of compassion. It is hard to imagine anyone more radically alone.Whether or not he deserves our sympathy is a fair question. It is easy, and not entirely unjustified, to look at Mr. Tyson, his left eye ringed by a Maori tattoo, his head shaved clean, and see a self-pitying, self-justifying man who squandered his talent and good fortune and caused much more hurt than his brutal profession required. He started out as a street criminal in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and was plucked from juvenile detention by Mr. D’Amato and his associates, who disciplined the young man’s natural volatility and turned him into a fighter.But Mr. Tyson never learned to control his brutish, self-destructive instincts. His brief first marriage, to the actress and model Robin Givens, was marked by accusations of abuse, and in 1993 he went to prison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a beauty pageant contestant in Indiana. By now he may be better known for ranting and press conferences and for biting Evander Holyfield’s ear during a 1997 fight than for the mighty pugilistic feats of his youth.And a lot of people, even passionate boxing fans, might prefer to forget about Mr. Tyson rather than spend 90 minutes in his company. But “Tyson” is worth seeing even if you have no particular interest in the sport or the man.It may lack the detachment and the balance that Barbara Kopple brought to “Fallen Champ: The Untold Story of Mike Tyson,” the 1993 documentary she made for NBC, but Mr. Toback’s film, partly because it restricts itself to Mr. Tyson’s point of view, offers a rare and vivid study in the complexity of a single suffering, raging soul. It is not an entirely trustworthy movie, but it does feel profoundly honest.From time to time the screen is divided into two or three almost identical images, and the sound is edited to make it sound as if Mr. Tyson is in dialogue with himself, his words echoing and overlapping. These effects emphasize the film’s main point, which is that Mr. Tyson is too mercurial, too self-contradictory, to be easily summed up.He is by turns boastful, angry, remorseful and bewildered, choking up when he recalls Mr. D’Amato, whose death in 1985 remains the central tragedy of Mr. Tyson’s life. He relates the details of that life with candor and feeling, and also with an analytical ardor that is moving because it reveals his struggle to figure himself out.Without the sympathetic presence of Mr. Toback, whom he has known for many years, it is unlikely that Mr. Tyson would have opened up in this way. And it is also likely that without Mr. Tyson’s presence, the director would have been unlikely to restrain his own self-indulgent impulses.Mr. Toback’s fascination with hyperbolic visions of masculinity predates his filmmaking career, going back at least to a notorious 1967 essay on Norman Mailer. As a screenwriter and director — from “Fingers” to “Harvard Man” — he has been preoccupied with brutality, vanity and sexual conquest, and with the interplay between those elemental impulses and the refinements of art and culture.His protagonists tend to be variously romanticized versions of himself: intellectuals seduced by fantasies of crime, risk, sexual wantonness and violence. Even in his most interesting projects he frequently loses track of the difference between exploring such fantasies and indulging them, but in “Tyson,” his first nonfiction film, he is held in check by the irreducible, excruciating realness of the man in front of the camera. The transaction between them is charged with a strange kind of magic. The filmmaker allows the fighter to have his unchallenged say to justify, condemn and contradict himself. In exchange Mr. Tyson has enabled Mr. Toback to make his best film, which is also, paradoxically, his most personal.“Tyson” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and violence.Directed by James Toback; director of photography, Larry McConkey; edited by Aaron Yanes; music by Salaam Remi, with the song “Legendary” by Nas; produced by Mr. Toback and Damon Bingham; released by Sony Pictures Classics.

"'09-04-24,'1','Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said its earnings included 6 cents of charges related to the layoffs and impairments to investments.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Microsoft to earn 39 cents a share, excluding the one-time charges, on revenue of $14.1 billion.Intel supplies the processors for most PCs, while Microsoft supplies the key operating system software.Last week, Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, declared that “the worst is now behind us.”Mr. Liddell of Microsoft maintained a more somber tone. “While we would all like to think a recovery will be soon and painless, we actually believe it will be slow and painful,” he said.Still, shares of Microsoft rose in after-hours trading after release of the results as investors apparently took solace from the company’s cost-cutting efforts.Microsoft has lowered its forecast of its operating expenses by as much as $1 billion for the year.“Microsoft, like everyone else, has got serious about cost-cutting,” said Brendan Barnicle, a software analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. “They never really had to do that before, and investors had been hoping they would cut more.”Microsoft’s online services business, which competes with Google and Yahoo, continued to disappoint observers as a depressed advertising market pushed sales down to $721 million, from $843 million.“The online business looked bad, but I still believe they have to be in that space to fulfill the larger vision of where Microsoft is going,” said Richard Williams, the senior software analyst at Cross Research. “It may mean that they have to acquire rather than build.”Microsoft has been in talks with Yahoo about some kind of partnership in online advertising.In the company’s core Windows business, sales declined to $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from $4 billion in the period last year.Netbooks, the cheap, small laptops that have surged in popularity, remained the big story. According to Microsoft’s research, PC sales fell 7 to 9 percent during the quarter. Excluding netbooks, traditional PC sales fell 15 to 17 percent.Last quarter, netbooks accounted for about 10 percent of PC sales, Microsoft said. Netbooks are a mixed blessing for Microsoft. The company’s average selling price for Windows has declined, because it ships a discounted version of the older Windows XP on netbooks. Microsoft’s Windows profit fell 19 percent, to $2.5 billion.On a positive note, many customers have bought netbooks as complements to their existing computers, representing fresh revenue for Microsoft and Intel during these lean times.However, “there are some real challenges in that business behind this shift to the low end,” said Israel Hernandez, director of software research at Barclays Capital. “And on the horizon, you have Apple and Google who appear ready to introduce their own takes on netbooks.”Microsoft declined to offer specific financial guidance for the coming quarters.Shares of Microsoft ended regular trading Thursday at $18.92, up 14 cents. The company released third-quarter figures after the market closed, and in after-hours trading the shares rose more than 3 percent, to $19.50.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','Fiat, a company that was struggling this decade, is seeing new opportunities in Detroit’s troubles. Its chief executive, Ser-gio Marchionne, already in Washington for talks on the Chrysler deal in recent days, has raised the possibility of also acquiring the Opel division of General Motors in meetings with United States officials, a top government negotiator said Thursday.Such a deal, while far from certain, could turn Mr. Marchionne, a lawyer by training, into one of the most prominent auto executives in the world.During a call with analysts Thursday, Mr. Marchionne said he had not had direct talks with Opel, adding, “Chrysler is my first and foremost objective.”Mr. Marchionne has long argued that the number of automakers must shrink. “We need to go back to making cars and making money making cars,” he said Thursday.He said he was not trying to build a new empire, as some analysts have suggested, but rather create a profitable template for the industry. “The obligation is on all of us not to do stupid things,” he added.But many analysts doubt that Mr. Marchionne can pull off a three-way deal, despite his success at reviving Fiat since he took over five years ago.The Chrysler talks, with the deadline nearing, are more urgent than any discussions over Opel, particularly in light of the $6.9 billion in Chrysler debt held by the company’s lenders.Despite any hopes for a smooth outcome from a Chapter 11 filing, there are risks in bankruptcy. Consumers may avoid Chrysler cars because of worries about their quality or resale value.A bankruptcy filing for Chrysler would most likely wipe out existing equity stakeholders, notably Cerberus Capital Management, which took over the carmaker from Daimler in 2007.Some analysts questioned whether the Treasury’s steps to direct Chrysler to prepare for bankruptcy were an effort to pressure the lenders to come to an agreement outside the courts.“You have to proceed as if it’s happening, and in doing so, you may avoid it,” said Jeremy Anwyl, a veteran industry analyst and the chief executive of Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car buying advice.The Treasury declined to comment. But an administration official who did not want to be named said, “It should surprise no one that the administration is planning on contingencies, but we remain focused on the goal and engaged with all stakeholders to bring Chrysler and Fiat to a working partnership.”The U.A.W. declined to comment. A Chrysler spokeswoman, Lori McTavish, said, “As we move forward in this process, we believe it’s important to keep all options open.” She added that Chrysler would continue to work through the end of the month, based on direction given by President Obama’s auto task force, “to secure the support of the necessary stakeholders and reach a successful conclusion that the administration and U.S. Treasury deems appropriate.”The creditors’ claims are backed by most of Chrysler’s collateral, including plants, brands and equipment, and the senior lenders will argue that they have first claim on those assets — even before repayment of the government’s debt.The government and the creditors have been trading offers, with new ones likely in coming days. The most recent offer, presented Wednesday, would give the company’s lenders about 22 cents on the dollar, or $1.5 billion, and a 5 percent equity stake in a reorganized Chrysler.This week a steering committee of the lenders proposed that they receive 65 cents on the dollar, or $4.5 billion, and a 40 percent equity stake.A committee representing Chrysler’s senior lenders is preparing another counteroffer, people briefed on the matter said.Chief among the creditors’ concerns is that Fiat is being asked to contribute little to a Chrysler alliance, while lenders and the U.A.W. are being asked to make big concessions, this person said.Yet fissures have emerged within the Chrysler lending group, a collection of roughly 50 banks and hedge funds. The four major banks — JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs — hold about 70 percent of the roughly $7 billion of Chrysler debt, and they favor striking a deal with the government. Many of the hedge funds, however, are calling for a tougher stance.The Treasury is also working with General Motors to prepare a possible bankruptcy case, and the terms of a Chrysler filing might offer a glimpse into the shape of a G.M. filing.G.M. faces a June 1 deadline in its own efforts to draft a restructuring plan. The company said on Thursday that it would idle 13 assembly plants in North America to reduce production by 190,000 vehicles from May through July.Under the most likely assumptions, Treasury will provide the financing that Chrysler needs to operate while under bankruptcy protection. The Canadian government is also expected to participate in backing the company. The Globe and Mail of Toronto reported the Canadian government’s role on Thursday.Although Chrysler and Fiat have been discussing an out-of-court agreement, a bankruptcy case would allow Fiat to more easily select the Chrysler assets it wants to preserve.The approach, which relies upon Section 363 of the federal bankruptcy code, is somewhat similar to what the government is planning in the case of G.M. Then, Chrysler could sell or jettison any assets it did not want to keep and cancel franchise agreements with car dealers it considered superfluous.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','ISTANBUL — Turkey and Armenia have agreed to a framework for improving their strained relations, the two countries said in a statement this week, apparently in the first breakthrough in diplomacy in more than a decade.Turkey closed its border with Armenia in 1993 to support its ally, Azerbaijan, which was fighting Armenian-backed separatists in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. But relations have long been tense: Turkey does not recognize the mass killings of more than a million Ottoman Armenians in 1915 as genocide, something Armenia has long campaigned for.The agreement, which was issued by Turkey’s Foreign Ministry in a short statement late Wednesday, came on the eve of the Armenians’ annual commemoration of the genocide. It provided no details on how the two countries would move forward, stating simply that they “had achieved tangible progress and mutual understanding” and that “a road map has been identified.”Switzerland has been the mediator, the statement said. Tigran Balayan, the spokesperson for Armenia’s Foreign Ministry, confirmed by telephone from Yerevan, the country’s capital, that the statement had been issued by Armenia, too.Armenian authorities have said the negotiations have not yet taken on the two thorniest issues in bilateral relations — Nagorno-Karabakh and the genocide.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','Following up on pledges he made during the election campaign to curtail the high fees and rates, the president called the top executives from the nation’s largest credit card companies to the White House to pressure them to take steps that officials say would reduce abusive practices.Most of the banks have also received government assistance as part of the federal bailout, putting the government in an awkward position. As a shareholder, it profits from the banks’ improved earnings. At the same time, the administration is trying to take steps that, while helpful to consumers, could cut into the institutions’ profitability.Participants described the half-hour meeting in the Roosevelt Room as cordial and not confrontational. They said Mr. Obama told the executives that he recognized the importance of credit cards as a source of liquidity and convenience, but that he had concerns about certain card policies. He said some of those concerns had been addressed in new regulations that the Federal Reserve recently adopted and that will take effect next year, but that he thought the government needed to go further.“I know you feel that anything beyond what the Fed has done would be overkill,” the president was quoted by one participant as saying. “I just disagree.”He called on the companies to produce statements that are clearly written and do not have any confusing terms and conditions. He also proposed that every company issue a “plain-vanilla, easy-to-understand, simplest-terms possible credit card” to make it easier for the average consumer.Mr. Obama was told by executives that the industry still faced its own financing problems, as roughly half of the nation’s credit card debt is repackaged and sold as securities to investors in what is called the secondary market, which is still largely frozen. The president responded that he was sympathetic and that the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, had been working to thaw the credit markets.In response to one executive who was trying to make the case for less regulation, Mr. Obama told the executives to remember that they were “talking to a president who still has a very fresh memory of relying on credit cards” to finance his lifestyle. “I know them firsthand,” he reportedly said.Mr. Obama’s firm tone left some executives resigned. One executive told the president that although her assignment had been to try to persuade the president not to support new restrictions, “it was pretty clear I won’t succeed.”“You’re probably right,” the president replied. “But you should feel free to make your pitch.” The comment prompted the room to break out in laughter.The House measure is likely to sail through next week, lawmakers and lobbyists predicted. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said a similar measure that he and others have been working on would be on the floor of the Senate before the Memorial Day recess.Lawmakers said on Thursday that they had agreed to some amendments that were being sought by senior White House officials. One provision would require the credit card companies to apply consumer payments first to any debt that has the highest interest rate.On Wednesday the House Financial Services committee overwhelmingly approved a bill that would reduce many fees and limit the ability of the credit card companies to charge penalties. The bill, sponsored by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, was adopted 48 to 19.The bill would enshrine into law most of the Fed’s new rules, as well as some additional ones. Hoping to move more quickly on some protections, Senator Schumer and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, asked the Fed on Thursday to impose an immediate emergency freeze on interest rates of existing card balances. The Fed’s similar rule is not set to take effect before July 2010.“Credit card providers have been aggressively raising rates on consumers now to avoid the ramifications of this rule when it goes into effect next year,” the senators wrote. “Consumers describe situations to our offices in which the interest rates on their accounts have doubled or tripled overnight, without any misconduct on their part.”Michelle A. Smith, a Fed spokeswoman, said it was considering the letter and would respond promptly.'"
"'09-04-24,'1','PARIS — Credit Suisse reported an unexpectedly large first-quarter profit on Thursday, as its investment banking business bounced back.The bank, second in size only to UBS among Swiss lenders, returned to profit with net income of 2 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion), from a loss of 2.1 billion francs a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a net profit of about 948 million francs.“Our prudent approach in the new market environment has served us well in the first quarter and we will continue to manage our business in this manner,” Brady W. Dougan, the chief executive, said. “While we may still be affected by continued volatility and market disruptions if difficult conditions persist, we believe that we are in a position to weather the storms and perform well when market opportunities arise.”Barclays, the British bank, also reassured investors on Thursday about its business in the first quarter. The bank said its “financial performance is well ahead of the prior year” and reiterated that it planned to resume paying dividends in the second half of this year. Barclays’ shares fell 0.3 percent on Thursday in London.Credit Suisse, based in Zurich, said it had a return on equity of 22.6 percent, and that it raised its Tier 1 capital ratio to 14.1 percent at the end of the quarter, up 0.8 percentage point from the end of 2008. It also said that its April business continued in the same vein as in the first quarter.'"

The United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee found that illegal Myanmar migrants deported from Malaysia were often forced to work in brothels, fishing boats and restaurants in Thailand if they could not buy their freedom. “We do not want Malaysia to be used as a point for human trafficking,” Prime Minister Najib Razak, above, said. He said his government needed “more facts.”'"
"'09-04-25,'0','When leaders from the so-called Group of 20 met three weeks ago in London, they agreed to raise an additional $500 billion for the fund, which would use the money to help stabilize poorer countries that were blindsided by the financial crisis.Led by the United States, Europe and Japan, governments have thus far pledged about $375 billion. Though some officials had been hoping that more pledges would surface this weekend, that prospect seemed doubtful on Friday.Mr. Geithner hosted two back-to-back meetings with finance ministers here on Friday. The first was with ministers from the seven big industrialized countries. The second meeting, which began Friday evening, was with officials from the Group of 20, which includes China, Russia and large developing countries like Brazil, India and South Africa. The Group of 20 comprises 19 nations plus the European Union.Before the meetings began, American officials went out of their way to dampen expectations for any big accomplishments. Noting that only three weeks had passed since leaders from the Group of 20 mapped out an ambitious effort in London to combat the global downturn, Treasury officials said their goals this weekend were simply to “build on” the earlier meeting.The biggest issue dividing the United States from other wealthy countries is the amount that governments should spend to revive their domestic economies.Mr. Geithner and other American officials prodded their counterparts in Europe and Japan to plow more money into public spending projects and tax cuts. But while Japan has increased its stimulus efforts since the London summit meeting, European nations have been unwilling to go further than they have gone.“It is critical that we supply the necessary stimulus to domestic demand in each of our countries,” Mr. Geithner said, praising China for embarking on an aggressive $500 billion stimulus program and giving a nod to Japan. “Recovery in the United States depends significantly on recovery in those large and previously rapidly growing economies.”Economists said there have indeed been glimmers of hope. The frozen credit markets have thawed somewhat in recent weeks; shares in financial companies have climbed sharply, though from abysmal lows; and mortgage refinancing has soared in the United States.But even optimists warn that an economic recovery is likely to be slow and fragile, and may not start until late in 2009. Even if economic activity climbs, they add, it will probably be many months later before unemployment peaks and starts to decline.Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a former senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the hopeful hints might have the unwelcome consequence of making leaders in some countries complacent and reluctant to follow through on the regulatory reforms and stimulus measures they recently supported.“The warm glow from the meeting of G-20 leaders has subsided and we are back to grappling with reality, although reality seems a lot less scary than it did a few weeks ago,” he said.'"
"'09-04-25,'0','The more than 100,000 counterfeit items seized this week from a warehouse in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, included the usual fare of fake designer clothes and handbags. But besides the counterfeit Ralph Lauren shirts, Coach purses and other items found in rented storage spaces inside the warehouse, there were 17 pairs of fake Nike sneakers that bore not only the company’s swoosh logo, but also somber images of President Obama wearing a suit and tie.“It’s frankly just disrespectful to have the president of the United States depicted on these sneakers,” said District Attorney Charles J. Hynes, who held a news conference at the Stop and Store warehouse Friday morning. “Just absolutely disgraceful.”Mr. Hynes said arrests were made of six people who were involved in a counterfeiting ring that operated out of the storage warehouse. The authorities also confiscated $20 million worth of counterfeit merchandise from 118 rented spaces inside the warehouse.In addition to a likeness of the president, the fake Nike sneakers bore a round logo used by the Obama campaign as well as the words “change” and “yes we can.”Mr. Hynes said an undercover investigator working for his office rented a space a year ago at the storage building, on 63rd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, posing as a dealer in counterfeit goods. Eventually that investigator was able to penetrate the ring, which was operating out of spaces in the same building.'"
"'09-04-25,'0','“The Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York field office, have been conducting an independent review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the Nov. 25, 2006, shooting of Sean Bell and two others, that resulted in the death of Mr. Bell,” the spokesman, Robert Nardoza, said. “That review is ongoing.”Michael Hardy, a lawyer for Mr. Bell’s fiancée, Nicole Paultre Bell, and his friends, Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, said the last time federal officials invited any of them in for a conversation was “right after the New Year.”Ms. Bell said, “We don’t want his death to be in vain.”“But we understand these things take time,” she added.“We lost Sean and it just felt like, ‘Something has to come out of this,’ because it seemed like it happened for no reason,” Ms. Bell said. “My drive, my determination, is just to be stronger, because that is what he would want me to do.”Meanwhile, in a police precinct station house in Brooklyn, Gescard F. Isnora, one of the detectives, goes to work to shuffle papers and “do statistics,” as he copes with how the legal system and the department will ultimately come to view him, said Philip E. Karasyk, his lawyer.As he waits, Detective Isnora, who fired 11 shots that day, is living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, with his mother, and pursuing his bachelor’s degree.“I think the biggest part is being in this terrible state of limbo, having gone through the event and the trial and having been exonerated by an impartial fact finder, and now still having the threat of facing federal charges when all he was trying to do was keep the peace and do his job,” said Mr. Karasyk. “It is something that is very daunting and very discouraging.”Of the other officers, Mr. Karasyk said: “I think that everybody is suffering in this state of dread uncertainty.”The shooting of Mr. Bell, who had been out celebrating at his bachelor party in Jamaica the night before his wedding, touched off a series of protests, and a grand jury in Queens indicted Detectives Isnora and Michael Oliver on manslaughter charges and Detective Marc Cooper on a charge of reckless endangerment.Although no one in Mr. Bell’s car was armed, the officers, who had been involved in an undercover operation at the nightclub where Mr. Bell celebrated, said they believed there might be a gun because someone in his group was overheard talking about one. While Mr. Bell’s friends denied such talk, the judge, who heard the case without a jury, said he found them unbelievable and ruled that prosecutors had not proved their case.Paul P. Martin, a lawyer who represents Detective Cooper, said his client was doing “administrative duties” in the Bronx. He said Detective Cooper, who fired four shots, is trying to go forward, for his wife and three children, and to complete a police career of 19 years so far.“He still has a lot of sympathy for the Bell family,” Mr. Martin said. “But in light of the fact that he has been acquitted, he is just trying to move on with his life.”Seven officers, including the three who stood trial, were charged last May with breaking departmental rules. If the charges are substantiated, some of the men could be fired. But the federal authorities have asked police officials to put off taking any disciplinary action against the officers, said Paul J. Browne, the department’s chief spokesman. Police departments typically are asked to hold internal investigations until criminal inquiries are complete so as not to compromise prosecutors’ cases.Michael J. Palladino, the president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, the union that represents most of the officers involved in the shooting, said it was not known whether a change of administration in Washington was delaying federal action. But he said that “from my point of view, I would imagine that once a new U.S. attorney for the Eastern District is appointed by the Obama administration, the investigation will probably move along at a quicker pace.”For all the delay, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who has been a spokesman for the Bell family and has protested the acquittals, said he had a hopeful way of viewing things: The federal case is still alive.True, Mr. Sharpton said, events moved much faster in the case of the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles in 1992, when a federal grand jury indicted four police officers on federal charges of violating Mr. King’s civil rights just three months after a state jury acquitted the same four officers.But the federal government is also known to move slowly and deliberately. He pointed to the way a teenager accused of the fatal 1991 stabbing of a Hasidic scholar during four days of violence in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was indicted on federal charges almost three years after the attack and more than a year and a half after his acquittal in state court.Mr. Sharpton said he was buoyed about the Bell case because federal authorities were speaking to people involved, something he said did not occur in 1999 after four city officers were acquitted in the death of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea who was fired on 41 times as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.“There at least seems to be some activity,” he said. “How serious or not, we don’t know.”'"
"'09-04-25,'0','The 3M Company said Friday its quarterly profit fell 48 percent as the global economic slowdown hurt its sales in varied product categories, like health care and office supplies.Weak demand in the United States hurt sales of LCD screen coatings, steel coatings and other products, 3M said.The company, known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, reported net income of $518 million, or 74 cents a share, down from $988 million, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier.

"'09-04-25,'0','Her books are banned here, and the blog she has kept since 2005 is currently blocked. Still, with foreign media banned from much of the Tibetan plateau, Ms. Woeser’s blog, “Invisible Tibet,” has become one of the few reliable news outlets for those able to circumvent what is cynically referred to as The Great Firewall.Ms. Woeser has been kept especially busy by a run of politically delicate dates, including the 50th anniversary of the “liberation” of Lhasa by the Chinese Army, which upended the Tibetan aristocracy and sent the Dalai Lama into exile. This year Beijing christened March 28 a national holiday, Serf Liberation Day, but among many Tibetans it was a time for mourning.This year’s commemoration was made all the more tense by a security lockdown that accompanied the first anniversary of the riots in Lhasa in which 19 people were killed, many of them Han Chinese migrants.In the weeks and months that followed, hundreds of Tibetans were arrested; by her own tally, based on accounts of those she said she trusts, as many as 300 people may have died at the hands of public security forces.“It’s impossible to know the exact number because the bodies are always immediately cremated,” she said. “I am sympathetic to the loss of Han lives, but I am angry at the government for responding with such heartlessness. They have only made the situation worse by awakening the anger of the Tibetan people.”A graceful, soft-spoken woman whose disquieting tales are often punctuated by nervous laughter, Ms. Woeser has become an accidental hero to a generation of disenfranchised young Tibetans. Like many of her peers, she was schooled in Mandarin, part of a policy of assimilation that left her unable to write Tibetan, and she grew up embracing the official version of history — that the Communist Party brought freedom and prosperity to a backward land.HER pedigree is all the more notable because her father, the son of a Han father and a Tibetan mother, was a deputy general in the Chinese Army who oversaw Lhasa.It was only at 24, after seven years studying Chinese poetry and literature, that she reconnected with her Tibetan DNA. During a visit to Lhasa, an aunt dragged her to the Jokhang Monastery, one of Tibetan Buddhism’s holiest sites, and she found herself overwhelmed by the emotional intensity of the faithful. “I was crying so loudly a monk told my aunt, ‘Look at that pathetic Chinese girl, she can’t control herself.’“It was that moment I realized I had come home,” she said.She moved back to Lhasa, found a job at Tibetan Literature, a government-run journal, and began delving into the history and folklore of Tibet. In 2003, a publisher in Guangzhou put out her first book, “Notes on Tibet,” a collection of prose and short stories that quickly sold out. It was just before the second print run that the authorities took notice. They promptly banned the book, saying it contained “serious political mistakes.”In their condemnation of the book, her employer, the Tibetan Literature Association, said she had glorified the Dalai Lama, harmed the solidarity of the nation and “exaggerated and beautified the positive function of religion in social life.” They demanded a confession of her errors. She refused, and found herself unemployed.With no means of support, she moved to Beijing. After gushing to friends about one of China’s best-known writers, Wang Lixiong, an introduction was made. They married a year later.In contrast to Tibetan dissidents who agitate from places of exile, Ms. Woeser’s is a rare voice that emanates from China. Robert Barnett, a professor of modern Tibetan studies at Columbia University, described her as “fierce and courageous” but said she was never strident. “She is not a politician but a poet who quite late in her career started talking about politics,” he said. “She is an eloquent reminder of what’s happening in Tibet.”One of her most startling recent projects is “Forbidden Memory,” a book of photographs taken by her father during the Cultural Revolution. Published in Taiwan, the book provides a disturbing glimpse of the tumultuous decade that destroyed thousands of temples and laid waste to countless lives. There are pictures of trampled relics, jubilant crowds bearing oversized Mao portraits and a female living Buddha, head bowed in humiliation, as she is hectored in the streets. “My father loved photography and no one dared stop him because he was in uniform,” she said.The photographs also offer a telling window into the soul of a conflicted man. Ms. Woeser recalled her father as a devoted Communist who would publicly denounce religion by day and seek refuge in Buddhist texts at night. After he died in 1991, she found a dog-eared biography of the Dalai Lama hidden on his bookshelf. “He was like many Tibetans who work for the government,” she said. “They are divided inside. We call them people with two heads.”In recent years Ms. Woeser has become less tolerant of Chinese rule and more vocally opposed to the Han migrants and tourists who she claims have diluted Tibetan culture and damaged a fragile ecosystem. Such outspokenness has only heightened the interest of the authorities, who blocked her first three blogs. (The fourth, she said, was destroyed by hackers.)LAST year, she and her husband were briefly placed under house arrest after they spoke to the foreign news media.Her visits to Tibet are even more tightly scrutinized. The police track her every move, interrogating any friend who dares to meet with her. “Most of my friends no longer have the guts to see me,” she said.During her last visit in August, public security officials searched her mother’s home in Lhasa, confiscating computers and subjecting Ms. Woeser to eight hours of questioning. When she returned home, her mother, fearful for her safety, begged her to pack her bags and go. “That was one of the most heartbreaking moments,” she said.Most of the news that appears on her blog arrives through e-mail messages or via Skype, the Internet calling service, although they are not without risk. She said 13 of her friends are still in detention, some facing charges that they illegally disseminated details of arrests and protests to the outside world. “Every day I cry because I don’t know what’s going to happen to them,” she said, glancing out the 20th-floor window of her apartment, with its expansive view of a hazy Beijing sunset.Despite her relatively high profile both inside and outside China, she is well aware that her liberty is fragile. Since 2004 she has been waiting for a passport, which would allow her to travel and speak abroad.“I feel so insecure inside,” she said. “I feel like I’m sitting on the edge of a cliff and I could fall down at any moment.”'"
"'09-04-25,'0','WE are often told that tackling global warming should be the defining task of our age — that we must cut emissions immediately and drastically. But people are not buying the idea that, unless we act, the planet is doomed. Several recent polls have revealed Americans’ growing skepticism. Solving global warming has become their lowest policy priority, according to a new Pew survey.Moreover, strategies to reduce carbon have failed. Meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, politicians from wealthy countries promised to cut emissions by 2000, but did no such thing. In Kyoto in 1997, leaders promised even stricter reductions by 2010, yet emissions have kept increasing unabated. Still, the leaders plan to meet in Copenhagen this December to agree to even more of the same — drastic reductions in emissions that no one will live up to. Another decade will be wasted.Fortunately, there is a better option: to make low-carbon alternatives like solar and wind energy competitive with old carbon sources. This requires much more spending on research and development of low-carbon energy technology. We might have assumed that investment in this research would have increased when the Kyoto Protocol made fossil fuel use more expensive, but it has not.Economic estimates that assign value to the long-term benefits that would come from reducing warming — things like fewer deaths from heat and less flooding — show that every dollar invested in quickly making low-carbon energy cheaper can do $16 worth of good. If the Kyoto agreement were fully obeyed through 2099, it would cut temperatures by only 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Each dollar would do only about 30 cents worth of good.The Copenhagen agreement should instead call for every country to spend one-twentieth of a percent of its gross domestic product on low-carbon energy research and development. That would increase the amount of such spending 15-fold to $30 billion, yet the total cost would be only a sixth of the estimated $180 billion worth of lost growth that would result from the Kyoto restrictions.'"

"'09-04-25,'0','If that proves to be the worst reading for this recession, it will be a smaller decline than in the downturns of 1990 to 1991, or in the brief 1980 recession, and less than half the decline in the 1973-75 recession.That performance may be misleading, however. Personal income includes the cost of benefits, so rising health care expenses for employees count in that number. The decline would be larger if it were based strictly on wage and salary receipts.The two areas in which this is already the worst recession since 1960 are employment and industrial production. The number of jobs in the country has fallen by 3.7 percent, exceeding the 3.1 percent decline in the 1981-82 recession. Economists generally expect those numbers to get worse before they stabilize.The 13.4 percent fall in industrial production, while worse than in previous recessions, is better than in some countries. The worldwide recession has slashed both production and international trade, and the impact is being felt most in export-driven economies in Asia.The fourth category used in the coincident indicators is manufacturing and trade sales, a broad picture of total transactions in the economy. Adjusted for inflation, that has fallen 9.8 percent since the peak, a bit more than the decline in 1981-82 but not yet close to the 12.9 percent decline in the 1970s recession.This recession is also bidding to be the longest in recent history. If it ends in May — which seems unlikely — it will have lasted 16 months, tying it with the 1973-75 and 1981-82 downturns as the longest since World War II.The Index of Coincident Indicators did not exist in the 1930s. But there is no doubt that the declines in the Great Depression would have been far greater than anything experienced since.It also lasted much longer. As measured by the National Bureau, there were actually two recessions during the period we now remember as the Great Depression — 1929 to 1933 and 1937 to 1938 — separated by a recovery that did not come close to restoring the economy to its pre-Depression size. That first downturn lasted 43 months, nearly three times as long as this recession has lasted until now.Correction: An earlier version of this article and its accompanying chart misstated several percentage comparisons because of an erroneous formula.'"
"'09-04-25,'0','Medical debt can lead to drastic measures, forcing people to raid their , tap into home equity lines and, in some cases, declare bankruptcy. Surveys by the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit health care research foundation, found that 41 percent of adults said they were struggling to pay their health care bills in 2007, up from 34 percent in 2005. That percentage is almost surely growing.And as Mr. Kupka’s situation illustrates, it’s not just uninsured patients who rack up large bills. Nearly two-thirds of those with debt problems, according to Commonwealth, had .But insurance covers less and less these days, as employers continue shifting more health care costs to their employees, and as consumers resort to lower-cost plans that come with high deductibles or less generous benefits.“People who have been faithfully paying insurance premiums for years are coming in with medical bills they can’t pay,” said Gail Cunningham, a spokeswoman for the National Foundation for Counseling, an umbrella group for services that help consumers cope with debt.But if you’re having trouble paying your medical bills, you’re not helpless, either. There are ways to reduce, or at least more effectively manage, medical debt.CONFRONT, DON’T IGNORE Procrastinating only leads to trouble. If your bills are turned over to a collection agency, the debt goes on your credit report and will remain there for lenders, and even potential employers, to see. You may have difficulty getting a and, if you do get one, you’ll be charged higher rates. So take action — even if that doesn’t mean writing any checks right away.SCRUTINIZE YOUR BILLS Look over your outstanding bills and make sure the listed services actually square with the care you received. Errors are common. If terms or procedures confuse you, call the hospital’s or doctor’s billing department and ask for an explanation.If your insurer denied one or more of your claims, resubmit the bills, advises Mark Rukavina, executive director of the Access Project ( ), a nonprofit group in that helps consumers cope with medical debt.“If that doesn’t work, file a formal grievance or appeal with the insurer,” Mr. Rukavina said. “Even it that fails, most states allow insured patients the right to an external review by a certified third party, often a state agency. And patients should exercise this right.”HIRE AN EXPERT Try first to negotiate with your providers for a discount or an extended payment plan. Explain that you simply can’t pay your bills in full right now, and you need some leeway.If this tactic doesn’t work, or you don’t have the time or energy to haggle, consider hiring a billing specialist — a professional trained to spot errors who speaks the language that medical providers understand and respond to. (You can find a medical mediator at the Medical Billing Advocates of America Web site, ).Some billing experts charge only if they save you money. Others may ask for a retainer up front. Make sure you clarify the terms at the outset.BE WARY OF PLASTIC It’s tempting to get rid of your medical debts by paying them off with a . But if you don’t pay off your card balance swiftly, a $1,200 doctor’s fee could balloon to $1,500 or more over the course of a year. Your large debts might also cause a rate increase on other lines of credit. And while medical debt on your credit report is often viewed with some sympathy, credit card debt is not.If a hospital offers you a medical credit card at zero percent interest, be skeptical, warns Ms. Cunningham of the credit counseling foundation. The rate typically jumps to double-digit interest if you miss a payment.SET BOUNDARIES If your debts are turned over to a collection agency, you do have rights. “Debt collectors can be very aggressive and frightening,” says Tena Friery of the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization. “If they call, ask for the name of the caller, and insist that they send you in writing the name of the collector and the amount you owe.”According to federal law, a collector can call only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. They cannot threaten you with a lawsuit just to scare you into paying the debt. And they can’t garnish your wages, unless they take you to court and win.For a guide to debt collection, see the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse’s Web site, .If a collector is harassing you, you can file a formal complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. And many states have their own consumer protection laws on medical debt.LEARN YOUR POLICY’S RULES. Study your plan’s Explanation of Benefits carefully so you won’t be blindsided by unexpected charges.“Not knowing is what gets people in the most trouble,” says Arden Lee Taber, a lead negotiator for HealthCare Mediation, a mediation firm based in , Tex. He handles hundreds of billing disputes each year.KEEP A DIARY. Write down every instance of medical care you receive — all exams, tests, medications and procedures. This will help you or a mediator when reviewing your bills.NEGOTIATE BEFOREHAND. If possible, discuss ahead of time the fees you will be charged for a procedure, test or exam. If you expect difficulty paying, ask about price breaks.“You can often get discounts of up to 50 percent if you offer to pay right away,” says Mr. Rukavina. “We’re seeing more flexibility these days on the part of providers. Everyone wants to avoid the collection process.”'"
"'09-04-25,'0','If convicted on both charges, as is expected, he could be sentenced to 15 years in prison, Mr. Jiang said.He said the charges were unfounded and motivated by politics.“There’s a lack of evidence on the weapons charge, and the embezzlement charge is ridiculous,” Mr. Jiang said. “The living Buddha predicted that the government would arrest him because some nuns from his convents took to the streets to protest.”Calls to the two courts in Ganzi that are involved in the case went unanswered Friday.The Tibetan issue is one of the most intractable political and security problems for China. Many Tibetans resent rule by the Chinese; the riots in Lhasa focused on the Han Chinese, members of the country’s largest ethnic group.Mr. Jiang was one of 21 Han lawyers who signed a petition last year announcing that they would help defend Tibetans. Government officials met with the lawyers and told them not to take on any cases, he said. But he traveled with a colleague, Li Fangping, from Beijing last week to take on the case. Both are prominent human rights lawyers.“We hoped that this kind of issue could be solved through law, through legal procedures,” Mr. Jiang said.“This is beneficial to the relationship between Tibetans and Han Chinese, because they’re citizens of the People’s Republic of China, and they’re entitled to be protected by the law.”After the Chinese government sent security forces across western China to crack down on the protests last year, the nuns at the two convents in Ganzi were told to sign papers denouncing the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. However, the nuns refused and marched instead, according to Woeser, a prominent Tibetan blogger who has written about the case and who follows the Tibetan tradition of using a single name.At least a dozen of the nuns have been sentenced for unknown crimes, and six are still being detained, Ms. Woeser said in an interview.Beijing sent thousands of troops into Tibetan areas this winter and spring to prevent any protests during the 50th anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against the Chinese.In recent weeks, there have been a spate of sentences related to the 2008 uprising.On Tuesday, a court sentenced three Tibetans convicted of setting or helping set a deadly fire during the rioting in Lhasa. One was given a death sentence with a two-year reprieve, which can be commuted later. A second was given life in prison, and a third was given 10 years in prison.'"

"'09-04-26,'0','The United States has generally supported an overhaul of the organization’s voting structure, but many European countries oppose a dramatic shift, because it would dilute their own voting power.To get around the roadblock, fund officials said they are close to agreeing on a plan to sell bonds to countries including China, Russia, Brazil and India. The bonds would have to be repaid after one or two years, so they would not increase the fund’s permanent resources.But they would provide the fund with a way to raise the entire $500 billion quickly enough to help countries trapped in cash squeezes because of the frozen credit markets.“There was a lot of discussion that the fund would use the possibility to issue notes that could be bought by central banks, which could be a vehicle for some countries to provide resources to the fund,” said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F.’s managing director, after a meeting with officials from member countries here on Saturday.Other officials said the plans were serious and in an advanced stage, though they stopped short of saying that a bond offering was ready to be started.“What this signifies is that the emerging markets are drawing a line in the sand,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a former senior economist for the I.M.F. “From the perspective of the key emerging countries, they are being asked to contribute a very substantial amount of resources in exchange for a very uncertain promise of reform.”China, for example, has only 3.78 percent of the voting power at the I.M.F. But the United States and other wealthy nations are hoping that it contributes $40 billion, or 8 percent, of the new emergency fund.American officials said they supported the proposed bond issue, adding that the most important priority was to raise the necessary money as quickly as possible. The United States, Europe and Japan have each pledged to contribute $100 billion to the new lending facility.Though finance ministers attending the I.M.F.’s annual meeting here have expressed increased optimism that the global financial crisis is easing, American officials and fund officials have also warned that a recovery is still months away and that it will be even longer before unemployment stops climbing and begins to recede.The idea for the new lending program is to provide flexible credit lines to poorer countries that found themselves blindsided by the sudden inability to borrow in global capital markets.Poland, Mexico and Colombia have signed up to borrow from the program, and more countries are expected to do so as well.'"
"'09-04-26,'0','Nancy Potts slumped along a bench in Morningside Park in Harlem after a morning of clearing cigarette butts, plucking weeds and mulching soil.“I’m taking a break,” she said, as she swiped the sweat from her forehead.Ms. Potts, 41, was one of thousands of volunteers who fanned out across the city Saturday on what turned out to be the warmest day of the year, cleaning up green spaces, planting trees and uprooting soil in what has become a springtime ritual in the city.But for many, after a long, gloomy financial winter, this year’s work seemed more than just giving back: It was a welcome respite, a sort of spring cleaning of the soul.“It’s definitely revitalizing,” said Ms. Potts, a manager of operations at MetLife, the sleeves of her green Junior League T-shirt rolled up over her shoulders. “The financial market is really bad, unemployment is at its highest in years, and doing this just sort of reaffirms the things that are important in life.”On this day, the New York Junior League — which adopts a different park every year — had about 150 volunteers in Morningside, one of its biggest turnouts ever, said Julie Zawislak, who helped oversee the event for the league. The volunteers came from local high schools and youth groups, corporations and even the ranks of those who have recently been involuntarily ushered out of corporate America.'"
"'09-04-26,'0','“There is a profound conflict of interest built into the industry’s structure,” he wrote, “one that grows out of the fact that the management companies are independently owned, separate from the funds themselves, and managers profit by maximizing the funds under management because their fees are based on assets, not performance.”According to Mr. Lowenstein’s analysis, the performances of most mutual funds range from dismal to terrible while the managers receive fees regardless of whether the prices of the stocks they select rise or fall.In 1988, Mr. Lowenstein published “What’s Wrong With Wall Street” (Addison-Wesley), which, among other criticisms, lambasted the market’s short-term trading schemes.Investors have forgotten that stock represents part ownership in a business, the book said, adding: “If you buy on that basis, you have made a judgment about that company and its businesses over the long term. No sensible investor would change his mind in a few days or a few weeks.”BusinessWeek wrote that the book amounted to “a call for revolution on the Street.” The Washington Monthly said, “Congress ought to read this book.”Born in Manhattan on June 13, 1925, Mr. Lowenstein was one of three sons of Louis and Ralphina Steinhardt Lowenstein. Besides his daughter Barbara, he is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Helen Udell; his brothers, Robert and Richard; another daughter, Jane Mairs; a son, Roger, who is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine; seven grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.Mr. Lowenstein received a bachelor’s degree in business in 1947 and his law degree in 1953, both from Columbia. He then served as a clerk for Judge Stanley H. Fuld of the New York State Court of Appeals.In 1968, Mr. Lowenstein became a founding partner of Kramer, Lowenstein, Nessen & Kamin (now Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel), which soon became one of the major business law firms in New York.While with the firm, he worked as the merger lawyer for the Supermarkets Operating Company. It later became Supermarkets General, a conglomerate that eventually sold more than $1 billion a year in goods through its divisions, including Pathmark.In 1978, the company hired Mr. Lowenstein as president. But within two years, the company’s co-founder, Herbert Brody, decided that he wanted to run Supermarkets General instead.Mr. Lowenstein, who had been a lecturer at Columbia since 1976, resigned from the company, accepted a full professorship at the law school and soon began rattling the financial industry.“Wall Street gets paid for persuading people to change their minds,” he said in 1988. “There are only a certain number of shares of General Motors, and Wall Street gets paid for persuading some people to buy and other people to sell — to play a game of musical chairs.”In recent years, among his other philanthropic activities, Mr. Lowenstein served as chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless, in New York.'"

"'09-04-26,'0','Felix, meanwhile, did not need words to describe her disappointment. She was crying at the Bird’s Nest after losing to Jamaica’s Veronica Campbell-Brown in the 200. Wariner’s defeat came at the hands of an American, LaShawn Merritt, although his struggles last year can be ascribed to many self-inflicted wounds.It was not so much Wariner’s split with his longtime coach Clyde Hart that did him in as it was the loss of quality training time that such a change brings with it.“It set me back a month and a half,” Wariner said. “I didn’t get the base. That takes a month and a half. And by the time we got there, I’m already at my first meet in Australia. Then, we’re training for the meet instead of acting like we didn’t have a meet, which is what we should have been doing.”Those setbacks showed themselves in many ways. By the time summer rolled around, Wariner found himself letting up too much in the middle of his races, then using too much energy to start kicking in the homestretch.He got that flaw figured out after a few trips to his agent and mentor Michael Johnson in Texas, but by the time the benefits from those changes started kicking in, Wariner was lining up in Beijing, with Merritt at the top of his game.Instead of defending his Olympic title, Wariner labored to the finish, feeling fortunate to finish second.“I’m looking back at what I did, changing things to where I’m training as hard as I can at all times,” Wariner said. “When I’m on the line about to run, I’m going to run my hardest every race. I’m not going to slow down. I’m going out there telling people I’m here for a reason. I’m not just out here to run. I’m out here to win.”Of course, winning in an Olympic year is much different from winning in any other year, which helps explain Felix’s reaction after her disappointment in the 200.She had won the two world championships since the Athens Olympics at that distance, but her performances in the last two Olympics have netted a pair of silvers, both in losses to Campbell-Brown.“The race went like déjà vu from 2004,” Felix said. “I didn’t get out very well, that was the biggest problem. Then, you’re getting behind early and I could feel the race getting away from me.”Unlike Wariner, Felix has no plans to drastically alter her training regimen, although she did take about 10 weeks off after the Olympics to get away from track, then briefly experimented with hurdles before realizing they were not for her.She realized her biggest flaw in the lead-up to the Olympics was trying to do too much off the track. Most notably, she flew to Europe to race, then flew back to Los Angeles for a friend’s wedding, then back to Europe again before the trip to China.“I made a few decisions that were unfortunate and we all saw the results of that,” Felix said.Gay, meanwhile, conceded he was not in top shape heading to the Olympics, but still thought the hamstring he injured during the Olympic trials was fully healed. Until, that is, he started warming up for the 100 semifinals.“It just grabbed me a little bit,” he said. “I thought I could gut it out and make it to the final, but it didn’t happen.”He got to see Bolt dart to the world record in the final, but only on the big television screen.America’s top sprinters were part of an over all disappointing Olympics for the United States, which led USA Track and Field to commission a study and call for changes in some training and coaching practices.Wariner — one of the few sprinters whose biggest competition comes from within the United States — believes American athletes have to do it individually.“We didn’t all of the sudden get bad,” he said. “Other athletes just got better, so you do what you have to do to get better, too.”'"
"'09-04-26,'0','“The advocates want to scare people, so they hype the threat,” said Philip E. Coyle III, a former director of weapon testing at the Pentagon and a senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information, a private group in Washington, D.C. They see stark portrayals of Korean danger, Dr. Coyle added, “as an opportunity to promote missile defense.”Such portrayals take bravado, since the failed launching was North Korea’s third unsuccessful bid to loft a satellite in a decade, the splashdown made all the more humiliating by Pyongyang’s weeks of drumrolls and world defiance.Still, antimissile backers rose to the occasion. “North Korea has successfully tested a long-range ballistic missile,” Riki Ellison, president of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, commented in a news release. “This success coupled with the North Korean nuclear weapons makes North Korea a nuclear threat.”Mr. Ellison, a former linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers, makes no apologies for his group’s advocacy. Located in Old Town Alexandria, Va., just down the road from the Pentagon, the alliance has on its advisory board three former directors of the Pentagon’s antimissile program, as well as a number of other military heavyweights.Mr. Gaffney, a pioneer of antimissile advocacy, is a conservative celebrity. An architect of President Ronald Reagan’s Star Wars program, he left the Pentagon in 1987 and then set up the Center for Security Policy, which prides itself on antimissile education.The technical products upon which these men lavish such hopes and praise already sprawl across the wilds of Alaska and a sister base in California. There, in the last five years, military contractors have installed two dozen interceptor rockets meant to shoot down North Korean warheads.But test flights of the interceptors have repeatedly fallen short, and critics call the supposed protection a mirage. “The U.S. track record for the successful interception of ballistic missiles is not much better than North Korea’s track record for launching ballistic missiles,” said Tim Brown, a senior fellow at GlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va.Even so, Mr. Gaffney hails the weapons as potential saviors. After telling “Hardball” that a North Korean nuclear attack could turn the United States “into a preindustrial society,” he lauded the arsenal of interceptors. “Thank God we’ve got a missile defense,” he said.Antimissile foes take the other tack, demeaning the Korean threat. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a private group that seeks to curb the spread of nuclear arms, dismissed the Korean test flight as not only a failure but intrinsically nonthreatening. To become a military danger anytime soon, he told CNN, North Korea would need to make bigger missiles, and warheads that are more compact to put atop them.“North Korea simply does not have the technical background or institutional capacity,” he argued. “It is time to put aside the hype.”Engineers tend to inhabit the middle ground, saying that failures teach more than successes and that the North Koreans are slowly — albeit very slowly — learning rocketry. David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., noted that the recent Korean test was less of a failure than the nation’s 2006 attempt, and that the flop might provide useful information about how to make improvements.The scary warnings over the Korean test seem to have had little impact on Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. On April 6, the Monday after the launching, he proposed $1.4 billion in budget cuts for the Pentagon’s antimissile program in the coming fiscal year — a reduction of about 15 percent.Mr. Gates said he would recommend against a planned increase in the number of interceptors in Alaska, and would scrap efforts to develop an advanced interceptor warhead.But he also sought the middle ground. In a nod to emerging dangers, as well as his political constituencies, Mr. Gates said the department planned to keep financing research meant to improve existing defenses against rogue states — a threat, he added, that “North Korea’s missile launch this past weekend reminds us is real.”'"
"'09-04-26,'0','In eight races this season, Ambrose’s top finish was 10th in Bristol, Tenn.“I can tell you I think everybody has been impressed with what he’s been able to do this year,” the veteran driver Jeff Burton said of Ambrose last week during a teleconference.None of that surprises those who know Ambrose. He was a two-time V8 Supercars champion in Australia before moving to North Carolina in 2006 to pursue his Nascar dream.“I was a big fish in a little pond over in Australia and won a couple championships and was doing just fine, and I could have stayed there and bought a boat and gone in cruise control,” Ambrose said at the expansive, state-of-the-art Michael Waltrip Racing shop, which houses and supports JTG Daugherty, a team co-owned by the former N.B.A. player-turned-broadcaster Brad Daugherty, through a technical alliance.“I had a lot of knockers and a lot of people that couldn’t understand my choices to come here,” he said. “I’m pleased that I’ve proved them wrong.”It has been a long drive. A four-time junior karting champion in Tasmania, Ambrose left Australia once before. He moved to Europe in 1998 to pursue a Formula One career. He competed in the lower levels of the sport before giving up at the end of 2000.“I ran out of money, I ran out of talent and I ran out of time,” said Ambrose, who was $300,000 to $400,000 in debt by the time he left Europe. “I just knew it wasn’t for me.”Ambrose returned to Australia and became a champion driver. Along the way, he attended a Nascar race at Bristol in 2003. That was all it took. Ambrose announced in 2005 he would leave Australia to try breaking into the sport here.“I think he just saw it and just wanted to go for it,” his wife, Sonja, said in a telephone interview. “I think it was just a challenge.”In 2005, Ambrose met Tad Geschickter, a team owner in the lower levels of Nascar looking for a driver he could develop and promote to Sprint Cup someday. Ambrose had flown to the United States to try to find a ride in Nascar. The two met in a hospitality suite in Indianapolis.“This gentleman with a funny accent walked up and introduced himself,” Geschickter said. “I had no idea who he was or what his résumé was. I went back to the motor home that night, looked him up and learned pretty quickly that he’s a world-class driver.“Obviously, someone as marketable as he is with a résumé that he has, who is expressing an interest in seeing if he can make it in Nascar, was of interest to us.”Ambrose was marketable because he could connect with race fans and corporate sponsors. Although he had never raced on an oval in his career, he impressed Geschickter during a four-day test session at various tracks. The two have been racing together since 2006. They began in the Class AA-level Camping World Truck Series, then moved up to the Class AAA Nationwide Series for two seasons. Ambrose earned the first victory for an Australian in Nascar when he won a Nationwide Series race at Watkins Glen in 2008, joining Juan Pablo Montoya as the only two non-North American drivers to reach victory lane.Ambrose and JTG Daugherty moved to Sprint Cup this season with limited expectations.“A realistic goal for me this year to start, it hasn’t changed, is just to make an impression, just to give my sponsors, my team, a reason to feel good about me being in the car,” Ambrose said. “I just have to show that promise, that glimpse, and we’ve done that already. And then, of course, you’ve got to back that up with results.”Ambrose competed in 11 Sprint Cup races last season, including a third-place finish at Watkins Glen, before opening with a 17th-place showing in the Daytona 500 in February. He has had his struggles as well, equipment failures leading to some poor finishes.Ambrose has two young daughters he plans to raise in Tasmania when he is done racing in Nascar. But he plans to stick around for a while. And in the meantime, he has another quest to keep him occupied. Ambrose is buying more sophisticated equipment to continue prospecting for gold in the region.Not everyone is a true believer.“I never found anything but copper wire,” Geschickter said of his expeditions with Ambrose. “He tells me we’re going to make a lot of money doing it. Seems to me it’s a lot of hiking and a lot of work.”'"

She clinched the win in 56 minutes.“I tried to be pretty aggressive on returns,” Glatch said. “It’s key for me to be aggressive and take my chances.”Benesova, whose record fell to 3-9 in Fed Cup, said she might give up her spot in future matches.“I’m struggling in the Fed Cup,” she said. “I play like I’m No. 500, and that’s not enough.”The captain Petr Pala said he had not decided whether Benesova would play on Sunday.In the first match, the 19-year-old Kvitova showed no sign of a recent ankle injury. She rallied from a 3-5 deficit in the second set to force a tie breaker after Mattek-Sands, ranked 39th, failed to serve out the set.“I should have held my serve,” Mattek-Sands said. “I didn’t play well today. She came with great shots, and I didn’t know how to respond.”Kvitova relied on her solid serve to take a 5-0 lead in the tie breaker. She improved to 4-1 in Fed Cup singles.ITALY LEADS RUSSIA, 2-0 Flavia Pennetta and Francesca Schiavone won their singles matches to give Italy a 2-0 lead against Russia in the Fed Cup semifinals on clay courts in Castellaneta Marina, Italy.Pennetta lost only 9 points in the second set to close out the match in 67 minutes.AUSTRALIA FACES SUSPENSION Australia could face a one-year suspension from the Davis Cup after refusing to travel to India for their scheduled May 8-10 matchup in Chennai, citing “high-risk” security concerns.Tennis Australia said that there was an “unacceptable level of risk” in Chennai, and had appealed for a change of venue after the International Tennis Federation said last week that the southern Indian city had been approved by security consultants.The ITF rejected Australia’s appeal Friday and upheld the decision to have the matches in Chennai as originally planned. The winner would advance to the World Group playoffs in September.Less than 12 hours after the ITF announced that decision, Tennis Australia said the team would boycott the match.Davis Cup rules say that if a team withdraws from the competition after the draw, then the country will not be eligible to take part in the competition the next year and will be fined up to $100,000.The ITF said the Davis Cup Committee would decide on any penalties “in due course.”NADAL IN BARCELONA FINAL Rafael Nadal beat Nikolay Davydenko, 6-3, 6-2, to reach his fifth straight Barcelona Open final.

"'09-04-26,'0','I spent the next days discovering that Budapest, like the Parliament, was regal. But the grandeur seemed out of place amid the unmistakable sadness that hung over it and other Eastern European capitals of the time.I had felt that sadness in East Berlin, too. But in Budapest, from beneath the grime that covered the turn-of-the-century palaces and houses, a splendor managed to seep through. The fine lines and rich architecture made these buildings seem like wealthy people impersonating characters out of Dickens. Two world wars and two authoritarian regimes had not erased their sophistication. If you stood long enough on Andrassy Street, the wide boulevard bisecting the city, and peered through the midday haze of exhaust from old Trabants and Ladas, you could sense the city’s past greatness.The people of Budapest were equally out of phase with the atmosphere that surrounded them. There was a furtive energy in the eyes of strangers on the packed subways, but also an apprehension, reflecting the fact that Hungary was loosening up politically even though freedom had not yet burst forth. The Hungarians, their muffled pride clear in every conversation, rushed past the oversize Soviet monuments that dotted their city.For an Eastern bloc nation, Hungary was relatively prosperous, but there was still a drabness to the clothes people wore, a sameness to the products in the stores. The city seemed to simmer in the hopelessness of a failing economic system.When I returned to Budapest last month, I was once again amazed. After two decades of economic and political liberalization, the city’s potential was no longer hidden, glimpsed like a shadow disappearing around a corner.Budapest had become a dream realized, full of world-class hotels, ubiquitous construction cranes, mansions and museums scrubbed clean. Stylish women and men filled the subways and sidewalks. The stores were full to bursting, with local products as well as global brands.Hungary, it struck me, was part of Europe again.That is what is at stake in the current meltdown — a truly globalized world, increasingly connected and increasingly familiar, and, as the contagion of economic weakness has shown, more fragile because of its interdependence.In the years since China, then Russia and its satellites, joined the world economy, confidence has become the currency of this globalized world. One of our era’s dominant features had been a swaggering self-assurance, a sometimes smug pride in our modernity. Until it all started to come apart last year, a sense of optimism and possibility infected a border-hopping elite and, to some extent, the middle and working classes from Budapest to Bangalore.Global trade rose as economic barriers fell, and prosperity grew and spread. More than a billion people were lifted out of poverty in the last four decades, most of them in Asia. And in much of Eastern Europe, prosperity and personal freedom arrived together.We took that world for granted. We behaved as if it were perfectly natural to be able to travel freely from one side of Europe to the other, to withdraw money from our home checking accounts at A.T.M.’s in Africa.An entire industry grew up around globalization, with its cheerleaders and critics, its Thomas Friedmans and Fareed Zakarias on one side, and Joseph Stiglitzes and Samuel Huntingtons on the other.Now, the globalized world faces its greatest challenge: an economic contraction the likes of which it has never seen. As many economies shrink under the burden of bank bailouts and consumers and creditors tighten their grips on their wallets, unemployment will rise most everywhere.The director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, testified in February that the threat of political and social upheaval caused by the downturn has replaced terrorism as the greatest immediate threat to American security.The threat to much of Eastern Europe is even more immediate. Western Europeans, seeking to shore up their own economies, could pull their money home, leaving the East to fend for itself. Already, governments whose popularity had slid have fallen in Hungary and the Czech Republic. A fortress Western Europe would go further, endangering the very optimism that produced the new Budapest.For as much as things have changed, there remains a generation gap in Eastern Europe. Many young people still shrug off the current economic crisis. In response to a question about how much pain she and her family are feeling, one woman told me, “We used to have communism” — as if to say, “Are you kidding?”But a 2002 Gallup poll in Eastern Europe found that people over 60 were only half as likely to support free-market capitalism as those under 30.And the danger of banks, or even governments, defaulting in Eastern Europe is real. The International Monetary Fund had to give Hungary billions last year to avoid a national default.The problem is that much of the prosperity of Hungary and its neighbors was borrowed, from foreign banks in foreign currency. As volatility roiled world markets, international investors fled into dollars and United States bonds, hammering other currencies and making Hungarians’ foreign-denominated debt more and more expensive.Other developing countries are caught in their own globalization binds — from Mexico, heavily dependent on consumers in the United States as customers, to even China, its export juggernaut slowing so much it is likely to grow half as much this year as last.What will happen around the world if millions continue to lose their jobs? What will be left of a world that thought fortunes moved only in one direction?The truth is that no one knows.In Eastern Europe, the nightmare of widespread protests remains more talk than reality.For the moment, anyway. Sitting in a cafe on Andrassy Street, the sun sparkling across the scrubbed facades, the fleets of German cars streaming by, it is still hard to believe we could ever return to a time when Europe was not whole and free — or that Budapest could again find itself hostage to a failed economic system.'"

"'09-04-26,'0','IT’S hard enough for most people to find the perfect pair of jeans, but imagine being Serena Williams. Her muscular 5-foot-9-inch frame is a blessing on the tennis court but a curse in the fitting room, where her curves turn every shopping excursion into an odyssey.“First I look for the size,” said Ms. Williams, 27, explaining that her posterior was on the large side. She rifled through stacks of denim at a Joe’s Jeans counter at Barneys New York; a salesman handed her a new, slimming cut to try.“Oh, these are for short girls,” she said wearily, unfurling the pair. “These would be like shorts on me. They would be like a bikini on Venus.” (Her sister, Venus Williams, is 6-foot-1).That afternoon, Ms. Williams had escaped her busy schedule of training for the French Open and promoting charities to indulge in a shopping jaunt in New York City, accompanied by Nikki Burchiere, her personal assistant. Lunch was a sidewalk-vendor pretzel wolfed on the escalator at Barneys.Ms. Williams, the reigning United States Open champion, was looking for jeans, yes, but also for inspiration for her new fashion line, Serena Williams Signature Statement, which she said she was active in designing. Her jewelry and handbags, all under $100, will be introduced this month on HSN.Thumbing through the racks in Rag & Bone, Ms. Williams discussed her latest design theories. “Modern buildings can be really influential — the shape, the structure,” she said, pointing to the sleek, Le Corbusier-like geometry of a gray tunic dress. “I’m not saying this was influenced by a building, but it easily could be, these lines here.”'"
"'09-04-26,'0','Ford and Dodge recently introduced redesigned light-duty trucks into this gloomy and uncertain market. The 2009 Dodge Ram and Ford F-150, which together accounted for almost 462,000 sales in 2008, are crucial to the finances — indeed, the very survival — of their parent companies. In reworking their trucks, efforts that began long before the industry fell into turmoil, the two companies took different approaches.State Route 142 wiggles for about six miles between Franconia and Bethlehem in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. There are blind corners, somewhat neglected and often rough pavement and occasional surprises like a black bear crossing the road with her cubs. Driving the new F-150 up that road also brings surprises.The first is how incredibly solid the truck feels, partly because Ford used more high-strength steel in it. There is none of the shimmy-shaking that troubles some pickups, including the last-generation F-150.Another is that the steering is so good. Tight, precise and nicely weighted, it inspires confidence that the driver will be able to guide the big truck through the most tricky turn. Heading through those curves there’s none of that keeling-over body lean that you often feel with tall trucks.The downside is a ride that can be slightly stiff. But Ford reworked the springs in the rear suspension and the ride falls just short of rough.The final surprise is that the F-150 is so quiet.While those are all good things, Ford makes it clear that it wants the F-150 to be a respected member of the working class. “The reputation of the truck rests on the work truck,” said Matt O’Leary, the F-150’s chief engineer. “People buy a truck based on either capability they are going to use or capability they might use.”There are three cab styles, four pickup boxes and seven trim levels. There is a choice of three engines, all V-8s.The entry-level engine is a 4.6-liter V-8 with two valves per cylinder, rated at 248 horsepower. It comes with a 4-speed automatic transmission.Then there is a 4.6-liter, 292-horse engine with three valves per cylinder, making it more efficient and powerful. It comes with a 6-speed automatic.The top choice is a 5.4-liter V-8 that pumps out 310 horsepower; it is mated to a 6-speed automatic.The least expensive model is a regular cab XL with rear-wheel drive, which Ford describes as nothing less than “a true workhorse.” Priced at $21,790, it has a 4-speed automatic transmission and the 248-horsepower engine.On the high end is the Platinum SuperCrew. With the 5.4 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and 4-wheel drive, it starts at $45,030.The model I tested was an XLT SuperCrew, which Ford says is the most popular version. It had rear-wheel drive, the 292-horsepower V-8 and a bed 5.5 feet long. The starting price was $32,290. Options, including a $1,420 chrome package and $300 “premium cloth captains chairs,” brought the final tab to $35,540.The SuperCrew has 43.5 inches of rear legroom, almost 5 inches more than last year’s model. Two 6-foot adults can now sit in the back in stretch-out comfort. If it is necessary to carry cargo instead of people, the rear seats easily fold up, and the floor is flat. That means boxes or cargo can be stacked without rocking like a teeter-totter.Life is also good for the people up front. The surroundings are handsome. The seats are wide and offer plenty of thigh support for tall drivers. There’s nothing mysterious about the controls.Reaching into the bed is easier on some models because of clever fold-down steps on the side and rear. The steps by the tailgate even have a help-me-up grab handle.All F-150s come with important safety features, including antilock brakes, electronic stability control and trailer sway control. Ford says that if the trailer begins to sway enough to move the truck, the pickup’s electronic stability control will steady the truck and, ideally, halt the trailer’s erratic movements.In case of a side-impact crash there are seat-mounted air bags up front for torso protection and “air curtains” for head protection of occupants in both the front and rear.The F-150 did so well in front, side and rear crash tests that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the group’s highest rating, Top Safety Pick.Acceleration was adequate with three people on board and no cargo in the bed. But it was clear that towing a heavy load would make the trip more leisurely.For the truck I tested, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates fuel economy at 15 miles a gallon in town and 20 m.p.g. on the highway.Next year, Ford is expected to add one of its new EcoBoost engines. Mr. O’Leary says that turbocharged V-6 will perform like a V-8 while using fuel like a V-6.The 5.4-liter V-8 is the choice for maximum towing, and Ford says the F-150 can pull as much as 11,300 pounds, the most in the class and 300 pounds more than the previous model. There is no standard way to calculate towing capacity, but taking each automaker at its word, Ford beats the competition by at least 500 pounds (and perhaps by as much as 2,200 pounds).Of course, not every F-150 can tow that much. Most are rated between 8,000 and 9,500 pounds. The model I tested was rated at 8,100 pounds.While Ford has emphasized the work-truck aspect of the new F-150, it has hardly ignored the driver and passengers. The truck is not just more capable but more pleasant, its most serious flaw a stiff, somewhat unyielding ride.The old F-150 was something of a joke compared with the fresher Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra, but nobody should be laughing now.INSIDE TRACK: Ford gets back in the game.When Dodge began working on the new Ram, officials decided they didn’t care about winning the maximum-towing war. Ram owners said they were happy with their trucks’ towing capacity, said Scott Kunselman, vice president for Jeep and truck product development at Chrysler.“On average, the people are towing between a 2,000- and 5,000-pound trailer,” he said. “When we asked them if they need to tow 10,000 pounds they said, ‘No, that is what a heavy-duty truck is for.’”So the maximum towing capability on the new Ram is unchanged at 9,100 pounds.What Dodge decided was important was making the new Ram more comfortable, refined and luxurious.“It was clearly a place we could make a lot of headway,” Mr. Kunselman said in a tacit acknowledgement that the Ram had fallen behind the competition on interior appointments.In search of a more comfortable ride and better handling, Dodge made a big change in the rear suspension. Instead of using time-tested leaf springs, commonly found on pickups, engineers decided to use coil springs, which are more commonly found on cars.“A leaf spring, while it is reasonably cost-efficient, has a lot of compromises in terms of a chassis system,” Mr. Kunselman said.He said Chrysler executives had been concerned about how buyers would react to coil springs. But would-be buyers calmed down after learning that the Ram would still have a solid rear axle, which they saw as a sign of durability. “The defining parameter for them was the solid axle,” Mr. Kunselman said.The advantages of that coil-spring rear suspension are clear at every bump, break, bobble and turn in the road. The Dodge’s ride remained comfortable and composed at all times. Under hard cornering there was a moderate amount of body lean, and the steering felt a bit light. But the handling of the Ram was quite good over all.On the rough stuff, however, the Ram’s body didn’t feel nearly as solid as the F-150’s.The Ram’s suspension, combined with my test model’s 390-horsepower 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, makes for great driving entertainment, a phrase not normally associated with pickup trucks.The acceleration is impressive; the fuel economy, not so much. The federal estimate is 13 m.p.g. in the city and 18 on the highway.The Hemi is paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Two other engines are offered: a 210-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6, which comes with a 4-speed automatic, and a 310-horse 4.7-liter V-8 with a 5-speed automatic.Prices on the Ram start at $22,420 for a regular-cab ST with rear drive and the V-6. Adding 4-wheel drive raises the price to $26,875.I tested a top-of-the-line Laramie Crew Cab with 4-wheel drive, which had a starting price of $45,185. The total came to $52,555 at the end of a long list of options that included heated rear seats and a power sunroof.There was also an $1,895 feature called the “Rambox cargo management system.” Those are basically side-saddle lockable storage containers built into the sides of the bed. Dodge is not the first to offer such storage; Chevrolet introduced a similar feature on the 2002 Avalanche; the bins are standard on that truck.As one would expect for a truck so pricey, the tested Ram’s interior was practical, with plenty of storage, as well as plush, with handsome leather atop both the dashboard and the seats.The new Crew Cab replaces the Mega Ram, an almost cartoonishly large vehicle that wouldn’t fit in many garages. Dodge says the Crew Cab has 42 inches of rear legroom. That’s enough to keep a couple of 6-foot adults comfortable, and only 2 inches less than the gargantuan Mega Ram.The rear seats easily fold up for carrying cargo. But the floor is not flat. That greatly increases the chance that cargo will slide and topple.Mr. Kunselman said Ram owners indicated that the truck’s enormous size provided enough protection without any new safety gear. They got some anyway.All Rams come with electronic stability control and antilock brakes. There are air curtains for head protection and seat-mounted air bags for chest protection in a side-impact crash. As with the F-150, there’s a system that tries to bring a trailer under control if it begins to sway.In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety’s crash tests, the Ram got good marks for front and rear impacts, but a “marginal” rating for side impacts.While the new Ram still looks like a big bruiser, Mr. Kunselman said it was largely aimed at families that “have gotten into the truck segment for its utility and fallen in love with it — it becomes the family vehicle.” For those folks, the Ram is right on target.Dodge opted out of the battle for maximum-towing bragging rights and instead focused on creature comforts and a great ride. For many buyers, the payoff from that effort is likely to be greater than it would have been from a higher payload.The Ram and F-150 are aimed at different consumers and have different strengths. The F-150’s body is more solid and it controls body lean far better. But the Ram has a superior ride. It is also clear that while the Ram and F-150 previously trailed well behind the Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra, they are now serious competitors.The more important question is whether, in this economy, consumers still care.'"
"'09-04-26,'0','To the Editor: Christopher Shaw’s article “In the Dordogne, Canoeing Into Prehistory” (April 5) brought back very good memories of a day I spent in the area visiting two of France’s treasures. Both of them are gone now. The Lascaux caves were closed to the public in 1963, and Josephine Baker died in 1975.In 1962, 19 years old and living in Paris, I visited my girlfriend in Sarlat, where she worked in an orphanage. One morning, the chaplain took us to tour the Lascaux caves. We were the only ones in the caverns, which added a reflective tone to our transport back tens of thousands of years.In the afternoon, the cleric introduced us to Josephine Baker at her nearby estate, les Milandes. She had an orphanage of her own. She poured tea and coffee, and pointed out which pastries she had made herself.Then she nudged me to help her in the kitchen, and said, “I imagine a strapping American boy like you would prefer beer to tea.” She handed me a couple of bottles to open.She happily and proudly took me on a tour of her zany castle to see the napping children she had adopted from around the world. She was at once kind, classy and unpretentious.'"
"'09-04-26,'0','IN the several years since I discovered the Madison Beach Hotel, its seasonal opening, at the end of March, has been the happy signal that spring has been cleared for landing.The hotel is on the site of a roominghouse built in the early 1800s, catering to workers at the nearby shipyard. It maintains an unprepossessing, New England sensibility, with small, reasonably priced rooms, right on the beach. The hotel’s adjoining restaurant, the Wharf, used to serve a modified clam-shack menu. Its main attraction has always been its views of Long Island Sound; they are spectacular, whether you’re watching through a window on a chilly October day, or from an outside table on the covered porch in the mid-summer sunshine.In October 2006, the Cooney family, owners since 1968, sold the hotel to Ric and Dawn Duques. The Duqueses plan to close the property on Sept. 27 this year (traditionally, it has stayed open into November) for demolition and reconstruction. According to Ken Martino, the general manager, the Madison Beach will reopen as a small, luxury boutique hotel in late summer or fall of 2010. The new Wharf restaurant will be joined by a smaller, fine dining restaurant and a large banquet space.For the moment, the Wharf has a new executive chef; the menu, while retaining its New England character, has turned somewhat more upscale, focusing on fresh, rather than fried, seafood. There is a large selection of sandwiches and salads, and a mix-and-match collection of grilled entrees, offered with a choice of sauces on the side, steamed vegetable and rice.I have had good luck with the appetizers, many of which are large enough to serve as light entrees. Plump, nicely cooked mussels are a good deal at $10; accompanying triangles of hot, grilled bread are delicious dunked in the garlicky white wine broth. The smoked fish platter combines generous portions of salmon and trout with a hefty dollop of whipped horseradish cream (the grilled bread that accompanied it, however, was cold and damp).Goat cheese and Vidalia onion quiche, served as an individual, round pie with a small arugula salad, makes a terrific light meal. The thin crust is crisp at the edges, and the filling gossamer light.'"
"'09-04-26,'0','The antecedents of some of the teachings of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (Andrew Rice, April 12) are historically familiar, but the implications are fraught with potential danger. When Pastor Enoch Adeboye preaches that his followers “are a chosen people and have a special covenant with God,” he is merely echoing what other faiths have been claiming for centuries, starting with Judaism and continuing through Christianity (especially Calvinism and Mormonism) and Islam. But I wonder what Pastor Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran means when he speaks against “the gospel of tolerance” that has contributed to “moral decadence”? With the exception of Judaism, the above-mentioned have all been and are proselytizing faiths; faiths that have been and still are all too quick, in their extreme forms, to condemn or eliminate those who don’t accept their version of the truth. We live in a religiously diverse nation and world. Without toleration and respect for the faiths of others, including the views of those who reject religious faith completely, we will continue to make war on our fellow human beings based on the self-serving provincialism of these pastors and their ilk across the religious spectrum.Daniel Ajayi-Adeniran and Raphael Adebayo claim that the Redeemed are in America because it “has fallen into the thrall of wickedness.” If America is considered fallen, what does that say about the extreme poverty, disease, ethnic cleansing, tribal warfare and failed states of Africa where he and the Redeemed originated? In truth, the Redeemed came to America because this is where the money is, and because American freedoms allow all religions — even the most bizarre — not only to exist but to sustain their existence by exemption from taxes.We chastised the leaders of the American automobile industry for flying to Washington on private jets, yet we subsidize by tax relief the purchase of a private jet for a religious group that prays for God to cancel debts supernaturally; believes text messages offer divine protection; prays for deliverance from curses, spells and sorcery, witchcraft, evil spirits, poverty and addiction due to demonic possession; petitions God to transform their followers into millionaires; and claims to perform miracles, see the future, raise the dead, avoid traffic jams, foresee coups, restore hair, cure kidney disease, depression and H.I.V.How can we be so inconsistent?'"
"'09-04-26,'0','“There was a certain amount of rolling of eyes,” Ms. Dickey said. “People said it will never work in this country. People are too private.”The opposite turned out to be true, and the women said they were astonished by the response. The first Open Days, in 1995, featured 110 gardens, most of them in Westchester and nearby Connecticut.“We went and buttonholed all our friends,” Ms. Maynard said.Word of mouth came into play as well. Ms. Dickey and Ms. Maynard also enlisted the support and assistance of the Garden Conservancy, a nonprofit group based in Cold Spring, N.Y., dedicated to preserving America’s finest gardens. The conservancy is now responsible for coordinating the program.This year, more than 300 gardens nationwide — including more than 100 on Long Island and in Connecticut, New Jersey and Westchester — will be open at least once between April 16 and Nov. 1. Early participants in this area are in Westchester and in Fairfield County, Conn., this Sunday. Westchester alone will have 27 gardens on view this year.A full list of open gardens can be found at gardenconservancy.org, along with descriptions and directions. The cost to visitors is $5 at each garden, to benefit the conservancy.The program reaches from coast to coast, and this year will include gardens in 23 states and the District of Columbia.“It’s absolutely extraordinary that it’s become a national thing,” said Ms. Dickey, who noted that participating gardens vary from year to year.Regional representatives help locate and select the gardens that will be included. There are no precise requirements for a garden to qualify, and it can be any size. But screeners look for diversity in the offerings and some significance in what there is to see, Ms. Maynard and Ms. Dickey said.“We try to have a garden that excels in design or that has an interesting collection of plants,” Ms. Dickey said.“Every garden has merits,” Ms. Maynard said. “But on the other hand, you can’t charge to get into a garden that has three box bushes and a garden gnome.”For the most part, the gardens featured in the program will leave the ordinary gardener feeling humbled and green with envy. Those created by Ms. Maynard and Ms. Dickey are good examples.Ms. Maynard, whose garden at her Bedford home will be open on May 17, began working on it about 22 years ago. It flows in and out of oak woods on a rocky shoulder of Mount Aspetong.“I believe in trying to keep the feeling of nature,” she said.Her terrace is built around a tree she did not want to remove, and huge stone walls were constructed to make it possible for Ms. Maynard to create gardens on the steep hillside. The flower beds are filled with bulbs that will be followed by perennials.White-flowering stewartia mix with magnolias and an intriguing paperbark maple given to her by her father-in-law more than 40 years ago. Japanese tree peonies fill another bed, with flower gardens scattered throughout the property, along with masses of hydrangeas and viburnum and a wide array of other plants.“We see this very much as an educational tool,” Ms. Maynard said of the Open Days program. “You learn so much by visiting gardens, and gardeners love to share information.”Ms. Dickey started her three-acre garden in 1981, when she bought Duck Hill. “There was nothing blooming,” she said. “No flowers. No hedge. It was a clean slate.”She created a series of hedge-framed gardens with her farmhouse and outbuildings as focal points. There’s an herb garden, a white garden, a crabapple courtyard and a vegetable and cutting garden, complete with a Greek Revival-style chicken house. A pergola covered with Seagull, a white rambler rose, serves as the entrance to a swimming pool, and toward the road is her greenhouse, which took center stage in early April with a rare Fritillaria davisii in bloom.With Open Days just weeks away, participants are readying their gardens — mulching, trimming, planting and pruning.“It’s like having a big party. The slipcovers get washed. You polish and dust your garden like crazy,” Ms. Dickey said. “It’s a delight.”'"

"'09-04-27,'0','“And now to start chipping away at that again really does threaten the stability of the agency.”Perhaps the biggest fear is that the average caseload could balloon, after an intense effort to bring it to its current level, just under 12, from 21 three years ago. A children’s services spokeswoman, Sharman Stein, said she could not say that child-protective workers, who investigate reports of abuse and neglect, would be spared from layoffs; Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said, “It’s an issue we have to look at very carefully.”“We have a goal of reducing costs while continuing the progress made in reducing caseloads,” Mr. La Vorgna said.In a statement sent by e-mail, Mr. Mattingly said he would try to keep caseloads at the current levels.“These manageable caseloads are a critical element in our ability to do strong, thorough protective investigations,” he said. “Children’s services has committed to the children and families of this city that we will continue to strengthen and improve our child-protective work.” The city budget process is still underway; Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to present his proposal on Friday.The Administration for Children’s Services was founded in 1996, after the much-publicized beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, who was killed by her mother. In response to the public outcry, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani removed child-welfare programs from the Human Resources Administration, then the umbrella agency for all city social services, and promised a renewed focus on protecting children.After a string of high-profile deaths of children in 2006 — including that of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, who was found abused and starved in her home — Mr. Mattingly instituted a series of changes, beefing up child-protective services, vastly increasing the amount of money spent on family support programs, reducing caseloads and shifting more responsibility to foster-care agencies.But if Mr. Mattingly plans to prioritize child-protective caseloads, the proposed budget cuts would eliminate some preventive services and reduce others. These programs, which are administered through contracted agencies, address problems in families through parenting classes, housing advocacy or domestic violence counseling, for example, and can often keep children with their parents and out of foster care. Officials from the 36 foster-care agencies that hold contracts with the city have been told to prepare for a 5 percent cut in their fees, a reduction that many agency directors said could be devastating.James F. Purcell, chief executive officer of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, said that if there was less money to work with, “kids are going to stay in foster care even longer, and they’re already in care a very long time.” Jeremy Kohomban, the president and chief executive of Children’s Village, said he was planning to lay off several employees. Bill Baccaglini, the executive director of the New York Foundling, one of the city’s oldest and largest foster-care agencies, said the cuts would mean a loss of roughly $500,000.According to data compiled in Child Welfare Watch, a biannual report published by the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, preventive programs were operating at full capacity through most of 2008.“A.C.S. is relying a lot more heavily on preventive services than it did, say, six years ago, and this means the caseloads are probably going to go up,” said Andrew White, the director of the center. “And it means there won’t be the kind of growth in family and children’s services that we need to diffuse the kinds of crises that send kids into foster care.”Some of the layoffs within the city agency itself appear to be in line with Mr. Mattingly’s goals under Improved Outcomes for Children, an initiative begun in 2007 to delegate more responsibility and decision-making to the outside foster-care agencies. Several directors of the agencies said they were not concerned that many of the city positions would be eliminated.But many of the proposed cuts are of positions that provide support to child-protective workers, like administrative staff, computer technicians and drivers.In 2006, the agency began building a staff of 60 former police detectives who work as investigative consultants. Ten of those positions will be cut.“The burden will fall on the child-protective workers, because they won’t have the supports that help them manage the cases and move the cases along,” said Faye Moore, president of the Social Service Employees Union.Some advocates predicted that the budget cuts were only the beginning. Even if the economy begins to recover, they said, another round of reductions was possible in the fall.“We finally started to get it right after Nixzmary Brown,” said Bill de Blasio, a city councilman from Brooklyn who is chairman of the General Welfare Committee. “Now, by definition, it will be much harder to keep up with the cases, it’ll be much harder to protect kids, and this level of cut at a single agency suggests that we are not making this agency a priority.”'"

Rodgin Cohen, a prominent Wall Street lawyer who spoke frequently with Mr. Geithner.Today, Mr. Geithner is Treasury secretary, and as he seeks to rebuild the nation’s fractured financial system with more taxpayer assistance and a regulatory overhaul, he finds himself a locus of discontent.Even as complain that the government has attached too many intrusive strings to its financial assistance, a range of critics — lawmakers, economists and even former Federal Reserve colleagues — say that the bailout Mr. Geithner has played such a central role in fashioning is overly generous to the financial industry at taxpayer expense.An examination of Mr. Geithner’s five years as president of the New York Fed, an era of unbridled and ultimately disastrous risk-taking by the financial industry, shows that he forged unusually close relationships with executives of Wall Street’s giant financial institutions.His actions, as a regulator and later a bailout king, often aligned with the industry’s interests and desires, according to interviews with financiers, regulators and analysts and a review of Federal Reserve records.In a pair of recent interviews and an exchange of e-mail messages, Mr. Geithner defended his record, saying that from very early on, he was “a consistently dark voice about the potential risks ahead, and a principal source of initiatives designed to make the system stronger” before the markets started to collapse.Mr. Geithner said his actions in the bailout were motivated solely by a desire to help businesses and consumers. But in a , he added, “the government has to take risk, and we are going to be doing things which ultimately — in order to get the flowing again — are going to benefit the institutions that are at the core of the problem.”The New York Fed is, by custom and design, clubby and opaque. It is charged with curbing banks’ risky impulses, yet its president is selected by and reports to a board dominated by the chief executives of some of those same banks. Traditionally, the New York Fed president’s intelligence-gathering role has involved routine consultation with financiers, though Mr. Geithner’s recent predecessors generally did not meet with them unless senior aides were also present, according to the bank’s former general counsel.By those standards, Mr. Geithner’s reliance on bankers, hedge fund managers and others to assess the market’s health — and provide guidance once it faltered — stood out.His calendars from 2007 and 2008 show that those interactions were a mix of the professional and the private.He ate lunch with senior executives from , and at the Four Seasons restaurant or in their corporate dining rooms. He attended casual dinners at the homes of executives like , a member of the New York Fed board and the chief of .Mr. Geithner was particularly close to executives of Citigroup, the largest bank under his supervision. , a senior Citi executive and a former Treasury secretary, was Mr. Geithner’s mentor from his years in the Clinton administration, and the two kept in close touch in New York.Mr. Geithner met frequently with , one of Citi’s largest individual shareholders and its former chairman, serving on the board of a charity Mr. Weill led. As the bank was entering a financial tailspin, Mr. Weill approached Mr. Geithner about taking over as Citi’s chief executive.But for all his ties to Citi, Mr. Geithner repeatedly missed or overlooked signs that the bank — along with the rest of the financial system — was falling apart. When he did spot trouble, analysts say, his responses were too measured, or too late.In 2005, for instance, Mr. Geithner raised questions about how well Wall Street was tracking its trading of complex financial products known as derivatives, yet he pressed reforms only at the margins. Problems with the risky and opaque derivatives market later amplified the economic crisis.As late as 2007, Mr. Geithner advocated measures that government studies said would have allowed banks to lower their reserves. When the crisis hit, banks were vulnerable because their financial cushion was too thin to protect against large losses.In fashioning the bailout, his drive to use taxpayer money to backstop faltering firms overrode concerns that such a strategy would encourage more risk-taking in the future. In one bailout instance, Mr. Geithner fought a proposal to levy fees on banks that would help protect taxpayers against losses.The bailout has left the Fed holding a vast portfolio of troubled securities. To manage them, Mr. Geithner gave three no-bid contracts to , an asset-management firm with deep ties to the New York Fed.To , a Nobel-winning economist at Columbia and a critic of the bailout, Mr. Geithner’s actions suggest that he came to share Wall Street’s regulatory philosophy and world view.“I don’t think that Tim Geithner was motivated by anything other than concern to get the financial system working again,” Mr. Stiglitz said. “But I think that mindsets can be shaped by people you associate with, and you come to think that what’s good for Wall Street is good for America.”In this case, he added, that “led to a bailout that was designed to try to get a lot of money to Wall Street, to share the largesse with other market participants, but that had deeply obvious flaws in that it put at risk the American taxpayer unnecessarily.”But , the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in an interview that Mr. Geithner’s Wall Street relationships made him “invaluable” as they worked together to steer the country through crisis.“He spoke frequently to many, many different players and kept his finger on the of the situation,” Mr. Bernanke said. “He was the point person for me in many cases and with many individual firms so that we were prepared for any kind of emergency.”A revolving door has long connected Wall Street and the New York Fed. Mr. Geithner’s predecessors, E. Gerald Corrigan and , wound up as -bank executives. The current president, , came from Goldman Sachs.Mr. Geithner followed a different route. An expert in international finance, he served under both Clinton-era Treasury secretaries, Mr. Rubin and . He impressed them with his handling of foreign financial crises in the late 1990s before landing a top job at the .When the New York Fed was looking for a new president, both former secretaries were advisers to the bank’s search committee and supported Mr. Geithner’s candidacy. Mr. Rubin’s seal of approval carried particular weight because he was by then a senior official at Citigroup.Mr. Weill, Citigroup’s architect, was a member of the New York Fed board when Mr. Geithner arrived. “He had a baby face,” Mr. Weill recalled. “He didn’t have a lot of experience in dealing with the industry.”But, he added, “He quickly earned the respect of just about everyone I know. His knowledge, his willingness to listen to people.”At the age of 42, Mr. Geithner took charge of a bank with enormous influence over the American economy.Sitting like a fortress in the heart of ’s financial district, the New York Fed is, by dint of the city’s position as a world financial center, the most powerful of the 12 regional banks that make up the Federal Reserve system.The Federal Reserve was created after a banking crisis nearly a century ago to manage the money supply through interest-rate policy, oversee the safety and soundness of the banking system and act as lender of last resort in times of trouble. The Fed relies on its regional banks, like the New York Fed, to carry out its policies and monitor certain banks in their areas.The regional reserve banks are unusual entities. They are private and their shares are owned by financial institutions the bank oversees. Their net income is paid to the Treasury.At the New York Fed, top executives of global financial giants fill many seats on the board. In recent years, board members have included the chief executives of Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, as well as top officials of and industrial companies like .In theory, having financiers on the New York Fed’s board should help the president be Washington’s eyes and ears on Wall Street. But critics, including some current and former Federal Reserve officials, say the New York Fed is often more of a Wall Street mouthpiece than a cop.Willem H. Buiter, a professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science who caused a stir at a Fed retreat last year with a paper concluding that the Federal Reserve had been co-opted by the financial industry, said the structure ensured that “Wall Street gets what it wants” in its New York president: “A safe pair of hands, someone who is bright, intelligent, hard-working, but not someone who intends to reform the system root and branch.”Mr. Geithner took office during one of the headiest bull markets ever. Yet his most important task, he said in an interview, was to prepare banks for “the storm that we thought was going to come.”In his first speech as president in March 2004, he advised bankers to “build a sufficient cushion against adversity.” Early on, he also spoke frequently about the risk posed by the explosion of derivatives, unregulated insurancelike products that many companies use to hedge their bets.But Mr. Geithner acknowledges that “even with all the things that we took the initiative to do, I didn’t think we achieved enough.”Derivatives were not an altogether new issue for him, since the Clinton Treasury Department had battled efforts to regulate the multitrillion-dollar market. As Mr. Geithner shaped his own approach, records and interviews show, he consulted veterans of that fight at Treasury, including Lewis A. Sachs, a close friend and tennis partner who managed a hedge fund.Mr. Geithner pushed the industry to keep better records of derivative deals, a measure that experts credit with mitigating the chaos once firms began to topple. But he stopped short of pressing for comprehensive regulation and disclosure of derivatives trading and even publicly endorsed their potential to damp risk.Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at the Stern School of Business at , who made early predictions of the crisis, said Mr. Geithner deserved credit for trying, especially given that the Fed chairman at the time, , was singing the praises of derivatives.Even as Mr. Geithner was counseling banks to take precautions against adversity, some economists were arguing that easy credit was feeding a more obvious problem: a housing bubble.Despite those warnings, a report released by the New York Fed in 2004 called predictions of gloom “flawed” and “unpersuasive.” And as lending standards evaporated and the housing boom reached full throttle, banks plunged ever deeper into risky -backed securities and derivatives.The nitty-gritty task of monitoring such risk-taking is done by 25 examiners at each large bank. Mr. Geithner reviewed his examiners’ reports, but since they are not public, it is hard to fully assess the New York Fed’s actions during that period.Mr. Geithner said many of the New York Fed’s supervisory actions could not be disclosed because of confidentiality issues. As a result, he added, “I realize I am vulnerable to a different narrative in that context.”The ultimate tool at Mr. Geithner’s disposal for reining in unsafe practices was to recommend that the Board of Governors of the Fed publicly rebuke a bank with penalties or cease and desist orders. Under his watch, only three such actions were taken against big domestic banks; none came after 2006, when banks’ lending practices were at their worst.Perhaps the central regulatory challenge for Mr. Geithner was Citigroup.Cobbled together by Mr. Weill through a series of pell-mell acquisitions into the world’s largest bank, Citigroup reached into every corner of the financial world: , , trading, investment banking, as well as mortgage securities and derivatives. But it was plagued by mismanagement and wayward banking practices.In 2004, the New York Fed levied a $70 million penalty against Citigroup over the bank’s lending practices. The next year, the New York Fed barred Citigroup from further acquisitions after the bank was involved in trading irregularities and questions about its operations. The New York Fed lifted that restriction in 2006, citing the company’s “significant progress” in carrying out risk-control measures.In fact, risk was rising to dangerous levels at Citigroup as the bank dove deeper into mortgage-backed securities.Throughout the spring and summer of 2007, as subprime lenders began to fail and government officials reassured the public that the problems were contained, Mr. Geithner met repeatedly with members of Citigroup’s management, records show.From mid-May to mid-June alone, he met over breakfast with Charles O. Prince, the company’s chief executive at the time, traveled to Citigroup headquarters in Midtown Manhattan to meet with Lewis B. Kaden, the company’s vice chairman, and had coffee with Thomas G. Maheras, who ran some of the bank’s biggest trading operations.His calendar shows that during that period he also had breakfast with Mr. Rubin. But in his conversations with Mr. Rubin, Mr. Geithner said, he did not discuss bank matters. “I did not do supervision with Bob Rubin,” he said.Any intelligence Mr. Geithner gathered in his meetings does not appear to have prepared him for the severity of the problems at Citigroup and beyond.In a May 15, 2007, speech to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Mr. Geithner praised the strength of the nation’s top financial institutions, saying that innovations like derivatives had “improved the capacity to measure and manage risk” and declaring that “the larger global financial institutions are generally stronger in terms of capital relative to risk.”Two days later, interviews and records show, he lobbied behind the scenes for a plan that a government study said could lead banks to reduce the amount of capital they kept on hand.While waiting for a breakfast meeting with Mr. Weill at the Four Seasons Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Geithner phoned Mr. Dugan, the comptroller of the currency, according to both men’s calendars. Both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were pushing for the new standards, which they said would make them more competitive. Records show that earlier that week, Mr. Geithner had discussed the issue with JPMorgan’s chief, Mr. Dimon.At the , which insures bank deposits, the chairwoman, , argued that the new standards were tantamount to letting the banks set their own capital levels. Taxpayers, she warned, could be left “holding the bag” in a downturn. But Mr. Geithner believed that the standards would make the banks more sensitive to risk, Mr. Dugan recalled. The standards were adopted but have yet to go into effect.Callum McCarthy, a former top British financial regulator, said regulators worldwide should have focused instead on how undercapitalized banks already were. “The problem is that people in banks overestimated their ability to manage risk, and we believed them.”By the fall of 2007, that was becoming clear. Citigroup alone would eventually require $45 billion in direct taxpayer assistance to stay afloat.On Nov. 5, 2007, Mr. Prince stepped down as Citigroup’s chief in the wake of multibillion-dollar mortgage write-downs. Mr. Rubin was named chairman, and the search for a new chief executive began. Mr. Weill had a perfect candidate: Mr. Geithner.The two men had remained close. That past January, Mr. Geithner had joined the board of the National Academy Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded by Mr. Weill to help inner-city high school students prepare for the work force.“I was a little worried about the implications,” Mr. Geithner said, but added that he had accepted the unpaid post only after Mr. Weill had stepped down as Citigroup’s chairman, and because it was a good cause that the Fed already supported.Although Mr. Geithner was a headliner with Mr. Prince at a 2004 fundraiser that generated $1.1 million for the foundation, he said he did not raise money for the group once on the board. He attended regular foundation meetings at Mr. Weill’s Midtown Manhattan office.In addition to charity business, Mr. Weill said, the two men often spoke about what was happening at Citigroup. “It would be logical,” he said.On Nov. 6 and 7, 2007, as Mr. Geithner’s bank examiners scrambled to assess Citigroup’s problems, the two men spoke twice, records show, once for a half-hour on the phone and once for an hourlong meeting in Mr. Weill’s office, followed by a National Academy Foundation cocktail reception.Mr. Geithner also went to Citigroup headquarters for a lunch with Mr. Rubin on Nov. 16 and met with Mr. Prince on Dec. 4, records show.Mr. Geithner acknowledged in an interview that Mr. Weill had spoken with him about the Citigroup job. But he immediately rejected the idea, he said, because he did not think he was right for the job.“I told him I was not the right choice,” Mr. Geithner said, adding that he then spoke to “one other board member to confirm after the fact that it did not make sense.”According to New York Fed officials, Mr. Geithner informed the reserve bank’s lawyers about the exchange with Mr. Weill, and they told him to recuse himself from Citigroup business until the matter was resolved.Mr. Geithner said he “would never put myself in a position where my actions were influenced by a personal relationship.”Other chief financial regulators at the Federal Deposit Company and the Securities and Exchange Commission say they keep officials from institutions they supervise at arm’s length, to avoid even the appearance of a conflict. While the New York Fed’s rules do not prevent its president from holding such one-on-one meetings, that was not the general practice of Mr. Geithner’s recent predecessors, said Ernest T. Patrikis, a former general counsel and chief operating officer at the New York Fed.“Typically, there would be senior staff there to protect against disputes in the future as to the nature of the conversations,” he said.As Mr. Geithner sees it, most of the institutions hit hardest by the crisis were not under his jurisdiction — some foreign banks, mortgage companies and brokerage firms. But he acknowledges that “the thing I feel somewhat burdened by is that I didn’t attempt to try to change the rules of the game on capital requirements early on,” which could have left banks in better shape to weather the storm.By last fall, it was too late. The government, with Mr. Geithner playing a lead role alongside Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson, scurried to rescue the financial system from collapse. As the Fed became the biggest vehicle for the bailout, its balance sheet more than doubled, from $900 billion in October 2007 to more than $2 trillion today.“I couldn’t have cared less about Wall Street, but we faced a crisis that was going to cause enormous damage to the economy,” Mr. Geithner said.The first to fall was , which had bet heavily on mortgages and by mid-March was tottering. Mr. Geithner and Mr. Paulson persuaded JPMorgan Chase to take over Bear. But to complete the deal, JPMorgan insisted that the government buy $29 billion in risky securities owned by Bear.Some officials at the Federal Reserve feared encouraging risky behavior by bailing out an investment house that did not even fall under its umbrella. To Mr. Geithner’s supporters, that he prevailed in the case of Bear and other bailout decisions is testament to his leadership.“He was a leader in trying to come up with an aggressive set of policies so that it wouldn’t get completely out of control,” said Philipp Hildebrand, a top official at the Swiss National Bank who has worked with Mr. Geithner to coordinate an international response to the worldwide financial crisis.But others are less enthusiastic. William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis until March 2008, said that the Fed, by effectively creating money out of thin air, not only runs the risk of “massive inflation” but has also done an end-run around Congressional power to control spending.Many of the programs “ought to be legislated and shouldn’t be in the Federal Reserve at all,” he contended.In making the Bear deal, the New York Fed agreed to accept Bear’s own calculation of the value of assets acquired with taxpayer money, even though those values were almost certain to decline as the economy deteriorated. Although Fed officials argue that they can hold onto those assets until they increase in value, to date taxpayers have lost $3.4 billion. Even these losses are probably understated, given how the Federal Reserve priced the holdings, said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm in . “You can assume that it has used magical thinking in valuing these assets,” she said.Mr. Geithner played a pivotal role in the next bailout, which was even bigger — that of the , the insurance giant whose derivatives business had brought it to the brink of collapse in September. He also went to bat for Goldman Sachs, one of the insurer’s biggest trading partners.As A.I.G. bordered on bankruptcy, Mr. Geithner pressed first for a private sector solution. A.I.G. needed $60 billion to meet payments on insurance contracts it had written to protect customers against debt defaults.A.I.G.’s chief executive at the time, , said he had hired bankers at JPMorgan to help it raise capital. Goldman Sachs had jockeyed for the job as well, but because the investment bank was one of A.I.G.’s biggest trading partners, Mr. Willumstad rejected the idea. The potential conflicts of interest, he believed, were too great.Nevertheless, on Monday, Sept. 15, Mr. Geithner pushed A.I.G. to bring Goldman onto its team to raise capital, Mr. Willumstad said.Mr. Geithner and Mr. Corrigan, a Goldman managing director, were close, speaking frequently and sometimes lunching together at Goldman headquarters. On that day, the company’s chief executive, , was at the New York Fed.A Goldman spokesman said, “We don’t believe anyone at Goldman Sachs asked Mr. Geithner to include the firm in the assignment.” Mr. Geithner said he had suggested Goldman get involved because the situation was chaotic and “time was running out.”But A.I.G.’s search for capital was fruitless. By late Tuesday afternoon, the government would step in with an $85 billion , the first installment of a bailout that now stands at $182 billion. As part of the bailout, A.I.G.’s trading partners, including Goldman, were compensated fully for money owed to them by A.I.G.Analysts say the New York Fed should have pressed A.I.G.’s trading partners to take a deep discount on what they were owed. But Mr. Geithner said he had no bargaining power because he was unwilling to threaten A.I.G.’s trading partners with a bankruptcy by the insurer for fear of further destabilizing the system.A recent report on the A.I.G. bailout by the found that taxpayers may never get their money back.Over Columbus Day weekend last fall, with the market gripped by fear and banks refusing to lend to one another, a somber group gathered in an ornate conference room across from Mr. Paulson’s office at the Treasury.Mr. Paulson, Mr. Bernanke, Ms. Bair and others listened as Mr. Geithner made his pitch, according to four participants. Mr. Geithner, in the words of one participant, was “hell bent” on a plan to use the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to guarantee debt issued by bank holding companies.It was a variation on Mr. Geithner’s once-unthinkable plan to have the government guarantee all bank debt.The idea of putting the government behind debt issued by banking and investment companies was a momentous shift, an assistant Treasury secretary, David G. Nason, argued. Mr. Geithner wanted to give the banks the guarantee free, saying in a recent interview that he felt that charging them would be “counterproductive.” But Ms. Bair worried that her agency — and ultimately taxpayers — would be left vulnerable in the event of a default.Mr. Geithner’s program was enacted and to date has guaranteed $340 billion in loans to banks. But Ms. Bair prevailed on taking fees for the guarantees, and the government so far has collected $7 billion.Mr. Geithner has also faced scrutiny over how well taxpayers were served by his handling of another aspect of the bailout: three no-bid contracts the New York Fed awarded to BlackRock, a money management firm, to oversee troubled assets acquired by the bank.BlackRock was well known to the Fed. Mr. Geithner socialized with Ralph L. Schlosstein, who founded the company and remains a large shareholder, and has dined at his Manhattan home. Peter R. Fisher, who was a senior official at the New York Fed until 2001, is a managing director at BlackRock.Mr. Schlosstein said that while he and Mr. Geithner spoke frequently, BlackRock’s work for the Fed never came up.“Conversations with Tim were appropriately a one-way street. He’d call you and pepper you with a bunch of questions and say thank you very much and hang up,” he said. “My experience with Tim is that he makes those kinds of decisions 100 percent based on capability and zero about relationships.”For months, New York Fed officials declined to make public details of the contract, which has become a flash point with some lawmakers who say the Fed’s handling of the bailout is too secretive. New York Fed officials initially said in interviews that they could not disclose the fees because they had agreed with BlackRock to keep them confidential in exchange for a discount.The contract terms they subsequently disclosed to The show that the contract is worth at least $71.3 million over three years. While that rate is largely in keeping with comparable fees for such services, analysts say it is hardly discounted.Mr. Geithner said he hired BlackRock because he needed its expertise during the Bear Stearns-JPMorgan negotiations. He said most of the other likely candidates had conflicts, and he had little time to shop around. Indeed, the deal was cut so quickly that they worked out the fees only after the firm was hired.But since then, the New York Fed has given two more no-bid contracts to BlackRock related to the A.I.G. bailout, angering a number of BlackRock’s competitors. The fees on those contracts remain confidential.Vincent Reinhart, a former senior Federal Reserve official, said a more open process might have yielded a better deal for the taxpayers.“They may have been able to convince themselves that this was the only way to go, but it sounds to me like nobody stepped back and said, ‘What’s this going to look like to the outside world,’” he said.As Mr. Geithner runs the Treasury and administration officials signal more bailout money may be needed, the specter of bailouts past haunts his efforts.He recently weathered a firestorm over retention payments to A.I.G. executives made possible in part by language inserted in the administration’s at the Treasury Department’s insistence. And his new efforts to restart the financial industry suggest the same philosophy that guided Mr. Geithner’s Fed years.According to a recent report by the inspector general monitoring the bailout, Neil M. Barofsky, Mr. Geithner’s plan to underwrite investors willing to buy the risky mortgage-backed securities still weighing down banks’ books is a boon for private equity and hedge funds but exposes taxpayers to “potential unfairness” by shifting the burden to them.The top echelon of the Treasury Department is a common destination for financiers, and Mr. Geithner has also recruited aides from Wall Street, some from firms that were at the heart of the crisis. For instance, his chief of staff, Mark A. Patterson, is a former lobbyist for Goldman Sachs, and one of his top counselors is Lewis S. Alexander, a former chief economist at Citigroup.A bill sent recently by the Treasury to Capitol Hill would give the Obama administration extensive new powers to inject money into or seize systemically important firms in danger of failure. It was drafted in large measure by Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm that represents many banks and the financial industry’s lobbying group. Mr. Geithner also hired Davis Polk to represent the New York Fed during the A.I.G. bailout.Treasury officials say they inadvertently used a copy of Davis Polk’s draft sent to them by the Federal Reserve as a template for their own bill, with the result that the proposed legislation Treasury sent to Capitol Hill bore the law firm’s computer footprints. And they point to several significant changes to that draft that “better protect the taxpayer,” in the words of Andrew Williams, a Treasury spokesman.But others say important provisions in the original industry bill remain. Most significant, the bill does not require that any government rescue of a troubled firm be done at the lowest possible cost, as is required by the F.D.I.C. when it takes over a failed bank. Treasury officials said that is because they would use the rescue powers only in rare and extreme cases that might require flexibility. Karen Shaw Petrou, managing director of the Washington research firm Federal Financial Analytics, said it essentially gives Treasury “a blank check.”One year and two administrations into the bailout, Mr. Geithner is perhaps the single person most identified with the enormous checks the government has written. At every turn, he is being second-guessed about the rescues’ costs and results. But he remains firm in his belief that failure to act would have been much more costly.“All financial crises are a fight over how much losses the government ultimately takes on,” he said. And every decision “requires we balance how to achieve the most benefits in terms of improving confidence and the flow of credit at the least risk to taxpayers.”'"
"'09-04-27,'0','Already, for example, the worst-case sales forecast that G.M. predicted in December has become its working assumption.People with knowledge of the company’s planning say that figure is expected to drop again, especially since G.M. announced deep production cuts last week.On March 30, G.M. told the Treasury Department that it expected industry sales this year of 10.5 million vehicles, and that sales could drop to 9.5 million under the worst of conditions. (The industry sold 13.8 million vehicles in 2008, an 18 percent decline from 2007.)That 10.5 million figure was what G.M. predicted as its worst-case situation on Dec. 2, when its expectations were that American auto sales for the industry in 2009 would be 12 million vehicles.Now, its new forecast might be closer to 10 million vehicles, say people familiar with its plans.That is two million less than its working assumption in December, and 3.8 million fewer cars and trucks than the industry sold in 2008.G.M. officials declined to comment on their new projections.“Until we have a formal viability plan filed with the government, it’s not something we want to discuss in any detail,” John McDonald, a G.M. spokesman, said last week.The only agreement among industry analysts is that sales this year will be dismal. Autodata predicts auto sales in the United States this year will reach 10.5 million, the same as G.M.Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car buying advice, predicts the market will be around 10.8 million sales this year, while Brian Johnson, a veteran analyst with Barclays Capital, expects sales of 11 million vehicles. Any of the forecasts would make this year the worst in nearly three decades.Last month, Treasury hired the Boston Consulting Group to prepare its own market forecast for the next few years.David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said automakers had been surprised at how dismal the car market had been, despite efforts by the administration to make credit more widely available.“Nobody has realized how deep this trough has been,” Mr. Cole said. “There are forces at play that make it almost impossible to predict where this thing is headed.”Given G.M.’s track record, Mr. Cole said it might be wise for the company to underestimate the car market, sending a signal to the administration that it has learned its lesson.“It is a lot better to exceed a forecast,” he said, “than not live up to it.”Plotting G.M.’s future may force forecasters to become far more creative. For years, auto companies have based their projections on reliable economic data, like employment, consumer sentiment, housing starts and the rate at which consumers were scrapping old vehicles.But erratic fuel prices and the economic crisis have made it difficult to rely on statistics that were accurate in the past, said Mr. Pinelli of Autodata.“Since time began, forecasting methods didn’t change — now, change is a given,” he said. For G.M., “a lot has happened since December.”'"
"'09-04-27,'0','Now, even hotels that restricted pets in the past want to market themselves as pet-friendly. To attract their share of animal lovers, some hotels are taking out ads on Web sites like Petswelcome.com, Dogfriendly.com, and Petfriendlytravel.com.Petswelcome.com, where travelers book pet-friendly hotels online, draws about 120,000 unique visitors a month, according to Chris Kingsley, who started the site in 1997.Hotels pay a per-property fee of $150 annually to be listed on the site, with a bulk discount for chains listing multiple properties. More than 30 chains advertise on the site, including Best Western, Holiday Inn, La Quinta, Motel 6 and Red Roof Inn.Mr. Kingsley’s own dog, Smudge, a Bracco Italiano, weighs about 90 pounds, and to his chagrin would be turned away by many of his advertisers. “Why would you advertise yourself as pet-friendly if you just accept pets up to 15 pounds?” he asked.At BringYourPet.com, where hotels pay $399 for each property annually, the site’s owner, Derek Welsh, also discourages limits.“If your weight limit is 15, you need to raise that or have no limit,” said Mr. Welsh, whose golden retriever, Bogey, weighs about 100 pounds. “All you’re really doing is cutting your own throat by not accepting larger pets.”Still, pet policies are evolving and hard to pin down.The operator on a reservation line to the Plaza Hotel in New York, for example, said the hotel accepted dogs only up to 25 pounds, but Lori Holland, a spokeswoman for Fairmont Hotels, which owns the Plaza, subsequently said the company was planning to end weight restrictions chainwide.Bill Wood, executive editor of the 2009 edition of “Traveling With Your Pet: The AAA PetBook,” which lists more than 13,000 pet-friendly hotels and campgrounds, is more sympathetic to the restrictions.“One of the issues is how much fur the animal is going to shed, which affects the cleanup costs and the smell in the room,” Mr. Wood said. “And if the pet were to have an accident, obviously that’s in proportion to their size as well.”All but four of the 720 La Quinta hotels accept pets, and, shortly after saying in a phone interview that most of the hotels set a weight limit at 40 pounds, a hotel spokeswoman, Teresa Ferguson, wrote in an e-mail message that the limit had been lifted.At Best Western, about 1,900 of its 4,000 hotels worldwide accept pets, with some setting weight limits as low as 12 pounds, and Troy Rutman, a Best Western spokesman, attributed the split to the chain’s hotels being individually owned.“There are some strong feelings on the other side, people who genuinely feel like they don’t want to stay in hotels that accept pets because they find that it’s noisy or they don’t want to share elevators with dogs,” Mr. Rutman said. “Not everyone’s a pet lover.”But Steve Pinetti, a senior vice president at Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, bristles at weight restrictions.“For me to say we are pet-friendly but we do not take pets over 100 pounds would be like saying, ‘I’m in the hotel business but I don’t take anyone over 200 pounds,’ ” Mr. Pinetti said. “It’s kind of bogus.”Some other chains are trying to ramp up services, creating perks aimed at pets.The W Hotels chain markets itself as dog-friendly, offering room service for dogs and “Yappy Hours” — mixers open to nonguests and their dogs. (The chain has a weight restriction, generally 40 pounds, but Carlos Becil, a W Hotels vice president, said the policy was flexible, and in place partly to prompt guests to broach the subject and reserve a big enough room for larger breeds.).Loews Hotels have no weight limit, said Emily Goldfischer, a spokeswoman.The company’s pet-friendly promotions include dog “learning vacations,” like Su’ruff Camp at Loews Coronado Bay in California, where dogs staying at the hotel learn to surf.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','Big companies in Detroit have mostly opted to part with their hometown. When the Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier once part of G.M., filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005, it went to New York. The Kmart Corporation took its bankruptcy hearing to Chicago in 2002.With the Treasury Department directing Chrysler to prepare to file for bankruptcy protection as early as this week as part of a deal to sell assets to Fiat, and with G.M. operating under a June 1 deadline to come up with a viable plan or file bankruptcy itself, location choices could be made quickly.Detroit’s six bankruptcy judges have adopted a rule that could appeal to both the automakers’ management and the Obama administration. They will allow the chief bankruptcy judge to pick who will oversee a giant corporate filing, rather than leaving the selection to chance.Last week, Michigan’s attorney general sent G.M. a letter urging it not to go out of state.“I am gravely concerned about the impact of any bankruptcy filing in a jurisdiction outside Michigan,” Mike Cox, the attorney general, wrote in a letter to G.M.’s chief executive. Because the company’s headquarters, many of its plants and hundreds of thousands of current and former employees are in Michigan, Mr. Cox continued, “any potential bankruptcy filing outside the state of Michigan seems bizarre.”The choice of courthouse can have serious implications for interested parties, said David A. Skeel, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.The law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and judges in some places may be more or less sympathetic to the bankrupt company, its creditors, its employees and other affected groups. By deciding in December that the chief judge could pick who would hear a G.M. case — or a Chrysler case, for that matter, or any other “very large, complex case of national significance” — Detroit’s six judges created the opportunity for the selection of a specific judge with particular views. Previously, cases were assigned at random.Given the likely controversy over any G.M. reorganization plan, bondholders and other creditors may be worried about the prospect of facing a judge chosen because he is friendly to the company and the administration instead of their interests.Professor Skeel said that the Third Circuit, which includes Delaware, had an established court opinion that makes it harder to redo a collective bargaining agreement, a likely sticking point in a G.M. case.“That makes Delaware a little less attractive” to the company, Professor Skeel said.On the other hand, he said, the Detroit court is a bit of a “wild card,” having given few signals in substantial cases there of how it would resolve complex issues.Judges in any jurisdiction would want a crack at overseeing a G.M. reorganization, said Douglas G. Baird, a law professor at the University of Chicago. “It’s like climbing Mount Everest,” he said, of the sense of accomplishment that could come from all the hard work.G.M. is not tipping its hand. Greg Martin, a company spokesman, responded to the letter from the Michigan attorney general by saying that the company remained focused on restructuring outside of bankruptcy.“However, if GM is not able to complete the actions required, it will have no other alternative than to pursue an in-court restructuring, and we would be prepared to do so,” Mr. Martin said in an e-mail message. “The filing location would be just one of many factors we would need to take into account.”Still, courthouse clerks in Detroit are buzzing, and security guards are bracing themselves.In a meeting this month, clerks throughout the Detroit federal court system were told there was no indication whether or when G.M. might file its case in Detroit, according to a clerk who attended but declined to give her name. They were also told that the court would probably get several days’ notice that a filing was imminent.Even if they cancel later, companies make an appointment to drop off boxes of legal documents in a major bankruptcy case.There would be practical challenges to a filing in Detroit. For one thing, there is not a lot of space. The federal bankruptcy court is housed in a 27-story office building at 211 West Fort Street, across from the federal courthouse that also is home to a branch of the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.The bankruptcy court rooms, on its upper floors, have floor to ceiling windows with sweeping views of downtown Detroit, the Detroit River and Windsor, Ontario, beyond. The courtrooms have adjacent work rooms for use by lawyers — but probably not enough to handle the hordes that would want them for the nation’s largest bankruptcy filing.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','The All-Star shortstop Hanley Ramirez scored 369 runs in the previous three seasons, nine more than Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, whose annual salary is nearly the same as the Marlins’ season payroll.The Marlins’ bullpen stitched together 24 consecutive scoreless innings before the streak came undone last week. The team’s leadoff hitter, Emilio Bonifacio, has been timed from home to first in 3.65 seconds.The Marlins’ starting rotation, the youngest in the league, is making up for lost time. Johnson, Ricky Nolasco and Anibal Sanchez were ready to rock the majors in 2007, but in the course of the season the 25-year-old Johnson had Tommy John surgery on his throwing arm; Nolasco, 26, sustained an inflamed right elbow; and Sanchez, 25, had shoulder surgery. Already in 2009 the rotation has been visited by injury, with the fifth starter, Andrew Miller, 23, put on the 15-day disabled list last week with an oblique strain.In their most recent starts, Johnson pitched seven scoreless innings against the Phillies; Nolasco lasted six innings at Pittsburgh; and Sanchez went seven against the Pirates. Johnson, who has gone at least six innings in his four starts, allowed five hits and one run in a complete-game victory against the Mets on April 12.Johnson is 9-1 since his return last July from his injury, which he described Friday as “a blessing in disguise.” He explained that he shed 30 pounds from his 6-foot-7 frame during his rehabilitation. “I feel like I’m a lot more athletic,” he said. “My core is a lot stronger, my lower body is a lot stronger, my shoulder feels stronger and I feel like I can go deeper in games without tiring.”Volstad has a temperament that never seems to overheat. John Baker, the Marlins’ baby-faced catcher, remembered the Mets experiencing early success against Volstad at Shea Stadium last fall in his final start of the season. They had runners on second and third with one out when, Baker said, he visited Volstad on the mound.“He smiled and said, ‘Who would have thought we’d be here at Shea on its last weekend?’ and we had a little laugh,” Baker said. “He’s very good about being in the moment.” Volstad went six innings in that game, a 6-1 victory. The 84-win Marlins went on to eliminate the Mets from the playoff race.The 2009 Marlins remind many of the 2003 team that was powered by three starting pitchers — Beckett, Brad Penny and Dontrelle Willis — who were 24 or younger on opening day. That team also had speed on the basepaths, and its arms and legs carried it to the franchise’s second World Series championship, beating the Yankees in six games.The Achilles’ heel of the Marlins, then as now, was the bullpen. The 2003 squad got by with Chad Fox, Braden Looper and Ugueth Urbina. Over the weekend, a parade of Marlins relievers blew two ninth-inning leads at home against the Phillies.On Friday, the anointed closer, Matt Lindstrom, yielded seven runs in the ninth on four hits, the cruelest of which was a grand slam by Shane Victorino, in a game that included 1,540 dogs among the 29,032 spectators as part of a promotion, Bark at the Park Night. Afterward, Lindstrom, a former Met, said it was embarrassing. He meant his performance, not the presence of all those pooches during the first South Florida appearance by the defending World Series champion Phillies.The next night, Leo Nunez and Renyel Pinto failed to preserve a 4-3 lead in the ninth, and Logan Kensing yielded two runs on four hits in the 10th to seal another defeat in front of a Dolphin Stadium crowd of 26,412.Like the Phillies and the Mets before them, the Marlins may be destined for a new stadium. After years of trying, the City of Miami and the Miami-Dade Commission approved the project. One detail remains a long way from being determined: Will they have a banner from 2009 to hang in it?'"
"'09-04-27,'0','“We want Iceland as soon as possible to join the European Union and adopt the euro,” she said. She added brusquely, “I should emphasize that this is a priority issue for the Social Democrats.”That appeared to be a challenge to the Left-Greens and their leader, Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, a former truck driver and geologist with hard-left views who has served as finance minister since the caretaker coalition took office in January.The Left-Greens’ reluctance to join the union is based on fears, widely shared in Iceland, that the country would lose control of its exclusive fishing waters off its coasts and of its other natural resources. It is an issue that has deep resonance in a country that has fashioned its national consciousness around a tradition of gritty independence and an ability to survive in one of the world’s toughest natural environments.The party’s resistance to European Union membership has translated into an insistence on a drawn-out procedure that would have Icelanders approve any entry application in a referendum first, and then have a second referendum on entry terms agreed on with Brussels. The Social Democrats have insisted on a simpler and potentially much faster route, with an application for entry within weeks, and a single referendum on whatever terms are negotiated.Mr. Sigfusson, the Left-Greens’ leader, has hinted that his party may compromise on the referendum issue to keep the coalition together, while retaining the option of campaigning against European Union entry when the issue comes to a vote.As early election returns became known Saturday night, Ms. Sigurdardottir appeared to tighten the screws on Mr. Sigfusson by noting, in an interview on the state television network, that there would be “a parliamentary majority” in favor of European Union entry — a pointed reminder that the Social Democrats could turn to other pro-European Union parties for approval of the single-referendum formula if the Left-Greens tried to block it.At the Saturday news conference, Ms. Sigurdardottir said her aim would be to seek to replace the battered krona with the euro within four years, the duration of the parliamentary term she secured in the election, assuming there was no new political crisis. The krona is currently trading at 40 percent and more below its value before the economic collapse, just one measure of a crisis that has seen Iceland plunge since last fall from giddying prosperity to widespread unemployment. Inflation is running above 15 percent, and mounting state debt in the wake of October’s banking collapse has left the government with foreign debts approaching $10 billion.Ms. Sigurdardottir said that with European Union membership, Iceland, “the first country to have an economic crisis on this scale,” would also be the first to emerge. But she also said how “difficult” it would be to meet the demand from the International Monetary Fund for a one-third cut in the government’s annual budget within three years — one of the terms of a $2.1 billion emergency loan that helped keep Iceland afloat, together with $3.1 billion in loans from other Nordic countries, after the country’s three biggest banks collapsed and were nationalized last fall.A cut of that severity in the government’s expenses, the prime minister said, would be hard to make while protecting the unemployed, pensioners and other underprivileged groups — precisely the constituency Ms. Sigurdardottir, the daughter of a prominent labor leader, made her own during her years as the country’s minister of social affairs. She hinted that the I.M.F. terms might be eased or offset by European Union assistance once Iceland was able to show it was committed to stabilizing its economy and paying its debts.In the meantime, she said, the act of applying for European Union membership would create new confidence in Iceland abroad, helping to speed economic recovery.Commentators in Iceland have given high ratings to Ms. Sigurdardottir’s performance in her 80 days in office, and in the election campaign, saying she has steadied the country’s faltering self-confidence in the wake of the banking collapse and turbulent January street protests, the first political violence in Iceland since protests over the country’s decision to join NATO in 1949.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','You would expect a program with a name like “Puppy Mills: Exposed” to be full of gruesome sights, and it is. But perhaps the most dismaying moment in it is, at first glance, benign and trauma free: it shows a chocolate Labrador retriever walking in a circle. Only when you realize that the animal, which was rescued from a wretched breeding mill in Pennsylvania, is doing nothing but walking in a circle does the implication sink in. The dog was caged for so long that this is all it knows how to do.“Puppy Mills,” an episode of “Animal Cops: Philadelphia” having its premiere Monday on Animal Planet, spends much of its time detailing a raid last year at Limestone Kennel in Lancaster County, Pa., where the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals found almost 90 dogs living in conditions that more than justify the “viewer discretion” warning at the beginning of the program.Such operations exist to churn out puppies that can be sold to brokers, who then pass them along to pet stores and other outlets. They are a long way from a Norman Rockwell world where happy dogs romp in the yard and give birth once a lifetime; instead the mills view dogs merely as “puppy-producing machines,” as Bob Baker, an investigator for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, puts it.“They’re just bred incessantly in horrendous conditions,” he says bluntly, “and as soon as they don’t come into heat regularly, they take them out and shoot them.”The program acknowledges but doesn’t explore in depth the great contradiction in all this: while puppy mills are turning out dogs at an assembly-line pace, animal shelters are swamped and can’t give their dogs away. A perfunctory written comment from a Pennsylvania breeders’ association is read, but the program would have benefited from some reasoned discussion between breeders and rescuers. Instead it concentrates on shock value — necessary, probably, for calling attention to the problem, but leaving the viewer feeling as if there’s another, less horrific side to the subject.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','A tax-evasion case involving the Swiss bank UBS and 52,000 of its wealthy American clients is turning into a diplomatic chess game.The president of Switzerland, Hans-Rudolf Merz, has asked Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to drop a lawsuit led by the Justice Department seeking to force UBS to turn over the clients’ names, Daniel Haener, a Swiss government official in New York, said on Sunday.Under Swiss bank secrecy laws, disclosing clients’ names is a criminal offense that can carry prison terms and large fines.Switzerland instead is proposing to negotiate a new tax treaty with the United States that would make possible such disclosures in the future. However, the treaty would not apply to the clients in the continuing case. The current treaty, signed in 1996, does not require Switzerland to disclose clients’ names, and the United States is eager for a new treaty that does. Formal talks on a new treaty are scheduled to start on Tuesday.For its part, the Justice Department is unlikely to scale back or drop its case against UBS, according to a senior person briefed on the matter. The agency “is not going to give in,” this person said on Sunday.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','On Sunday night, the Jets confirmed contact with Burress’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus. General Manager Mike Tannenbaum said in a statement: “Consistent with our normal approach of performing our due diligence, we contacted Drew Rosenhaus several days ago, prior to the draft, to inquire about Plaxico’s pending legal situation. However, we have had no discussions with Drew about Plaxico since that time.”After swapping their first- and second-round picks along with three players to move up 12 spots with the Browns for the right to pick a franchise quarterback prospect in Sanchez on Saturday, Tannenbaum made another swap to begin Day 2 of the draft.This one was a three-for-one trade with the Lions, allowing the Jets to move up 11 spots and select the Iowa first-team all-American tailback Shonn Greene with the first pick of the third round. Detroit sent that 65th overall selection to the Jets in exchange for third-, fourth-, and seventh-round selections.“We felt the value of Shonn was too much to pass up,” Tannenbaum said. “That’s why we went up a second consecutive time. That was not our plan. But we just felt it was a compelling opportunity.”Thomas Jones topped the American Football Conference in rushing last season with 1,312 yards, but he has been a no-show for the voluntary off-season workouts. It is believed that he wants to renegotiate his contract.Tannenbaum denied that the Greene pick had anything to do with the situation, saying, “Thomas will be here.”If Greene lives up to the advertising, he could be an eventual heir to the 30-year-old Jones’s starting job since the dynamic Leon Washington has not been viewed as an every-down back.Greene, a 5-foot-11, 227-pound back from Sicklerville, N.J., is a punishing, between-the-tackles type. He lacks great speed, but he rushed for Iowa records of 1,850 yards and 20 touchdowns last year after being forced to leave the university for his junior year because he was academically ineligible. “This is a special talent — great vision,” Coach Rex Ryan said, comparing his vision to that of the former Jet Curtis Martin.“He’s got starter ability. We want to run the football. This guy gives us that kind of ground and pound that we’re looking for. We’re going to have three great backs.”Sanchez had flown overnight from California with several family members and his agent, David Dunn, to be here for a meet-the-news-media introduction. He said that no one should sweat over his arm strength at the Meadowlands. “Deceptively strong,” Sanchez said. “Don’t worry about the wind.”Dunn and Sanchez said no one should worry about a contract holdout. “Our group hasn’t been involved in a quarterback holdout for over a decade,” Dunn said.'"
"'09-04-27,'0','Already, for example, the worst-case sales forecast that G.M. predicted in December has become its working assumption.People with knowledge of the company’s planning say that figure is expected to drop again, especially since G.M. announced deep production cuts last week.On March 30, G.M. told the Treasury Department that it expected industry sales this year of 10.5 million vehicles, and that sales could drop to 9.5 million under the worst of conditions. (The industry sold 13.8 million vehicles in 2008, an 18 percent decline from 2007.)That 10.5 million figure was what G.M. predicted as its worst-case situation on Dec. 2, when its expectations were that American auto sales for the industry in 2009 would be 12 million vehicles.Now, its new forecast might be closer to 10 million vehicles, say people familiar with its plans.That is two million less than its working assumption in December, and 3.8 million fewer cars and trucks than the industry sold in 2008.G.M. officials declined to comment on their new projections.“Until we have a formal viability plan filed with the government, it’s not something we want to discuss in any detail,” John McDonald, a G.M. spokesman, said last week.The only agreement among industry analysts is that sales this year will be dismal. Autodata predicts auto sales in the United States this year will reach 10.5 million, the same as G.M.Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car buying advice, predicts the market will be around 10.8 million sales this year, while Brian Johnson, a veteran analyst with Barclays Capital, expects sales of 11 million vehicles. Any of the forecasts would make this year the worst in nearly three decades.Last month, Treasury hired the Boston Consulting Group to prepare its own market forecast for the next few years.David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said automakers had been surprised at how dismal the car market had been, despite efforts by the administration to make credit more widely available.“Nobody has realized how deep this trough has been,” Mr. Cole said. “There are forces at play that make it almost impossible to predict where this thing is headed.”Given G.M.’s track record, Mr. Cole said it might be wise for the company to underestimate the car market, sending a signal to the administration that it has learned its lesson.“It is a lot better to exceed a forecast,” he said, “than not live up to it.”Plotting G.M.’s future may force forecasters to become far more creative. For years, auto companies have based their projections on reliable economic data, like employment, consumer sentiment, housing starts and the rate at which consumers were scrapping old vehicles.But erratic fuel prices and the economic crisis have made it difficult to rely on statistics that were accurate in the past, said Mr. Pinelli of Autodata.“Since time began, forecasting methods didn’t change — now, change is a given,” he said. For G.M., “a lot has happened since December.”'"

The second is the potential for an unfriendly welcome abroad, as some countries begin to look askance at anyone with the sniffles who shows up at their borders.Although swine flu cases have now been confirmed in seven countries, and possible cases are being investigated in several more, the focus for Americans remains overwhelmingly on the possible dangers of traveling in Mexico. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans forgo all “nonessential travel” there (wwwn.cdc.gov/travel), and travel companies are giving breaks to travelers who want to cancel reservations.Many airlines, including American, Continental, Delta, JetBlue, United and U.S. Airways, have relaxed their ticketing policies for travel to Mexico so that passengers who had trips scheduled can postpone them or change plans without change fees or penalties. Hotels, including Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, and online travel agencies like Orbitz.com said they would waive penalties for canceling or changing hotel reservations in Mexico.Some nations, particularly in Asia, are tightening their borders and immigration controls, and American travelers, along with Mexicans, are finding themselves objects of suspicion. Health officers at three Japanese airports were being deployed Tuesday to check passengers before they got off flights from Mexico, Canada and the United States. Travelers suspected of having the flu would be quarantined and examined further at medical facilities, news agencies reported, citing the Japanese health minister.'"

Instead, she took her case to national news outlets and became a heroine to supporters of online freedom. An Internet campaign raised about $15,000 for her defense.The industry eventually dropped its suit against the mother. But it filed a new one against two of her children, Michelle and Robert, ages 20 and 16 at the time.'"
"'09-04-28,'0','“The iPhone turned AT&T into a serious competitor now neck-and-neck with Verizon,” he said. If Verizon gets a contract to sell the iPhone, he said, “it will be another major shift.”Jeffrey Nelson, a spokesman for Verizon Wireless, declined to comment on whether Verizon and Apple were talking. An Apple spokeswoman said that the company was “very happy” with its relationship with AT&T.“AT&T is a very good partner,” said the spokeswoman, Natalie Kerris. “We have no plans to change the relationship.”She declined to comment on discussions between Apple and Verizon Wireless.In a recent quarterly conference call with investors, Tim Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, cast some doubt on the prospect of an imminent deal with Verizon. He said that Apple was wary of building a phone for a network using C.D.M.A. technology — which Verizon’s current network uses — because, Mr. Cook said, the C.D.M.A. infrastructure may have a short life span.Verizon, however, is moving to a new network in 2010 that would not rely on C.D.M.A technology. Verizon has said previously that even as it deploys its new network, it plans to retain its C.D.M.A. network for a time to transmit voice communications.The person who had been briefed on discussions between Verizon and Apple said that it was not out of the question that Apple could build an iPhone for the current network.Apple has not publicly disclosed the financial terms of its deal with AT&T or the duration of its exclusive deal, which began in 2007. Some industry analysts say they believe the arrangement ends in 2010.Mark Siegel, a spokesman from AT&T, said the company was thrilled with its partnership with Apple. But he had no comment on the company’s own discussions with Apple about extending its arrangement. He said he had no comment on the discussions between Verizon and Apple.AT&T’s most recent financial quarter showed the influence of the phone on its business. During that first quarter, AT&T said it activated 1.6 million new iPhones — more than 40 percent of them new to AT&T. During that period, AT&T had 1.2 million overall net subscriber additions, indicating that iPhones made a considerable impact on the company’s ability to grow, Mr. Entner said.“Without the iPhone, their performance in the first quarter would have been worse than T-Mobile’s,” Mr. Entner said.Verizon has done fine without the iPhone. It added 1.3 million customers in the first three months of the year, though many came from its acquisition of Alltel. Revenue rose 30 percent to $15.1 billion in the first quarter.Verizon Communications, which owns Verizon Wireless in a joint venture with Vodafone, reported Monday that its net income grew 5 percent in the first quarter to $3.21 billion, or 58 cents a share, from $3.05 billion, or 57 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose almost 12 percent to $26.6 billion.Doing business with Apple does carry a cost. Ed Snyder, an analyst with Charter Equity Research, said that AT&T has spent around $2 billion to subsidize the cost of the iPhones — selling them to consumers well below what it pays Apple for the phones. AT&T does not get a share of revenue from the iPhone App Store.Further, Mr. Snyder said, the phones put heavy stress on the AT&T network because iPhone users tend to send and receive data more heavily than users of other phones.That heavy use has its upside. Mr. Entner said that the typical iPhone user generates for AT&T around $85 in revenue a month, 40 percent more than users of other phones.“It’s been a net plus,” Mr. Snyder said of AT&T’s relationship with Apple. “But it’s been more of a mixed blessing than most people view it as.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','The central question before the court, though, is this: Did Congress overstep its constitutional power in 2006 by reauthorizing Section 5 of the act, which requires states and localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal permission before making changes to their voting procedures?“Obama inexorably shapes how we understand Section 5 today,” Professor Katz said, adding that the court should take the unusual step of finding a way to force Congress to take a fresh look at the law, which expires in 2031.Theodore M. Shaw, a law professor at Columbia and a former president of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., said the court should not place too much weight on a single election. “We’ve had a profound moment, and we’re in a different place,” Professor Shaw said. “But race still plays powerfully in electoral politics in this country. If it weren’t for the Voting Rights Act, there would be no President Obama.”The act was a triumph of the civil rights movement. It took on, as the Supreme Court said in upholding it in 1966, the “insidious and pervasive evil” of state officials defiantly committed to denying blacks the right to vote.At the act’s heart is Section 5, which requires state officials to get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before they make even minor changes to voting procedures. Such federal intrusion into state affairs through “preclearance” rather than subsequent litigation was needed, the Supreme Court said in 1966, to address “unremitting and ingenious defiance of the Constitution” by state officials.The court has repeatedly upheld the act. Just last month, even as it limited another part of the law, three relatively conservative justices in the majority acknowledged that more work was needed to ensure equal access at the polls.Some state officials, mostly in the South, bristle at what they say is the stigma, burden and federal intrusion that come with being covered by Section 5.Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama, a Republican, conceded in a friend-of-the-court brief that his state’s racist policies had earned it a place on Section 5’s original coverage list. “Through acts of violence and willful defiance of federal law,” Mr. Riley told the court, “Alabama maintained an all-white legislature and 19 percent black voter registration in 1965.”Today, though, he said, black and white voter registration rates are virtually identical — 72.9 percent for blacks and 73.8 percent for whites. And a quarter of the state legislators are black, almost exactly reflecting the state’s population.In extending the Voting Rights Act in 2006, Mr. Riley said, “Congress wrongly equated Alabama’s modern government, and its people, with their Jim Crow ancestors.”Besides Alabama, Section 5 applies to Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas; most of Virginia; counties and townships in California, Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina and South Dakota; and three New York City boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx. The act requires federal permission before making changes in voting procedures like how registration is conducted, where polling places are put, how elections are publicized and where the boundaries of voting precincts are drawn.Most changes are minor, but redistricting or wholesale revisions of election laws can require complicated, expensive and time-consuming submissions.A supporting brief urging the court to uphold the law filed by six states at least partly subject to the preclearance requirement said the minor burdens were offset by benefits including expert guidance in avoiding discrimination, less litigation and better race relations. The law also allows jurisdictions with clean records to ask a court to let them “bail out” of the preclearance requirements.The jurisdictions subject to Section 5 were selected based on whether they had used devices to discourage voting, like literacy tests, and data from the 1964, 1968 and 1972 elections. Congress did not tinker with those decades-old criteria when it renewed in 2006.The question before the Supreme Court is not whether the criteria were optimal but whether Congress acted beyond its constitutional authority in using them.There are arguments on both sides. On the one hand, Congressional power is at its peak in the areas of race and voting. On the other hand, the federal intrusion under Section 5 is unique in American legal history.The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the Voting Rights Act and its earlier extensions. But a 1997 decision in a religion case, City of Boerne v. Flores, may require the court to subject the latest extension to more exacting scrutiny than it has in the past, one that asks not only whether legislation was a rational response to constitutional violations but also whether it was “congruent and proportional” to them.The case before the court was brought by a Texas utility district that was established on undeveloped land in the late 1980s. The district said it had never been accused of voting discrimination. Lawyers for the district told the court that the current Voting Rights Act “treats racism as an inheritance that runs with the land rather than a manifestation of attitudes and actions of living individuals.”The crucial vote on the court will probably be that of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. In another voting rights case decided last month, Bartlett v. Strickland, Justice Kennedy indicated that he might oppose eliminating Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.“Racial discrimination and racially polarized voting are not ancient history,” he wrote. “Much remains to be done to ensure that citizens of all races have equal opportunity to share and participate in our democratic processes and traditions.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','Under Ohio law before Atkins, capital juries would weigh retardation along with other mitigating factors against aggravating factors in deciding on the proper sentence.The jury recommended a death sentence without indicating what role the evidence about retardation had played in its decision, and the trial judge accepted that recommendation.Last year, a unanimous panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, said prosecutors had “litigated and lost the issue of petitioner’s mental retardation” and may not now reopen it. The court ordered that Mr. Bies be “resentenced to receive a sentence other than death.”But Justice David H. Souter said the Atkins decision had left states free to decide for themselves how to determine whether capital defendants were retarded. That meant, Justice Souter said, that the earlier statements may not have answered the question posed by Atkins.Before Atkins, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, prosecutors had little incentive to fight hard about retardation in cases where the balance of sentencing factors tilted heavily against the defendant.“When the prosecutor wants to go for the death penalty and it thinks it’s got a secure case on the atrocious manner in which the crime was committed,” Justice Ginsburg said, “there isn’t the same incentive to litigate as there is when it is the ultimate question.”After Atkins, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that lawyers for death row inmates who claim to be retarded must prove three things at a new hearing: that their clients have “significantly sub-average intellectual functioning,” that they lack fundamental social and practical skills, and that both conditions existed before they turned 18. The court added a presumption that a defendant is not retarded “if his or her I.Q. is above 70.”Mr. Blume said those factors had already been established. Benjamin C. Mizer, Ohio’s solicitor general, said prosecutors should be allowed to offer evidence on those points at a new hearing at which “I.Q., among all the other elements of the mental retardation, will be up for determination.”Justice Souter said Mr. Blume was asking the court to create a “brand new rule” that “a subsidiary fact determination” in a case the defendant loses can be used as a defense in a later proceeding,“We have never held this,” Justice Souter said, “and I don’t know of any court that’s ever held this.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','By pitching from a windup with the bases loaded, Pettitte helped Ellsbury, because the motion slowed Pettitte down. When Pettitte moved his right foot to begin his windup, Ellsbury was more than halfway down the line. When the ball left Pettitte’s hand, Ellsbury was about 20 feet from home and was half-lunging and half-stumbling for the plate.“The biggest thing is getting the courage to go, I guess,” Ellsbury said. “In that situation, bases loaded, you’ve got to make it. It could be one of the worst base-running mistakes if you don’t make it, but I was pretty confident that I could get in there.”In a nationally televised game, Ellsbury’s straight steal of home was the first by a Red Sox player in 15 years. There were 15 steals of home last season, but only one of them was a straight steal in which there was no indication of a squeeze play and no other runners tried to steal, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. That steal was by Omar Vizquel.With one blitz of roughly four seconds, Ellsbury captivated the Red Sox fans and made two Yankees look stale. Pettitte said he noticed Ellsbury, but he did not act that way. He threw a breaking ball. Catcher Jorge Posada caught Pettitte’s pitch as if it were any other pitch in the game, not with an urgency to make a tag. Ellsbury’s steal gave the Red Sox a 3-1 lead in a game they won, 4-1.Yogi Berra, who was on the wrong end of Jackie Robinson’s memorable steal of home during the 1955 World Series, said Don Larsen stopped working from the windup with a runner on third because of Robinson’s speed. Fifty-four years later, Ellsbury probably made sure that Pettitte will eschew the windup, too.“The bottom line is that I didn’t run through my windup fast enough to get the ball home fast enough obviously to get him,” Pettitte said.Reyes loves stutter-stepping up and down the line to distract pitchers and has twice caused pitchers to balk. But, before Reyes can mimic Ellsbury, he might have to convince his teammates that stealing home is worthwhile.In Saturday’s game against the Washington Nationals, Reyes was on third, Carlos Beltran was on second and Carlos Delgado was batting. As Reyes did his usual jitterbug to try to unnerve pitcher Daniel Cabrera, Delgado called time out and stepped out of the batter’s box. It seemed as if Delgado, not Cabrera, was most distracted by Reyes.Two weeks ago, Reyes promised that he would try to steal home before his career ended. After Ellsbury’s snazzy play, Reyes was even more enthralled with the idea. When Reyes was told that Ellsbury was one steal ahead of him, he predicted that he was due for a bold burst.“I’m going to get one,” he said. “You’ll see me.”'"

Romero has filed a lawsuit against a nutritional supplement manufacturer arguing that an unlisted ingredient in one of its products caused him to test positive for a substance banned by Major League Baseball.In the suit filed Monday in Superior Court in Camden County, N.J., Romero said Ergopharm and Proviant Technologies was negligent in manufacturing 6-OXO and 6-OXO Extreme, the nutritional supplements he took, and that it misrepresented their ingredients.Also named in the suit are Vitamin Shoppe and General Nutrition Centers, stores where Romero said he bought the over-the-counter supplements in July. He said employees at each store recommended the supplements and assured him that using them would not lead to a failed drug test.Romero was suspended for the first 50 games of this season. He is eligible to return on June 2, barring any Phillies games’ being postponed.Braves pitcher Tom Glavine said he felt better about his ailing left shoulder after throwing in the outfield Monday, but he still is not sure if he will be able to extend his career.Glavine, 43, stopped throwing for two weeks after his shoulder began hurting during a minor league rehabilitation start. He threw in the outfield before Sunday’s game at Cincinnati, then withstood a more strenuous test — two sets of 15 throws from 70 feet — before the opener of a three-game series against St. Louis.“I feel O.K.,” Glavine said. “I’m definitely making some progress. I’m not going to sit here and say I’m 100 percent pain-free, but I’ve made progress.”Lance Berkman hit his 20th home run at Great American Ball Park, the most by any visiting player, and Hunter Pence hit a tie-breaking double in the ninth inning, leading Houston to a 4-1 win at Cincinnati.The Astros won their 10th straight at Great American Ball Park, a streak that started near the end of the 2007 season and is the longest in the majors.Berkman has more career homers (46) and runs batted in (127) against Cincinnati than any other team.Dexter Fowler tied a modern-day rookie mark with five stolen bases as host Colorado won, 12-7, against San Diego. Fowler became the first rookie to steal that many bases since Damian Jackson on June 28, 1999.The game was halted in the sixth inning when Brad Hawpe was hit in the neck by San Diego catcher Nick Hundley’s throw to second. Hawpe was taken off the field in a cart and then to a hospital with a possible concussion.Ryan Howard and Raul Ibanez each hit a grand slam, rallying host Philadelphia to a wild 13-11 victory against Washington, the Phillies’ fourth straight win. ...

"'09-04-28,'0','Now, hotel room prices reflect a rat’s nest of published rates, available-for-the-asking rates, negotiated rates, and rates for rooms slipped to discounters because the hotel did not want to advertise that they were being sold at fire-sale prices.Most travelers comparison shop for hotels online. But Tom Botts, a partner at the travel adviser Hudson Crossing, said that until recently, accurate comparisons were difficult because online booking agencies disguised their service fees.Typically, Mr. Botts said, once a person booking the reservation accepts the listed room rate on the first screen and then clicks through to make the reservation, that person assumes that “taxes and fees” are “just the regular occupancy taxes that would be due to a local municipality or state,” rather than a combination of taxes and the booking agency’s service fee.Last week, Orbitz, one of the major online travel bookers, announced that it had temporarily reduced its service fees for hotel bookings and that those fees would now be clearly labeled at the start of the reservations process. The initiative — which Orbitz believes will differentiate it from its online competitors — will be in effect through July 15, Orbitz said.Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Expedia, said that Expedia’s prices “are and will continue to be competitive with Orbitz” and that because Expedia does so much volume “oftentimes we’re able to negotiate better rates with lodging supply partners, which likely makes any change in Orbitz’s booking fee irrelevant.”With travel in a deep slump and hotels hurting as badly as airlines, reducing booking fees — the estimate was that Orbitz had shaved about $7 off its prices — was seen in the industry as a risky strategy to grab a share of a shrunken market. But openly labeling its fees was definitely a good move from a consumer’s viewpoint.Last week, the market research company PhoCusWright said that revenue in the online leisure and unmanaged business travel booking market would decline 3 percent this year, to $93 billion. That is the first such year-on-year decline since PhoCusWright began tracking that market in 1998.So these are tough times for suppliers. On the other hand, though, it’s a great time to buy travel. On Monday, for example, my wife booked a business trip from Newark to New Orleans in May for $199 round trip, and one from Newark to San Juan round trip in June for $254 on Continental — which is also giving double elite-qualifying miles for each trip. In both cases, those fares are about 40 percent cheaper than what she would have paid a year ago.Mr. Botts said the new disclosures of hotel booking fees can save travelers some money.“The question is, will consumers get it?” he said. “Because up until now consumers have paid no attention to these charges because people just assumed it as a tax, and there was nothing negotiable about it.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','This time could be different. Even assuming the Mexican flu strain is no more deadly, it comes at a fragile moment. The financial crisis and resultant economic contraction is already taking heavy casualties on the businesses and economies most dependent on trade, transportation, tourism and lodging, which are most susceptible to the flu bug.Moreover, governments are managerially challenged, with bank bailouts and huge stimulus packages to finance. A severe flu epidemic would open another front. After SARS, much was learned about epidemic control. For the sake of the global economy, this had better be a flu that can be easily contained.China is warming to gold. Its reserves agency has increased holdings of the precious metal by 75 percent over the last six years. The gold bugs think Beijing sees inflation coming and the dollar sliding and wants to own something solid. But don’t bet on a Chinese gold rush.The authorities certainly aren’t comfortable holding about $1.4 trillion of their $2 trillion in reserves in dollar-based assets. Large American fiscal deficits, partly financed by printing money, add to the discomfort. The central bank governor has already wished for a nonsovereign currency to replace the dollar as the global monetary lingua franca.For now, gold could be the next best thing. But China, even after its latest increase, has just 1.6 percent of its foreign currency reserves in gold, far less than the 10 percent average held by other major economies, according to the World Gold Council. To get to even half of that, which would start to make gold a meaningful part of its mix of reserve assets, China would need to collect 5,575 more tons. That is 19 months’ worth of the world’s new supply. After subtracting steady demand for gold in jewelry and manufacturing, it is more like a decade’s worth of the remaining available supply.Yet any push by China to get to the 10 percent level depends on gold’s price, and therein lies a conundrum. The more China purchases, the more the price will be forced up, even if the government embarks on a midsize buying spree. That would reduce the value of diversification.China may have other reasons for not wanting to lift the price of gold. America holds 80 percent of its foreign currency reserves in gold, the largest of any country. A higher price would make America richer, on paper at least. A tenfold rise in the gold price would be enough to cancel out America’s entire $2.5 trillion foreign net debt.China is probably not eager to risk wasting some of the reserves it earned from years of lucrative exports on a spending spree that would inflate a potentially unsustainable gold-price bubble. That would amount to a back-door bailout of the United States — the country whose profligate consumption it has partly financed. ROB COX and JOHN FOLEY'"
"'09-04-28,'0','DETROIT — Daimler of Germany said on Monday that it had agreed to divest its remaining 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler, ending an ordeal that began with a stunning 1998 merger but went sour.Daimler will pay $600 million into Chrysler’s pension plan over three years. It also will forgive loans that it made to Chrysler when it sold 80.1 percent of that automaker to the private equity business Cerberus Capital Management in 2007.The deal gives complete ownership of Chrysler to Cerberus before a deadline on Thursday from the Obama administration for Chrysler to form an alliance with the Italian automaker Fiat or risk having to file for bankruptcy.Chrysler’s hourly workers are voting this week on a cost-cutting deal reached Sunday that would clear one obstacle for the company. Those workers also are considering a buyout offer that would pay them to give up their jobs. The window for the buyouts had been scheduled to close Monday but has been extended until May 25, Memorial Day, so workers will know whether the company is in bankruptcy.Fiat is expected to take a considerable stake in Chrysler, under the framework of a partnership the two companies reached last month. Chrysler, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., would gain access to Fiat’s technology and small-car platforms and would allow Fiat to re-enter the United States market, which it abandoned in 1983.Daimler said that it had already written off the loans it is forgiving, but that unloading Chrysler would reduce its earnings by $700 million in the second quarter.Daimler executives said they were creating a “merger of equals” when Daimler paid $36 billion to unite with Chrysler, but the deal was seen in Detroit as a takeover of Chrysler.'"

"'09-04-28,'0','There have been blacks and American Indians in Sag Harbor since the 19th century, Mr. Colson explained on a foggy, drizzly afternoon last week. Many worked in the whaling industry and settled in the town’s Eastville neighborhood. Starting in the ’30s, black people from the city began coming out, and in the ’40s, thanks largely to the efforts of a woman named Maude Terry, the three subdivisions of Azurest, Sag Harbor Hills and Ninevah were created on land along Sag Harbor Bay as a summer community for African-Americans.As Mr. Whitehead spoke, Sag Harbor did not seem particularly summery. The yachts were still up on cradles, mothballed in white plastic. There was plenty of parking, and the seasonal restaurants had yet to open, including Big Olaf’s, the ice cream shop where Mr. Whitehead worked as a teenager. Peering through the window, he noticed that a waffle press had replaced the “medieval contraption” that he used to man in the window, where everyone could stare at him. Next door, what used to be a roller disco had turned into a theater. The corner shop where his pals and the local white teenagers used to compete for precious time on the Space Invaders video game has become a natural-food store.Mr. Whitehead is tall and thin, with long dreadlocks pulled back in a leather barrette. He walks and talks quickly and covered the half-mile or so from the town wharf out to Azurest at a near lope. Many of the houses were still buttoned up for the winter, lawn furniture stacked on concrete patios. There were bungalows and ranch houses from the ’50s and ’60s, some with new additions, some with roofs mossy from neglect. Here and there, on lots that Mr. Whitehead recalled as woods, or on the sites of cottages that had been torn down, were new, modern-looking houses that suggested a level of mortgage undreamed of by the doctors, lawyers and Harlem schoolteachers who originally settled the neighborhood.Mr. Whitehead pointed out the airy beachfront house where his mother now lives year-round, and the red and white cinder block saltbox, still owned by his aunts. It was built by his maternal grandfather, who owned a chain of funeral homes in Orange, N.J., and hauled the building material out every weekend in his car. In back is a small white wood-frame cottage where, according to legend, W. E. B. Du Bois once spent the night.Du Bois, or his idea of “double-consciousness,” is an unspoken presence in “Sag Harbor,” in which the characters see themselves as the embodiment of paradox — “black boys with beach houses” — and are aware both of their privilege and of the ever-present white gaze. Mr. Whitehead grew up on the Upper West Side and went to mostly white private schools. He wasn’t interested in sports and preferred to read, collect comics and watch television. He imagined that he might someday make a living by writing about werewolves. But even in middle-class neighborhoods back then, he recalled, young black men felt singled out, and Azurest came to seem a kind of refuge. “But because you come out here, safe in the middle class, you start acting out as you get older,” he said. “You don’t feel authentic. It’s not only true of upper-middle-class black kids, but look at white kids in the suburbs, listening to gangsta rap.”After college, Mr. Whitehead stopped going out to Sag Harbor much. “It was too bourgie,” he said. But seven or eight years ago he started visiting again, and the idea for “Sag Harbor” came to him one day when he was standing on the beach. “I was trying to point out some people I had grown up with, and I realized it wasn’t a simple story,” he said. “That’s the guy who used to beat me up. That’s the guy who stopped coming out for a while because it turned out his father had another family in Cincinnati.” Mr. Whitehead went home to Brooklyn and, though he was supposed to be working on “Apex Hides the Hurt,” began writing about Sag Harbor.“I think I just didn’t know how to do a first-person book until now,” he said. “After about 10 pages, I always shifted into jaded hipster speak.” He added: “I also think I wasn’t old enough to figure out a way to talk about my childhood. I didn’t have the tool kit — didn’t know what to keep, what to get rid of. If I could have achieved this voice earlier, I would have. I’m pretty fond of it.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','Dr. deMaynadier found frogs, salamanders and damselflies that thrive only where fish are absent. Given the apparent rarity of fishless lakes — the department knew of just 30 among Maine’s 6,000 lakes — he recommended a moratorium on stocking them, pending further study.The department enlisted Cynthia Loftin, an associate professor of wildlife ecology at the University of Maine, to find and do research on the lakes. Dr. Loftin and her students spent five years finding fishless lakes the hard way: poring over topographical maps, following hunches, and packing inflatable rafts and gill nets high into the mountains and far into the backwoods. Then they learned to apply biology and technology to find them faster.They found an association of six invertebrates, including several beetles and a midge that swim boldly in open water, that is found only in fishless lakes. Using the bugs as indicators (they gathered them in glow-stick-baited traps), they could quickly assess which lakes were fishless. And they could analyze sediments from lakes with fish, painstakingly searching for mandibles of the phantom midge, to see if the lakes had once been fishless.Dr. Loftin’s team then determined the physical features of fishless lakes — like smallish size and steep outlets — and used geographic modeling to find other fishless lakes. The modeling predicted that 101 of 3,281 appropriately sized lakes in likely areas would be fishless.The researchers visited 21 of the lakes, set gill nets and found that 15 contained fish. But sediment sampling showed that nine were once fishless.In a report to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Dr. Loftin and her colleague Emily Schilling estimated that 107 Maine lakes were historically fishless, and that half now contained fish. The agency is writing a policy for managing fishless lakes.The impact of stocked trout on mountain yellow-legged frogs has prompted research on fishless lakes in California. And with international concern about amphibian declines, fishless lakes have been receiving more attention elsewhere. Dr. Schilling, an assistant research professor at the University of Maine, is now coordinating a broad analysis of fishless lakes, incorporating research from the United States, Europe and South America.Mark McPeek, a professor at Dartmouth College, has studied fishless lakes in Michigan, Florida and New England. In a telephone interview, he said they were fast disappearing. A decade ago, Dr. McPeek often visited a fishless lake on a steep bluff above the Connecticut River in Vermont. “All of the zooplankton, all of the insects, all of the amphibians that bred there were completely different than the lake with fish that’s half a mile down the road,” he said. But somebody has since stocked it with carp. “Now this lake is just ruined,” Dr. McPeek said.Dr. Loftin said there was a continuum of fishless waters, with seasonally flooded vernal pools on one end and fishless lakes on the other. She said the lakes might act as refuges for some species as the climate changes. “It could be that these lakes serve as a sort of insurance policy,” she said, by providing breeding areas in times of drought.'"
"'09-04-28,'0','Older people who believe that memory loss goes hand in hand with aging may be undermining their own performance, a new study says .Researchers found that when older volunteers took a series of cognitive tests after being given hints that their age might affect the results, they did less well. The study, which appears in Experimental Aging Research, was led by Thomas M. Hess of North Carolina State University.The researchers worked with about 100 adults in two age groups, 60 to 70 and 71 to 82. Participants were asked to do a series of tasks involving arithmetic and memorization.For some test-takers, the researchers set out to plant in their minds the idea that their age might affect their performance. They told them the test was being used to examine the effects of age on memory. They also asked the volunteers to write down their age right before taking the test.The study found that members of this group did worse than those in the other group. This was especially the case for the 6o- to 70-year-olds.The explanation may be that these participants, newly getting used to the idea of being “older,” were more susceptible to suggestions that their age might make them do worse, the researchers said.'"
"'09-04-28,'0','It helps that the dozens of veiled and uneducated female laborers who assemble the handmade items — gag balls, lime-green corsets, thonged spanking skirts — have no idea what the items are used for. Even the owners’ wives, and their conservative Muslim mother, have not been informed.“If our mom knew, she would disown us,” said Adnan, seated on a leopard-print fabric covering his desk chair.“Due to cultural barriers and religion, people don’t discuss these things openly,” Rizwan said. “We have to hide this information.”Even customs officials were perplexed at how to tax the items, not quite sure what they were, they said.Recently, when a curious employee inquired about the purpose of the sleep sack, a sleeping bag-like product used in certain kinds of bondage, she was told it was a body bag for the American military in Iraq.Adnan Ahmed, a former air traffic controller who is now AQTH’s chief operating officer, said the items were undergarments. When asked if he considered a red-hot puppy mask an undergarment, he had a straightforward, but honest reply: “No. It’s just for joking.”Still, word of the business has at times escaped. Last year four “powerful guys” from a conservative Muslim group threatened to burn down the factory if it was not closed within a week. The brothers calmly explained that it was merely a business, and that the items were not used in Pakistan. The next day they bribed a local Islamic political organization to ensure their safety.These days, the gravest danger is Pakistan’s crumbling economy. The brothers idolize former President Pervez Musharraf, crediting their success to his industry friendly policies, like not requiring export licenses and banning trade unions. When Mr. Musharraf resigned last year, the brothers “didn’t eat for three days,” Adnan Qadeer said.Since President Asif Ali Zardari took office, Adnan said, trade unions have been legalized and prices of some raw materials, including leather, have shot up, as have interest rates. The result: a 15 percent dip in AQTH’s profits.Echoing the pervasive fears of entrepreneurs across the country, the brothers are considering relocating to East Asia if Pakistan becomes more unstable — or if they receive another threat.The shoddy factory seems like an ode to their humble upbringing. Adnan’s executive bathroom has no toilet paper. Rizwan has no office. And their preferred lunch is Kentucky Fried Chicken.Their inspiration for success came from their father, a civil servant who supported a family of six with a $150 monthly salary. While other children were forced into labor, or played aimlessly, the Qadeer brothers had to study.In 2001, after the brothers graduated from a university, their father lent them $800, enough to purchase their first computer and to cover several months of rent on a studio apartment. There, the brothers searched the Internet day and night for a high-value garment product that was not widely available.They experimented with basic leather goods, like jackets and pants. Adnan slept at mosquito-infested stitching factories to oversee sample runs that, in the end, proved more costly than their Chinese competitors.“It was very hard time,” Adnan said. “We had nothing in our pockets, not even money to fuel our motorbike.”Rizwan said: “People used to say: ‘You can’t do business in Pakistan. You’re wasting your time. Just go get a job.’ ” But our father boosted our morale.”The brothers said Pakistan’s “stone-age production” worked to their advantage. The country, they said, lacks visionary product development. “Everyone’s still making the same products,” Adnan said.Then, they discovered a kind of straitjacket online. At first, they thought it was used for psychiatric patients, but it quickly led them to learn about the lucrative fetish industry.Without family connections in the finance industry, and with nothing to mortgage, they were refused a loan by four banks. “Our education was our only connection,” Rizwan said.They finally secured a loan from an American bank, and then the Sept. 11 attacks offered a timely chance. Orders for garment exports were canceled across Pakistan in the slower economic climate, allowing the prices of raw materials like leather to be cut in half.But fear after Sept. 11 raised suspicions among their own Western clients. On Sept. 12, 2001, a customer sent an e-mail message with a photo of two F-16s flying over Pakistan. Orders were canceled.Today, they sell their products to online and brick-and-mortar shops, and to individuals via eBay. Their market research, they said, showed that 70 percent of their customers were middle- to upper-class Americans, and a majority of them Democrats. The Netherlands and Germany account for the bulk of their European sales.“We really believe that if you are persistent and hard working, there is an opportunity, in any harsh environment, even in an economically depressed environment like Pakistan,” Rizwan said.A major perk, they say, is attending international fetish shows to see how their products hold up in action.“I go to Sin City every year,” said Rizwan, referring to Las Vegas in a sheepish laugh. It’s all business, he said. “Clients know our country and culture, and they don’t invite us to participate. We’re a little bit shy.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','The increase in mortality risk tied to the higher levels of meat consumption was described as “modest,” ranging from about 20 percent to nearly 40 percent. But the number of excess deaths that could be attributed to high meat consumption is quite large given the size of the American population.Extrapolated to all Americans in the age group studied, the new findings suggest that over the course of a decade, the deaths of one million men and perhaps half a million women could be prevented just by eating less red and processed meats, according to estimates prepared by Dr. Barry Popkin, who wrote an editorial accompanying the report.To prevent premature deaths related to red and processed meats, Dr. Popkin suggested in an interview that people should eat a hamburger only once or twice a week instead of every day, a small steak once a week instead of every other day, and a hot dog every month and a half instead of once a week.In place of red meat, nonvegetarians might consider poultry and fish. In the study, the largest consumers of “white” meat from poultry and fish had a slight survival advantage. Likewise, those who ate the most fruits and vegetables also tended to live longer.Anyone who worries about global well-being has yet another reason to consume less red meat. Dr. Popkin, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, said that a reduced dependence on livestock for food could help to save the planet from the ravaging effects of environmental pollution, global warming and the depletion of potable water.“In the United States,” Dr. Popkin wrote, “livestock production accounts for 55 percent of the erosion process, 37 percent of pesticides applied, 50 percent of antibiotics consumed, and a third of total discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus to surface water.”A question that arises from observational studies like this one is whether meat is in fact a hazard or whether other factors associated with meat-eating are the real culprits in raising death rates. The subjects in the study who ate the most red meat had other less-than-healthful habits. They were more likely to smoke, weigh more for their height, and consume more calories and more total fat and saturated fat. They also ate less fruits, vegetables and fiber; took fewer vitamin supplements; and were less physically active.But in analyzing mortality data in relation to meat consumption, the cancer institute researchers carefully controlled for all these and many other factors that could influence death rates. The study data have not yet been analyzed to determine what, if any, life-saving benefits might come from eating more protein from vegetable sources like beans or a completely vegetarian diet.The results mirror those of several other studies in recent years that have linked a high-meat diet to life-threatening health problems. The earliest studies highlighted the connection between the saturated fats in red meats to higher blood levels of artery-damaging cholesterol and subsequent heart disease, which prompted many people to eat leaner meats and more skinless poultry and fish. Along with other dietary changes, like consuming less dairy fat, this resulted in a nationwide drop in average serum cholesterol levels and contributed to a reduction in coronary death rates.Elevated blood pressure, another coronary risk factor, has also been shown to be associated with eating more red and processed meat, Dr. Sinha and colleagues reported.Poultry and fish contain less saturated fat than red meat, and fish contains omega-3 fatty acids that have been linked in several large studies to heart benefits. For example, men who consume two servings of fatty fish a week were found to have a 50 percent lower risk of cardiac deaths, and in the Nurses’ Health Study of 84,688 women, those who ate fish and foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids at least once a week cut their coronary risk by more than 20 percent.Choosing protein from sources other than meat has also been linked to lower rates of cancer. When meat is cooked, especially grilled or broiled at high temperatures, carcinogens can form on the surface of the meat. And processed meats like sausages, salami and bologna usually contain nitrosamines, although there are products now available that are free of these carcinogens.Data from one million participants in the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition trial found that those who ate the least fish had a 40 percent greater risk of developing colon cancer than those who ate more than 1.75 ounces of fish a day. Likewise, while a diet high in red meat was linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer in the large Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial, among the 35,534 men in the study, those who consumed at least three servings of fish a week had half the risk of advanced prostate cancer compared with men who rarely ate fish.Another study, which randomly assigned more than 19,500 women to a low-fat diet, found after eight years a 40 percent reduced risk of ovarian cancer among them, when compared with 29,000 women who ate their regular diets.'"
"'09-04-28,'0','His success reflects the perseverance and improvisational spirit of the oil and fishing villages in lower Plaquemines Parish, an isolated, rural county that was ravaged in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. Recovery is far from complete along this peninsula, where the Mississippi River runs to the Gulf of Mexico. A nearby FEMA trailer park remains open for a dozen families, some coffins still await reinterment and the thin population grows increasingly vulnerable to storms because of coastal erosion.Still, there is a resiliency here perhaps most visibly evident in sports performance. South Plaquemines, with an enrollment of 208 students who have defiantly nicknamed themselves the Hurricanes, won the 2007 and 2008 state football championship in Class 1A and is seeking the 2009 state track championship.Sprint training on a grass surface is not uncommon in some places. Usain Bolt of Jamaica, now the world’s fastest man, began his career on a grass track with curves and lanes etched into the ground with tar. South Plaquemines has none of that meager formality, only a football field that is not kept manicured in the spring.The consolidated school, formed in 2006, attracts students from the devastated communities of Port Sulphur, Buras and Boothville-Venice. Before Katrina, the county had a worn all-weather track south of here at a sports complex at Fort Jackson, a Civil War battle site. But the storm inundated lower Plaquemines with 20 feet of water, scouring the rubberized running surface to its cracked asphalt base. Now, the football field must suffice.There is at least one advantage to training on grass, said Cyril Crutchfield, the football and track coach at South Plaquemines who is also Sylve’s stepfather. “It helps prevent shin splints,” Crutchfield said. “The only disadvantage I see is that we can’t get his technique fundamentally sound. No matter how hard he works, we can’t simulate the curve.”So Crutchfield improvises. Using hurdles and cones as a boundary, he roughly approximates a curve in one end zone so that Sylve and his teammates can run 200-meter repeats. To rehearse starts in the 100, Crutchfield hammers a set of blocks into the earth at the goal line.Sprinting is not simply a matter of speed but also a function of strength and endurance. The Hurricanes do extensive weight training. During winter and summer conditioning for track and football, they run repeats of 200, 500 and 800 meters, along with sets of 300-meter hurdle runs. Most of the year they also do exhausting, hamstring-burning runs up and down the steep 16-foot levee that contains the Mississippi.South Plaquemines sits on a narrow spit of land, not a half-mile wide, along Highway 23. The Mississippi flows on one side of the highway and the marsh and the gulf on the other. In enervating half-hour workouts, the Hurricanes hop up and down the river levee on one leg, then the other. They prong up and down on both legs. They run sideways. They crabwalk. They carry teammates on their backs, running forward and backward. Sometimes they jump miniature hurdles to increase the degree of difficulty.“Running the levees is where I think I get all my strength,” Sylve said. “Carrying people up and down, that helps.”His biological father, Eddie Ray Jackson, was a sprinter and all-state running back at Vidalia High School in north Louisiana, and from 1987 to 1990 played with Brett Favre at Southern Mississippi. But Sylve’s own career nearly ended as a varsity eighth grader, when he felt intimidated by some of the state’s fastest sprinters. Last spring, as a freshman, his confidence began to blossom with his speed. He won a state 100 title in a wind-aided 10.60 and took the 200 in 21.85.“I knew it could be my ticket to college,” Sylve said.Last fall, playing mostly receiver, Sylve caught 45 passes for 1,174 yards, scoring 13 touchdowns from scrimmage and returning four kicks for touchdowns. In the championship game, he scored twice on runs as South Plaquemines set a state record for points, defeating Christian Life Academy of Baton Rouge by 62-16.“He’s about as fast a kid as I’ve seen in high school football, and I’ve seen a lot at every level,” said Warren Capone, the Christian Life coach who was a star linebacker at Louisiana State in the 1970s and played briefly in the N.F.L.Sylve, too, would like to play football at L.S.U. Some track enthusiasts believe he should concentrate on sprinting and try to make the Olympics. Eventually, he may play both sports in college. But football is king on the bayou.Increasingly, schools are seeking football players who happen to be sprinters, instead of sprinters who are attempting to play football. Florida, for example, won the 2008 national championship with a freshman tailback named Jeffrey Demps, who set a national high school record at 100 meters (10.01) last June at the Olympic track trials.“I try to convince Bradley that he’s a football player who has track speed,” Crutchfield said. “It’s easy to find 10 guys who run 10.3. It’s a lot harder to find 10.3 guys who are football players.”Like many young sprinters, Crutchfield said, Sylve must become more serious about training and continue to polish his start, taking a longer first stride with his right leg, while driving his left knee forward instead of upward. In February, a searing prelim start at the state indoor championships produced a time of 6.31 seconds for 55 meters, the third-fastest ever run in Louisiana.“In football, the more experience he gets, he’ll grow by leaps and bounds,” Crutchfield said of Sylve. “Track is going to take a little longer. Realistically, you don’t go from 10.5 to 10.2 right away. The main thing is that he stays patient.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','“We’ve seen these kind of effects with outbreaks before,” said Richard Purkiss, a drug sector analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. “Generally speaking, you get a rally in stocks that have any kind of links to influenza.”Airline and travel companies fell sharply as the European Union urged Europeans not to travel to the United States, where some 40 cases of swine flu have been confirmed, including 28 in New York City, one of the biggest travel hubs and tourist destinations in the country.Shares of Continental, Delta and the parent companies of American Airlines and United Airlines were all down by double-digit percentages. The huge cruise operator Carnival fell 13.5 percent on worries about the outbreak’s potential effect on tourism to Mexico and other destinations.If the outbreak spreads rapidly and nervous travelers decide to stay home, airlines already struggling to endure the economic slump could suffer another setback during their peak summer months, said Hunter K. Keay, an airline analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. Mr. Keay said he was still more concerned about airlines’ longer-term problems, but said investors seemed shaken up on Monday.“They’re drawing conclusions that if this outbreak does turn into an epidemic, it would have an impact on travel,” he said.Companies that make pork products and slaughter hogs were also hurting. Hormel, the maker of Spam, and the pork producer Smithfield Foods fell after countries including Lebanon, Thailand and Indonesia imposed restrictions on pork imports, raising fears that countries would hastily build trade barriers as they rush to contain the disease.Health officials in the United States, the National Pork Producers Council and hog producers scrambled to reassure the public that people could not contract swine flu by eating pork.Still, hog futures fell to their lowest price in a year, and an analyst at JPMorgan Chase downgraded Smithfield and Tyson Foods on Monday. Despite the lack of a link between pork consumption and swine flu, “the fear generated by a disease named after hogs cannot be good for pork consumption,” the analyst, Kenneth Goldman, wrote in a note.The price of longer-term Treasury debt rose, a sign of more defensive behavior by investors and a response to an announcement that the Federal Reserve had bought $7 billion in Treasury debt. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 22/32, to 98 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 2.91 percent from nearly 3 percent late Friday.But declines in the United States turned into a rout in Mexico, the center of the outbreak, where 149 people have died and more than 1,300 have probably been infected. The Mexican Bolsa stock index dropped more than 3 percent, the peso fell 4 percent against the dollar, and shares of Mexican food companies, retailers and transportation companies dropped sharply.Elsewhere in financial markets, investors pushed shares of General Motors 20.7 percent higher to $2.04 after the automaker said it needed an additional $11 billion from the government and was prepared to file for bankruptcy if a proposed exchange of debt for equity did not succeed.General Motors said it was also planning to close more plants and dealerships and eliminate its Pontiac brand as it tries to turn itself around and end quarter after quarter of billion-dollar losses.Following are the results of Monday’s Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills and two-year notes:'"
"'09-04-28,'0','Portfolio, the ambitious, glossy business magazine from Condé Nast Publications, closed Monday after just two years. Joanne Lipman, editor in chief, and Tom Wallace, editorial director of Condé Nast, met with editorial staff members and announced that the magazine and its Web site, Portfolio.com, were shutting down, effective immediately.Most of the $100 million pledged toward the start-up is gone, sunk into the very expensive printing, paper, marketing and editorial costs that go with creating a magazine, especially one published by Condé Nast. The now-folded magazine may be the last of a breed, an attempt by a Manhattan media company to build a large magazine franchise from the ground up.Senior executives at the company made the decision to close Portfolio last Friday. Ms. Lipman was told to go to the office of S. I. Newhouse at 8:30 a.m. Monday, where he told her. William Li, the publisher, met with the business staff at 9:30, and Ms. Lipman met with her staff at 9:45 and delivered the news. According to people who were there, she was frank in her disappointment at the closing and lavish in her praise. She ordered lunch in for staff members, who were told that they would be permitted to return to their offices until Thursday. In all, approximately 85 people will lose their jobs.The fact that the April issue, published at a time of maximum business tumult, featured a cover shot of Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska and unsuccessful candidate for vice president, seemed to etch the perils of executing business journalism on a monthly schedule during an era when financial scoops are often measured in seconds. Mr. Wallace, editorial director of Condé Nast, said that Ms. Lipman, who had been criticized during her tenure for odd cover decisions, “was the right editor for Portfolio and created a magazine that Condé Nast was proud to publish.”In a phone call, Ms. Lipman cited Portfolio’s accomplishments, including a National Magazine Award for its “Briefs” section. “I’m tremendously proud of the magazine and the talented people who worked here,” she said. “We were ahead of the financial crisis, we broke news, and the staff has done exactly what we set out to do.”'"
"'09-04-28,'0','In , where the only related deaths have been reported, state health authorities looking for the initial source of the outbreak toured a million-pig hog farm in Perote, in State. The plant is half-owned by Smithfield Foods, an American company and the world’s largest pork producer.Mexico’s first known swine flu case, which was later confirmed, was from Perote, according to Health Minister José Ángel Córdova. The case involved a 5-year-old boy who recovered.But a spokesman for the plant said the boy was not related to a plant worker, that none of its workers were sick and that its hogs were vaccinated against flu.American officials said their response to the epidemic was already aggressive, and the W.H.O.’s decision to raise its pandemic alert to level 4 from level 3 would not change their plans. Level 4 means that there has been sustained human-to-human transmission.The W.H.O. decision offered some official guidance to a world that, at least for the day, seemed swept by confusion that unnerved international travelers and the financial markets. European and Asian markets fell, and stock in airlines and the travel industry fell while those in pharmaceutical companies rose.Pharmacies in New York reported runs on , an antiflu drug — a reaction that public health officials badly want to avoid because the drug could eventually be needed for the truly ill.For now supplies of Tamiflu and Relenza, another antiflu drug, remain adequate, the manufacturers said, but both were increasing production and expressed that shortages could develop if governments placed huge orders.The travel issue was the most confusing. On Monday morning, the appeared to issue and then rescind a ban on travel to the , drawing a rebuke from American officials, who themselves later suggested that Americans drop all nonessential travel to Mexico.The number of deaths in Mexico for which flu is believed responsible climbed to 149. That includes 20 in which the swine flu virus has been confirmed as the cause.The number of confirmed cases of the virus in the United States increased to 50, with 28 of them from one school. None of the American cases have been serious, but Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he “would not rest on that fact.”“I expect that we will see additional cases, and I expect that the spectrum of disease will expand,” he said at a news conference.Asked why the W.H.O. had waited so long to raise its alert level, Dr. Fukuda said it was done on technical grounds, that there was evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new virus and movement of that virus to new areas. But he conceded that “the committee is very aware that changes have quite significant political and economic effects on countries.”The W.H.O. has no power to enforce any policies on member states, but different countries may have their own pandemic flu plans that are triggered by changes in the alert level.and became the first places outside to confirm cases. Suspected cases appeared in , , and , but confirmation is slow because most nations’ laboratories lack the test kit the C.D.C. is developing for the new virus.The C.D.C. began sending out the new kits on Monday, meaning that soon some states and foreign countries will be able to make their own diagnoses — a development that could lead to a sharp increase in confirmed cases.Confusion regarding ’s position on travel arose when the European Union’s health commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, was questioned on a visit to and said Europeans “should avoid traveling to Mexico or the United States unless it’s very urgent.”Early reports of those remarks led both Dr. Besser and Mayor of New York City to publicly disagree.“We don’t think there is any reason not to travel and come to New York,” the mayor said. “But they have to do what they think is right.”Ms. Vassiliou’s office later denied she had issued any travel advisory and said she was only offering her personal opinion. “She didn’t want to insinuate risk where we’re not sure,” a spokesman said, adding that formal advice would be offered later.Mayor Bloomberg confirmed that there were now 28 cases in New York, all connected to St. Francis Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, . He said there had been no suspected cases in any of the city’s intensive-care units. He acknowledged an increase in emergency-room visits, but he said his preliminary information indicated that there were more people who were worried rather than seriously ill.New York’s public health situation does not now resemble ’s, the mayor said, and the public does not need to don masks.In Europe, a spokesman for the -based European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said there were about 40 suspected cases beyond the confirmed case in Spain.The United States pork industry continued to try to allay consumer concerns about their products. Many companies and hog farmers complained that the “swine flu” name was unfortunate and perhaps inaccurate because, so far, the virus appeared to be spreading without any contact with pigs.“I guess everything has got to have a name,” said Kyle Stephens, who raises show pigs in , Tex. “The biggest thing we are up against is people thinking the worst, instead of checking into it more.”'"

"'09-04-28,'0','There have been blacks and American Indians in Sag Harbor since the 19th century, Mr. Colson explained on a foggy, drizzly afternoon last week. Many worked in the whaling industry and settled in the town’s Eastville neighborhood. Starting in the ’30s, black people from the city began coming out, and in the ’40s, thanks largely to the efforts of a woman named Maude Terry, the three subdivisions of Azurest, Sag Harbor Hills and Ninevah were created on land along Sag Harbor Bay as a summer community for African-Americans.As Mr. Whitehead spoke, Sag Harbor did not seem particularly summery. The yachts were still up on cradles, mothballed in white plastic. There was plenty of parking, and the seasonal restaurants had yet to open, including Big Olaf’s, the ice cream shop where Mr. Whitehead worked as a teenager. Peering through the window, he noticed that a waffle press had replaced the “medieval contraption” that he used to man in the window, where everyone could stare at him. Next door, what used to be a roller disco had turned into a theater. The corner shop where his pals and the local white teenagers used to compete for precious time on the Space Invaders video game has become a natural-food store.Mr. Whitehead is tall and thin, with long dreadlocks pulled back in a leather barrette. He walks and talks quickly and covered the half-mile or so from the town wharf out to Azurest at a near lope. Many of the houses were still buttoned up for the winter, lawn furniture stacked on concrete patios. There were bungalows and ranch houses from the ’50s and ’60s, some with new additions, some with roofs mossy from neglect. Here and there, on lots that Mr. Whitehead recalled as woods, or on the sites of cottages that had been torn down, were new, modern-looking houses that suggested a level of mortgage undreamed of by the doctors, lawyers and Harlem schoolteachers who originally settled the neighborhood.Mr. Whitehead pointed out the airy beachfront house where his mother now lives year-round, and the red and white cinder block saltbox, still owned by his aunts. It was built by his maternal grandfather, who owned a chain of funeral homes in Orange, N.J., and hauled the building material out every weekend in his car. In back is a small white wood-frame cottage where, according to legend, W. E. B. Du Bois once spent the night.Du Bois, or his idea of “double-consciousness,” is an unspoken presence in “Sag Harbor,” in which the characters see themselves as the embodiment of paradox — “black boys with beach houses” — and are aware both of their privilege and of the ever-present white gaze. Mr. Whitehead grew up on the Upper West Side and went to mostly white private schools. He wasn’t interested in sports and preferred to read, collect comics and watch television. He imagined that he might someday make a living by writing about werewolves. But even in middle-class neighborhoods back then, he recalled, young black men felt singled out, and Azurest came to seem a kind of refuge. “But because you come out here, safe in the middle class, you start acting out as you get older,” he said. “You don’t feel authentic. It’s not only true of upper-middle-class black kids, but look at white kids in the suburbs, listening to gangsta rap.”After college, Mr. Whitehead stopped going out to Sag Harbor much. “It was too bourgie,” he said. But seven or eight years ago he started visiting again, and the idea for “Sag Harbor” came to him one day when he was standing on the beach. “I was trying to point out some people I had grown up with, and I realized it wasn’t a simple story,” he said. “That’s the guy who used to beat me up. That’s the guy who stopped coming out for a while because it turned out his father had another family in Cincinnati.” Mr. Whitehead went home to Brooklyn and, though he was supposed to be working on “Apex Hides the Hurt,” began writing about Sag Harbor.“I think I just didn’t know how to do a first-person book until now,” he said. “After about 10 pages, I always shifted into jaded hipster speak.” He added: “I also think I wasn’t old enough to figure out a way to talk about my childhood. I didn’t have the tool kit — didn’t know what to keep, what to get rid of. If I could have achieved this voice earlier, I would have. I’m pretty fond of it.”'"

"'09-04-29,'1','The United States has changed a great deal since the Voting Rights Act was first passed in 1965, but minorities still face significant obstacles in registering to vote and casting ballots. It would be outrageous overreaching — the sort of thing Republicans deride as judicial activism — if the Supreme Court takes away the power of Congress to protect minority voters from harassment and disenfranchisement.On Wednesday, the court is scheduled to hear arguments in a case in which a Texas utility district is challenging Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a significant provision that requires selected jurisdictions across the country to “preclear” new voting rules with the Justice Department or a federal court. Congress adopted the preclearance requirement to prevent the adoption of rules that make it harder for minorities to vote in places that have a history of doing just that. The utility district argues that Congress is exceeding its authority.Congress has broad power to protect minority voters. After the Civil War, the Constitution was amended for the express purpose of authorizing Congress to pass laws to help bring black Americans up to full citizenship — including eradicating the obstacles to voting. In light of the direct mandate of the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment, it is not surprising that the Supreme Court has upheld Section 5 on four separate occasions.Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act most recently in 2006, by a vote of 390 to 33 in the House and 98 to 0 in the Senate. Before that, it conducted an intensive investigation to determine whether the law was still needed. The record of obstacles to minority voting that it developed is incontrovertible.Some of the obstacles minority voters face at the ballot box have gotten significant coverage in the news media. Florida and Ohio made headlines with the roadblocks they put in the way of voter registration drives that have a strong record of signing up poor and minority voters. Other assaults on minority voting rights have attracted little attention. In 2001, the white leaders of Kilmichael, Miss., tried to cancel an election after black citizens became a majority. When the town voted — thanks to the Voting Rights Act — it elected its first black mayor.The election of the first African-American president last year was an undeniable sign of racial progress. But even that breakthrough cannot ensure that legislative districts will not be gerrymandered, voting rolls purged or election procedures modified at the state and local levels in ways that diminish the rights of minorities. For that, as Congress wisely recognized, we still need the Voting Rights Act.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq is falling far behind schedule to create a system to maintain its own military equipment, costing American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars to fill in the gaps, according to a new United States audit.The United States military sees Iraq’s ability to take on such duties as essential for the country to maintain a self-sufficient force after American forces leave at the end of 2011.But the audit, by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction and released Sunday, found a pattern of negligence and shortcomings by the Iraqi military in planning for its basic needs: repairing and maintaining equipment, and supplying troops. The problems include not allocating enough money for logistics operations and failing to provide enough soldiers for training, the audit said.In one case, Iraqi soldiers abandoned a 90-day maintenance training class in March 2008 because they had not been paid in weeks by their units. The report said the Iraqi Army had not yet assigned other soldiers to take a class.The study also faulted the United States military for setting unrealistic training timetables.Initially, the contract costs were put around $208 million to train Iraqis in routine but critical roles. The audit said the contract had ballooned to more than $628 million in part because there was no clear blueprint for the programs, which led to frequent extensions and cost overruns.“The U.S. objective is to achieve greater capacity within the Iraqi security forces as quickly as possible,” said David Warren, assistant inspector general for Iraq reconstruction in Washington. “The fact that these things have occurred on this contract have delayed that. We would have liked to see a greater return on the investment.”'"

The Melody, a luxury cruise liner on its way to Europe from southern Africa, was attacked Saturday about 200 nautical miles north of the Seychelles islands, which are near Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Pirates in speed boats raced up to the ship under cover of darkness and unleashed a volley of automatic gunfire, but security guards on the liner fought them off. The ship made a distress call, and the Seychelles Coast Guard sent an aircraft to locate the pirates, according to a government statement.

But Rodriguez sent Girardi a text message on Tuesday, telling him he was making steady progress.Rodriguez took batting practice off Sergio Mitre in Tampa, Fla., and slid on a sliding mat five times. Girardi has said that sliding would be a final hurdle before Rodriguez gets into games, which could happen this week.“It’s getting fairly close,” Girardi said. “We want to make sure he responds every day, and as I’ve said all along, I don’t want to rush him. I think Alex understands that we need to have him back as close to 100 percent as possible, because we need him to play every day. I know he doesn’t want to go on the D.L. again and have another setback.”PENA TAKES OVER AT THIRD After two errors by Angel Berroa at third base Sunday, the Yankees have used Ramiro Pena there on Monday and Tuesday. Pena made several slick plays Monday, showing the skills that earned him an unlikely spot on the team out of spring training.“The young man has a great set of hands,” Joe Girardi said.Pena, 23, signed with the Yankees in 2005. He had been a shortstop during that time, last playing third in 2004 in his native Mexico. But Pena has quickly learned the quicker footwork required to play third. He has been honing his glovework for years.“Since I was a kid, I liked to catch ground balls,” Pena said. “I was good at it, and every day I did it, I got better. Some people tell me, ‘You make those plays look easy.’ Maybe it’s the way I play. I try to be relaxed and calm. But every ground ball is tough. You have to keep your eyes on the ball all the time.”Pena is a career .258 hitter in the minors, and he started play Tuesday with a .235 average (4 for 17) as a Yankee. That included two singles Monday off the Tigers ace Justin Verlander.The ball from his first hit, off Chris Ray on April 9 in Baltimore, belongs to his parents, who took it back to Mexico after watching Pena play at Yankee Stadium. It is a cherished memento.“I said, ‘Keep that ball with you all the time, don’t put it in a bag,’ ” Pena said. “I didn’t want it lost at the airport.”PITCHERS ADJUST TO SWISHER Nick Swisher opened his Yankees career by reaching base safely in each of his first 17 games, the first player to do that since Matty Alou in 1973, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. But Swisher has been slumping lately.During the season-opening nine-game trip, he hit .429 with 4 homers and 11 runs batted in. Over the next 10 games before Tuesday, he was hitting .179 with no homers and three R.B.I. Swisher said pitchers had adjusted and began throwing him more off-speed pitches.“I’m still battling, scratching out hits here and there,” Swisher said. “It’s just frustrating, because things haven’t been going the way we want them to. You want to get something going so bad, you put a little bit more pressure on yourself. You’ve got to not put pressure on yourself and stay within your game.”'"

Castor Pollux originally bid $15.5 million in March.“The auction today yielded a higher and better offer for the market-making business,” said the trustee, Irving Picard. “The additional consideration that we will receive as a result of the auction will benefit Madoff’s victims.”He said the deal allowed those victims to participate in future earnings of the business.

"'09-04-29,'1','New York City’s longtime finance commissioner, Martha E. Stark, resigned on Tuesday amid a series of official inquiries.In announcing her departure, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered no explanation. But Ms. Stark, 48, in office since 2002 and one of the city’s highest-ranking black officials, has been under scrutiny by the city’s Department of Investigation and Conflicts of Interest Board for her paid service on a private real estate board, her romantic relationship with a former subordinate and the irregular billings of a parking judge married to Ms. Stark’s first deputy commissioner.Through her lawyer, Ms. Stark said she had done nothing wrong, and in a terse resignation letter suggested she had been pushed out.“As I serve at the pleasure of the mayor, I hereby resign,” she wrote. “It has been my great honor to serve” and “I very much appreciate the opportunity.”As recently as several weeks ago, buffeted by questions about her conduct, she sent an e-mail message to her staff saying “rumors of my demise (have been and are) greatly exaggerated!”“Sorry you’re stuck with me,” she continued. “I’m not going anywhere.” She said the mayor had assured her “they want me around for the long haul.”Aides to the mayor and city investigators declined to comment on what in the review of Ms. Stark appeared to have further eroded Mr. Bloomberg’s support for the commissioner.Ms. Stark, whose resignation is effective at the close of business on Friday, will be temporarily replaced by Michael Hyman, deputy commissioner for the Tax Audit, Policy and Enforcement Division. During his 21-year career with the finance agency, he has also served as a senior analyst, director of research, and assistant commissioner for the Office of Tax Policy.A City Hall spokesman said that there was no timetable for naming a new commissioner. The mayor is scheduled to release his latest budget proposal on Friday, but officials said Ms. Stark’s departure would not affect the content or presentation, because decisions had already been made.The finance agency’s 2,300 employees assess the city’s $800 billion worth of taxable property and collect $22 billion in annual tax revenues.“I want to thank Martha for her years of service, and I want to recognize the many reforms that finance developed and implemented under her leadership,” Mr. Bloomberg said.Ms. Stark took her first job in the department in 1990 under Mayor David N. Dinkins. She served as a White House fellow in 1993 under President Bill Clinton and managed youth grants at the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation before joining the Bloomberg administration and becoming, she later said, the longest-serving finance commissioner in 40 years.In recent months, though, questions arose about some of the judgments Ms. Stark had made. In one case, the commissioner had decided to retain the husband of her first deputy commissioner, Rochelle Patricof, as a parking ticket judge even though city investigators had found discrepancies in the time sheets submitted by the husband, Allan J. Patricof.The investigators said he appeared to have billed the city for hours when he was not present and recommended he repay the city $8,645. But Ms. Stark said she had conducted her own review, concluded Mr. Patricof had actually worked the hours he said he had, and found no wrongdoing. Last month, after several news reports, Ms. Stark said the agency would no longer use Mr. Patricof as a judge to avoid any appearance of conflict.Around the same time, Ms. Stark faced new disclosures that she had been paid more than $134,000 in 2006 and 2007 for service as a board member of the Tarragon Corporation, a large housing builder and property owner not doing business in the city, a level of outside activity generally frowned upon by city regulations. Ms. Stark, who said she believed she had clearance from city officials for the outside work, agreed to resign from the board and Mr. Bloomberg praised her at the time for the “40, 50, 60 hours a week” he said she routinely spent working for the city.Two weeks ago, The New York Post reported that Ms. Stark was romantically involved with a former subordinate, Dara Ottley-Brown, whose salary had risen sharply during the last three years she worked for the agency. Ms. Stark said the relationship did not start until Ms. Ottley-Brown had left the department in 2006. But the mayor asked city investigators to review the circumstances, and the other questions, that had arisen about the commissioner.Yesterday, Ms. Stark’s lawyer, Randy M. Mastro, said: “Martha Stark did nothing wrong here except try to keep her private life private, and for that she has now left her government post and New York City has lost one of its finest public servants.”Mr. Mastro said city investigators had not interviewed the commissioner.City Councilman David I. Weprin, chairman of the Finance Committee, reacted to Ms. Stark’s resignation by saying that, while he did not always agree with her, “I have always found her to be the consummate professional.”Ms. Stark sometimes chafed at the subtle hierarchies within City Hall, privately complaining, for example, that she was frozen out of several major budget decisions, like the plan last fall to withhold $400 tax rebate checks to homeowners.Her relationship with the city’s budget director, Mark Page, was strained enough that the mayor asked the two to have dinner to mend fences, according to an official briefed on the request who asked not to be named because it was an internal matter.Mr. Bloomberg’s administration has generally not been roiled by infighting among his commissioners or their sudden departure. Patricia J. Lancaster, the buildings commissioner, was forced to resign in April 2008 after a surge of fatal construction accidents.The commissioner of the Department for the Aging, Edwin Méndez-Santiago, resigned abruptly without explanation last December. And in 2004 the deputy chancellor of education, Diana Lam, and the top education lawyer, Chad Vignola, resigned in a scandal over the hiring of Ms. Lam’s husband.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','ALBANY — The state will face a perilous financial situation when federal stimulus money and temporary state tax increases on the wealthy expire two years from now, according to the financial plan released by the governor’s office on Tuesday.For the fiscal year beginning in April 2011, the budget deficit is projected to balloon to $8.8 billion. The year after that, the deficit is expected to be $13.7 billion.While far lower than what Gov. David A. Paterson’s budget office projected before this year’s budget deal, the gaps would still be enormous: On paper, they would be the second- and fourth-largest deficits in state history (the largest was this year).“Federal stimulus funding provided the state a soft landing as it transitions to a new fiscal reality, but much more needs to be done to get our fiscal house in order,” Mr. Paterson said in a statement. “This year we took the first step toward implementing reforms that will make our state government more cost-effective and accountable, and we must continue the important work of reining in state spending in the future.”This year, Mr. Paterson and lawmakers closed a budget gap that his administration estimated at $20.1 billion with a mix of spending cuts, federal stimulus aid and new taxes and fees. Including stimulus funds that were required to be spent, the state’s overall budget came to $131.8 billion.While the deficit projected for next year — when Mr. Paterson and every state lawmaker will seek re-election — is projected at $2.2 billion, that assumes a relatively strong recovery in tax receipts, according to state budget figures. Excluding money from the tax increase on high earners and other new taxes and fees, budget officials are projecting a 4.8 percent increase in revenues for the fiscal year beginning next April, after two years of substantial declines.And when lawmakers return from the campaign trail in 2010, they will confront the effects of Wall Street retrenchment and the resulting revenue decline. Budget officials expect the financial and insurance industries to shed jobs every year until 2015, when they project a small amount of growth. Wall Street bonuses will fall by more than half from their 2007 peak of $50.9 billion, the plan projects.'"

The four dogs, all named Ruppy, a combination of “ruby” and “puppy,” look like typical beagles by daylight.

Prof. Lee Byeong-chun of Seoul National University, the leader of the research team, called them the world’s first transgenic dogs carrying fluorescent genes, an achievement that goes beyond just the glowing novelty. “What’s significant in this work is not the dogs expressing red colors, but that we planted genes into them,” Professor Lee said.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','THERE’S been plenty of blather about doggie bags during the last few months, as belts have tightened and restaurant trips dwindle. These days, not wasting a mouthful is behavior virtuous and true, so the time-honored maxim “You break it, you own it” has found new life as “You ordered it, you finish it.” Dining out is no longer an exercise in hedonism; it’s a replay of dinner-table drama circa the third grade. Was it you who ordered that extra side dish for the table? Was it also you who didn’t clean your plate?The fish-eye accompanying those unspoken questions usually comes from one person at the table, the resident expert in passive-aggressive control issues, otherwise known as the person who should have stayed home nursing a soft-boiled egg but couldn’t pass up the opportunity to drive everyone else insane.Two can play at that game. As a poster child for the economy, you are free to carry a doggie bag home, then actually feed it to a dog, just for spite. Who’ll ever know? Actually, the most ingenious passive-aggressive use of a doggie bag I’ve heard was told to me by an editor of mine, years ago. Her blind date started with dinner at an Italian restaurant, before moving on to the elegant Cafe Carlyle. She settled on the banquette, next to the gentleman, her odoriferous container of linguine and clam sauce leaking between them. Needless to say, that first date was their last.For me, personally, this is way too much intrigue devoted to leftovers. If you’ve paid good money to eat good food, why not take it with you? Yes, it’s the frugal thing to do. But it’s also the fun thing to do. Portions are so ridiculously large these days; why not get the chance to eat all of what it is you like?Having grown up in a kosher house, I came to doggie bags late. Granted, we were the kind of “kosher” that allowed us to dig into shrimp with lobster sauce or cheeseburgers under someone else’s roof, on someone else’s dishes. But I could never take anything home.'"

"'09-04-29,'1','The idea and approach aren’t unlike those long used at, say, Bread Bar, which is the casual wing of Tabla, or in the front area of Aquavit, only Anthos Upstairs wasn’t part of the original plan. It’s an improvisation, and feels that way. The 15 tables press together in an awkward geometry, and the noise level is high.The menu simply lists more than a dozen small- and medium-size dishes, most $10 to $13, none above $15. Like the food at Anthos and even at its Upper West Side sibling Kefi, a boisterous taverna for nearly 200, these dishes underscore Mr. Psilakis’s determination to move beyond the tropes of Greek cooking.Sure, there’s feta afoot, but where you’ll find it is in a BFT sandwich, replacing lettuce as a consonant donor. Lamb appears not in kebab or shank form but as grilled ribs, whose oozing succulence is accomplished with a tad too much pure fat, even for the most zealous fat worshiper (read: me).On the subtle-to-blunt spectrum of Anthos to Kefi, the food here falls almost smack in the middle. Only two dishes lingered in my thoughts. One was the “crispy cod,” fried fish nuggets done with a magically and delightfully light touch. The other was the hilopites, a Greek pasta combining braised pork belly and calamari to wickedly flavorful effect. Upstairs, downstairs or out on the sidewalk, I’d happily eat bowl after bowl of this.Still, I had better luck and a better time at DFF, 47 East 19th Street; (212) 780-0880; dffnyc.com; no reservations, the re-appropriation of the private-party room adjacent to Craft, in the Flatiron district.Damon Wise, Craft’s executive chef, supervises the DFF menu, initially available on Friday nights only. Now it’s served every night but Tuesday, when the Craft empire’s august paterfamilias, Tom Colicchio, may be using the space and stage-set kitchen here to prepare ambitious, expensive tasting menus under the rubric Tom: Tuesday Dinner.Like TTD, DFF demonstrates a reverence for pork and offal and an affinity for seasonal ingredients. But at DFF, these are harnessed into snacks and small plates that never exceed $10. The wines by the glass top out at the same price.With its frantic pace — the food zooms out of the kitchen — DFF reminds you that one of the trade-offs for cheaper eats is often less time at the table, less of an ability to turn a meal into the prolonged main event of a night out. It clearly wants fleet turnover.The dozens of menu items, including miniature pizzas and jarred rillettes, target a spirit of sophisticated fun. There’s teriyaki beef jerky (so-so); gooey pork croquettes (excellent); pig tails with a blood orange molasses (too sweet); skewered lamb with medjool date and harissa (terrific); cookie-bracketed ice cream sandwiches (adorable). Call it filigreed finger food.Semantically cuter but otherwise less appealing than DFF, Halfsteak, 85 10th Avenue, (15th Street); (212) 400-6699; no reservations, occupies what had been the front cocktail lounge of Craftsteak, Mr. Colicchio’s upscale steakhouse.Its dozens of dishes are listed by their prices, which are typeset in accordance with the overall conceit: $6 1/2 (for a serviceable wedge of fried mac & cheese, for example); $11 1/2 (for an irresistible fried oyster po’ boy); $13 1/2 (for pointless wagyu nachos or a charmless casserole of stone-hard meatballs, gnocchi and smoked mozzarella).For $7 1/2, there are diminutive (six-ounce) cocktails with names like “half-thyme” and “not half bad.” The obsessions with fractions carried over to the sluggish performance of the wait staff for the first 45 minutes of our meal. We got half service.In the front lounge of Per Se, fourth floor of Time Warner Center, Columbus Circle; (212) 823-9335; perseny.com; no reservations for lounge, we were pampered beyond pampering, which is what Per Se, of course, is all about.This gilded, gorgeous lounge space used to exist for diners getting ready for, or unwinding from, a multicourse, $275-a-person (including tip but not wine) extravaganza in the adjacent dining room. But now it’s a way to sample Per Se in abbreviated, piecemeal form.On the night we went, the à la carte lounge menu had seven savory dishes ranging from $26 to $46. They beautifully demonstrated the kitchen’s greatness, which lies in its ability to amplify ingredients and express their flavors with a clearness that’s close to magical.Fava bean agnolotti tasted more vibrantly of fava bean than seemed possible, and the swish of vivid red beneath a sea scallop had a sweetness purer and truer than I thought a beet could yield.The meal was superb — and yet utterly ridiculous. The lounge’s seating arrangement, with armchairs and couches positioned at what are essentially coffee tables, isn’t suitable for eating fastidiously composed dishes, or for presenting them: stressed servers’ arms wobbled as they lowered plates.And what happens when the longer Per Se menu is broken down price-wise to its component parts is that the food actually seems more expensive, because you can more easily calculate — and find yourself automatically aware of — the bites per dollar. At $46 (including service), a modest portion of veal tenderloin was well over $6 a bite.Using the Per Se lounge for food that doesn’t require as substantial a commitment of money and time is smart. But until the furniture is rethought or the dishes presented in a less fussy fashion, it won’t be quite as silvery a recession concession as it’s meant to be.'"

More recently, Justice Department lawyers notified the parties to the settlement, including Google, and representatives for the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild, that they were looking into various antitrust issues related to the far-reaching agreement.The inquiry does not necessarily mean that the department will oppose the settlement, which is subject to a court review. But it suggests that some of the concerns raised by critics, who say the settlement would unfairly give Google an exclusive license to profit from millions of books, have resonated with the Justice Department.A spokeswoman for the Justice Department was not immediately available to comment. A spokesman for Google declined to comment. Representatives for the Association of American Publishers and the Authors Guild could not immediately be reached.The settlement agreement stems from a class action filed in 2005 by the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers against Google. The suit claimed that Google’s practice of scanning copyrighted books from libraries for use in its Book Search service was a violation of copyrights.'"

And the consternation it was causing for Yankee officials was made clear when , the team’s president, harshly criticized Don Garber, the commissioner of , after Garber mentioned that the sight of some of the best seats at the new stadium going unfilled was “unbelievable.”The team had first hinted at a change in ticket policy April 2 when Hal Steinbrenner, the team’s managing general partner, said, “There’s no doubt that a small amount of our tickets might be overpriced.”But back then, still two weeks before the home opener, could not have anticipated the empty swaths of blue seats that were supposed to be filled with people willing to pay $500, $600, $850, $1,250 or $2,500 a game for a premium seat.Steinbrenner announced the new ticket policy in a statement issued Tuesday afternoon. Neither he nor Levine was available to comment on the new policy. Nor was Lonn Trost, the team’s chief operating officer and the Yankee executive most identified with the initial ticket strategy.

Still, at $1,250, those tickets will remain roughly twice as expensive as the highest-priced seat at , the ’ new home.¶Tickets along the first- and third-base lines that cost $1,000 a game will be cut to $650. Refunds and credits will apply as well.¶Fans who have purchased $2,500 front-row season tickets behind and to the sides of home plate will not get a price cut. Instead, they will receive an equal number of front-row seats, for free, for the rest of the season, in what may be an attempt by the Yankees to fill up the empty spaces so visible on TV.The Yankees’ willingness to give away some of those top seats, along with waiter-served food, is a clear signal that while 85 percent of the 4,397 premium seats have been sold, the most expensive ones are moving much slower.Alice McGillion, a team spokeswoman, would not say how many of the $2,500 seats have been sold for the season. She said the giveaways are part of “a promotional strategy.”She also said the team’s focus was on accommodating the fans who have paid $325 and more for full-season ticket plans — and not other fans who have paid less but might have seen their ticket costs jump substantially from last season. “This was a very specific pricing plan, going off Hal’s comments, to look at the premium pricing,” she said.But Assemblyman , a frequent critic of the financing of the new stadium, criticized the new policy, saying: “The people who built Yankee Stadium with their money can no more afford $1,200 a game than they can afford $2,500.”The Yankees’ plan also provides significant numbers of complimentary seats for various numbers of games to buyers of season tickets that cost from $1,250 to $500 a game. In addition, other season-ticket holders higher up behind home plate will see their ticket prices cut from $750 to $500 a game.The team also said fans who buy three full-season plans for $325 a game in field-level sections that run from dugout to dugout will get a fourth one free. Those who have already purchased tickets in those sections will get free ones to future games this season depending on how many they have bought.The Yankees will not divulge the financial impact of the unsold seats and McGillion would not say how the refunds, credits and free premium tickets will affect team finances. The team has made clear in the past how much more financially beneficial the new stadium would be. In January, when the Yankees issued $258.9 million in tax-exempt , they estimated that ticket and suite revenue in the 2009 season would be $331.5 million, based on attendance of 3 million.But in August 2006, when it sold $942.5 million in tax-exempt bonds, the team estimated $253.2 million in anticipated 2009 revenue, based on 3.4 million attendance — indicating that in the time between the bond issues, the team increased the prices it would charge at the stadium.In any case, the unsold seats represented a marketing, and image, problem for a team that had nonpremium seats prices by 76 percent for its new stadium.“It was starting to hurt the overall brand,” said , chairman of Deutsch Inc., an advertising agency, when asked about the original pricing strategy. “People start asking whether you care about the fans.”A situation comparable to what confronted the Yankees occurred when Apple appeased alienated customers by dropping the price of its iPhones from $599 to $399; customers who had paid the higher price ultimately were offered $100 coupons good for Apple merchandise.For the most part, owners of luxury brands are reluctant to cut prices, since part of their mystique is the high price. Instead, they have given consumers optional extras, like leather seats, for free. Nonetheless, Yankee fans might not see the cut in ticket prices as anything but damage control.Robert K. Passikoff, president of Brand Keys, a brand and research consultant, said, “It’s not about being good to our fans, it’s about, ‘Oh my God, we’ve priced the tickets too high.’ ”'"
"'09-04-29,'1','BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki said Tuesday that Iraqi forces had recently arrested a leader of the Sunni insurgency who had been in league with members of Saddam Hussein’s ousted Baath Party.Iraqi officials say the insurgent, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, is the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown group that American intelligence officials say is led by foreigners.The government has not provided proof of his capture since announcing the arrest on Thursday, beyond showing a photograph of a man with a trimmed beard wearing a black T-shirt. In 2007, Iraqi officials announced twice that Mr. Baghdadi had been captured and killed. A spokesman for the United States military, which has suggested that he might not exist, said Tuesday that the military could still not confirm his arrest.Mr. Maliki, who spoke out Tuesday on the arrest for the first time, has increased his anti-Baathist language in recent weeks and has resisted American pressure to reconcile with more approachable members of the party. Many analysts say they believe that he is under pressure from his Shiite partners in the government, some of them allied with Iran.“This terrorist had deep ties with the former regime and created with its followers a devil’s pact reflected in bloody scenes of carnage involving innocent children and women and the elderly,” Mr. Maliki said.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','The British government has poured hundreds of billions of pounds into preventing several of its largest from falling into bankruptcy as the extent of their bad bets became evident. But there is little prospect of a revival anytime soon, as the government is about to impose stiffer demands on banks to keep high capital ratios and to rely less on leverage and once-lucrative trading activities.That, combined with a more aggressive posture by the regulatory authorities to put a check on bonuses, is likely to hasten what has already been a sharp falloff in corporate and income from the City.The economic contribution from the British financial sector, according to the Office for National Statistics, peaked at 10.8 percent of G.D.P. in 2007 — up from 5.5 percent in 1996, just before Labor took over. By comparison, the contribution from financial services in the to the American economy never exceeded 8 percent.In a bid to capture more revenue, the British government has decided to raise tax rates on the affluent, many of them working in finance. But the new top income tax rate of 50 percent for those earning at least £150,000 ($219,000) may only make things worse, said Mr. Snook, the economist.“These people are highly mobile and they will leave London,” he said. “The impact on public finances will be negative.”Britain’s top tax rate will soon rank fourth behind those of , and the — not quite the advertisement one would expect from one of the world’s leading financial centers.In many ways, Mr. Ishikawa’s career tracked the explosion that has now imploded. When he began work as a lowly credit analyst in 2002, banks in London issued about £20 billion in securities linked to various instruments. His career took off as that figure surged to over £180 billion over the next five or six years. Mr. Ishikawa received a $3 million bonus from Morgan Stanley in 2008 as a reward for peddling assets that turned out to be toxic.With that line of business virtually defunct, banks in the coming years must return to lower-risk and lower-return businesses like equity and bond underwriting, foreign exchange trading and traditional deal-making — businesses that may well be profitable, but can in no way make up for the loss of such a lush specialty.The Center for Economic and Business Research estimates that corporate and income taxes from the financial industry will shrink from 12 percent of the overall tax take in 2007 to 8 percent this year and perhaps lower in the years ahead, a prospect that could force Britain to increase its already substantial borrowing requirement.The crisis has humbled all financial centers, from Wall Street to . According to an index produced in Britain that ranks financial centers around the world, the City of London still comes out on top, closely followed by New York. The gap, though, between these two and , which is now third, is narrowing.Lord Adair Turner, the chairman of the Financial Services Authority, agrees that London as a financial center will be in for an adjustment and says that a large portion of the banking industry’s profit contribution to the economy was “illusory.”But even in a more restrictive environment, he points out, London’s importance as a global financial hub and the most valuable trading center in will not go away.“The City is important today for the same reason it was important in 1890,” he said.As for Mr. Ishikawa, who is 30 and grew up in Britain as the son of a successful Japanese executive, he is putting his hopes into a new career as a writer. His book, “How I Caused the Credit Crunch,” chronicles the debauched excesses of the boom — he was briefly married to a Brazilian lap dancer — by lightly fictionalizing his six-year stint in finance.“I really don’t miss it,” he said, sipping a coffee near the building where he was laid off. “There are many more kids out there more hungry than me.”Like Faruq Rana, for example. Mr. Rana, the 26-year-old son of Bangladeshi immigrants, was born and reared in Tower Hamlets, a district abutting Canary Wharf that has Britain’s highest unemployment rate.From his window, he can see the towers of and reaching into the sky and his ambition to one day work as a trader in one of those buildings soars nearly as high.“Every day when I wake up and open up my window, I can smell my job,” said Mr. Rana, who is a student in a government-financed program at Tower Hamlets College that prepares local youths for jobs in the financial industry.Unlike Mr. Ishikawa, Mr. Rana did not go to Eton or , but he remains undeterred.“I have the motivation and the drive,” he said. “I think I can be one of them.”'"
"'09-04-29,'1','As the drug giant Pfizer sails toward its merger with Wyeth, the company is hitting headwinds in the form of patent expirations and weakening sales in some important products, including Lipitor.Pfizer reported a 2 percent decline in first-quarter profits on Tuesday, to $3.7 billion, and an 8 percent decline in revenue, to $10.9 billion. While more than half the revenue decline came from the effect of a stronger dollar on overseas sales, company officials and analysts said, the profits fell in response to generic competition and weakening demand for some of Pfizer’s leading drugs.The cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug, had sales of $2.7 billion, a decline of 8 percent from the first quarter of 2008, on lower-than-expected sales in the United States. Pfizer has been hoping to wring more revenue from Lipitor, whose patent expires in November 2011.Pfizer also reported declining sales in two brand-name drugs that went off patent last year — the allergy medicine Zyrtec and the chemotherapy drug Camptosar. And Chantix, a smoking cessation drug the company had formerly hoped could be a blockbuster, had a sales decline of 36 percent, to $177 million, for the quarter, on concerns that it can have psychiatric side effects.But several analysts praised Pfizer for slightly beating expected earnings per share, which it achieved mainly through cost-cutting. Excluding restructuring costs, the company earned 54 cents a share, compared with 49 cents a share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','Nothing, it seemed, could move the stock markets on Tuesday.Faced with news about big banks and stress tests, home sales, consumer confidence and the future of the auto industry, investors offered almost no reaction. The major indexes swung between light gains and losses all day before ending slightly lower.Transportation and telecommunications companies buoyed the broader markets, while financial stocks dragged them lower. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 8.05 points, or 0.1 percent, to end at 8,016.95, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 2.35 points, or 0.3 percent, to 855.16. The Nasdaq was down 0.3 percent at 1,673.81.To some extent, investors were waiting for two important economic developments set for Wednesday. The government is scheduled to report its preliminary estimate of economic growth in the first quarter, and the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee is expected to release a statement as it concludes a two-day meeting in Washington.Shares of major banks declined as investors looked for more details of the government’s stress tests of the nation’s top 19 banks. Bank of America fell 8.6 percent, to $8.15 a share, and Citigroup declined 5.9 percent, to $2.89, after a report that the government was urging the banks to raise more capital.Investors barely reacted to better economic reports, including an unexpected increase in consumer confidence and slower declines in prices of single-family homes.'"
"'09-04-29,'1','For the country as a whole, the Case-Shiller numbers offered the thinnest of silver linings: things are still getting worse, but more slowly.In February, the price of single-family homes in 20 major metropolitan areas fell 18.6 percent from the year earlier, compared with a record drop of 19 percent in January.“Finally, we’re seeing a touch of moderation,” said David Blitzer, chairman of S.& P.’s index committee. “This is the kind of thing one might see if we’re beginning to see a bottom. I would not run out and celebrate, but I would not dig the bunker any deeper.”Mr. Blitzer said the decline in Phoenix outpaced any during the recession of the early 1990s, for which reliable figures are available. The only precedents he could cite were the Midwestern cities hit by the Great Depression and a contemporaneous drought, and Miami after a 1920s craze for beachfront property reversed itself.The boom in Phoenix was founded on a basic truth: it was a place where many people wanted to live. But the market turned irrational. Investors bought homes they did not even bother to rent out. They merely waited a few months until prices rose again so they could flip them.Ordinary homeowners got caught up, too. “People saw themselves as cashing in on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Mr. Guntermann said.Except for the few who managed to get out at the peak, it was a mistake. By now, anyone who bought in Phoenix a decade ago would have lost money after inflation. Many did not get off so easily. Foreclosure notices were filed against one in 40 houses in the metropolitan area in the first quarter, according to RealtyTrac Inc. That was the ninth-highest rate in the country.The Case-Shiller data show that housing markets across the United States are still suffering. Half of the 20 metropolitan areas in the index posted record year-over-year declines. In all, the 20-city index was down 2.2 percent from January.From Atlanta to San Francisco to Chicago, not one of the 20 cities posted a gain in home prices from January to February, and values in all but five cities dropped by double digits from a year earlier.The nearly 51 percent drop in Phoenix is not an isolated plunge. Prices in Las Vegas are down some 48 percent from their peaks. They are down 45 percent in Miami from their highest levels, and down 40 percent in Los Angeles and San Diego.Economists said housing prices would probably continue to fall as Americans, worried about rising unemployment and the recession, put off big financial decisions like buying a home.Some economists expect housing prices to fall another 5 to 10 percent before they hit a bottom; others say that prices could decline by as much as a third. According to the National Association of Realtors, the median price of a home in the United States, which peaked above $230,000 in 2006, has fallen to $175,200.As prices have dropped, frozen housing markets in hard-hit areas like Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas and South Florida have begun to thaw. Record-low mortgage rates and huge inventories of foreclosed homes and other fire-sale properties have enticed first-time buyers to the market and lured others who had been sitting on the sidelines.Home sales in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, where foreclosures dominate many markets, have snapped back this spring as prices dropped. But sales have slowed to a crawl in other markets like New York City, where prices declined 10 percent from a year ago.“We’re seeing very strong sales in a few states and weak sales across 40 states,” said Patrick Newport, United States economist at IHS Global Insight. “The key factor driving them right now is just the excess inventory. Even though prices are undervalued, they’re still going to drop because of the excess. Even if we were at full employment we’d still see prices dropping.”Inventories of unsold homes are edging down slightly, but there was still a glut of 3.7 million unsold homes in March, the Realtors’ group reported, representing a supply of nearly 10 months.Mr. Swan, the realty agent, said inventories of lower-priced homes were already dwindling in Phoenix as investors snapped up bank-owned properties at bargain prices.“I’ve got Canadians coming here who are putting together investment pools of millions of dollars to buy houses by the hundreds,” he said. “They’re going to rent them out to all the people who were foreclosed and need a place to live. This is going to be a good year for us.”'"
"'09-04-29,'1','COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Increasingly impatient with foreign calls for a pause in its war against Tamil rebels, the Sri Lankan government denied entry to the Swedish foreign minister, who had planned to take part in a European Union humanitarian mission, Sweden said Tuesday.Sweden said it would recall its chief diplomat in Sri Lanka.Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and now the country’s foreign minister, told reporters in Luxembourg that his visa application was turned down, and accused the Sri Lankan government of “exceedingly strange behavior.”“You just don’t act this way,” Mr. Bildt was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.Two other European officials, Britain’s foreign secretary, David Miliband, and the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, will carry out the mission as planned, Mr. Bildt said.As the Sri Lankan military closes in on Tamil Tiger rebels who are holding an estimated 50,000 civilians as human shields, the government here has become increasingly upset by foreign criticism of the war. A commentary in the pro-government newspaper Daily News on Tuesday was scathing in its criticism of the many countries, including India and the United States, that have called for a pause in the fighting.“None of those who are urging from afar a humanitarian pause/cease-fire, amnesty and talks with the Tigers are going to live in Sri Lanka when the suicide bombers strike again, the parcel bombs go off in shops and at bus stops,” said the article, which was headlined, “Get your humanitarian paws off my country.”'"

"'09-04-30,'0','The walking man in “The Limits of Control,” a Minimalist exercise in the key of cool from Jim Jarmusch, wears through a lot of shoe leather during his feature-length tramp. One of cinema’s men with no names, credited only as the Lone Man, this peripatetic figure is played (and walked and walked) by Isaach De Bankolé with a determined gait and inscrutable gaze that initially reveal almost as little as the elliptical storytelling. Like Mr. Jarmusch, the Lone Man doesn’t share his intentions until he reaches the end. By that point, though, if you’ve paid attention to the cues and opening credits, you will be steps ahead of both.Set more or less in the present, the Lone Man’s journey gets going in an airport where he receives some vaguely philosophical directives from a suave number played by the French actor Alex Descas and credited as Creole. Mr. Descas’s low-key intensity imbues the setup with a shiver of menace — despite the unhurried pace, it feels as if something heavy were at stake — an air of unease that’s counterbalanced by the dryly amusing fashion in which the Creole’s sidekick (Jean-François Stévenin) translates the orders. The Creole speaks in, yes, Creole (his words are translated in the English subtitles) and the sidekick repeats them (sometimes with slight modification) in English, which means the instructions are given three times. Repetition, it emerges, is the film’s central structuring device.That much at least becomes quickly apparent after the Lone Man leaves the airport. Wearing a form-fitting, lightly iridescent blue suit and purple shirt, he travels to Madrid, where he settles into a 1960s high-rise apartment building with a cylindrical facade that brings to mind rolled coins. There he stays for an indeterminate amount of time. Days slip into night, though it’s unclear if they’re slipping in sequence or during different weeks and months. Whatever the case, the Lone Man establishes a routine that deviates only in its details: he sits at a cafe, drinks two espressos and, at some point (hours, minutes, days later), is joined by a man or woman with whom he exchanges almost identical matchboxes. Sometimes, he visits a museum.A sensitive colorist, Mr. Jarmusch is given a rich palette here by Christopher Doyle — the bright Spanish light does its part — the cinematographer known for his work with Wong Kar-wai. (Mr. Doyle makes color pop and vibrate, but he also knows how to light for black skin.) Although the Lone Man doesn’t say much, the images of him suggest plenty, whether he’s looking through a red-tinted window or standing against a red wall in an elevator. These splashes of color, which appear to signal some unspoken threat or warning, serve as pieces of a puzzle that Mr. Jarmusch assembles with formal rigor and languid pacing that increasingly borders on the somnolent. Other pieces: a guitar, a flamenco song and Bill Murray.It’s too bad that Mr. Murray’s name appears in the opening credits, since his absence from most of the film hints what will happen in the unfortunately obvious climax. By the time Mr. Murray appears, the Lone Man has racked up a lot of miles and traveled to other places where he’s exchanged matchboxes with mysterious types who ask him — just as the Creole did earlier — “You don’t speak Spanish, do you?” The line is funny the first, second and almost the third time. Along the way are a quotation from Arthur Rimbaud and several nods at Jean-Luc Godard, including a shot that frames Paz de la Huerta’s apple-cheeked derriére much the same way that the French filmmaker did Brigitte Bardot’s in “Contempt.”'"

Raising the bar on what is required to undertake such raids could result in fewer of them.The guidelines are a significant step toward President Obama’s pledge to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. The president’s aides said recently that he would ask Congress this year to consider changes that among other things would give legal status to the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants now in the country.But a worsening economy could weaken political support for such changes. In the meantime, the administration has begun a review of steps it can take without Congressional approval.In his news conference Wednesday night, Mr. Obama restated his commitment to an immigration overhaul, saying the United States could not continue with a “broken” system. With regard specifically to workplace enforcement, he said he was looking for “a more thoughtful approach than just raids of a handful of workers, as opposed to, for example, taking seriously the violation of companies that sometimes are actively recruiting these workers to come in.”“That’s something we can start doing administratively,” he added.Among Janet Napolitano’s first acts as secretary of homeland security was to order reviews of many parts of the nation’s immigration system. Ms. Napolitano promised to stem the rising tide of illegal immigration by strengthening border enforcement and cracking down on employers who hire illegal immigrants.Work on the guidelines that are to be issued Thursday began after a February raid against a mechanic shop in Bellingham, Wash., where 28 illegal workers were seized. Ms. Napolitano, angry in part that her office had not been notified about the raid, ordered a review, and a couple of weeks later ICE officials took possession of the employer’s files, released the immigrants from detention and gave them permission to work while they cooperated with an investigation of the company, Yamato Engine Specialists. That inquiry continues.One senior official said ICE agents worked from a field manual offering a menu of strategies that can be used in pursuit of workplace enforcement. But the manual does not lay out the order in which the strategies should be employed, or explain the agency’s objectives. As a result, enforcement actions have been undertaken at the discretion of each field manager rather than Washington’s direction.“That’s how you ended up with investigations that focused on low-hanging fruit,” the official said, “rather than on both the employers and the illegal workers that they intentionally hired.”Among the most significant of the new guidelines is one in which agents are instructed to “obtain indictments, criminal arrest or search warrants, or a commitment from a U.S. attorney’s office to prosecute the targeted employer, before arresting employees for civil immigration violations at a work site.”The guidelines call on agents to seek civil penalties, including fines and disbarment from federal contracts, in cases where they do not have enough evidence to press criminal charges. And they require that at least 14 days before conducting a raid, the relevant field office notify ICE headquarters with information including a proposed strategy for prosecuting the employer.They also require that rules involving humanitarian considerations be taken into account in raids on work sites that have at least 25 employees. Those rules, which previously applied to raids involving at least 150 workers, generally allow the authorities to release detainees who are sick or who are sole caregivers for small children.1020 2009-04-30 THE swine flu outbreak seems to have emerged without warning. Within a few days of being noticed, the flu had already spread to the point where containment was not possible. Yet the virus behind it had to have existed for some time before it was discovered. Couldn’t we have detected it and acted sooner, before it spread so widely? The answer is likely yes — if we had been paying closer attention to the human-animal interactions that enable new viruses to emerge.While much remains unknown about how pandemics are born, we are familiar with the kinds of microbes — like SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), influenza and H.I.V. — that present a risk of widespread disease. We know that they usually emerge from animals and most often in specific locations around the world, places like the Congo Basin and Southeast Asia.By monitoring people who are exposed to animals in such viral hotspots, we can capture viruses at the very moment they enter human populations, and thus develop the ability to predict and perhaps even prevent pandemics.Over the past 10 years, my colleagues and I have demonstrated that such monitoring is possible. In Cameroon, we have studied hunters who are exposed to the blood and body fluids of monkeys, bats, wild pigs and other hunted animals. By collecting specimens from both the hunters and their prey, we have discovered previously unknown viruses and documented how they’ve jumped from animals to humans. We have seen, for example, a gorilla retrovirus, never before seen in humans, infect one of our study subjects.Then, by monitoring infected people and those who are in contact with them, we observe what effects these novel viruses have on people, and how easily they can move from person to person.We can also identify a virus’s genetic and immunological signatures and other biological information that is needed to create diagnostic tests, vaccines and treatments — so that when a disease appears, it is possible to respond as quickly as possible.1021 2009-04-30 The Mexican Army, deployed across the country to combat drug cartels, is committing major human rights abuses and is not being held accountable for its illegal acts, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released Wednesday. Accusing the army of killing, torture, rape and arbitrary detention in recent years, the New York-based advocacy group said not one military investigation into abuses has led to a conviction of a soldier. “The need to improve public security in Mexico is clear,” José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. “But, to be effective, any strategy to address security must also deal with the rampant impunity for military abuses committed during public security operations.” While the government had no immediate response to the report, President Felipe Calderón has consistently defended the military and labeled the drug cartels “the principal threat to the human rights of all Mexicans.”1022 2009-04-30 Involving every archetype in Italian life — the rogue husband, the scorned wife, the much younger woman, the sainted mother — the soap opera gripped the country and the front pages.Ms. Lario’s comments were prompted by, of all things, a recent debate over the June elections for the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, a political entity best known in Italy for the high salaries and low accountability of its members.The problem, from her point of view, is that Mr. Berlusconi gets to pick the candidates for his center-right party, and Tuesday’s papers were full of large color photographs of the young and comely women he chose, apparently more for their pictures than for their résumés.“Someone has written that this is just a diversion for an emperor,” Ms. Lario wrote. “I agree,” she added. “What emerges from the newspapers is shamelessly trashy, all in the name of power.”Mr. Berlusconi struck back at his wife on Wednesday. “I’m afraid that the ‘signora’ believed what she read in the newspapers,” ANSA quoted him as saying while he was traveling in Warsaw.He added that she had been subject to the “manipulations” of the left-wing press.Yet on Tuesday, Il Giornale, the center-right daily owned by Mr. Berlusconi himself, featured a two-page spread with large color photos of eight young, attractive women it said were being considered as candidates.They included a participant in a top reality television show and Barbara Matera, 28, an announcer on the leading government television channel, a prefinalist in the 2000 Miss Italy contest, and a university graduate.In the end, Ms. Matera was the only television personality to make the cut.ANSA reported that Mr. Berlusconi, in Warsaw, said that anyone who dared criticize the candidates “should be ashamed of themselves.”He added that he did not want anyone “smelly or badly dressed"" running for the European Parliament, like the candidates “of some other parties.”This week’s letter is not the first in which Ms. Lario has publicly denounced her husband on the same grounds.In February 2007, she published an open letter in La Repubblica, the center-left daily newspaper, criticizing the prime minister for flirting with some young women at a party and praising the beauty of Mara Carfagna, a former showgirl whom he named equal opportunities minister.Ms. Lario’s latest criticism also comes in the context of speculation about a brewing power struggle between the children of Mr. Berlusconi’s first marriage, or “first bed,” as the Italian phrase goes, and those of his second, with Ms. Lario, over his media and even political empire.Not everyone was pleased with such rumor-mongering. “It’s very Italian and very sad that every time a woman speaks the truth” people think “something is behind her,” said Maria Latella, the author of a biography of Ms. Lario and the editor of A, a women’s magazine.Ms. Latella said that she had not discussed the issue with Ms. Lario.“Being the wife of the premier and reading every day the same articles about the same TV girls, selected just because they are beautiful and brilliant but having no experience in politics maybe was a little tiring for the first lady,” Ms. Latella said.On Wednesday, Dario Franceschini, the center-left leader, said in a statement on his coalition’s Web site that Mr. Berlusconi “ignored Italian women as they are in reality.”“He has in mind a world of luxury, showgirls and money, very different from the real Italy,” Mr. Franceschini added.But as Mr. Berlusconi figured out long ago, while building a real estate and television empire before dominating Italian political life, there is a good chance that Italians prefer the image.1023 2009-04-30 But days later, Clear Channel announced that revenue plummeted 23 percent in the first quarter and cash flow fell by 47 percent.On Wednesday, the company announced it was laying off 590 employees after cutting 1,850 employees in January, for an overall staff reduction of 12 percent since the acquisition.Bishop Cheen, who follows corporate bonds for Wachovia, wrote recently that Clear Channel was on track to become the biggest default among media companies and therefore the biggest workout ever in the industry.The company’s options may be limited. Many financially pressed concerns have been able to persuade creditors to exchange debt for equity and thus avoid a default and a bankruptcy filing. At Clear Channel, getting creditors to go along with such a plan could be tough because the original deal was fraught with so much ill will, including an unusual court fight.“Before the 2008 purchase closed, there was a battle between the banks and private equity funds, who went to court to force the banks to complete the deal,” said Neil Begley, a Moody’s debt analyst. “While the equity holders would prefer an out-of-court restructuring, in this case they may not be able to come to terms with the banks.”The company has $16 billion of bank debt, on which it pays variable rates, and $6 billion more of junior debt. The holders of the junior debt and the equity holders would absorb the first loss in the event of a bankruptcy, so the banks have some protection and less incentive to negotiate.As advertiser spending plunges week by week, the likelihood grows that Clear Channel will fall out of compliance with one of its loan covenants by year’s end and be in technical default, several analysts said. The covenant requires that debt not exceed 9.5 times its cash flow. Lately, Clear Channel has been adding to its debt even as its cash flow is shrinking.Media companies of all types are suffering from the recession while consumer appetites are shifting in the digital revolution. Those laden with debt may buckle, with the biggest so far being the Tribune Company, thrown into bankruptcy after Sam Zell borrowed heavily to pay $8.2 billion for the company and assume $5 billion more of its existing debt. When Bain and Thomas H. Lee finally completed the Clear Channel acquisition in July after two years of struggle, they paid $18 billion and assumed $5 billion in outstanding debt. Today, there are few buyers for broadcast assets. Should the market rebound, the company could be worth about $12 billion, Mr. Begley of Moody’s said.Mr. Cheen estimates its market value today at less than $6.3 billion. “The market has gone from irrational exuberance to excessive awfulness,” he said.Though many companies acquired by private equity firms at the end of the bubble are in trouble, critics say the Clear Channel deal was ill advised from the start. The acquirers raised their bids several times to win over the previous shareholders even as the economy weakened.“Most investors in Clear Channel were thrilled that the private equity guys took radio off their hands,” recalled Michael Nathanson, a media analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “Many had deep concerns because the industry was not growing during a period of economic expansion. So what would happen when things slowed down?“This has been an industry facing secular challenges since 2002. Dollars were moving away from local market, and radio was losing share of dollars to the Internet.”Within months of closing the deal, the company announced a plan to cut costs. Dismissing 9 percent of its workers, or 1,850 people, would cut $350 million in annual costs, it said in January. A month later, under pressure to free up more cash, Clear Channel drew down a remaining $1.6 billion credit line.Meanwhile, the sons of Clear Channel’s founder, L. Lowry Mays, have taken pay cuts. Mark Mays serves as chief executive and Randall Mays as chief financial officer. (The family made hundreds of millions of dollars when the company was sold and retains an ownership stake.)With an estimated $1.4 billion in cash on hand, the company appears to have enough to manage through the next few years as long as it does not violate its bank agreements, Mr. Begley of Moody’s said. The company has to pay $1.3 billion in interest annually on its debt, and it and analysts project that it needs more than $1.5 billion in cash flow this year.Some analysts say it may not have been possible to foresee the economic collapse that has put so much pressure on Clear Channel. Still, critics wondered if there were ever a viable exit strategy.“In radio they were the biggest in the industry, so there was no likely strategic buyer,” Mr. Nathanson of Sanford Bernstein said. “We were more optimistic about their outdoor advertising business because there was a chance to sell it to a foreign buyer.”A public offering was unlikely because the stocks had languished for years, he said.Bain and Thomas H. Lee put up $450 million each for the deal. Their investors put up an additional $2.1 billion. Each firm receives an annual management fee of about $6.7 million, and each earned about $43 million in so-called transaction fees for their roles as bankers in the deal. They passed on two-thirds of those fees to their investors.Other radio companies are suffering, Citadel Broadcasting and Cox Radio included. Cox, though, has avoided layoffs so far. Its senior debt is four times cash flow, compared with nine times at Clear Channel.Marci Ryvicker, an equity analyst at Wachovia who follows the radio industry, said, “If you have the opportunity and capital structure to take market share from your peers, you will be one of the surviving radio companies.”1024 2009-04-30 Visa posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings Wednesday as the credit card network increased prices and cut expenses. The company also benefited as consumers used debit cards more.Net income rose 70 percent, to $536 million, or 71 cents a share, for the second quarter ended March 31, compared with $314 million, or 39 cents a share, for the period a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, quarterly net income rose 38 percent, to $553 million, or 73 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 64 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.Net operating revenue rose 13 percent, to $1.6 billion, while total processed transactions — which represent transactions processed by VisaNet — increased 6 percent, to 9.4 billion.Visa said payments volume fell 1 percent for the quarter ended Dec. 31, which translates to revenue in the following quarter.Unlike rival American Express, which makes loans and runs a network, Visa and MasterCard are partly insulated from rising defaults because they only process transactions and allow banks to take the risk of extending credit to cardholders.1025 2009-04-30 The Boeing Company, which was hit harder by the Obama administration’s spending cuts than any other defense contractor, is pushing Congress to increase its orders for planes and fighter jets by $3 billion, industry officials said Wednesday.Boeing is trying to get more orders for C-17 cargo planes and F/A-18 fighter jets added to a supplemental war-funding bill, officials said. They said Boeing’s lobbyists contend that building the extra planes would help preserve the military’s industrial base. Several analysts said they were likely to prevail because members of Congress are seeking to preserve thousands of jobs in their districts.President Obama has pledged to halt the Bush administration’s practice of using the supplemental bills to pay for the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and to add the costs to the Pentagon’s annual budget. But White House officials said earlier this month that one final supplemental bill was needed to avoid disruptions, setting off a lobbying frenzy before the special financing door closes.Legislators have predicted that Congress will add $10 billion to $15 billion to the $83.4 billion that the White House requested, not only to keep jobs but also to block the cancellations of several of major weapons programs.Boeing has lobbied the hardest among the major defense contractors, Congressional aides and industry officials said, mainly because it stands to lose the most in a reshaping of defense programs announced this month.1026 2009-04-30 “Over all, Intel’s conduct is lawful, pro-competitive and beneficial to consumers,” Robert Manetta, an Intel spokesman in London, said Wednesday.Microsoft, the world’s largest software company, has faced the biggest financial penalties to date, accused of abusing its dominance. It paid a fine in 2004 of 497 million euros, or $663 million at current exchange rates.In the Intel case, “I’d be surprised if the fine isn’t as high or higher than in the Microsoft case,” said Howard Cartlidge, the head of the European Union and competition group at the law firm Olswang in London. “Technology markets are where the European Commission has perceived particular problems due to dominant companies.”Some legal experts speculate that Intel’s fine could reach about a billion euros, or $1.3 billion. Intel’s annual sales were $37.6 billion in 2008.Michael Reynolds, a partner in the international antitrust group in Brussels at the law firm Allen & Overy, said such a large fine would be more likely in a case involving cartel behavior, which is not at issue with Intel.European regulators have also fined Microsoft 279 million euros and 899 million euros on the grounds of failing to comply with European Union orders in antitrust cases, but these were administrative penalties.The market research firm International Data Corporation says Intel had 81.9 percent of the global market for personal computer chips in December, compared with 17.7 percent for A.M.D.The commission can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global worldwide sales for antitrust abuses. But applying the formula strictly could put companies out of business rather than lead them to change their business practices.A person with knowledge of the commission’s deliberations said the agency was planning to highlight specific instances of suspected illegal discounting and order an end to those practices.The European charges against Intel are confidential. But A.M.D. laid out some of its concerns about Intel’s behavior in Europe in a civil case filed in Delaware in 2005.In that case, A.M.D. said its share of business with the European computer maker Fujitsu-Siemens fell after Intel offered a “special discount” on chips. According to A.M.D., Fujitsu-Siemens accepted the discount in exchange for hiding references to A.M.D. computers on its Web site and in a retail catalog.A.M.D. also said in the case that a leading retailer based in Germany, Media Markt, carried Intel computers exclusively in exchange for annual payments by Intel. In Britain, DSG, the parent company of the retailers Dixons and PC World, limits A.M.D.’s share of its business to less than 10 percent because of payments by Intel, according to A.M.D.Intel has been engaged in a lengthy, multifaceted battle with antitrust authorities across the globe. In Japan, Intel agreed in a consent decree in 2005 to modify its practices, without admitting wrongdoing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is also investigating.In June, the Korea Fair Trade Commission fined Intel 26 billion won, or about $19.5 million at current exchange rates, for abusing its dominant position in the microprocessor market by offering rebates to South Korean computer makers in a way that unfairly harmed A.M.D. Intel has appealed in that case, saying that the Korean commission failed to understand the workings of the microchip market and neglected to take into account important evidence.1027 2009-04-30 BERLIN — Microsoft has submitted a lengthy defense in the latest European antitrust case it faces, saying its practice of bundling the Internet Explorer Web browser with the Windows operating system did not violate European law.Microsoft filed the response of roughly 250 pages to European competition authorities late Tuesday. It also asked regulators for a closed hearing in the case, according to a person with knowledge of the document, which was intended to be private.The European Commission, acting on a 2007 complaint by Opera, a Norwegian Web browser maker, said in January that the practice violated European law. In its written response to the commission, Microsoft said that its share of the browser market had fallen and that the company was no longer as dominant.The Microsoft Windows operating system powers more than 90 percent of the world’s computers, according to the research firm Gartner. Net Applications, another research firm, says Internet Explorer has a 66.8 percent share of the global browser market.Lawyers for Opera say they will present other statistics showing that Microsoft’s browser share in Europe is closer to 85 percent.The commission is likely to schedule a closed-door hearing on the case before July, when much of European government shuts down for the summer.1028 2009-04-30 The Web is full of video in various formats, but getting every single file type to play on your computer can sometimes be a challenge. For video files your current player can’t open, try VideoLAN’s VLC Player (www.videolan.org), a free, open-source multimedia player for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux that can play a large number of video and audio formats.1029 2009-04-30 THE season of house tours, garden tours and show houses is here, when visitors are invited into skinny row houses, sprawling apartments and vast estates to study their gleaming kitchens, burnished woodwork, antiques and artworks and city or country views. Gardens from urban town-house yards in Wilmington, Del., to acres of working farmland in the Hudson Valley of New York offer greenery, specimens, fragrance and flowers. Unless otherwise noted, tours are self-guided; some details may change, so check with a tour’s organizer before making plans.New York City | New York Region and New Jersey | Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island | Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland | Southern, Central and Western United States1030 2009-04-30 “One person said, ‘I feel like I’m in Paris when I walk by the building,’ ” Ms. DiMaggio recalled.Using LED-based fixtures, Ms. DiMaggio said, she cut energy consumption for lighting by 43 percent, saving $6,654 a year. With an expected life of 50,000 hours, compared with the 2,000 hours typical of incandescent bulbs, the lights have also lowered maintenance costs.Although they have yet to substantially influence the residential lighting market, light-emitting diode lamps are increasingly being introduced in commercial buildings. Manufacturers are creating lamps that are reliable, color-accurate and at least as efficient as incandescent or compact fluorescent lights.LED fixtures still cost more than conventional ones, but the energy savings can help commercial projects to pay for themselves in as little as two years.That said, the quickly evolving technology is still in its early stages. “In 2006, I had a really hard time to light well with just LEDs,” said Brad Koerner, a designer at Lam Partners, a Cambridge, Mass., lighting firm. “By 2008, there was no longer any problem.”Mr. Koerner oversaw the relighting of Boston’s Custom House Tower, which is now a Marriott hotel. The building’s lighting had fallen into disrepair over the last 20 years, with much of the upper half remaining in darkness.Mr. Koerner installed LED-based fixtures from Philips’s Color Kinetics division that resemble warm incandescent bulbs. He replaced the 90-watt halogen bulbs with 50-watt LED fixtures, cutting energy use in half.“Every month LEDs get so much better it’s amazing,” Mr. Koerner said. “It’s changing that quickly.”While Derry Berrigan, owner of Derry Berrigan Lighting Design in Rogers, Ark., is using LEDs, she said much of what was currently sold was “pure junk. It’s like the Wild West.”Seeking out high-quality products, Ms. Berrigan used fixtures from Cree and Insight Lighting to relight a prototype KFC and Taco Bell restaurant in Northampton, Mass.She placed LEDs in the interior, reducing energy consumption by 81 percent, while LEDs outside saved 77 percent. Installing LED parking lot fixtures, which spread wider beams than conventional lighting, allowed Ms. Berrigan to remove two poles.Costs can even be cut when a building is receiving its energy off the grid. At the Chicago Center for Green Technology, which uses solar energy, Ms. Berrigan used LED track lighting from Journée Lighting in Westlake Village, Calif., to illuminate the walls in its resource center, along with fixtures from Color Kinetics, Cree, Insight and other companies to provide general illumination.With a resulting 64 percent drop in energy use for lighting, 47 of the center’s 200 solar panels could provide electricity for purposes other than illumination.LEDs can also create a look that would otherwise be unachievable. Focus Lighting, based in New York, illuminated Rock Sugar Pan Asian Kitchen, a restaurant prototype in Los Angeles owned by the Cheesecake Factory chain.Faced with lighting rooms with 25- to 30-foot ceilings and intimate bar and dining areas, Christine Hope, Focus’s designer, said, “LEDs were the perfect solution.”Fixtures included LED strips behind the bar and, in cubbyholes, dozens of candlelike LEDs using just one to three watts per unit. That “would have been impossible to do with incandescents,” Ms. Hope said.Color-changing LEDs programmed to cycle through the hues of dawn to dusk were placed behind large Buddhas. LED lights drawing three or six watts were installed in 25 globes in the courtyard.Needing omnidirectional light in the dining room, Ms. Hope used compact fluorescent bulbs in three fixtures, their yellow shades providing the proper color for the room.The LEDs reduced energy consumption by at least half compared with traditional incandescent and halogen bulbs, Ms. Hope said. “This restaurant is such a great example of what you can achieve with LEDs,” she said.1031 2009-04-30 Several funds, however, continued to reject the Treasury’s sweetened offer at a vote of the lenders on Wednesday evening, people familiar with the talks said.During a prime-time press briefing at the White House on Wednesday, appeared to lay groundwork for a Chrysler bankruptcy filing, although he said it was “not yet clear” Chrysler would have to move forward with one. “I am actually very hopeful, more hopeful than I was 30 days ago, that we can see a resolution that maintains a viable Chrysler automobile company out there.”He added: “The fact that the major debtholders appear ready to make concessions means that even if they ended up having to go through some sort of bankruptcy, it would be a very quick type of bankruptcy.”The four big that own 70 percent of Chrysler’s secured debt have already signed on to the Treasury’s plan and are trying to line up the other lenders in favor of the new terms.If all 46 lenders do not agree to the new offer, and a bankruptcy filing occurs, the lenders will be forced to accept the $2 billion they were originally offered or fight in court for a higher amount.The Obama administration is adamant that every lender participate in the debt swap, according to people close to the talks. One reason is that the deal would face legal challenges.People briefed on the negotiations said that while it seemed certain Chrysler would survive and avoid liquidation, it was not yet clear whether it would have to be placed into bankruptcy to sort through any unresolved issues with creditors.Administration officials said late Wednesday that while bankruptcy remained a possibility, talks with all of the stakeholders in Chrysler still could continue right up to an administration-imposed deadline at 11:59 p.m. Thursday.The administration gave Chrysler until Thursday to complete an agreement with Fiat, and avoid court protection. But it became clear in the last week that bankruptcy might be needed to allow Chrysler to shed debt, close dealerships and rid itself of other liabilities, in order to make itself a more attractive partner for the Italian auto company.A bankruptcy filing could lead to a prolonged battle in court with the company’s lenders, dealers and parts suppliers across the country. In bankruptcy, the government would also have to provide financing for the company to operate.Two people close to ’s Congressional delegation said Wednesday that Mr. Obama would probably opt for a bankruptcy filing, which would be intended to be executed in as little as 60 days.Publicly, Chrysler officials remained hopeful Wednesday that the company could avoid bankruptcy. In a letter to employees, Chrysler’s chairman, , said the company was making progress with Fiat and hoped to have a deal in hand by Thursday.“I’m encouraged by this progress and I want you to know I deeply appreciate the sacrifices made by so many constituents to help us reach the restructuring targets established by the government,” Mr. Nardelli said.There was no immediate comment from Fiat.Any deal with Fiat would involve management changes, including the departure of Mr. Nardelli, who joined the company in August 2007. Mr. Nardelli told employees this month that he was likely to leave Chrysler.The new management is likely to take charge of Chrysler as soon as agreements with the Treasury Department are completed, people briefed on the situation said.If there is a bankruptcy filing, the new management team will lead the company until it has finished restructuring. It was not clear whether one of Chrysler’s executives or a Fiat executive would head the company.Chrysler, subsisting on $4 billion in federal , has asked for another $7 billion in government aid to carry it through the worst automotive market in the in 25 years.But members of the president’s special auto task force are unsure the company can be viable for the long term without the use of what has been called a “surgical bankruptcy.”As the talks with Fiat and the lenders entered the final hours, members of the union approved a historic deal in which the union would take a 55 percent stake in Chrysler. The stake would finance half of a new trust to administer retiree health care costs.1032 2009-04-30 Not only has swine flu resulted in more than 159 deaths in Mexico and caused concern around the world — it’s also wreaking havoc with Hollywood’s marketing agenda. Variety reported that Paramount would postpone the Mexican premiere of its coming big-budget science-fiction feature “Star Trek” because of the swine flu outbreak. The film was scheduled for a release there on May 8; a new date was not announced. Variety also reported that Sony was contemplating a similar delay for the Mexican release of its movie “Angels & Demons,” adapted from the Dan Brown novel, which is scheduled for a Mexican release on May 15. The Hollywood Reporter said 20th Century Fox had canceled a visit to Mexico City by Hugh Jackman to promote Friday’s release of its superhero movie “X-Men Origins: Wolverine.”1033 2009-04-30 David Lanzman, co-owner of the Derby favorite, I Want Revenge, referred the inquiry to his trainer, Jeff Mullins. “I’m a banker,” Lanzman said. “I don’t know what goes on back there.” Mullins declined to provide the records.The owners’ responses make it impossible to tell what practices even racing’s most prominent and accomplished people follow when using chemistry to improve their horses’ performance.“We’ve got to quit giving these horses drugs they do not need, and show the public that we are serious about cleaning this sport up,” said Rick Porter, who owned Eight Belles and co-owns the Derby contender Friesan Fire. A necropsy of Eight Belles, who was euthanized after breaking down just beyond the finish, showed that she had no pre-existing injury or ailment and was free of steroids and other drugs.Porter provided the records for a dozen of his horses now training with Larry Jones. Joining him in offering their horses’ full medical records — which are not required to be disclosed — were Jerry Myers, the owner of Win Willy, and Bo Hirsch, who campaigns Papa Clem. On Wednesday, Win Willy’s owners withdrew him from the Derby when they discovered a possible crack in his left front ankle.According to the records, each of those owners took a conservative approach to medication. Porter paid $165 last month for Friesan Fire’s veterinary care. The monthly bills for routine care for some horses surpass $1,000.The 17 who declined to make their veterinary records available include a who’s who of thoroughbred racing.¶Edward Evans is the owner of the Derby winner Quality Road, who was among the Derby favorites until his scratch on Monday. Evans is one of 98 members of the , one of the sport’s most prestigious organizations, dedicated, it says, “to the improvement of thoroughbred breeding and racing.”¶Bill Casner and Kenny Troutt, owners of WinStar Farm, which will enter three horses in the Derby, are trustees of the Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association, which is dedicated “to improve the economics, integrity and pleasure of the sport.”¶Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of , who has spent hundreds of millions at American horse sales, will send two runners in search of his first Derby win on Saturday.The drug issue has been contentious in horse racing, and what comes off a veterinarian’s truck and goes into a horse is often perceived to be as important to the performance of a horse as its talent. Before the 2005 Derby, and racing officials began 24-hour surveillance and more comprehensive drug testing.Last spring at Keeneland, the trainer Patrick Biancone, who finished second in the 2004 Derby with Lion Heart, and his veterinarian were barred from the Kentucky circuit when cobra venom — a powerful, illegal painkiller — was found in his barn.The Hall of Fame trainer Jack Van Berg told a Congressional subcommittee last June that training horses had become “chemical warfare.” Arthur Hancock, a fourth-generation breeder and owner, said that after routinely receiving medication bills for more than $1,000 per horse, he told his vet to give his horses drugs only when they were sick.“You want to win races, don’t you, Arthur?” Hancock said the vet replied.Thoroughbreds routinely receive medications whether they have ailments or not. Mullins, the trainer of I Want Revenge, will serve a seven-day suspension after the Derby for giving one of his horses a remedy before a stakes race last month at Aqueduct in New York. He acknowledged that his horse did not have a cold and that he gave the treatment to all his horses in the hope of increasing their air capacity.Drugs help prevent , treat inflammation and open air passages. A common medication is Lasix, which prevents blood from seeping into the lungs and airways. It is given to nearly every horse that goes to post in the United States, although the practice is prohibited in and . Most regulators and veterinarians say Lasix enhances performance because it is a diuretic that flushes 20 to 30 pounds of water out of a horse.A consensus among equine researchers and surgeons has developed that legal medications and cortisone shots, over time, leave a horse vulnerable to a catastrophic breakdown.Nancy Heitzeg, a professor at St. Catherine University in , has tried to track all horse racing fatalities in the United States. She calculated that there had been about three breakdowns a day nationwide since last year’s Kentucky Derby.In America, racehorse fatalities have occurred at the rate of 1.47 per 1,000 starts for synthetic surfaces, and 2.03 per 1,000 starts for dirt tracks, said Mary Scollay, the equine medical director for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, who conducts research for the Jockey Club.In , the average risk of fatality is much lower, from 0.8 to 0.9 per 1,000 starts. In Victoria, , studies have reported the risk of fatality from 1989 to 2004 at 0.44 per 1,000 starts.Corticosteroids can be injected into joints and are prevalent at American tracks. They are often given within days of a race, especially in the sport’s lower levels. In essence, that helps a sore horse make the starting gate.“These are strong drugs and have therapeutic benefits,” said Dr. Wayne McIlwraith, a surgeon and leading researcher on joint injuries at . “The question we need to answer: When are we helping a horse, and when are we desensitizing pain to dangerous levels?”This will be the first Kentucky Derby in which anabolic steroids are expressly prohibited. That is a victory for the industry’s Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, which has also pushed through uniform rules in 32 of the country’s 38 racing jurisdictions.Many within the sport would like to eliminate all but the medicines that treat illness or injury.“Sometimes there is a conflict for what is best for the horse and what’s best for the owner, and what’s best for the trainer or the vet,” said Rick Arthur, the equine medical director for the Horse Racing Board. “The easiest way to regulate something is to take away the opportunities for bad judgments.”Mac Robertson, the trainer of Win Willy, is the son of a trainer. He grew up at third-rate tracks in the Midwest, where horses were injected because horsemen needed them to run to feed their families. As he rose in the sport, he said, he was disappointed that some trainers and owners treated their horses as commodities.“I’ve watched my favorite horse break his leg when I was a kid, and I know how much that hurts,” Robertson said. “We should get rid of all medications because they are bad for the horse, and it’s bad for the breed. If a horse is not healthy, he should not be running.“We have too many people hold them together with drugs so they can win races and go to the breeding shed and make money. If they won on drugs, they really weren’t the best, and their flaws are going to keep being passed on.”Porter will hardly feel outgunned when he sends Friesan Fire to the gate Saturday. His colt received only and electrolytes since arriving here from , though he was treated by a .As Eight Belles’s death showed, racing is dangerous under the best conditions. Porter, however, is disappointed that the sport has not gone further in eliminating medications and conducting itself more transparently.“Everyone who participates in this game should be taking care of these horses,” he said. “We’re the ones that speak for them.”1034 2009-04-30 The North’s first nuclear test in 2006 was considered something of a failure by the United States and South Korea. And a North Korean ballistic missile launched in 2006 blew up 40 seconds after blastoff and, contrary to North Korean claims, another rocket launched in early April failed to put a satellite into orbit, American officials said.On April 13, the Security Council issued a unanimous statement denouncing the North’s rocket launching as a violation of a resolution after the North’s first nuclear test in 2006 that banned the country from nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The Council called for tightening sanctions, a move that the North on Wednesday said was tantamount to “a declaration of war.”A Foreign Ministry spokesman told the state-run news agency, KCNA, that the country would “take additional self-defensive measures” unless the Security Council apologized immediately, specifying “nuclear tests and test-firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”North Korea also “will make a decision to build a light-water reactor power plant and start the technological development for ensuring self-production of nuclear fuel as its first process without delay,” the spokesman said. Such fuel would be uranium-based. Engineers use the same fuel-making technology to produce highly enriched uranium for nuclear bombs.North Korea reportedly has told United States officials that it has extracted enough plutonium for several bombs by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. But it has never confirmed that it has been pursuing a clandestine uranium-enrichment program that would provide an alternative means of bomb-making.On Wednesday, Fred Lash, a State Department spokesman, defended the Security Council’s action as “balanced and appropriate.”“We certainly call on North Korea, as we have in the past, to uphold its commitments” under two documents, he said: a Sept. 19, 2005, joint statement of six-party talks on North Korea, and a 2006 Security Council resolution imposing sanctions.“We remain committed to achieving the verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, hopefully through the six-party talks,” he said. “We urge them, as we always do, to return to the table.”The North insisted that its April launching, conducted after it ignored repeated offers of dialogue from Washington, was solely to put a communications satellite into orbit. But Washington maintained that the launching was a disguise for testing ballistic missile technology.Over the weekend, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Washington would not be “blackmailed” by the North. The United States and its allies will “tighten the band around North Korea,” she said.Washington’s approach appears to be based partly on a belief that the North’s recent moves were meant more for domestic purposes than to gain leverage internationally. Since his reported stroke in August, North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-il, seems to have shifted his priority to demonstrating leadership and securing a stable transfer of power to one of his three sons. And the best way to do so, experts say, is to highlight the one achievement Mr. Kim can boast of: his nuclear and missile programs.Washington’s current stand on North Korea has raised some concern in Seoul. After recent policy discussions in Washington, Moon Chung-in, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, described the American attitude as “just like the first-term Bush administration.”Shin Nakyun, a South Korean lawmaker, who also attended the discussions, said: “Although they said they keep their door open for North Korea, I felt they were turning uniformly hard-line. They said there will be no carrots for the North.”The Bush administration reversed its refusal to engage the North after the North conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. Washington offered a string of concessions but was disappointed when North Korea did not acknowledge the suspected uranium-enrichment program or helping Syria on nuclear issues.1035 2009-04-30 G.D.P.
