"'07-07-01,'0','Woods (with his wife and baby) and Singh (resting a sore elbow) are not playing the Buick Open for the first time since 2001 after combining to win four of the previous five.After playing the first 12 holes at par, Pernice eagled No. 13, then had four consecutive birdies before finishing with a par.Parnevik made the big move yesterday, going from a tie for 46th into a tie for second with an 8 under. He had the best round — by two strokes.Parnevik is playing in his first Buick Open, instead of returning to Europe as he usually does after the United States Open.“I decided to stay this year, which I’m very happy about,” he said.Parnevik, who usually does not return to the United States until the PGA Championship, will play at Oakland Hills in suburban Detroit in a British Open qualifier tomorrow.Pernice and Parnevik will be paired, hoping to continue a trend.The Buick Open winner has emerged from the final group since 1999, and the third-round leader has held on in each of the past six years.Pernice took advantage of the last leader who could not hold onto the lead on a Sunday at Warwick Hills.Pernice gained the first of his two PGA Tour victories here eight years ago, when he began the final round five shots behind Tom Lehman and beat him and two others by a stroke.“I didn’t really necessarily have many thoughts about winning when I teed off that day,” Pernice said. “Really, Tom Lehman let us all back into the game.”Brett Quigley plummeted a day after firing his caddie. His three-over 75 dropped him into a tie for 32nd at seven under after starting the day tied with Furyk and Perry.HANSEN LEADS FRENCH OPEN Soren Hansen of Denmark shot a five-under 66 to lead by one stroke after the third round of the French Open in Versailles. Hansen, who had an eagle at the third hole after almost chipping in, is at seven-under 206. Simon Khan (70) was second; Colin Montgomerie (71) and Martin Kaymer (69) were another shot back..'"
"'07-07-01,'0','The third and final rounds are scheduled to be completed Sunday. The third round will resume at 7:30 a.m., and the final round is scheduled to begin at 10:45 a.m.The cut, which fell at six-over 148, took out Juli Inkster (seven over), Suzann Pettersen (seven over), Christina Kim (seven over), Karrie Webb (12 over), Grace Park (12 over) and the 12-year-old Alexis Thompson (16 over).Wie was also headed for a missed cut, but she never got there.In her latest stumble in a strange and trying season, Wie notified tournament officials that she could no longer continue because of pain in her left wrist. She was six over through her opening nine holes, had missed seven fairways in seven tries and was 17-over-par for the championship.“I don’t remember hurting this much,” she said.Although she did not compete Friday because most of the day’s round was wiped out by thunderstorms, Wie said she woke up Saturday feeling soreness in the wrist, which she broke while jogging in February. She was sidelined for four months.She said she aggravated it Saturday when she took a swing on the par-4 17th tee, her eighth hole of the day, “and after that, it kind of went downhill.”After hitting a driver into the rough to the right of the fairway on the par-4 18th hole, Wie winced when she hit her approach shot out of the rough and into a greenside bunker. When she hit a blast out of the bunker, she let go of the club with her left hand, allowing it to dangle by her side.After making a bogey, Wie sought out her physical therapist, Leanne Quinn, who massaged her right below the palm. Wie then hit a snap hook off the first tee, hit a punch shot from the rough and began a slow walk back to the clubhouse and to an uncertain future.Wie is scheduled to play in next month’s Evian Masters and the Women’s British Open in August, but she said she was unsure when she would play again.“I definitely have to play and work out to get stronger,” she said. “I definitely want to compete because that’s what I like to do, but I have to think about my health and just work on it.”Last month, at the Ginn Tribute, Wie also cited an injured wrist when she withdrew after 16 holes, although she showed no outward distress. At the time, she was two closing bogeys away from shooting an 88, which would have barred her from competing on the L.P.G.A. Tour for the rest of the year because she is not a member. (The rule does not apply at the United States Women’s Open, which is run by the United States Golf Association.)Gulbis said she overheard Wie talking with her caddie Saturday about the pain in her wrist.“She started having pain earlier and she was trying to play through it,” Gulbis said. “You could see she was having some problems. Every time she was trying to hit shots out of trees and out of rough, I’m sure it was hurting more. Michelle is a good friend of mine. I definitely feel for her.”With the third round suspended Saturday night at 8:05 because of darkness, Sunday’s final round could be a test of endurance as well as nerves. The forecast calls for a chance of thunderstorms and temperatures in the upper 80s. Lorena Ochoa, the top-ranked player in the world, and Cristie Kerr, ranked fifth, are vying for their first major championship. Morgan Pressel, who is two shots off the lead, is trying to capture her second major. Pressel, who won the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April, finished tied for second in the 2005 United States Women’s Open as an amateur. ... Ji-Yai Shin, 19, who turned professional at the end of 2005, said she dedicated her golf accomplishments to the memory of her mother, who was killed in a car accident while Shin was an amateur. Last season, she won the Korean Women’s Open, the most prestigious event on the Korean L.P.G.A. Tour.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','It was no surprise that Vince Carter opted out of the final year of his contract with the Nets on Friday and became a free agent yesterday. But the Nets expect to reach a new deal with him — in the four-year, $60 million range — as early as this week.“We’re certainly hopeful,” Rod Thorn, the Nets’ president, said during a telephone interview yesterday. “All of his public pronouncements have been that he would like to play for the Nets. We’d certainly like to have him.”No deal can be announced until July 11, even if they reach an agreement earlier.Carter, 30, joined the Nets less than midway through the 2004-5 season, and they have had limited postseason success with him. But he is a favorite of Bruce Ratner, the team’s majority owner, and as one of the league’s flashiest players, he sells tickets.Last season Carter averaged 25.2 points, 6 rebounds and 4.8 assists.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','Mr. Brennan said he worried that Forest City could be forced to scale back or even abandon later phases of the project if the real estate market sours, putting at risk some of the 2,250 units of subsidized rental housing planned. Most of those units are scheduled to be built during the project’s later years of construction, as are most of the market-rate units.“The affordable housing is the weakest link in a project that is otherwise financially very tight,” Mr. Brennan said. “This is disturbing, because the affordable housing was marketed as the main public benefit of the project.”But Forest City officials said that they remained confident in their prospects and in those of the neighborhoods around the project site, where sleek condo developments and stylish coffee shops lie near public housing projects, abandoned auto repair shops and weedy vacant lots.“Atlantic Yards does have a risk to it. It is a complicated project. And frankly, we understand that, and we’ve worked through that,” said Joanne M. Minieri, the company’s chief operating officer.Bruce R. Bender, the company’s executive vice president, said Forest City was committed to building all of the subsidized housing and had promised state officials that at least 30 percent of all the apartments built during the project’s first phase would be lower-priced units.“We said we will do 50 percent of rentals as affordable for low- and moderate-income families, and we will. And we made it legally binding,” he added. “Find someone else who does this and let us know.”Company officials also referred to an independent audit of the financial projections that was commissioned by state development officials and performed by the consulting firm KPMG. That audit, which was released in December, judged Forest City’s business assumptions to be broadly sound, though it forecast a lower return for the project’s investors than Forest City did.Forest City is also a development partner in the new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company.The documents, which Mr. Brennan provided to The New York Times, span from June 2003, when Forest City Ratner was in early discussions with the development corporation, to last November, the month before the project received final approval from the Public Authorities Control Board, which must sign off on large state-backed projects. The city and the state are contributing hundreds of millions of dollars, including direct subsidies, sales and mortgage recording tax exemptions, and tax-exempt bond financing.In settling Mr. Brennan’s lawsuit, the development corporation agreed to release the documents without conceding that they were legally subject to the state’s freedom of information law.The business plans from last October do not include information about one of the project’s buildings that was approved separately. And they represent only one snapshot of an ever-evolving, much-delayed project that still faces several lawsuits and has yet to begin rising in Brooklyn.But the business plans — among the documents available to state officials before they approved the project — still offer an unprecedented look inside Atlantic Yards.They indicate that Forest City and the project’s investors have paid a steep premium for design, most notably the services of Frank Gehry, among other architects. The documents cite architectural costs of just over $12 a square foot for the project, roughly three times the industry average.They show that the basketball arena, widely assumed to be a money-loser whose chief purpose was to make the project more appealing to city leaders, is expected to be profitable by the 2012-13 basketball season, when it would bring in $20 million a year in net revenue. Bruce C. Ratner, the chief executive of Forest City Ratner, is the principal owner of the Nets of the National Basketball Association and intends to move the team from New Jersey.The documents also provide a window into the considerable resources Forest City poured into early plans for the project, promoting it to the public, and getting it approved in a city that has proven inhospitable to some recent attempts at large-scale development. Those costs amounted to $19.5 million, according to one document, including money for litigation, public relations and Mr. Gehry’s initial designs.The entire complex would bring an estimated profit of $609 million by 2015 if all the project’s elements, including the Nets, were sold by that year, according to the documents. (According to company officials, the sales figures were included to help value the project for investors, and the company has no plans to sell the complex.) The documents indicate that investors would make a modest return of 7.7 percent on the arena and 9.6 percent on the rest of the complex over 12 years despite significant construction and housing subsidies from the city and state.Forest City itself would earn a development fee of 5 percent of the project’s total cost: roughly $200 million if the entire project is built as planned. Most of that, company executives said, would go toward recovering the company’s internal costs. They also said that Forest City owns a significant share of the project, in addition to being the developer.But the company’s assessment of Brooklyn’s residential market and the project’s construction costs may provoke the most scrutiny.The project’s 16 towers are scheduled to open in several increments, beginning in July 2009 with the completion of the signature tower, known as Miss Brooklyn, at Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, and concluding in April 2015 with a condo tower at Dean Street and Carlton Avenue.But their financial viability depends on Brooklyn’s high-end real estate boom penetrating from waterfront neighborhoods to the area farther inland, just east of Downtown Brooklyn, where Atlantic Yards will be built.In Miss Brooklyn, Forest City expects to sell condos for an average of $889 a square foot. (Even so, the residential portion of the building will lose money, according to the documents; revenue from office space will make it profitable.) Projected prices for the rest of the project’s condos rise steadily until the opening of the last tower in 2015, where condos are expected to sell for $1,069 a square foot.Real estate prices have grown rapidly in the gentrifying neighborhoods around the project, Fort Greene and Prospect Heights. But Andrew Gerringer, managing director of the development marketing group at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that buyers did not yet view those neighborhoods as being as desirable as Williamsburg, Dumbo or Brooklyn Heights, waterfront districts where the borough’s luxury real estate is now concentrated.A luxury building that Mr. Gerringer’s firm is marketing in Downtown Brooklyn is averaging about $750 a square foot in sales. On the waterfront, he said, “The high end of the market is probably blended at about $850 a foot, give or take.”It is not clear yet whether those prices will spread quickly to other parts of Brooklyn. Mr. Gerringer said that, according to his firm’s research, the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank building — just blocks from Miss Brooklyn — had sold less than half of its units by the middle of May, with an average price per square foot of less than $800. The building’s developer, the Dermot Company, not long ago cut its prices by 10 percent across the board after sales stalled, he said, though they have picked up again.Andrew C. MacArthur, a principal of the Dermot Company, said that he expected all of its apartments to sell by early 2008, including condos priced at up to $1,500 a square foot. But the company had not yet begun selling those units, he said.Before the Atlantic Yards condos can be sold, however, they must be built. According to the documents, the “hard costs” for the towers — chiefly construction material and labor — range from $259 to $369 per gross square foot, the price tag for Miss Brooklyn.A few developers said that they were currently building comparable buildings at similar costs. But most cited hard costs of $350 to $400 a square foot and higher, particularly when it came to the construction of high-end condos with union labor.“We’re seeing in the neighborhood of $425 per foot” for new construction, Mr. MacArthur said.Moreover, Forest City’s calculations appear to reflect only a modest increase in costs over roughly a decade of construction. A condominium tower scheduled to open in 2013 has hard costs of $314 a square foot; another one, opening in 2015, has an estimated hard cost of $324 a square foot.One developer, who asked not to be named for fear of angering the city and state officials who support Atlantic Yards, whistled when told of the estimates.“They aren’t really saying that, are they?” he said.But Forest City executives said they believed the projections were accurate.“I’m not surprised at everything that you’ve heard,” said Ms. Minieri, who noted that the developer’s last major project in Brooklyn, the MetroTech office complex, had had its share of naysayers.She also said that hard costs for Atlantic Yards would be partly reduced by several factors. For example, all of the residential buildings include underground parking, and several feature ground-level retail space. Both are cheaper to build than apartment units, she said, and bring down the overall square-foot costs of those buildings.Richard Moore, a real estate analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that Forest City had a reputation for careful planning and very conservative investments. But he also noted that even the most competent developers could not easily predict how a long-term project like Atlantic Yards would turn out.“I could see this project taking many forms over the years,” Mr. Moore said. “It could go either direction, I imagine.”'"
"'07-07-01,'0','In the short term, while many school districts across the country may be forced to revise or abandon race-based assignment plans, Seattle — which suspended its policy five years ago amid legal challenges that led to the Supreme Court ruling — will feel strikingly little impact from the ruling it helped prompt.But school officials say the Supreme Court decision, which left room for the use of race in limited circumstances, eventually will help them find new ways to steer schools like Ballard back toward more diversity, not less, a position that all but ensures that the debate over race and its distribution among schools here will be revived, not resolved by the ruling.For a city that regards itself as progressively liberal and is not often viewed as having the painful racial legacy shared by so many other American cities, Seattle has a history of sharply segregated neighborhoods, struggling public schools and the flight of white families.Through transfers, busing and complicated school-choice plans, the school district has been pursuing integration for four decades. Not everyone, however, has chosen to participate. The city, with one of the nation’s highest median household incomes, also has one of the highest rates of private school attendance in the country.This week, school officials seized on the opinions of the four dissenting justices in the 5-to-4 decision and the view of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who agreed with the majority but also emphasized “the important work of bringing together students of different racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds.”Gary L. Ikeda, the general counsel for the school district, said, “The heartening thing is that a majority of the court reaffirmed the principle of diversity in public education, and in Justice Kennedy’s opinion we now have some clarification in terms of how the heck we’re going to do that.”The parents who challenged the Seattle plan, however, emphasized that they were the ones who won in court on Thursday, and they urged the district to move beyond what they said was a preoccupation with social engineering rather than academics.“This obsession with race has hurt our schools,” said Jill Kurfirst, one of the parents who formed a nonprofit corporation to challenge the district. “It is time for the district to refocus its energy on improving all schools in all neighborhoods.”School officials say that is their intention, but that promoting diversity must be part of the effort.“By working in teams and interacting day to day with individuals different than themselves, students learn to better understand and respect themselves and others,” Raj Manhas, the district superintendent, said the day of the ruling. “They also learn to function in an increasingly global community and marketplace. Collaboration is the way of the future and these are skills best learned early in life.Last week, even as the district awaited the court’s ruling, the school board approved a framework for a new assignment plan that includes the goal of “fostering diversity” and potentially using race as a means to do so.With the tiebreaker suspended during the last five years, school officials have pointed to high schools like Ballard, in the northern part of the city, and Franklin, a nearly century-old school south of downtown that has gone from 79 percent nonwhite to 91 percent, as evidence of the demographic trends that can take hold without intervention.Opponents say the district is trying to fix something that is not broken.“The whitest school in the district is still more than one-third nonwhite,” said Harry Korrell, a lawyer who represented the parents who sued the district. “That doesn’t strike me as a segregated school district.”Seattle was never formally segregated by law, but a mix of housing restrictions and economic inequality sharply divided the city by race. By the late 1990s, with complaints rising that schools were unequal, the district began allowing students to help choose the school they attended.The integration tiebreaker was intended to push all 10 comprehensive high schools toward the demographics of the overall student population, which is about 60 percent nonwhite. The district initially required schools to keep their enrollment within 10 points of the overall percentage but later changed it to 15.The policy was more notable for the litigation it sparked than for its practical impact. The policy the court struck down applied only to high school enrollment, and it affected only about 300 students each year of the 46,000 in the district.In light of the court ruling, school officials are already emphasizing newer efforts to promote diversity with the indirect emphasis on race they believe the court will tolerate. They include placing appealing academic programs in schools that have particularly heavy minority populations in an effort to attract more white students and possibly redrawing enrollment boundaries around economically diverse neighborhoods to bring a broader mix of students to certain schools.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','The stock market managed only slight gains last week as worries over oil prices and subprime mortgage lending weighed on investors.The major stock indexes closed out the first half of the year higher, with the Dow Jones industrials up 7.6 percent since Jan. 1.On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods fell 2.8 percent in May, but takeover deals and strong earnings reports from several companies helped lift the major indexes that day.The Federal Reserve said last week that it remained concerned about inflation and kept its benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent.Shares of several financial companies ended the week lower after the Bear Stearns Companies stepped in to salvage two of its troubled hedge funds.For the week, the Dow rose 48.36 points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 13,408.62. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 0.79 points for the week, to close at 1,503.35. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.27 points, or 0.55 percent, to close at 2,603.23.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','A host of strategies surround value investing. Some managers of value funds choose to bet on just a handful of stocks.Depending on whom you ask, betting on just a few stocks is riskier because it depends on a savvy handful of picks. Others say this strategy is actually less risky because each investment represents greater conviction on the fund manager’s part.Choosing a small clutch of holdings is the approach of Larry S. Pitkowsky, Bruce Berkowitz and Keith D. Trauner, who run the $4.9 billion Fairholme fund. That fund, which is up 9.28 percent this year, has handily beaten the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over three years and five years, according to Morningstar. Fairholme invests in just 24 stocks.The world may view Fairholme as a value fund, but Mr. Pitkowsky does not really see a distinction between growth and value. He says all investing is value oriented. “Everything we do,” he said in a telephone interview, “is trying to buy dollar bills for 50 cents.”“There’s nothing wrong with buying a faster-growing company if your analysis of the future cash flow shows that the stock is cheap relative to its future cash flow,” he said. But, he added, “we want such a big margin of safety that we are normally unwilling to assume rapid growth for many years.”It is reassuring to think that one can find managers who keep beating the competition with just a handful of stocks. But even the best managers can run through tough years.Oakmark Select, a concentrated fund run by Bill Nygren a veteran value fund manager, and Henry Berghoef, was up 6.03 percent this year through Thursday, trailing the S.& P. by 1.1 percentage points. In recent years, the fund, with $6.3 billion in assets, has had just 20 positions and has had a disappointing performance relative to the S.& P. Recent holdings have included Washington Mutual, Yum Brands, McDonald’s and H & R Block.“Select is more suitable for some portion of a portfolio,” Mr. Nygren said. “There is more risk through concentration.”Value investors are quick to caution that patience may be needed for the payoffs. While the Oakmark Select fund has not kept up with the indexes in the last three years, it has had a 16.27 percent annualized return over the last 10 years. That is 8.49 percentage points better than the S.& P.It is noteworthy that Oakmark also offers a less concentrated fund, run by Mr. Nygren and Kevin E. Grant, and called just Oakmark, with 52 stocks. Like its sister fund, it has underperformed the S. & P. this year.Over the 10-year period, Oakmark has outperformed the S.& P., but by just a fraction of a percentage point.Mr. Nygren attributes the difference in long-term performance to a handful of successful stocks in the Select fund that accounted for a far larger percentage of that fund’s holdings. They included cable television stocks and investments in the Gucci Group and Amgen.For investors who do not want the risk of somewhat concentrated choices, there are index funds and even funds that function like index funds, selecting a broad array of stocks — by a set of metrics — with value characteristics.Among the more interesting is the Dimensional Fund Advisors U.S. Small Cap Value fund. It is effectively a hybrid of a value fund and an index fund.The Dimensional family of funds depends on a strategy developed by the economist Eugene F. Fama, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business who is credited with creating the term “efficient markets,” and Kenneth R. French, a professor of finance at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. The two believe that over a very long period, smaller stocks and value stocks deliver better returns. Dimensional has created a group of funds that rely on an index of such stocks.The fund, with $10 billion in assets, has turned in a stunning performance, handily beating the S.& P. in the 3-, 5- and 10-year periods. Over the last 10 years, it has had an average annual return of 15.84 percent, almost twice as good as the S.& P.For the five-year period, the numbers have been even better: Dimensional’s U.S. Small Cap fund generated an average annual return of 18.3 percent, versus 10.74 percent for the S.& P. Weston J. Wellington, a vice president at Dimensional, said that there are 1,329 stocks in the fund’s portfolio.Another value investor is Mario J. Gabelli. Gabelli Asset, with $2.9 billion under management, was Mr. Gabelli’s first fund. It owns 450 stocks, including a heavy dose of media shares, which have always appealed to him.Gabelli Asset has outperformed the S.& P. so far this year and underperformed it for the three- and five-year periods. Mr. Gabelli says the fund, which he describes as a surrogate for a classic value fund, is not looking to beat an index fund.“Our benchmark is to outperform 10-percent-plus inflation, which is now about 3 percent,” he said.But is this the best time to buy a value fund?Experts say it is as good a time as any. Few investors are ultimately smart about timing the market, and good value investors aim to find undervalued stocks even in a tough market.“Even in the late 1990s, value stocks did not get clobbered absolutely,” said Bruce C. Greenwald, a professor of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School. “They were going up 8 or 9 percent, compared to the market, which was going up 20 percent or more, and they made it up later.”Value may never have quite the greed-activating allure that growth stocks had in the late 1990s, when dot-com stocks seemed to reach new heights daily. But for investors with the patience, value — despite its recent run — is probably still a good bet.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','“Some folks start getting less happy at the wedding reception,” said Larry Bumpass, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who wrote the study with Professor Musick.“There is not necessarily anything magical about year three,” Professor Musick said. “We know that typically when marriages end in divorce, half end before seven or so years and half end after. This is the same idea.”Their analysis, which included unmarried, cohabitating partners but not gay couples, was based on the National Survey of Families and Households, a nationalsample of 9,637 racially diverse households conducted by the University of Wisconsin Center for Demography and Ecology. The research, coupled with a survey released today by the Pew Research Center, provides an intriguing look at an ethereal part of marriage. Everyone knows the first blush of love is the strongest, but measuring how long it will last and whether that bliss is unique to marriage has always fallen more into the category of “here’s what my mother says” than something quantifiable.In an academic paper they completed last year that analyzed earlier findings from the national surveys, Professors Musick and Bumpass compared responses to questions about how couples described their relationships, how often they fought and over what, and how they would envision their lives if they separated.The research doesn’t address whether blissful 21st-century relationships are any more or less enduring than they were in the 20th century, so it may be that happy coupledom always came with a three-year expiration date. With nonmarital childbearing more common and women more economically independent, “What’s keeping people together is their love and commitment for each other,” Professor Musick said, “and that’s fragile.”Anecdotal evidence suggests that the findings have some foundation.Bart Blasengame, a 33-year-old freelance writer from Portland, Ore., was with his former fiancée for three years. “I felt like, by year three, we were both forcing it,” he recalled.“It’s the whole cliché of pursuit,” he said. “Your dates are planned out like some Drew Barrymore romantic comedy with unicorns and rainbows. By year two, we were cruising along, living together, relatively happy. But from a growth standpoint things had started to atrophy. We were happy, content is a better word, but there was no spark.”But the evolving rules of marriage provide both opportunities and pitfalls, Professor Musick said. “There may be greater potential to find fulfillment in relationships,” she said, “but that possibility and the expectations that come from it may lead to greater disappointment for some” if the expectations aren’t fulfilled.Her bleak statistical assessment of the durability of enchantment is one of several new findings about relationships and marriage in America. In a word, the State of the Unions is precarious.Even with the nation’s population increasing, the number of married Americans age 21 to 54 has declined slightly since 2000 — apparently for the first time, as measured by the Census Bureau. In the first decade of the 21st century, the proportion of Americans in every racial and ethnic group who were never married has continued to grow by double digits.The United States is far from embracing Europe’s postmarriage model or its much higher rates of nonmarital births. Most Americans surveyed this year by the Pew center, in fact, still say marriage is an ideal, if a more elusive one.While roughly 9 in 10 American adults eventually marry, the time they spend married has declined sharply, in part because they are marrying later and living longer as widows. Moreover, the Pew survey found that 79 percent of Americans say a woman can lead a complete and happy life if she remains single. The comparable figure for men was 67 percent.While married couples generally say they are more satisfied with their lives, younger adults are far less likely to stigmatize alternatives such as living together and having children out of wedlock, according to the Pew telephone survey of 2,020 adults, which is available at www.pewresearch.org.The Pew survey found that nearly half of Americans in their 30s and 40s have cohabitated. Among all adults, a minority (44 percent) said that living together without getting married was bad for society (only 10 percent said it was a good thing), although the Pew survey concluded that “by providing an alternative to marriage, cohabitation for some appears to diminish rather than strengthen the impulse to legally marry.”In general, married people are presumed to be happier and better off, but Professor Bumpass, who found that most marriages nowadays are preceded by cohabitation, and Professor Musick questioned whether those benefits were unique to marriage and whether they are stable over time.“We conclude that the boundaries between marriage and cohabitation may become increasingly blurred,” Professor Musick said.As for the three-year itch, Byron Lester, a 49-year-old information technology administrator from Bloomfield, Conn., is well suited to consider it. Married three years and two months ago, he said the secret to success is often in the details. “Little things really do mean a lot,” he said.Mr. Lester said he abandoned his cherished newspaper reading during dinner because that is when his wife most enjoys conversation. “And I think she’s adapted to watching more sports,” he said.Marriage rates vary widely by race, ethnicity, education, income (63 percent of white women over 18 who make more than $100,000 are married; 25 percent of poor black women are). Soaring divorce rates have leveled off, most experts agree, but one reason may be that the dissolution of live-in relationships are not taken into account.Raoul Felder, the celebrity divorce lawyer whose favorite aphorism is that marriage is the first step on the road to divorce, says marital longevity has fallen victim to the velocity of our souped-up society.“We’re all addicted to a television-clicker lifestyle,” he said.But a dissipation of that all-enveloping rapture is no reason to give up on a relationship, many people insist.“At times, sure, I’m bored,” said Sean Meehan, 51, a therapist from West Hartford who has been married for 14 years. “Who isn’t? But you talk about it with your spouse and you can switch things up.”“People are so used to everything being disposable,” he said. “They throw out diapers, lighters, coffee cups, so they can throw out a marriage.”Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex adviser, cautioned, too, that the notion of a three-year itch can become self-fulfilling. “How dangerous it is to say something like that,” she said. “From now on, everyone who’s getting married will say it will last three years and then I will have to look for someone else.”Or, as Paul D. Neuthaler, a divorce mediator in Westchester, said: “The fizzle tends to bubble out within a three- to five-year period when the basis for the marriage was purely physical or related to some attraction not closely associated with each partner’s essential character.”Another new study, by Prof. Evelyn Lehrer of the University of Illinois at Chicago, contradicts the chestnut that women who marry later are more likely to divorce. She found that with both men and women marrying later than ever, later marriages seem to last longer.Stephanie Coontz, director of public education at the Council on Contemporary Families, a research group, said: “We’re getting close to a 180-degree turn in many of the rules about what makes marriage work and not work. The marriages of college-educated couples are becoming more stable.”Professor Musick is happily married herself — “mostly,” she says — and will celebrate her third anniversary this fall. “My honeymoon,” she mused, “is almost over.”Whatever the trends, marriage and relationships are in an unusual state of flux, as they were for baby boomers. With so much room to maneuver, younger couples have fewer firm markers to guide them.In the film “Knocked Up,” Ben beseeches his father for advice after his one-night stand results in a pregnancy.“I’ve been divorced three times,” his father replies. “Why are you asking me?”'"
"'07-07-01,'0','In the 1970s, many scientists and engineers, disenchanted with the Vietnam War, turned away from military problems. And in 1991, the breakup of the Soviet Union took away the mirror-image rival that American innovators could “race” against.Today the leading technologies are hatched by commercial companies pursuing lucrative and large civilian markets. “The U.S. government and its defense partners no longer are at the leading edge of most of the militarily-relevant technologies, having been displaced by international commercial industries and markets,” the Defense Science Board, an adviser to the Pentagon comprised of independent experts, concluded in a February report to the top brass entitled “21st Century Strategic Technology Vectors.”How did the military, which spends a great deal of money on research and development, get into the position of having to play catch-up in technological innovation?There is no single explanation. One factor is the spread-too-thin syndrome. Instead of ruthlessly prioritizing, or “putting all your wood behind one arrow,” as Scott McNealy, the C.E.O. of Sun Microsystems, likes to say, the Pentagon finances a myriad of smaller, incremental and ultimately cautious R & D projects that, while perhaps covering the innovation horizon, don’t add up to a great leap forward.Another factor is the Iraq war. Urgent battlefield problems, such as how to neutralize roadside bombs, understandably consume the “mind share” of military researchers, reducing time spent on longer-term questions.The multiplicity of current security threats is another barrier. “There is no single threat you can identity and rally people around,” says Bran Ferren, co-chairman of Applied Minds, a product designer in Glendale, Calif., that works on classified projects. “I don’t think there is a conspiracy” to prevent civilian technologists and the military from working closely together, Mr. Ferren adds. “It isn’t apathy, either. It is just a difficult coupling.”That’s partly because the American military is slower-moving and more conservative than, say, Google, Intel, Apple or other Silicon Valley pacesetters.The government’s choice of new weapons technologies, meanwhile, is sometimes influenced by political considerations, such as the Congressional districts of the contractors, or by how much money has been spent on competing systems that, while less effective technically, have more jobs and corporate profits riding on their selection. Finally, the government can insist on owning the “intellectual property” embedded in a device, a deal that scares off even patriotic innovators.“The process is ensuring the best minds aren’t working on military technologies,” says Warren Citrin, a radar expert who spent 18 years at the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University and from 2003 to 2005 was an executive at Raytheon, a large military contractor.Leadership is another missing ingredient. “The government isn’t going to researchers and saying, ‘Drop everything, work on terrorism.’ Instead, the government is telling them, ‘Proceed as before,’ ” says Daniel S. Greenberg, who has monitored military research in Washington since the 1960s and is the author of the forthcoming “Science for Sale.”Certainly, there is wisdom in the government not interfering too much in the commercial activities of America’s leading technology innovators. And there is always the possibility that people in the Pentagon are engaged in a huge disinformation campaign aimed at lulling America’s enemies into a false sense of security. Perhaps there is a crash program and that — shades of the old “X-Files” television series — the government just isn’t talking about it.“We cannot assume that the government did not galvanize the R & D community after 9/11,” says Terry C. Pierce, professor at the Naval Postgraduate School and an expert on military innovation. “There may be ongoing top-secret projects” of the world-changing sort.More likely, however, the government’s secret projects are modest. At a recent conference on military problems, Mr. Pierce bemoaned a lack of a coordinated effort by the military to advance and integrate a highly diverse set of technologies that would together realize what the Defense Science Board and other experts consider one of the highest national security aims: the need for ‘‘birth to death’’ tracking and identification of critical targets, whether they are people or things, anywhere in the world.The task is large and requires combining advances in sensors and satellites, data collection and analysis, pilotless attack planes and futuristic “directed energy” weapons. Huge breakthroughs are needed, such as batteries with at least 10 times the current life, and automatic translation systems that can turn foreign languages into English as people speak.Similar advances are required to turn soldiers into data collectors so effective that audio, visual and data records of battles can be replayed, TiVo-like, helping soldiers improve tactics and thwart enemies.For great leaps forward in military technology, the commercial market alone provides no answers. Instead, the gulf between civilian researchers and war-fighters — a gulf decades in the making that is addressed only haphazardly today — must be bridged. And the best way to do so is for both sides to agree on a grand national security challenge.In short, America needs a mega-project that brings together a Silicon Valley all-star team and the nation’s savviest soldiers.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','Honda began development of motorcycle air bags in 1990 and tested the system for a decade before making it available on the Gold Wing for 2007. A Honda spokesman, Jon Row, emphasized that the air bag was something of a last measure in today’s safety technology, and is not intended to replace the need to wear a helmet.Mr. O’Connell, 40, and the father of two young children, said the accident persuaded him to wear his helmet whenever he rides.The crash was something of a milestone in motorcycle safety, one of the few positive developments in recent years. Riding a motorcycle is becoming riskier. Deaths last year increased by 5.4 percent over 2005, according to preliminary estimates of the federal Fatality Analysis Reporting System, and are up for the ninth consecutive year. Deaths have increased 125 percent over 10 years, a period in which registrations rose more than 50 percent.Even when adjusted for more bikes covering more miles, the picture is grim. While the death rate for people in vehicles fell by about 17 percent for each mile traveled over that period, the rate for motorcycle riders more than doubled, according to the report.That timeline coincides with factors including a rising average age of riders, more powerful engines and the repeal of state laws requiring universal helmet use, in part a result of pressure applied by lobby groups that persuaded legislators to “let the rider decide.” Wearing a helmet cuts the risk of death by about 37 percent, according to Ted R. Miller, a researcher at the Pacific institute for Research and Evaluation. Making helmets mandatory increases use because police officers can check compliance at a glance.Measuring the effect of motorcycle helmet law repeals is tricky because of factors like the increase in motorcycle sales. Still, the numbers are powerful. Texas, which loosened its laws in 1977 and then reinstated universal coverage in 1989, again backed down on the regulations in 1997 for riders over 21; fatalities shot up 31 percent in the first year after the law was relaxed. A study in Florida sponsored by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that in the two years after that state repealed its universal helmet law in 2000, fatalities for every 10,000 motorcycles were up 21 percent, compared with 13 percent nationally.At the National Transportation Safety Board, the death toll has not gone unnoticed because it is now larger than the number of deaths in airplane, marine, railroad and pipeline accidents combined. Deborah A. P. Hersman, a member of the board who presided over a two-day motorcycle safety forum last September, said in an e-mail message, “This is the only mode of transportation in which the overall number of fatalities and the rate of fatalities continue to steadily rise, and yet there is no public outcry.”While it might seem that older riders would be more experienced and less likely to take risks, other factors may lie behind their portion of the fatality increases.“It’s the baby boomers,” said Barbara L. Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, a Washington-based group of state officials. Many riders are returning to bikes years after having given up riding, and “they don’t realize how powerful the bikes are,” she said.Government statistics support, in raw numbers at least, the assertion about older riders, even if the data cannot assign blame for the fatal crashes. Umesh Shankar, an analyst at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that the number of fatalities among riders 40 and over had more than tripled.The industry, though, says the statistics are misleading. The Motorcycle Industry Council, a trade association, says that the fatality rate — which takes into account miles traveled — has been calculated incorrectly, in part because the Transportation Department does not accurately tally the number of miles ridden. For instance, government statistics say motorcycles traveled 9.6 billion miles in 2003; the industry council’s research says they actually traveled 20.6 billion miles.The Motorcycle Safety Foundation, which is allied with the industry council, does agree that returning riders can be a problem. Dean L. Thompson, a spokesman for the safety group, said that older riders should “not be in denial about their skills, which decline over time.” Riders should know their limits, he said.With gasoline prices high, some riders are putting more miles on their bikes. Mr. O’Connell, the Gold Wing owner, loves to ride but also uses the bike in his business. He is a commercial real estate broker, and says when he arrives to show a property, the big Honda impresses customers.The industry’s consistent message is that more rider training will reduce the number of deaths. Last fall, Ms. Hersman took a basic rider course, and got a motorcycle endorsement on her Virginia drivers license.Ms. Hersman may be better prepared than most riders; according to the industry, only about 38 percent of riders have taken an organized rider education course. The Motorcycle Safety Foundation urges riders to take recurrent safety courses, wear protective gear and not ride while impaired.Air bags, which have cut the fatality rate in cars, are not adaptable to all motorcycles. They are well suited to touring models like the Gold Wing or the very popular cruiser bikes, where the rider sits upright, but sport bikes with a crouched riding position present a design challenge.Electronic antiskid systems, a technology that has been very effective in preventing car and truck crashes, are not applicable to two-wheel vehicles, but traction control devices are already available on many BMW motorcycles. In addition, BMW offers tire pressure monitoring, which can help riders prevent problems on the road.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','“Abbott School Districts Among the Top Spenders” (June 10) shows how New Jersey has reversed decades of separate and unequal financing for poor, urban schools. But it didn’t include an important piece of the overall puzzle.While New Jersey is near the top in school spending and No. 1 in support for poor, urban districts, it is tied for No. 38 in the share of school spending picked up at the state level. The state pays only about 40 percent of school costs, well below the national average of nearly 50 percent. This is why New Jersey’s local property taxes are the highest in the nation and why middle and wealthy suburban districts are pitted in competition with Abbott districts for an inadequate pool of state aid.The problem is not too much financing for poor schools, but inadequate support for all schools at the state (and federal) levels and the resulting overreliance on local property taxes to pay for education.This is what needs to be fixed as the state develops a new school financing formula.We need to sustain the Abbott commitments to poor, urban schoolchildren, and extend that support to all New Jersey’s children, wherever they live.For two years, Campbell Soup Company has worked with government officials from the city and county of Camden, and New Jersey, on plans to expand our headquarters and develop an office park in Camden.The vacant Sears building literally stands in the way.The issue is not, as you suggest, whether the building would “clash” with Campbell’s headquarters. It is whether a modern office park that includes the Sears building could succeed in Camden.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','""I hear tell,"" the SOCO said to Ransome, ""it's by someone called Utterson.""""Never heard of him.""""Worth a couple of hundred grand. My house didn't cost half that.""It was a bleak country landscape, maybe 30 inches by 20. Ransome had seen better work on the walls of his local hostelry. ""Who's that Hendricks is talking to?"" he asked.The SOCO looked over to where D.I. Hendricks was in close conversation with a short, bald, worried-looking man. He shrugged and shook his head, so Ransome wandered back toward the reporters and asked the same question.""Head of the National Galleries,"" he was told. ""And the guy just turning up runs the museums."" The newcomer was taller and calmer. He patted the Galleries boss on the shoulder, as if to comfort him. Ransome started moving slowly, until he was in listening range.""We think they were making the transfer,"" Hendricks was saying, ""and a member of the public interrupted them, so they bolted.""""Lucky for you they did, Alasdair,"" the Museums boss told his colleague with another pat to the shoulder.""We don't know if anything's missing,"" the man called Alasdair said, rubbing a hand across his forehead.""Full inventory needed?"" his colleague guessed. ""Wasn't one about to happen anyway?""""You're not off the hook, Donald,"" Alasdair said to the Museums boss. ""They could have walked off with anything. Most of the paintings are kept in the vaults, but the majority of your stuff is just lying there on the shelves.""""It's a good point, sir,"" Hendricks added. ""Sooner you start that inventory the better. Meantime, can I ask how many people knew about the warehouse?""""The whole bloody city,"" Alasdair hissed. ""This is Doors Open Day, remember?"" A taxi was drawing up, having been allowed through the cordon. ""Ah, here comes our resident expert,"" Alasdair said, striding forward to shake the passenger's hand. He then led the distinguished-looking gentleman toward the small group. ""Our chief curator's on holiday,'"" he was saying, ""but we're lucky enough to have the help of Prof. Robert Gissing.""More handshakes were exchanged, as Alasdair explained to Hendricks that Professor Gissing was in charge at the city's art college. The man himself seemed to realize he was being stared at and glanced in Ransome's direction, Ransome turning away a moment too late.Gissing, he was thinking. Robert Gissing. Friend of Mike Mackenzie . . . he'd been at the auction that day, too, same day as Chib Calloway, all of them ending up in the same wine bar.Small city, Edinburgh, he thought to himself. Almost like a village. . . .""Not too many snooker halls left,"" Chib was telling Mike as he switched on some of the lights. It was a cavernous, musty-smelling room. There were six full-size snooker tables, none in the best of health. Two were covered with dust sheets, while the remaining four had suffered nicks and rips to the green baize. A game seemed to have been abandoned on one of them; Mike rolled the pink ball toward the center pocket.""Why's this one shut on a Saturday?"" he asked.""Costing me too much money to run. I could put pool tables in instead, maybe a few slot machines. . . . "" But Chib wrinkled his pugnacious face. ""Probably end up selling it. Some developer can turn it into apartments or one of those huge superpubs.""""Why don't you do that yourself?""""With my reputation?"" Chib gave a chuckle. ""Doubt I'd get planning permission.""""You could bribe a few councillors.""""Or set up a front company, so no one knows you're in charge.""Another chuckle. ""Listen to yourself, Michael — maybe we should swap places, eh? You seem to be thinking more like a criminal every day.""""Maybe that's because I am a criminal.""""So you are,"" Chib agreed with a nod. ""Speaking of which. . . . "" He gestured toward the package under Mike's arm. Mike laid it down on one of the tables and carefully undid the brown paper.""An extremely good example,"" he said, ""of late-period Utterson.""""I'd still rather have had a Vettriano."" But Chib studied the painting, ran a finger along its edges. ""It's not framed,"" he complained.""The frame has to be elsewhere.""""I can't exactly take it into a shop, can I, tell them I want a nice new surround for it?""""Not exactly, no,"" Mike allowed with a smile. Chib met his eyes and smiled, too.""It was all right, then? My boys did what they were told?""""Your lads took them away in a bag.""""You didn't keep yours as a souvenir? Seemed to me you were getting a bit too attached to it. . . . """"And nobody got hurt?""""It was a piece of cake, Chib."" Mike laughed, ran a hand through his hair. ""If I could do it again, I'd grab twice as much.""""Getting a taste for it, Michael?""""We couldn't have done it without you.""""I still say you could have just swapped the paintings. No need for the stunt with the van.""""If nothing was missing from the warehouse, they'd be wondering what we were up to in there.""""Thinking more like a criminal every day,"" Chib repeated. ""So what happens now?""""They've already got Gissing at the scene. He'll verify the paintings are the originals.""""So long as his nerve holds.""""The plan itself was mostly Gissing's.""""And what about your other mate?""""Sure about that? See, the thing is this — we're connected now, aren't we? And out of the whole lot of us, the only one I trust is me."" He stabbed a finger toward himself. There was a sound at the door. A thin smile spread across Chib's face. ""A visitor,"" he said. ""Seeing how you've developed a taste, Mike, I thought you should be part of this.""""Part of what?"" But Chib was already heading for the door. He unlocked it, and in stepped a very tall ponytailed and tattooed man, incongruous in a powder blue suit. Chib brought the new arrival over to the table, where Mike was pulling his shoulders back, trying for a bit more height and heft.""This is Mr. Hate,"" Chib said by way of introduction. ""Hate, I'd like you to meet an associate of mine, Mike Mackenzie.""The way Chib said his name told Mike something was going on. The man called Hate meantime ignored him altogether, giving Mike the chance to study him. There was a dotted line along his neck with the words cut here. And when he rested his hands against the edge of the table, Mike saw the word hate tattooed on both sets of knuckles.""This is the collateral?"" Hate was saying.""This is it,"" Chib agreed.""And I am supposed to believe it is worth how much?"" The accent was Scandinavian, but Mike couldn't place it more exactly.""Michael here will tell you,"" Chib was saying.The Scandinavian gave a snort and picked up the canvas, none too gently, turning it over, studying it.Collateral, Mike was thinking. Calloway was about to hand the painting over to this monster, a monster who now had Mike's name and would forever link him to the painting. If it turned out not to be worth the figure quoted, would things turn nasty? He knew now why Chib had given Hate his name, why the gangster had wanted Mike here while the deal went down. We're connected now. Hadn't Chib said so himself?Hate meantime was sniffing the painting — actually sniffing it!""Doesn't smell so old,"" he commented.""None of that,"" Chib said with a wag of his finger. ""You think I'd try to pull a stunt? Get someone to verify it if you don't believe me.""But Mike held up a warning hand. ""The painting's stolen. But the only way anyone'll find out is if it starts to be seen by people.""Chib took a moment to break this information down. ""Oh, yeah,"" he said eventually. ""Good point.""""So I am supposed to trust you?"" Hate was asking.""You could go online,"" Mike told him. ""Look at other works by the artist, see what they've been fetching at auction. He's called Utterson. There have been exhibitions, books about him . . . he's famous, Mr. Hate.""Hate looked from one man to the other. He was still holding the painting, and Mike feared he was about to punch a hole through it. But he placed it back on the table instead and started to wrap the brown paper around it.""That's something I will need to ask my clients."" Hate tucked the package beneath his arm.""No way I can let you walk out of here if we don't have an understanding,"" Chib was telling the man.Hate stared at him. ""Then you'll have to stop me,"" he said, making for the door. The two men watched him leave, Chib's shoulders relaxing as the door slammed shut. Mike eventually broke the silence.""I don't want to know,"" was all he said, but he meant the opposite, something Chib seemed to realize.""I owe some money on a deal. The Utterson buys me time.""""I've heard that it happens with the Mafia and old masters.""""Well, now it happens in Edinburgh too."" Chib managed a tired-sounding laugh. ""Maybe I'm getting too old . . . sure you don't want to swap?""But Mike's cellphone was ringing. It was Gissing, so he took the call.""How did it go?"" he asked.""I'm still there."" Gissing was keeping his voice low. ""Listen, are you with our friend?""""If you mean Chib, the answer's yes.""""I just want to know if we've got a problem. I don't like the way this fellow was looking at me. Call me back in five.""Gissing ended the call. Mike just stared at the phone's blank screen.""Gissing's got something he wants us to see.""""The paintings? Don't tell me the paint's still wet. . . . ""The phone trilled: a photo was coming through. Chib came closer, the better to see the screen. Mike knew that Gissing had a quality cellphone and had used it to take pictures for a recent exhibition. His own phone was the latest model, too, with a nice big screen. The photo itself appeared in three horizontal chunks. It showed the profile of a man's upper half, taken from a distance and using the zoom, meaning it was slightly blurred. All the same, Chib let out a hiss of air.""That's Ransome,"" he said. ""He's a detective, been chasing me for a while.""""And now showing an unhealthy interest in the heist and the professor both."" Mike gnawed at his bottom lip for the best part of a minute, while Chib explained that Ransome had tailed him on and off for a while . . . reason he always took evasive action when driving anywhere . . . thought maybe the detective had given up, but then again . . . knew he was being tailed that day he'd happened into the National Gallery and bumped into Mike.""So he might have seen us there?"" Mike asked, not expecting an answer. He stared at his phone for a little while, then called Gissing back.""Houston, we have a problem,"" he began.Hate had brought his laptop with him, never traveled without it. With the painting — the possibly worthless painting — stowed in the rental car's trunk, he booted up the laptop and got onto the Internet. First thing to run was a search on Utterson. Then maybe he would have recourse to a bookstore or library, see if he could find someone who knew about the artist. The man back in the snooker hall — Mackenzie, if that was his real name — had warned that the painting was hot. Well, that wasn't Hate's problem, was it? His problems only started if the painting turned out to be worth less than Calloway owed. He needed to know, and that meant asking someone.And showing them the painting, of course.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','“Never,” I said. On the scale of filial rebellion, I rank below Prince Hal and James Dean, but I was determined to purchase a hot dog from an independently owned business. The Chicago Hamburger Company turned out to be just a 10-minute drive from my parents’ house. It was also closed.“Why is everything always closed in Phoenix?” Elijah asked.The retail options near the party were limited. One local tavern boasted the “Best of Phoenix Wine Burger.” If I’d taken Elijah there, I would have reported myself to Child Protective Services. So I drove around Central Phoenix in a state of existential dread. It had been 20 years since I left this desert dump, and here I was again, lost in a scorching maze of car dealerships and crummy strip joints. Then I saw the sign: Costco. It didn’t occur to me to not pull into the lot. My kid wanted a hot dog, and here was salvation. I, the son, had at last become the father, or maybe it had happened long before. The truth is, I’ve been a Costco member since 2003.Inside, I ordered him a hot dog and got myself a dubious slice of pizza.“I want to sit somewhere clean,” Elijah said, walking around the tables.The one he found was the exactly the same as all the others, though maybe they all just looked dirty under the flickering grayish fluorescent light that gave the eating area the ambience of an Eastern-bloc interrogation room. I went to get a couple of bottles of water and turned around just in time to see the hot dog slip out of Elijah’s hand and onto the floor.“FIVE-SECOND RULE!” I shouted. Though five-tenths of a second probably would have been too long on that floor. Luckily, I got the second dog free. Elijah began to nibble, eagerly. And then he paused. There was a little blond hair hanging between his lips.“Please tell me that’s your hair,” I said.“I think Costco might be a magic place.”Twenty minutes later, we were at the party. To my relief, it was not some deranged, television-newsmagazine sting. The adults were mostly from my Internet friend’s church, and they were all mellow, kind and wholesome. There was indeed a Slip ’n’ Slide, with kids playing on it. Elijah couldn’t have been more excited if there had been camel rides. He slipped and slid and ate two Popsicles, a bowlful of popcorn and some goldfish crackers.Meanwhile, I learned that my Internet friend’s wife had grown up near me. And their house reminded me a lot of the houses I’d played in during my childhood in Phoenix. I felt oddly comfortable. A game of Wiffle ball broke out. I pitched underhand, and the kids took turns hitting.In one evening, I had been the rebellious son, the responsible dad and then the child again. I had lived the entire circle of life, minus death. But that slice of pizza began to take care of that. As it churned in my guts I started to feel very old, and yet strangely at peace. Then it got dark, and it was time to go home.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','If the closing is reversed, it could change things for Eatontown, which is set to acquire a golf course and Howard Commons, 486 units of military housing that have been vacant since 1991. But with growth comes expanded civic responsibilities like providing schools and public services, Mr. Tarantolo said.Oceanport could grow by more than 400 acres if Fort Monmouth closes. Mayor Lucille Chaump said that although Oceanport has fewer residents who work at Fort Monmouth than other neighboring communities, losing the fort would be an economic drain for the region and a brain drain for the country.Ms. Chaump has worked to catalog places of historical interest at Fort Monmouth, including memorial fields, markers and housing, and she said she would work to get some of them listed on the National Register of Historic Places whether or not the fort stays open. She has also requested that the marina that Oceanport would acquire if the fort closes remain as open space through a conservation easement.“It would be great if it didn’t close, but we have to be proactive and move ahead with the plans that we have,” she said.Peter Maclearie, the mayor of Tinton Falls, which is set to gain 252 acres, has said he would like to preserve the land as open space.The fort, which specializes in information technology, electronic warfare and sensor technology, employs 5,000 people, supports 22,000 additional jobs and generates more than $3 billion annually. The Defense Department plans to move many of the operations to Aberdeen, Md.Representative Frank Pallone Jr., whose district is near the fort, said the Defense Department originally said the cost of closing Fort Monmouth would be $780 million, then recently put the cost at $1.5 billion. “Basically double,” he said.Mr. Pallone said moving operations to Maryland would prompt experts and scientists working for the military at Fort Monmouth to move to the private sector rather than relocate. He said he believed the Defense Department withheld information that many workers would be lost.“I’ve always felt that Fort Monmouth should stay open,” he said. “There’s no practical reason it would have to move.”Representative Rush D. Holt, whose district includes the fort, called it “a bad decision badly made.” He said that for the sake of national security, he did not want operations at the fort interrupted.“There’s important work being done at Fort Monmouth that should not be interrupted as the Army tries to get people to move from one place to another,” he said.Scott Mulhauser, a spokesman for Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, said the senator was eager to see the results of the investigation.“This report will reveal a lot of what the Department of Defense knew and when they knew it,” he said.'"

"'07-07-01,'0','A donation of $200 per couple pays for the ceremony; six marriage preparation classes at two hours each; and a church reception — complete with a Champagne toast and finger food.And the church approves of the wedding. “What he’s doing is perfectly legitimate, acceptable and encouraged,” said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York.Matrimonio masivo is common in Latin America and is being offered more regularly in Westchester. At the Church of the Assumption in Peekskill, a largely Hispanic parish, eight couples were married in September. St. Ann’s Church in Ossining will hold a group wedding later this month.Some Hispanic couples do not marry in the Catholic Church because of the expense or because they feel that the process is too daunting, Father Ploch said. Some are deterred by their immigration status.“If they are undocumented, they think that getting married in the church will put them on the radar screen,” Father Ploch said, adding that such fears were unfounded.Many couples, like Dolores and Santiago Vazquez, who have four children and were married civilly 13 years ago, cling to dreams of a big church wedding in their homeland. “My mother, father, brother and sisters are in Mexico,” Mr. Vazquez, 44, said. “We were waiting, hoping we’d be there long enough to get married.”He said they decided not to wait, “because we’re waiting to go to Mexico, and it doesn’t happen.”Mrs. Vazquez, 47, who is from Guatemala, said it was her dream to get married in the church. “I feel like it’s the first time I’m marrying my husband,” she said.One June evening at the Holy Rosary rectory, Father Ploch, 61, reviewed the meaning of the sacrament of marriage with the couples, study that is required by the archdiocese. After showing a video, he explained the events of the wedding ceremony.Sebastiana Santos, who is Brazilian, and her partner, Manuel Gil, a Colombian, both 45, demonstrated. Facing each other and holding hands, they repeated the vows, laughing nervously, and were applauded.Silvia Garballo, who is 20 years old and 8 months pregnant, sat after class with her fiancé, Rolando Guardado, 23. They said they grew up in the same town in El Salvador and fell in love when she was 13. After he immigrated three years ago, he sent her a ring on Valentine’s Day. In September, she made her way to Mexico, swam across the Rio Grande, but landed in jail, she said. He received an advance on his chef’s salary to help pay her $7,000 fine, so the budget wedding is a godsend.“I’m so happy,” she said. “I wish the wedding was today.”Joanne Mogrovejo, 40, said that growing up in an Italian family in Mount Vernon, she dreamed of having a church wedding, with a single bride and groom. That was before Walter, a native of Ecuador, “swept me off my feet,” she said. Unable to afford a traditional wedding, they eloped. Four years ago, on their 10th anniversary and after raising two sons, they decided to get married in the church.“We both wanted to receive the sacrament to be complete, and to set an example for our kids,” she said.Every priest they approached turned them away. Then they found Father Ploch.Mrs. Mogrovejo said she had warmed up to the idea of sharing her day. “It’s nice to know we’re all in the same boat,” she said.And sharing the same aisle.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','“You try this at home, and your whole bathroom is trashed when the dog shakes,” said the owner, Jessica Easter. “Here, it’s quick, easy, fun, and we take care of the mess, for around $15 a dog.”There are also new dog cleanup businesses across the state, including Pet Butler in Fairfield, Doody Calls in Plainville, Poop Patrol in Greenwich and the Daily Scooper in Guilford.Several restaurants around the state have also recently invited owners to bring their dogs with them to dine outside, from Hot Tomato’s in Hartford and the Place in Guilford, to Seamen’s Inne Restaurant and Pub in Mystic and Marty’s Cafe in Washington.Barbara Gold, who owns Marty’s with G. Blane Withers, said her clients were so crazy about dogs that she was holding a “Best Dog in the World Contest” on July 1.The contest has drawn over 100 applicants from around Connecticut, including a Washington woman who drives by the cafe every day in her convertible, campaigning for votes — she and her Pomeranian in matching hats and rhinestone sunglasses.The winner will be announced at the Washington Primary School pavilion at 2 p.m. It costs $5 to enter and $1 to cast a vote. Proceeds benefit the pet therapy program for cancer patients at New Milford Hospital.“Everyone in Connecticut has a dog, and everyone is madly in love with their dog,” said the author Candace Bushnell, of “Sex and the City” fame, who lives in Roxbury and will be a judge for the contest.At the upscale boutique J. Seitz & Company, in New Preston, a flyer urges “Vote for Number 36!” with a picture of a Chihuahua dressed in a fly fisherman’s outfit.J. Seitz has also begun selling such over-the-top products as Zen meditation chew toys for dogs and, for their obsessed owners, pink plaid puppy purses, quirky dog key chains and books about dog names.“People see their dogs like their children, their grandchildren,” said the store’s owner, Joanna Seitz. “The fun is in the fact that you can spoil your dogs royally without ruining them.”In New Milford, Debbie Bauman left her job in commercial development last fall to open the Barkery Boo’tique, a glittering shop full of gourmet treats, toys and velvet doggie beds, as well as apparel to match any dog’s personality, from Terminator to Tinker Bell.“The dogs come in and pick out their own stuff,” Ms. Bauman said. “We’ve got a Jack Russell who comes in once a week and jumps straight up in the air, as high as the counter, to see what’s new. He doesn’t stop until he gets what he wants.”Doggie birthday cakes and party favors are also big sellers. “We have a whole variety of peanut butter birthday cakes for dogs,” Ms. Bauman said.Carolyn Klemm of Washington was planning a dog party for her Standard poodle, Elmer, who turned 2 on June 21. “Elmer is huge and delicious and the love of our lives,” Ms. Klemm said. “We’re having all of his best friends over for ice cream cake. Everyone gets their own seat at the table, party hats, and doggie-treat party favors.”At Hot Tomato’s, dogs have become the main attraction at the outdoor patio, said the assistant manager, Dale Kirshnitz. “Everyone brings their dog and checks out each others’ dogs,” she said. “It’s quite the scene.”At the Place in Guilford, a co-owner, Gary Knowles, said the dogs range from Great Danes to Chihuahuas “that sit in bread baskets on the table.”“We give the dogs their own water bowls, and we special order whatever they want,” he said. “Most of them go crazy for the roasted chicken and the hot-buttered corn.”'"
"'07-07-01,'0','THE relationship between a father and a son is always tangled. For Edmond Genest and Mark Saturno, it’s complicated by the fact that they’re not even related — their family ties exist only on the stage.They met when they were both hired for the 2003 Broadway production of William Nicholson’s family drama “The Retreat From Moscow” — Mr. Saturno as understudy for the son, Mr. Genest as understudy for the father. Two years later, they got to star in the play, when Steve Campo presented it at TheaterWorks in Hartford. And now they’re back working for Mr. Campo as yet another father-and-son team, in Caryl Churchill’s “A Number.”But it isn’t a case of been-there-done-that. Ms. Churchill’s play, a spare, elliptical series of encounters between the father, Salter, and three men who share his genes, has little room for the kinds of father-son dilemmas that come up in “Death of a Salesman,” “Long Day’s Journey Into Night” or, for that matter, “The Retreat From Moscow.” Only one of the sons who call on Mr. Genest’s Salter is his natural-born offspring. The other two, also played by Mr. Saturno, are clones, identical cell for cell but vastly different in history and temperament.The questions Ms. Churchill raises in her play run deep — questions about identity, love and free will. But the actors began with simpler questions. “There’s no punctuation in the play,” Mr. Genest, 63, said recently. “What does that mean? These are run-on sentences, but you can’t talk like that. Are they dangling? Cut off? Floating thoughts?”Mr. Saturno, 33, found it challenging, too. “You have to read between the lines and put in your own punctuation. Is this a question, a statement, an ellipsis? I’d work on the first scene. Then when I’d read it again, I’d say, ‘No, no, that’s all wrong. The sense of that is completely different.’ ”'"
"'07-07-01,'0','“I only play big instruments,” he said.Each sound is sampled by a computer program and labeled. From the samples Mr. Bertolozzi is isolating pitches and percussive effects and will use them to compose and record a 45- to 60-minute suite called “Bridge Music.”If all goes according to plan, the project will culminate in public performances piggybacked on celebrations in 2009 commemorating the 400th anniversaries of Henry Hudson’s trip up the river and Samuel de Champlain’s journey to the lake named after him. Twenty-two percussionists stationed along the bridge and a singer at the top of one of the towers will perform the work, to be transmitted over loudspeakers to audiences on the riverbanks.The New York State Bridge Authority has given its approval, lending Mr. Bertolozzi workers during his handful of visits so far and accepting his presence with amused benevolence. He awaits word from the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial Commission on whether it will endorse the project or provide funds.An endorsement, at least, would help Mr. Bertolozzi raise money from other sources. He estimates he needs $1.8 million, an outlandish sum for an obscure composer without a major institutional connection.UP on the bridge, while huge freighters slowly sailed down the Hudson as if they were whales, Mr. Bertolozzi’s persistence — bordering on obsession — had the whiff of Ahab.“I’m not trying to prove anything,” said Mr. Bertolozzi, who has amassed an impressive amount of information about bridge engineering along the way. “I just want to play the bridge. Whoever thought anybody would get to this point doing something like this?”While his quest may seem quixotic, elements of Mr. Bertolozzi’s idea have precedents in music history. Found instruments from tire rims to metal sheets have often been used in percussion pieces. Big art is often found in natural settings, as with Mount Rushmore or a Christo installation. Composers like Ives and Copland celebrated the American outdoors too.Such points are made by Andrew Tomasello, an associate professor of music at Baruch College and the City University of New York Graduate Center, in a testimonial that Mr. Bertolozzi includes in a packet of information laying out his vision and credentials. “The proposal is an exciting and original one,” Mr. Tomasello writes.Bridges have inspired other composers. Tobias Picker’s “Keys to the City,” a concerto for piano and orchestra, evokes the Brooklyn Bridge and was performed on it during a celebration of its centenary in 1983. Last year Bill Fontana attached eight vibration sensors to the Millennium Bridge in London and transmitted the sounds to a room in the Tate Modern.Mr. Bertolozzi has done something different.“I’m actually using the bridge as an instrument,” he said. “It’s not aleatory. There’s no guesswork. I have an army of percussionists playing a percussion instrument.”And then there is the setting. “Look at the theater I have,” Mr. Bertolozzi said, spreading his arms wide toward the Hudson. “Not only is the bridge magnificent, the venue is exalted.”Early in the day Mr. Bertolozzi, wearing a black T-shirt under an unbuttoned burgundy shirt and black pants, collected sounds under the bridge road. He worked on a traveler, a motorized platform that gives bridge workers access to the underside of the deck.Rick Warr, the worker who would later shimmy up to bang the cables, and another laborer, Deven Fisher, were there to help, wearing neon yellow-green shirts and handing up mallets, cleaning surfaces with alcohol and attaching the contact microphones. Ron Kuhnke, the sound engineer, sat at a laptop on the walkway above. The traveler vibrated with the passing of vehicles.Mr. Bertolozzi used an array of striking instruments at each spot, in a set order, starting with two rubber mallets with the names of his wife, Sheila, and daughter, Sarah, inscribed on the handles. He used ball-peen, Lucite and rubber-coated hammers and a pair of dowels, warning a visitor about the potentially infection-bearing effects of the copious pigeon droppings.Mr. Warr and Mr. Fisher helped willingly and took Mr. Bertolozzi’s unusual idea in stride. “He’s a good guy,” Mr. Fisher said. Mr. Warr added, “Easy day for us.” With their lunch break approaching at 11:45 a.m., Mr. Bertolozzi worked quickly, snatching up mallets and yelling to Mr. Kuhnke that he was moving to the next set of hammers. A train rumbled along the shore. “The sounds are unremarkable themselves,” Mr. Bertolozzi said. “It’s when you put them together that you make music.”Mr. Bertolozzi, who lives in nearby Beacon, said he became interested in composing when he was 10. He studied organ, graduated from Vassar College and now earns his living as an organist at Vassar Temple in Poughkeepsie and the Lutheran Church of the Resurrection in Mount Kisco. He collects gongs and has created a battery of them for composition and performance. His catalog of more than 75 works includes pieces for orchestra, band, small chamber ensembles and organ.He has long been a student of instrumental physics. Organs are a study in columns of air and resonance. His gongs taught him about how sound waves propagate across metal and how the kind of metal and its thickness alter the tone.So when he looks at the bridge, he said, he sees something in its spindles and handrails and trusses and ropes that means more than suspension, support and transport. “It’s a whole percussion ensemble,” he said.Mr. Bertolozzi said he had thought long and hard about the physics behind the sounds that elements of the bridge might produce. For the most part the solid steel structural elements of the bridge produced the thuds and clangs he expected, he said. But the suspension ropes, which are actually made of steel, were a surprise. “I was thinking that because they were so dense and so rigid they might act like a chime,” he said, or perhaps a bell.“I was wrong,” he added, immensely pleased by a fruitful mistake.The ropes, it turned out, were not so taut as to be immobile. When struck, they sway back and forth like a plucked guitar string. “When we finally played it,” he recalled, “the very short ones sounded like a bass guitar or marimba.”Air is not a good conductor of sound, so he and his technicians have added microphones to the metal structure, just as an electric guitar has pickups on its body to capture and amplify the strings’ vibrations.He handed over headphones so the sounds could be heard. The result was an otherworldly “Puh-THEW!-Whew!-Whew! ...”But why go to the trouble to try a live performance when all the sounds are on his hard drive? “I could sample a cat in Bulgaria and sample someone drinking a glass of water and put it together,” he said, but living performers make the difference. “I wanted to put a human fingerprint on this project.”SEVERAL strands of Mr. Bertolozzi’s career led to this place high above the Hudson. In 2004 he composed a piece for Poughkeepsie’s 150th anniversary that included using the band of the United States Military Academy at West Point, the stationing of trumpeters in two civic buildings and the ringing of the town’s church bells. “It was like playing the city,” he said. The gong music was another avenue.The bridge idea was born, Mr. Bertolozzi said, in September 2004, when he and his wife returned home after a gong performance. Passing a poster of the Eiffel Tower (where they met and first kissed) in their home, Sheila Bertolozzi whimsically made a gong-striking gesture toward it. “And I said, ‘Of course!’ ” Mr. Bertolozzi recounted.Perhaps there was music in the banging of the Eiffel Tower, he speculated. But Paris was impractical. “I thought, ‘What can we do here?’ ” Mr. Bertolozzi said. The bridge came to mind. Through a mutual friend he approached the bridge authority’s communications director, who was intrigued, and approached the agency’s executive director, George C. Sinnott.Mr. Sinnott was skeptical. “Quite frankly people were wondering if Mr. Bertolozzi had his head screwed on straight,” he said. “Everybody wondered if this guy was a kook.” He had Mr. Bertolozzi checked out and found that he was a serious composer. Why not give him a chance? he thought. After all, the authority’s charter says it should act for the “economic and social benefit” of the community, and the bridges often play a role in charity events.With the approval of the authority’s chief engineer, William J. Moreau, Mr. Bertolozzi was given permission in July 2006 to collect his first samples. He created “Bridge Funk,” a 2 minute 16 second calling card for the commissioners, who had to sign off on the project. (Available through josephbertolozzi.com, the piece will serve as a movement in the suite.) In November Mr. Bertolozzi was given 10 minutes at a board meeting to make his pitch. The commissioners heard “Bridge Funk” and gave approval.The authority has stood behind the project, even urging the quadricentennial commission to approve it, despite scattered complaints that it is a waste of money, officials said.“It’s a kick,” Mr. Sinnott said of the piece.The bridge, its main span 1,500 feet long, is already a cultural symbol to its community. Built between 1925 and 1930, the soaring Gothic towers and suspension cables show up on logos of local businesses and organizations.Mr. Moreau, the bridge’s longtime engineer, said he has always seen the bridge as a machine: a device that gets people from one place to another with the structural integrity to carry 35,000 vehicles each day but flexible enough to accommodate 40 inches of expansion and contraction along its length.It also makes a lot of noise. “We’re very familiar with the screeches and groans that it makes,” Mr. Moreau said. But until Mr. Bertolozzi’s project, he added, “we never thought of it as a musical noise.”So Mr. Bertolozzi’s proposal struck him as “pretty bizarre,” he said. “I had to conceptualize how the noise would be played without damaging the bridge.” During test runs, he said, the hammers and mallets make the paint on the ropes shake away like silver dandruff. “We’ll be dealing with that,” he said.Since he has been watching Mr. Bertolozzi, Mr. Moreau has come to see a new dimension to his bridge, he said. “Bridge Funk” opened his eyes and ears. “The physics of it didn’t make a lot of sense to me at first,” he added, “but he’s teaching me something here.”During one of the many lulls between setups and whamming Mr. Bertolozzi picked up two of the heavy wooden dowels from his bucket and faced the railing. With no microphones attached, he began to play the railing, striking the top in a rapid, jazzy beat and punctuating phrases with a rattling rake across the skinny balusters.The metal pinged and rang with the heavy blows, and Mr. Bertolozzi increased the tempo, rocking on his heels, his shoulders rolling. The scarred wood began breaking in his hands. Splinters flew as he sweated in the midday sun.For a moment it was the opposite of the careful sound-by-sound sampling. This was performance. Music. A boy playing on a bridge.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','Risk aversion is also showing up in the derivatives market, where the issuance of collateralized debt obligations is slowing. Last year, issuance of collateralized debt obligations — which include commercial and residential mortgages, corporate loans and small-business loans — approached $500 billion, up from $235 billion in 2005, according to Thomson Financial. But that flood is subsiding: global issuance of these pools of debt securities came in at around $46 billion in June, well down from the $62 billion issued in March.The mortgage market, meanwhile, continues to reel. Last week, the Carlyle Group, a big private equity firm, reduced by 25 percent the size of a fund backed by mortgage securities that it plans to offer to investors. The firm also cut the offering’s projected price.A retrenchment on risk is not surprising, given that the anything-goes mentality among investors has lasted for the past three years. The mortgage market’s woes were the first to tip the balance, but corporate bonds, stocks and private equity will also feel the effects of a pullback in risk-taking.“Until now we were in a period where risk was underpriced,” said Nouriel Roubini, a professor of economics at New York University’s Stern School of Business and chairman of Roubini Global Economics. “Debt was so cheap that anybody could take a semiprofitable company private and leverage it. Now the price of this is going to be more expensive.“There are some $200 billion of L.B.O.’s in the pipeline,” he added. “I think some of them might not be done or they will be done at a higher cost.”There is — as there always is — a historical parallel here. Go back to the late 1980s and you will see another easy-money era when a real estate bubble and takeover mania was fueled by the issuance of risky securities, in that case junk bonds. Back then, the firm at the center of the profits — and later, the plunge — was Drexel Burnham Lambert. Michael R. Milken, its brilliant bond impresario, figured out how to raise money for companies that investors had previously shunned (the corporate version of subprime mortgages).Savings and loan institutions, using insured deposits, were the manic lenders 20 years ago. Commercial real estate development and multifamily housing projects were the favored investments. When that party ended, the United States taxpayer had to foot the bailout bill. It cost $140 billion.Back then, as now, the public watched with dismay as big players in the takeover game pocketed enormous sums. (Remember Mr. Milken’s $500 million payday? It was in 1987.) The takeover titans’ gains were especially distasteful when viewed against mass firings at companies that had been taken over in leveraged buyouts financed by junk bonds.TODAY we have subprime mortgages being financed by hedge funds, pension funds, insurance companies and other institutional investors. But these same investors have also been lax in their lending to corporations issuing debt, often at the behest of private equity managers who hope to take those companies private.“In both the L.B.O. market and collateralized loan markets there are practices that are the equivalent of the reckless lending in subprime mortgages,” Mr. Roubini said. “Subprime people will say it was a niche problem. That’s nonsense.” And the correction of those freewheeling ways has only just begun.Mr. Milken’s successors on the big money front are hedge fund managers and private equity guys, and their ostentatious displays of wealth have started to attract unwanted attention from lawmakers in Washington — concerned about such mundane things as taxes.But what may be most unseemly about all this is that many of the lucrative fees being generated by these managers — the money that finances their lavish lifestyles — are coming out of the pockets of pensioners. Police officers, firefighters, teachers, sanitation workers — hard-working people who just want to be able to retire comfortably someday — are the pension fund investors paying enormous fees to get into hedge funds and private equity deals.There will always be haves and have-nots. But that doesn’t make the ever starker contrast between the two any more desirable.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','That's all to the public good, but hiding in plain sight was the little-noted content of the Bush executive order that Mr. Cheney is accused of violating. On close examination, this obscure 2003 document, thrust into the light only because the vice president so blatantly defied it, turns out to be yet another piece of self-incriminating evidence illuminating the White House's guilt in ginning up its false case for war.The tale of the document begins in August 2001, when the Bush administration initiated a review of the previous executive order on classified materials signed by Bill Clinton in 1995. The Clinton order had been acclaimed in its day as a victory for transparency because it mandated the automatic declassification of most government files after 25 years.It was predictable that the obsessively secretive Bush team would undermine the Clinton order. What was once a measure to make government more open would be redrawn to do the opposite. And sure enough, when the White House finally released its revised version, the scant news coverage focused on how the new rules postponed the Clinton deadline for automatic declassification and tightened secrecy so much that previously declassified documents could be reclassified.But few noticed another change inserted five times in the revised text: every provision that gave powers to the president over classified documents was amended to give the identical powers to the vice president. This unprecedented increase in vice-presidential clout, though spelled out in black and white, went virtually unremarked in contemporary news accounts.Given all the other unprecedented prerogatives that President Bush has handed his vice president, this one might seem to be just more of the same. But both the timing of the executive order and the subsequent use Mr. Cheney would make of it reveal its special importance in the games that the White House played with prewar intelligence.The obvious juncture for Mr. Bush to bestow these new powers on his vice president, you might expect, would have been soon after 9/11, especially since the review process on the Clinton order started a month earlier and could be expedited, as so much other governmental machinery was, to meet the urgent national-security crisis. Yet the new executive order languished for another 18 months, only to be published and signed with no fanfare on March 25, 2003, a week after the invasion of Iraq began.Why then? It was throughout March, both on the eve of the war and right after ""Shock and Awe,"" that the White House's most urgent case for Iraq's imminent threat began to unravel. That case had been built around the scariest of Saddam's supposed W.M.D., the nuclear weapons that could engulf America in mushroom clouds, and the White House had pushed it relentlessly, despite a lack of evidence. On ""Meet the Press"" on March 16, Mr. Cheney pressed that doomsday button one more time: ""We believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons."" But even as the vice president spoke, such claims were at last being strenuously challenged in public.Nine days earlier Mohamed ElBaradei of the International Atomic Energy Agency had announced that documents supposedly attesting to Saddam's attempt to secure uranium in Niger were ""not authentic."" A then-obscure retired diplomat, Joseph Wilson, piped in on CNN, calling the case ""outrageous.""Soon both Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Congressman Waxman wrote letters (to the F.B.I. and the president, respectively) questioning whether we were going to war because of what Mr. Waxman labeled ""a hoax."" And this wasn't the only administration use of intelligence that was under increasing scrutiny. The newly formed 9/11 commission set its first open hearings for March 31 and requested some half-million documents, including those pertaining to what the White House knew about Al Qaeda's threat during the summer of 2001.The new executive order that Mr. Bush signed on March 25 was ingenious. By giving Mr. Cheney the same classification powers he had, Mr. Bush gave his vice president a free hand to wield a clandestine weapon: he could use leaks to punish administration critics.That weapon would be employed less than four months later. Under Mr. Bush's direction, Mr. Cheney deputized Scooter Libby to leak highly selective and misleading portions of a 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq to pet reporters as he tried to discredit Mr. Wilson. By then, Mr. Wilson had emerged as the most vocal former government official accusing the White House of not telling the truth before the war.Because of the Patrick Fitzgerald investigation, we would learn three years later about the offensive conducted by Mr. Libby on behalf of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush. That revelation prompted the vice president to acknowledge his enhanced powers in an unguarded moment in a February 2006 interview with Brit Hume of Fox News. Asked by Mr. Hume with some incredulity if ""a vice president has the authority to declassify information,"" Mr. Cheney replied, ""There is an executive order to that effect."" He was referring to the order of March 2003.Even now, few have made the connection between this month's Cheney flap and the larger scandal. That larger scandal is to be found in what the vice president did legally under the executive order early on rather than in his more recent rejection of its oversight rules.Timing really is everything. By March 2003, this White House knew its hype of Saddam's nonexistent nuclear arsenal was in grave danger of being exposed. The order allowed Mr. Bush to keep his own fingerprints off the nitty-gritty of any jihad against whistle-blowers by giving Mr. Cheney the authority to pick his own shots and handle the specifics. The president could have plausible deniability and was free to deliver non-denial denials like ""If there is a leak out of my administration, I want to know who it is."" Mr. Cheney in turn could delegate the actual dirty work to Mr. Libby, who obstructed justice to help throw a smoke screen over the vice president's own role in the effort to destroy Mr. Wilson.Last week The Washington Post ran a first-rate investigative series on the entire Cheney vice presidency. Readers posting comments were largely enthusiastic, but a few griped. ""Six and a half years too late,"" said one. ""Four years late and billions of dollars short,"" said another. Such complaints reflect the bitter legacy of much of the Washington press's failure to penetrate the hyping of prewar intelligence and, later, the import of the Fitzgerald investigation.We're still playing catch-up. In a week in which the C.I.A. belatedly released severely censored secrets about agency scandals dating back a half-century, you have to wonder what else was done behind the shield of an executive order signed just after the Ides of March four years ago. Another half-century could pass before Americans learn the full story of the secrets buried by Mr. Cheney and his boss to cover up their deceitful path to war.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','Tired of the long commute from Bensonhurst, Mr. Nanscawen moved to Liberty Tower on Liberty Street, the neo-Gothic office building that was converted to a co-op in 1980. He rented a one-bedroom there for $1,750, which later rose to $1,950. His bride-to-be joined him.They enjoyed the building — especially the doormen — but over time, little things loomed large. The neighborhood shut down early, and few of their friends visited. Construction noise was everywhere.Worst of all, “It became agitating because there was no space in the apartment to put anything,” Mrs. Nanscawen said. Their wedding gifts sat at her mother’s house in Stroudsburg, Pa. Their two closets overflowed. Only once did the couple have a dinner party, inviting four guests for risotto. Everyone squeezed around a card table that doubled as the kitchen counter. “Never again,” said Mrs. Nanscawen, an accomplished cook.She often ripped out magazine recipes, “and James was mad because there was no place to put them,” she said. “When I put something away in our tiny little apartment, I would end up forgetting about it, so I would leave the clippings out to remind me I wanted to make the recipes. We would have weekends where we would power-clean and find recipes everywhere.”She longed to do the laundry herself, too. Their building wasn’t even near a coin laundry, so they spent at least $20 every week for pickup and drop-off service.“Being in fashion, I care about my clothes,” said Mrs. Nanscawen, who works for Cockpit USA, which makes military- and Americana-inspired clothing.“Tank tops would turn into tube tops,” she said. “We had a lot of stuff shrunken or ruined, texture-wise.”They began their hunt with a budget of $550,000 to $700,000 for a two-bedroom apartment, an amount that was low for Manhattan. “We had some married friends hunting at the same time, and they would come back to us with the same numbers we were finding,” Mrs. Nanscawen said. So they asked themselves, “Do we want to fall in love with an apartment and find out it costs a million dollars, or look at things we can afford and then fall in love?”A good friend who lived in Hoboken, N.J., had no trouble persuading them to look there. “Take the same amount of money, and it is night and day in terms of amenities you get,” Mr. Nanscawen said. Hoboken seemed to fit their personalities, too. “You walk up and down Washington Street and it’s all strollers, a fun atmosphere,” Mrs. Nanscawen said.A listing for a duplex condominium on Madison Street led them to Katherine Petsinis, an agent at Liberty Realty Hoboken. They found the layout awkward, but Ms. Petsinis began culling listings for them. “They wanted something luxury but not too luxury, somewhere in the middle,” she said.Most places they saw were perfectly fine, but “it just wasn’t something where you felt it was definitely it,” Mrs. Nanscawen said. “It was always a little, little issue that we didn’t want to settle on.”For example, they loved the apartments at 1100 Adams Street, part of the Upper Grand development, but thought they were too far from the heart of Hoboken.The Nanscawens liked another Madison Street apartment with a large kitchen. But it was a third-floor walk-up, and they worried about access for their parents.“We were trying to talk each other into it,” Mr. Nanscawen said. “We were saying, ‘Can we handle it? The stairs are carpeted, maybe it’s not so bad, it’s only a gradual slope.’ ” But they immediately reconsidered. “What are we doing?” he said. “This is our first home and we are committing to it, so we want to make absolutely sure that this is absolutely the place, no doubt.”Ms. Petsinis contacted them as soon as a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium in their price range became available in Adams Square. The 1870 building, formerly Public School 3, the Daniel S. Kealey School, was converted to rentals in 1996 and is now being converted to condominiums.Inside, they found 12-foot ceilings, an open layout, a dishwasher, lots of light and overhead storage. The second bedroom could function as a combination guest room, home office and future nursery. “I looked at James and gave him the eyebrows-up this-is-it look,” Mrs. Nanscawen said.The price was $615,000, with common charges of about $350 a month, and taxes of $7,600 a year.To keep themselves from acting impulsively, the Nanscawens had not brought a checkbook. Now they feared someone else would like the place as much as they did. So they grabbed the PATH train home and returned the same afternoon, check in hand.In the month since their move, Mrs. Nanscawen has been organizing her recipes in a binder and planning the menu for a dinner party for 12. She bought a color-coded set of laundry bags on a rolling rack. “It is awesome” to do laundry in the building’s laundry room, she said. “We let everything accumulate because we were so busy. I did five loads at once. I was happy as could be.”When their new furniture was delivered, the delivery man told them he had gone to school there. “He said, ‘I’ve lived here in Hoboken my whole life, and I was really excited to see they did something good with this place,’ ” Mr. Nanscawen said.'"
"'07-07-01,'0','It’s too early to pronounce the U.S. military’s surge in Iraq a failure. It’s not too early to say, though, that there’s no sign that it’s succeeding — that it’s making Iraqi politics or security better in any appreciable, self-sustaining way. At best, the surge is keeping Iraq from descending into full-scale civil war. At best we are dog paddling in the Tigris. Which means at least we should start to think about what happens if we have to get out of the water.We have to start by taking stock — honestly — about where we are. President Bush talks about Iraq as a country where the vast majority of the people are longing to live with each other in peace, harmony and freedom, and where only a tiny minority of terrorists and die-hard Baathists are standing in the way.I wish. If that were really the case, how could it be that after four years, hundreds of billions of dollars, tens of thousands of U.S. troops and thousands of casualties, we and our Iraqi allies have not been able to defeat this tiny minority? It doesn’t add up. No minority could be that powerful.The truth is we have a majorities problem in Iraq, not just a minority problem. For too many Iraqi leaders and too many of their followers, America’s vision of Iraq — a unified, pluralistic, democratizing, free-market — is actually their second choice, at best.The first choice for many Shiites is a pro-Iranian, Shiite-dominated religious Iraq, where Sunnis have little say and little power. The first choice for many Sunnis is a return to the good old days of Sunni minority rule over the Shiite majority. The first choice for many Kurds is an independent, democratic Kurdistan. In too many cases, the violence that is bedeviling Iraq today — while carried out by a minority of people — reflects the broad aspirations or fears of the respective majorities.In short, our first-choice soldiers are dying for Iraqis’ second choice. That is wrong, terribly wrong. It has to stop.'"

"'07-07-02,'1','Mr. Bush, who smiled through much of the news conference, described in his own words the talk of “a regional approach to missile defense,” then added, “I’m in strong agreement with that concept.”But Mr. Putin’s proposal seemed to catch the Americans by surprise to some degree, although Mr. Bush made it clear that he still intended to pursue plans for missile radar instillations in the Czech Republic and Poland. “I think the Czech Republic and Poland need to be an integral part of the system,” he said.The two met in this serene, seaside setting with the intention of smoothing over the deep wrinkles that have developed in their relationship during the past six years. But they approached reporters with an air of grimness that only broke when they discussed their morning fishing trip, during which Mr. Putin caught a fish. (Mr. Bush and his father caught none during three outings this weekend.)Mr. Putin’s new suggestions for the missile defense system came in spite of Russian officials’ statements — offered as late as 10 p.m. Sunday — that he would offer no new proposals this weekend.It was unclear where exactly the two leaders’ discussions left the issue. The United States has been negotiating with Poland and the Czech Republic over its plans to place missile defense bases in those countries, but American officials were taken aback by the ferocity of Russian opposition to those plans. That opposition was one the many factors that led to the Kennebunkport meeting.Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin today also emphasized their common concerns about the Iranian nuclear program.“We discussed a variety of ways to continue sending a joint message,” Mr. Bush said.“When Russia and the United States speak along the same lines, it tends to have an effect, and therefore I appreciate the Russians’ attitude in the United Nations,” he said. “We’re close on recognizing that we got to work together to send a common message.”Mr. Putin predicted that “we will continue to be successful” as the United Nations Security Council seeks ways to pressure the government in Tehran to halt a uranium enrichment program that Iranian leaders insist is peaceful but which other nations fear could lead to Iran’s developing nuclear weapons.Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin left unclear whether they had agreed on any new approach toward Iran — with which Russia has major economic relations — or simply had found a way to imply a more comfortable unity.Security Council members are weighing an American proposal for sanctions against Iran if it continues to enrich uranium. The United States and Russia, along with the other permanent members of the Security Council, have said they will delay those sanctions if Iran stops its work as they attempt to revive negotiations over the nuclear program.Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin made their comments came toward the end of a two-day visit in Kennebunkport. It was the first time the current president had invited a head of state to the family estate here. The meeting was crafted to give Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin the most comfortable and relaxed possible setting to deal with a series of issues dividing the two powers, from Iran to the Middle East and Kosovo.Earlier today, with former President George H.W. Bush at the wheel, the two leaders took a 90-minute spin in a powerful speedboat near the shoreline around the oceanfront estate.As they spoke, the current President Bush in particular looked at ease, frequently smiling. He wore a striped long-sleeve blue shirt open at the collar, while Mr. Putin sported a white short-sleeve shirt, also open at the collar.“We had a good, casual discussion,” Mr. Bush said. “There’ve been times we agreed on issues and times we haven’t agreed.” But he asserted that Mr. Putin had been “consistent, transparent, honest” and open to discussing both opportunities and problems.Mr. Bush said the men had discussed a wide range of issues in what had been a “very long, strategic dialogue.”Mr. Putin said he was “pleased to note that we are seeking the points of coincidence in our positions and very frequently we did find them.”He thanked Mr. Bush for “a very nice fishing party this morning.”But the smiles and warm words stood in uneasy juxtaposition with months of uncommonly chilly rhetoric from the Russian president and some of his aides — climaxing with Russian warnings that if the United States proceeded to build the missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, Russia might “target” those American allies.Starting early this year, Mr. Putin has assailed American “unilateralism,” said an “ideology of confrontation and extremism” was emerging global threats, and even — though the Kremlin later denied it — seemed to compare the United States to the Third Reich and to some of the darker days of Stalinism.Diplomatic analysts believe such language is not unconnected to the approach of parliamentary elections in Russia in December and the nation’s presidential elections three months later.'"
"'07-07-02,'1','“We have to see if people can come up with creative ways to help the university and the community,” said John E. Sexton, N.Y.U.’s president. “It should be a win-win situation, not a zero-sum game.”The university also began working last year with a task force of community leaders and elected officials, headed by the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer. In April, it hired a team of architecture and design firms to shape a strategic plan that includes community input. And on Thursday, it held the open house for community members, to discuss N.Y.U.’s needs and to hear their views.As a symbol of the new openness, the heavy outer doors of Hemmerdinger Hall, the airy, high-ceilinged room on Washington Square East where the reception was held, were opened for the first time in more than a decade, providing access directly from the street. But a locksmith had to be summoned because no one could find a working key.Many of the visitors welcomed the university’s promise of more transparency, although many remained skeptical.“Just the fact that they’re having this meeting is a big step in the right direction,” said Sara Jones, chairwoman of LaGuardia Corner Community Gardens, a city-sponsored garden in N.Y.U.’s midst. “We are concerned about N.Y.U.’s expansion. We’d just like to know what’s going on.”Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, also said he was encouraged but was afraid to be too optimistic. “I’ve been burned by the university a few times, where they’ve made promises they haven’t kept,” he said. “I’m hoping this time will be different.”Some also expressed frustration that N.Y.U.’s new planning process will not affect several projects already under way, including a 26-story residence hall being built on East 12th Street, on the site of the former St. Ann’s Church. N.Y.U. has agreed to lease and then buy the building, said Alicia D. Hurley, associate vice president for government and community affairs at N.Y.U.“A 26-story dorm on a side street in the East Village is inexcusable,” Mr. Berman said.Town-gown relations have always been problematic, and real estate has been especially contentious in recent years, as research universities feel competitive pressures to expand. Columbia, for example, has been trying to add about 17 acres just north of its Morningside Heights campus in Manhattan, and has faced resistance from local residents and property owners.With more than 40,000 students and 3,100 full-time faculty members, N.Y.U. is one of the largest private universities in the United States, but one with no clearly defined campus. To the consternation of many of its neighbors, it sprawls in a scattershot way across Greenwich Village and other areas, and keeps expanding. It uses about 15 million square feet, two-thirds of that in the Village and in nearby neighborhoods like the East Village and Union Square.In the last decade, part of its growth has come from leasing space for uses like student housing. And the university envisions that its student body will grow to 46,500 students within 25 years. One of N.Y.U.’s greatest areas of planned expansion is for student housing. It currently owns 2 million square feet of undergraduate housing and leases an additional 1.3 million square feet, but its plan calls for owning 4.3 million square feet by 2031.Mr. Sexton, N.Y.U.’s president, said growth comes with new programs. He said N.Y.U. was likely to add an engineering program, as well as others, in the next 25 years.The president chatted amiably with numerous visitors at the reception on Thursday. He acknowledged that relationships with the community had been mixed, but said that he was determined to change that. An important step, he said, was a strategic plan that took into account the views of those at N.Y.U. as well as community members nearby.“Once you get past that very small minority who as a matter of conviction are against growth at all, and the very small group of people who attack N.Y.U. for political purposes,” he added, “then you just have to ask people to have a genuine dialogue and not just say, ‘Not in my back yard.’ ”N.Y.U. recently selected a consortium of four firms — SMWM, Toshiko Mori, Grimshaw Architects and Olin Partnership — to work on its planning. Lynne P. Brown, a senior vice president at N.Y.U., says the planning will cost about $4 million over several years. In recent weeks, the designers have met with N.Y.U. officials and with each other. It was the design team that urged the university to open the heavy wood doors of Hemmerdinger for the reception.They said there was no model of how a land-starved university like N.Y.U. could expand without making too many waves, but were optimistic that they would find solutions.“When you have a tough problem, you can find different ways of thinking about it when you have good minds at the table,” said Karen B. Alschuler, a principal at SMWM, based in San Francisco. “We can’t promise that everyone will be happy,” she added. “But the result will be better architecture and better design.”Toshiko Mori, chairwoman of the architecture department at Harvard University, said she could already see opportunities for using the current space more effectively. “Their use of existing space is not very efficient,” she said. “There is a lot you can do with scheduling and having more general use classrooms.”The planning team will also be working with N.Y.U. to find spots for expansion outside the Village. University officials are talking about having more “branch” or “regional” campuses, both locally and in places like Paris; they also aim to have half of their students spend a semester abroad, up from a quarter now.Another source of discipline will come from the community task force on N.Y.U. development, which includes a congressman, Jerrold L. Nadler; the speaker of the City Council, Christine C. Quinn, whose district includes the West Village; state legislators and a variety of local community leaders; as well as Mr. Stringer, the borough president.In a letter to Mr. Sexton in November, the task force said that reducing tensions over the university’s expansion “is only possible if the community is given an opportunity to comment on and participate in N.Y.U. planning efforts, and if the university is willing to truly listen to and take into account the public’s concerns.”Mr. Stringer said he knew people were skeptical but he believed the task force could make a difference.“N.Y.U.’s president has showed up for task force meetings and stayed till the end, and that’s a sea change in itself,” he said, “to have the president across from the community, in front of all the elected officials.”'"

"'07-07-02,'1','In the four years since iTunes popularized the sale of music online, many in the music business have become discouraged by what they consider to be the near-monopoly that Mr. Jobs has held in the digital sector — the one part of the music business that is showing significant growth. In particular, Mr. Jobs’s stance on song pricing and the iPod’s lack of compatibility with music services other than iTunes have become points of contention.By refusing to enter a long-term deal, Universal may continue to press for more favorable terms from Apple or even explore deals to sell its catalog exclusively through other channels. If Universal were to pull its catalog from iTunes, Mr. Jobs would lose access to record labels that collectively account for one out of every three new releases sold in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan data.But if Apple were to decide not to carry Universal’s recordings, the music company would likely sustain a serious blow: sales of digital music through iTunes and other sources accounted for more than 15 percent of Universal’s worldwide revenue in the first quarter, or more than $200 million. (Vivendi does not break out revenue from Apple alone).If push came to shove and Universal decided to remove its catalog from iTunes, it might not necessarily instigate a broader insurrection against Apple. The second-biggest corporation, Sony BMG Music Entertainment, recently decided to sign a new one-year contract making its catalog available to iTunes, according to executives briefed on the deal. A spokeswoman for the company, a joint venture of Sony and Bertelsmann, declined to comment.Some industry observers have cautioned against taking on Mr. Jobs directly. “When your customers are iPod addicts, who are you striking back against?,” said Ken Hertz, an entertainment lawyer who represents artists like Beyoncé and the Black Eyed Peas. “The record companies now have to figure out how to stimulate competition without alienating Steve Jobs, and they need to do that while Steve Jobs still has an incentive to keep them at the table.”But other music industry executives say the major labels must take a harder line with Apple at some point if they are to recalibrate the relationship. In particular, they say, it is unfair for Mr. Jobs to exert tight control over prices and other terms while profiting from the iPod. Mr. Jobs, in February, noted that less than 3 percent of the music on the average iPod was bought from iTunes, leading music executives to speculate that the devices in many instances are used to store pirated songs. (Of course, users can also fill their players with songs copied from their own CD collections.)Apple has now sold more than 100 million iPods, and the device’s ties to iTunes have helped make Apple the leading seller of digital music by a wide margin. The iTunes service accounts for 76 percent of digital music sales, and the contract talks come as it is on the rise — Apple recently surpassed Amazon.com to become the third-biggest seller of music over all, behind Wal-Mart and Best Buy, according to data from the market research firm NPD.All of that has transformed Apple into a prominent gatekeeper, wielding influence as a tastemaker by highlighting selected artists on iTunes storefront, and as an architect of the underlying business dynamics.Apple has stuck to a pricing system that charges a flat 99 cents for a song since iTunes started four years ago (except for the recent introduction of songs without copy protection, which carry a higher price). Mr. Jobs has long argued that a uniform system and low prices will invite new consumers and reduce piracy.But some music executives have been chafing at the flat rate that Apple has insisted upon in its contracts with the big record labels, and they have been pressing publicly or privately for the right to charge Apple more for popular songs to capitalize on demand or, in the event of special promotions, to charge less. Edgar Bronfman Jr., the chairman of Warner Music Group, reinforced that idea at a recent investor conference, saying “we believe that not every song, not every artist, not every album, is created equal.”In the backdrop of the pricing dispute is an investigation by European regulators who are studying the roles of the music companies and Apple in setting prices in certain international markets.At the same time, Mr. Jobs has refused the industry’s calls for Apple to license its proprietary copy restriction software to other manufacturers. Music executives want the software to be shared so that services other than iTunes can sell music that can be played on the iPod, and so that other devices can play songs bought from iTunes.Mr. Jobs has argued that sharing the software with other companies would increase the likelihood that its protections would be cracked by hackers, among other problems. Instead, he asked the music companies to drop their insistence on copy protection altogether. So far, only one of the four music companies, EMI, has made a deal to sell unrestricted music through iTunes.'"

"'07-07-03,'1','Economists said that the price rollbacks were unsustainable and that shops and manufacturers would soon shut down and lay off their workers rather than produce goods at a loss. “You can’t buy eggs or bread or things of that sort,” said John Robertson, an economic consultant in Harare. “Suppliers can’t supply them at a price that allows retailers to make a profit.”“It’s pretty chaotic,” he added. “But I think the impact will be worse if it stays in place.”Zimbabwe’s annual inflation rate was last reported to be 4,500 percent in May, a figure the government has yet to confirm. Mr. Robertson and others say that the true rate now is probably about 10,000 percent, but official statistics apparently are no longer being released.He and others said they feared that the economic collapse would quickly lead to social unrest if Zimbabwe’s already shrunken workforce were hit by extensive layoffs and if foods like corn meal, cooking oil and sugar became unavailable.President Robert G. Mugabe, who faces a tough election next year, has often threatened to impose price controls over the eight-year course of Zimbabwe’s economic decline, but the controls generally were short-lived and loosely enforced. In contrast, the latest crackdown appears to be gathering momentum, as enforcers moved over the weekend to halt price increases by wholesalers and manufacturers as well as retailers.The government’s Ministry of Industry and International Trade ordered companies one week ago to roll back their prices to the levels of June 18, a reduction of roughly 50 percent. Many initially ignored the command, but after Mr. Mugabe delivered a caustic nationally broadcast speech last week, pledging to seize the assets of industries and businesses that evaded controls, the government has more strictly enforced the order.In Mutare, an eastern city on Mozambique’s border, store shelves emptied last week as shoppers scooped up low-priced goods once the controls took effect, said Sampson Mugari, a regional officer of the government-financed Consumer Council of Zimbabwe. This week, he said, some staples like beef, chicken and cooking oil have been sold at reduced prices at some local supermarkets, but he acknowledged that supplies were limited.“They tell shoppers to queue to buy whatever they have,” he said. Two-liter cartons of a popular orange drink, priced at 400,000 Zimbabwe dollars a week ago, were sold for 120,000 dollars, or about 45 cents at the currency’s black-market exchange rate.Gasoline was reported to be vanishing from filling stations as the going price, about 180,000 dollars per liter, was slashed by the government to something closer to the officially approved price of 450 dollars per liter.Mr. Mugabe’s government intends to cope with the shortages by subsidizing producers of basic goods. One of the few newspapers not under government control, The Zimbabwe Independent, reported last week that flour, which is controlled entirely by the state, will be sold to bakers for 10 million dollars a ton, half the market price. Similarly, many suppliers of basic goods have been told by the government that they will be allowed to buy gasoline at one tenth the going price, the newspaper reported.The government apparently plans to make up those losses by printing more money. Zimbabwe’s dollar has lost more than half its value in recent weeks because the government has constantly issued new bills to pay its mounting debts.The Bulawayo merchant, who said he was threatened on Tuesday by a government price-control official, said that prices have been doubling almost weekly at his shop. He said prices for cattle at the city’s twice-weekly auctions are now well above the prices shopkeepers have been ordered to charge for butchered meat.One of Bulawayo’s biggest meat wholesalers normally supplies merchants with about 200 head of cattle each week, he said. Today, the wholesaler’s entire stock consisted of four beef quarters — “the sum total of one animal,” he said.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by The New York Times against the Justice and Defense Departments, saying classified documents the newspaper was seeking under the Freedom of Information Act were properly withheld.

Shops can obtain a waiver against closing on Sundays if they attach a “cultural, recreational or sportive” aspect to their business.

"'07-07-03,'1','They also sent a jolt of uncertainty through Republican circles when many in the party are uneasy with their current candidates and are worried about their prospects against a far more determined Democratic field.The party has failed to coalesce around a favored candidate, with conservatives skeptical of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s support of abortion rights and Mitt Romney facing scrutiny for shifting his positions on key social issues.Mr. McCain’s campaign was in flux particularly in Iowa, where half of his 16-member staff was let go yesterday, campaign officials said. His state director left, and Jon Seaton, his national field director, headed to Iowa to take over.Department heads spent yesterday calling in lower-level staff members to inform them of their dismissals. Mr. McCain’s advisers said they were cutting back on consultants, with those in the fund-raising area losing their guaranteed monthly retainers. The moves amounted to a sharp scaling back of what had once been a gold-plated campaign.Top advisers to Mr. McCain, a Vietnam veteran known for his maverick streak, said the problems might force him to accept federal matching money, which could pump $6 million into his primary campaign but force him to abide by strict spending limits.Mr. McCain’s aides expressed hope that with the immigration battle over, the campaign could recover its momentum as the focus shifted to other issues, like federal spending. And the history of American primary campaigns is replete with examples of troubled candidates rising from major setbacks.“The decisions we made today were not easy,” said Terry Nelson, the McCain campaign manager, who said he would no longer accept a salary.While refusing to go into detail about the depth of the cuts or say exactly how many staff members had been fired, Mr. Nelson said “every department” had been affected. Republicans close to the campaign said that at least 50 and as many as 80 people were being let go, out of a staff of around 150 people.Campaign strategists said Mr. McCain’s ability to raise money was severely limited in recent weeks by the reaction to his support of the immigration legislation, which collapsed last Thursday in the Senate. They said Mr. McCain was now looking to raise $50 million this year — half of what he once expected — and was retooling the campaign to save as much money as possible for television advertising and travel.“Clearly, we didn’t meet our goals for the second quarter in fund-raising, which I largely attribute to the immigration legislation that has dominated the news for the past two months, and his position is not too popular with our small donors,” said Charlie Black, a senior Washington political strategist who is a volunteer adviser to Mr. McCain. “We have got to restructure the budget and the organization.”Mr. Black and others dismissed any suggestion that the moves were a precursor to Mr. McCain’s dropping out, particularly with the race still in its early stages and with no other candidate breaking away. John Weaver, another senior adviser to Mr. McCain, said the senator would now focus almost exclusively on the three early primary and caucus states.After the defeat of the immigration bill, Mr. McCain told reporters he had no intention of leaving the race despite the setback on what has become a driving issue for him.“Why would I contemplate such a thing?” he said. “I don’t know why I would even remotely consider such a thing in the month of June and July. It’s always been hard for me to raise money. None of the special interests are contributing because they don’t want me to be president.”Mr. McCain’s allies in the Senate had hoped that approval of the immigration legislation would help him politically by showing that there was consensus on his position, tightening the borders while offering the prospect of legal residency to some illegal immigrants. But the widespread Republican abandonment of the bill only further undercut him and caused him particular trouble in Iowa, where aides said polls had found that his support had plummeted to single-digit numbers.The scene yesterday at McCain headquarters in suburban Virginia was described as somber. People were called in and told they were being dismissed, effective immediately. They were given two weeks’ severance pay. A dozen senior campaign aides either agreed to work without salary or for less pay.Senior McCain advisers say they realized over the past few months that they had to change the mindset that they were running what one called a “Bush-Cheney campaign,” with the plush offices, army of consultants and extended staff befitting a front-runner. Mr. McCain himself had raised questions about the size of the operation and also bristled at making fund-raising calls.Rival campaigns said they still considered Mr. McCain a threat, but added that the decision to reduce his staff in the primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina could be disastrous because a strong organization was crucial.Mr. Black, the McCain adviser, was adamant that the senator was competitive in those states and said the end of the immigration fight could ultimately help Mr. McCain by shifting attention from the issue.“This will fade over time,” he said. “He has got as good a chance as anyone else.”The immigration battle resonated particularly in South Carolina, where the state’s two Republican senators split on the measure. Senator Lindsey Graham, a top McCain ally, supported the bill, and Senator Jim DeMint was a leading opponent.Katon Dawson, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said that Mr. McCain had been hurt but that the race there would be decided on more than one issue.“I do think it has wounded him, but I don’t think it has taken him out of the game,” Mr. Dawson said. “There is time to recover from this.”'"
"'07-07-03,'1','“In this case, there would be no need to place any more facilities in Europe — I mean, these facilities in Czech Republic and the missile base in Poland,” Mr. Putin said as he and Mr. Bush fielded questions after their meetings.American and NATO officials have said that the Azerbaijan site is less useful than those selected for Poland and the Czech Republic because it is too close to Iran to intercept missiles fired from there.Mr. Bush indicated that Mr. Putin’s new plan did not at first glance satisfy his concerns. “I think it’s innovative, I think it’s strategic,” Mr. Bush said. “But as I told Vladimir, I think that the Czech Republic and Poland need to be an integral part of the system.”Speaking later, Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, said Mr. Putin’s new proposal was a good sign that he was willing to work with the United States and NATO to create a missile-defense system.Mr. Bush had never before met as president with a foreign leader here at Walker’s Point, the serene seaside vacation property of his parents.The location was a reminder of the presidency of Mr. Bush’s father, during which the cold war ended and Russia and the United States heralded a new era of cooperation. Mr. Putin’s discussion of a strategic defense partnership would have been unimaginable at the start of the senior Bush’s term.But the subtext of disagreement about the system was a reminder of the new complications between the United States and Russia as they continue to jockey for global position. So, too, were jabs by Mr. Putin at Mr. Bush for questions about the intelligence leading up to the Iraq war, and the issue of torture, raised recently by the CNN host Larry King, among others, while interviewing George J. Tenet, the former C.I.A. director.“If you remember how Larry King tortured the former C.I.A. director, you would also understand that there are some other problems and issues, as well, in this world,” Mr. Putin said in a reflection of his reported frustration with what he views as American lecturing on democracy. “We have common problems.”Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin initially approached reporters with an air of stiff determination that dissipated when they discussed their morning fishing trip, during which Mr. Putin caught a striped bass — Mr. Bush and his father caught no fish in three outings this visit.The leaders did not announce any breakthroughs on independence for Kosovo, though Mr. Hadley said the United States and Russia would announce this week that they had finalized the details of a pact on sharing nuclear materials that they agreed on last year.They also did not announce any agreement on new sanctions against Iran for its uranium enrichment program, with Mr. Bush saying he and Mr. Putin agreed that they needed to send a forceful message together, but with Mr. Putin pointing to possible new signs of Iranian cooperation with international inspectors.But neither side expected Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin to announce any big breakthroughs. The radar proposal, however, did come as a surprise to the Americans, who were caught off guard last month when Mr. Putin first announced his Azerbaijan plan.Late Sunday night, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said there would be no surprise announcements from Kennebunkport.Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a private research group in Washington, called the new proposal “a minor modification” of that earlier plan, saying it appeared to have similar shortcomings.But other experts said it was still a positive sign that Mr. Putin was engaged and looking for alternatives. “We’re beyond the point where Putin shows up and says, ‘Over my dead body,’ ” said Julianne Smith, a Europe expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.The Americans said the whole point of inviting Mr. Putin here was to bring the leaders together in a way that would discourage that sort of loggerheads from either side. And in that respect both sides said the trip went well.Chatting with reporters, the first President Bush said Mr. Putin rode around on a Segway standing vehicle — which Mr. Bush once famously fell off here — and that the Bushes gave it to him as a gift.Then there was the fishing. Though Mr. Putin showed up his hosts, he was gracious: “That was a team effort, and we let it go to the captain,” he said, later correcting himself to say they threw the fish back.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','Nearly half of the country’s lowest-income families suffer from what Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies describes as a severe housing cost burden that places them at clear risk of homelessness. These struggling families often live doubled up with relatives and spend more than half of their pretax incomes on rent, which means that they keep a roof over their heads only by cutting back on food, clothing and medical care.The affordable housing crisis was accelerated during the 1980’s, when the Reagan administration and Congress backed away from a longstanding federal commitment to affordable housing by cutting construction funds and revising the tax structure in ways that discouraged investment in affordable, multifamily buildings. Congress could reverse those disastrous policies and help the most vulnerable families by passing legislation that would create the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund.Modeled on successful, state-level programs, the fund would be used to construct, rehabilitate and preserve 1.5 million units of housing over the next 10 years. The money — three-quarters of which would be earmarked for extremely low-income families — would be parceled out to local jurisdictions that would then award grants to entities that build and rehabilitate housing. In exchange for trust fund dollars, a proportionate number of units would be set aside for low-income families. This would encourage healthy, mixed-income developments.The fund would require no new taxes, but would be financed through new contributions made by the government-backed mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and with additional revenue generated by the Federal Housing Administration, which insures mortgages. To put it another way, the government would direct money made from housing right back into the same area.Hard-line Republicans have opposed similar legislation in the past, arguing that the federal government has no place in the housing business. But the bipartisan support that has materialized for this year’s bill suggests that the ideologues have had their day and that the pain and hardship being inflicted by the affordable housing crisis is finally being recognized on both sides of the aisle.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','Last week, GLG Partners, one of Europe’s biggest hedge funds, said it would pursue a listing in the United States through a merger with a holding company here.Unlike Fortress and Blackstone, which have substantial private equity operations, Och-Ziff appears to be the first pure-play American hedge fund to seek an initial offering. As such, it offers a rare glimpse into the performance, asset growth and profitability of these kinds of firms. Hedge fund managers earn a management fee of about 2 percent of assets as well as about 20 percent of the profits.Och-Ziff’s assets under management have grown rapidly, to almost $27 billion from $5.7 billion at the end of 2003, according to the firm’s prospectus. Its returns in recent years have not notably surpassed those of the S.& P. 500-stock index: for the last three years it had an identical return, and for the last year it returned 15.7 percent compared with the index’s 15.2 percent. Since inception, the main fund returned 17 percent compared with 11.6 percent for the S.& P. 500.But in a point it will be sure to make to prospective investors, Och-Ziff has delivered those returns with less risk. Since 1994, the S.& P. 500 has been almost three times as volatile, and over the last year the broad market index has been more than four times as volatile.“Achieving the same level of return while taking less risk is a commendable goal for investors,” said Ted Seides, director of investments at Protégé Partners, a fund of hedge funds, “though it’s not always the case that a lower volatility of returns equates to less risk.”In 2006, Och-Ziff made $954 million in management fees and incentive income, up 93 percent from 2005. It paid $185 million in compensation and benefits. The firm has 300 people, 125 of whom are investment professionals and 18 are partners.Hedge fund managers are allowed to defer their income offshore if they manage offshore funds — which are often set up to allow tax-exempt investors, like endowments, and foreigners to invest without facing taxes in the United States. Och-Ziff’s managers have about $1.8 billion in deferred income. The fund’s principals will invest all of the proceeds from the initial public offering back into the funds, where it will have to remain for five years.Like Fortress and Blackstone, Och-Ziff plans to offer a stake in its management company, organizing itself as a master limited partnership that gives public investors limited say in the firm’s governance. Unions led by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. have led the charge against these private equity firms’ going public, and members of Congress have taken notice. The bill introduced last month by the top two members of the Senate Finance Committee would more than double the tax rates on carried interest.Yet the Senate bill gives Fortress and Blackstone a five-year grace period on the higher tax rates, a concession not available to Och-Ziff. That may not matter eventually: the House’s legislation would eliminate the transition period, and Senator Max Baucus, one of the sponsors of the Senate bill, said he was open to narrowing that time frame.The firm plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol OZM.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','On the question of dismissal, he later told the courtroom, “I don’t know where I am.”Judge Kaplan’s comments came one week after federal prosecutors made their own surprise proposal that he dismiss charges against 12 of the 18 defendants, so that the government could start fresh and get its showpiece tax case back on track, perhaps by filing new charges. Prosecutors said yesterday that while they still did not agree with the findings of Stein I, the only remedy was to dismiss the case.The defendants — 16 KPMG employees, an outside lawyer and an investment adviser — are accused of conspiring to make, sell and use bogus tax shelters that cost the United States Treasury billions of dollars in unpaid taxes over the late 1990s through recent years.Lawyers for certain defendants also sought to broaden their accusations of prosecutorial misconduct, saying yesterday that federal prosecutors and the Justice Department had illegally turned over confidential taxpayer data to a Senate subcommittee investigating tax shelters and to separate lawyers involved in a civil tax shelter lawsuit against KPMG. Federal prosecutors denied any wrongdoing.Prosecutors have called the investigation the largest criminal tax shelter investigation in history, but the case is now certain to become even more focused on the payment of legal fees.By 2005, KPMG had reversed its long-standing policy and decided not to pay the legal fees of the defendants in their criminal cases.In a related angle, Judge Kaplan focused yesterday on the fact that KPMG had paid the legal fees of certain of the current defendants to be represented by civil lawyers in civil tax shelter lawsuits filed against KPMG by investors whose tax shelters did not pass muster with the Internal Revenue Service.Ronald E. DePetris, a lawyer for one of the defendants, told the judge and courtroom that KPMG had paid such fees.Judge Kaplan asked John M. Hillebrecht, the lead federal prosecutor, if that were true, and Mr. Hillebrecht replied that it was.Posing what he called “the Bill Gates question,” Judge Kaplan repeatedly asked the defense and prosecution whether a defendant’s constitutional rights to legal counsel and due process would have been violated had he or she been as wealthy as the Microsoft founder, and thus not be in need of KPMG’s help in paying legal fees. He got varying answers.Some defense lawyers argued that KPMG was coerced into paying a $456 million fine in 2005 as a condition of not being indicted, and that some of that money could have been used for the defendants’ legal fees. Some defense lawyers argue that their clients’ legal fees will run into the millions of dollars and that they cannot afford them.A spokeswoman for KPMG said that it had been “established in the record” that KPMG had paid legal fees for some of the current indicted defendants in certain civil lawsuits in which both the firm and individuals were co-defendants. KPMG has also claimed that it was defrauded by the indicted employees, which is why it is not paying their legal bills in the criminal matter.Mr. Hillebrecht took a scolding from Judge Kaplan after saying that some of the defendants had never asked KPMG for the legal fees in the first place. When Judge Kaplan appeared to mock that claim, Mr. Hillebrecht responded at one point: “That’s not really nice, your honor.”Judge Kaplan did not explain why he was willing to reconsider whether the case had to be dismissed.In May, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed a ruling in which he ordered KPMG to stand trial over its refusal to pay the legal fees of its indicted former employees.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','President Bush’s commutation of I. Lewis Libby Jr.’s prison sentence yesterday was not the equivalent of a pardon.A commutation lessens the severity of the punishment. A pardon excuses or forgives the offense itself.Mr. Bush commuted Mr. Libby’s 30-month sentence, for obstruction of justice and perjury, saying it was excessive. But he left in place two years’ probation and a $250,000 fine.He did not disturb the underlying conviction. To the contrary, Mr. Bush said in a statement, “The consequences of his felony conviction on his former life as a lawyer, public servant and private citizen will be long-lasting.”That means Mr. Libby’s appeal of his conviction and his remaining sentence can continue. The original sentence was within the range called for by federal sentencing guidelines.'"

"'07-07-03,'1','They also choose condos because they would probably not be approved by co-op boards, which often demand full-time residence. Pamela Liebman, the president of the Corcoran Group, said buyers also prefer the conveniences of new buildings and the perks like concierges who can “stock my refrigerator, get my theater tickets and have my dog groomed.” The dazzle of living in a new building doesn’t hurt either, she said. “New, new, new — all of the foreign buyers love that.”Dottie Herman, the president of the brokerage Prudential Douglas Elliman, said co-op boards may be forced to change their rules. “I’ve brought buyers that have tons of money, that have tons of assets, and still the co-op boards turn them down for no reason at all,” she said. “I do think that you’re going to see co-ops ease up in some cases. The prices have gone up so much that some of the rules don’t work today.”In some cases, buyers who can afford multimillion-dollar apartments are forced to buy condos or risk rejection from co-op boards because they are required to have a multiple of the apartment’s price in liquid assets. Michele Kleier, president of Gumley Haft Kleier, said buyers in the $3.5 million to $4 million price range are choosing apartments in new buildings like the Lucida, at 151 East 85th Street, where they can live on the Upper East Side but avoid dealing with a co-op board and the extensive renovations that are often needed for a prewar apartment.The difficulty of getting past a co-op board is making it tough on sellers, she said. One of her listings was a Park Avenue apartment that required extensive renovations. Five buyers offered roughly the asking price, $4.95 million, but none had the extensive assets required by the board. The price was reduced to $4.75 million, and it ultimately sold for even less to a bidder who had assets acceptable to the board.“I looked at every single balance sheet and there was not one person among the five offers who had the assets to get into the building,” Ms. Kleier said.These eager and rich buyers are swallowing up the stock of condos. Today, Manhattan has just 5,237 apartments up for sale, compared with 7,640 condos and co-ops for sale last year at the same time, according to data tracked by the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.Jonathan Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, said inventory is also shrinking because potential buyers had been renting until they were sure the market had stabilized. “They have re-entered the market,” he said. “We’ve essentially eliminated most of the fat out of the inventory.”Among condos, the fastest price growth was among entry-level studios. The highest price increase in any size category was in the studio market, according to Brown Harris Stevens data. The average studio rose 26 percent to $574,197.“The smaller units led the way in terms of price increases on the condo side,” said Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared market studies for Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property.Manhattan’s wealthiest buyers are paying even more money to get the most prized trophy homes, and they are not deterred by co-op board rules on assets. Brown Harris Stevens data showed that prices for co-ops with more than four bedrooms rose by 19 percent to an average of $7.016 million, compared with the same period a year ago. Town house prices also increased by 30 percent to $1,644 a square foot.Prices for Brooklyn town houses did not change, Mr. Heym said.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','He said a “deranged” man had been stopped outside of his office door once. “He was trying to get in, and when they asked him he said he was going to kill me,” he said. “So, you know, give me a break.”The governor’s staff tried to undercut those claims by pointing out that no one had ever asked for a formal threat assessment to determine risks to Mr. Bruno, who has been Senate majority leader for more than a dozen years. Lt. Glenn Miner, a spokesman for the State Police, said a threat assessment would be made only if it was requested by Mr. Bruno or by the governor.He also said he could not discuss specific security measures already being taken for Mr. Bruno.Mr. Bruno said he was outraged that the governor’s staff members moved so swiftly to refer the matter to investigators, noting that Mr. Spitzer receives police protection and escorts during trips that involve events that can be considered political, including a recent series of speeches lambasting Senate Republicans.The state’s Republican Party said it was seeking state records relating to the governor’s travel coinciding with fund-raising events.Asked if his recent trips to New York were solely for fund-raising, Mr. Bruno said, “Of course not.”“That would be just plain stupid,” he added. “It’s against the law, it would be criminal, it would be dumb, and it’s dumb for anybody stupid enough to allege that somebody would do that.”Darren Dopp, the governor’s communications director, said the senator’s use of the helicopters was approved on the understanding that it was for “legislative business meetings,” adding that “we are forwarding documents regarding use of state aircraft to appropriate state authorities for review.”Officials can be penalized under ethics rules or prosecuted under criminal statutes if they use state resources solely for political activity, but not if the trips mix politics and state business.Mr. Bruno railed at the governor at length on Monday, calling him “an overgrown rich spoiled brat who has tantrums all over the place” and “too temperamental to be the chief executive of 19 million people.” He said the governor “does not understand that he is not a dictator, he is not a tyrant, he is not a king.” He also said the governor had done “practically nothing” to create jobs.Mr. Bruno said Mr. Spitzer would “make a great salesman” because he has no capacity to hear people say no. And he said the Senate would be closely scrutinizing the governor’s nominee to head the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Dale Hemmerdinger, because he had held a fund-raiser for the governor.“I grew up in the toughest part of Glens Falls, next to the boxcars, where kids would come up to you when you weighed 90 pounds and they weighed 120 and just punch you right in the mouth just because you were Italian, O.K., or just because you lived next to the boxcars, or just because they felt like it.”“That’s how I grew up, O.K.?” he added. “So swing away.”'"
"'07-07-03,'1','At the trial, closed to the public because some of the defendants were minors, Mr. Samast exercised his legal right to silence, said Fethiye Cetin, a lawyer for Mr. Dink’s family, according to the state-run Anatolian News Agency.Four defendants, Erhan Tuncel, Yasin Hayal, Ersin Yolcu and Ahmet Iskender, testified, and two others asked for lawyers before speaking, Ms. Cetin said.Mr. Samast previously confessed to the killing, according to Turkish authorities, saying he had been angered by Mr. Dink’s columns on Armenian history and had come to Istanbul from the Black Sea town of Trabzon to kill him.A crowd of Mr. Dink’s supporters stood a short distance from the mustard-colored courthouse, which was used as a military court for years but is now a criminal court as part of a legal reform in preparation for Turkey’s bid to join the European Union.His lawyers’ main concern is that the trial will not get to the heart of the hate crime they say was highly organized by a network of ultranationalist Turks in collaboration with Turkish authorities. Shortly after the killing, a video surfaced showing the main suspect posing with Turkish police officers. Security officials were fired over the incident.“The gang does not consist of these suspects only,” Ms. Cetin said of the 18 defendants, according to the news agency. “It is far more planned and organized. There is almost an intentional misconduct of the gendarmerie and police in this incident.”Lawyers for the defendants say the attention to the case will make a fair trial impossible.Liberal Turks are skeptical that the trial will result in justice for Mr. Dink. The country’s establishment, which encourages nationalism, was deeply suspicious of him.“The judgment will not be free,” said Aydin Ozipek, an economics student at Fatih University in Istanbul. “There is a ruling class of people who want everybody to be the same — no Kurds, no Armenians, no head scarves.”In a petition to the court to allow him to take part in the trial, Mr. Dink’s brother, Hosrof Dink, described their childhood in an orphanage and a lifetime of discrimination.“We thought we were born as human beings,” he wrote in the petition, circulated by a group of his brother’s supporters. “In time, against our will, we were given many identities; we were labeled.”The trial, he said, “will be between the people who believe in the rule of law and the people who say: ‘We are the law. We are the state.’ ” His request to take part was granted.The court worked well into the evening, then adjourned until Oct. 1. Charges continue against all 18 defendants, but only eight were kept in custody, Turkish television reported.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','Top advisers to Mr. McCain, the Vietnam war hero from Arizona known for his maverick streak, said a shortfall in contributions left the campaign in deep political and financial trouble and opened the possibility that Mr. McCain may be forced to accept federal matching funds — which could pump $6 million into his primary campaign but force him to abide by strict spending limits. They said he currently had just $2 million on hand to finance the campaign, and had given up on its original goal of collecting $100 million this year.The problems added to unsettled nature of the Republican field. Unlike in 2000, the party has so far failed to coalesce around a favored candidate, with conservatives skeptical of Rudolph W. Giuliani’s support of abortion rights, and Mitt Romney facing scrutiny for shifting his positions on key social issues.Mr. McCain’s aides expressed hope that with the immigration battle over, the campaign could recover its momentum as the focus shifts to other issues, like federal spending. And the history of American primary campaigns are replete with examples of troubled candidates recovering from major setbacks.“The decisions we made today were not easy,” said Terry Nelson, the McCain campaign manager, who himself said he would no longer accept a salary. While refusing to go into detail about the depth of the cuts or exactly how many staffers had been fired, Mr. Nelson said “every department” was affected; Republicans close to the campaign said that at least 50 and as many as 80 people were being let go, out of a payroll of around 150 people.Campaign strategists said Mr. McCain’s ability to raise money was severely limited in recent weeks by the backlash over his support of the immigration legislation, which collapsed last Thursday in the Senate. They said Mr. McCain was now looking to raise half of what he once expected — $50 million this year — and was retooling the campaign to save as much money for television advertising and travel as possible.“Clearly, we didn’t meet our goals for the second quarter in fund-raising, which I largely attribute to the immigration legislation that has dominated the news for the past two months, and his position is not too popular with our small donors,” said Charlie Black, a senior Washington political strategist who is an volunteer adviser to Mr. McCain. “We have got to restructure the budget and the organization.”He and others rejected any notion that the moves were a precursor to Mr. McCain dropping out, particularly with the race still in its early stages and no other candidate breaking away. John Weaver, another senior adviser to the Arizona senator, said Mr. McCain, would now focus almost exclusively on the early primary and caucus states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.Following the defeat of the immigration bill last week, Mr. McCain told reporters he had no intention of leaving the race despite the setback on what has become a driving issue for him. “Why would I contemplate such a thing?” Mr. McCain said. “I don’t know why I would even remotely consider such a thing in the month of June and July. It’s always been hard for me to raise money. None of the special interests are contributing because they don’t want me to be president.”His Senate allies had hoped approval of the immigration legislation would bolster Mr. McCain politically by showing that his position on toughening the borders while offering the prospect of legal residency to some illegal immigrants was a consensus one. But the widespread Republican abandonment of the bill only further undercut him, and caused him particular trouble in Iowa where aides said polls had found his support had plummeted to single-digit numbers in the stateThe scene today at McCain headquarters in suburban Virginia outside Washington was described as somber. Across the building, people were called in and told they were being dismissed, effective immediately. They were given two weeks severance pay. Republicans close to the campaign said at least 50 workers were let go and the number could exceed 80.A dozen senior campaign aides either agreed to work without salary — like Mr. Nelson, the campaign manager — or for a reduced salary.Senior McCain advisers say they realized over the past months that they had to change a mindset that had begun with them believing they were running what one called a “Bush-Cheney campaign,” with the plush offices, army of consultants and extended staff befitting a frontrunner. Mr. McCain himself had raised questions about the size of the operation and also bristled at doing fund-raising calls.Rival campaigns said they still considered Mr. McCain a threat but said the decision to cut staff in the primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina could be disastrous since strong organization is crucial to competing in those locales.But Mr. Black, the McCain adviser, was adamant that the senator was competitive in the states hosting the three early tests and that the end of the immigration fight could ultimately help Mr. McCain since it would shift attention from the issue.“This will fade over time,” he said of the immigration fight. “He has got as good a chance as anyone else.”The immigration battle resonated particularly strongly in Iowa and South Carolina, where Senator Lindsey Graham, a top McCain ally and supporter of the measure, split sharply with Senator Jim DeMint, a leading Republican opponent of the bill.Katon Dawson, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, said that Mr. McCain had been hurt, but that the race there would be decided on more than one issue.“I do think it is wounded him, but I don’t think it has taken him out him of the game,” Mr. Dawson said. “There is time to recover from this.”'"
"'07-07-03,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, July 2 (AP) — Enriched from the sale of its wealth management subsidiary, the Charles Schwab Corporation will distribute $3.5 billion to its stockholders by buying back more than 100 million of its shares and paying a one-time dividend.Under a plan announced Monday, the stock brokerage firm, which is based in San Francisco, will pay up to $22.50 a share for its own stock — 10 percent above last week’s closing price. The price of the buyback will be set through an auction.After buying 84 million shares in the auction, the company will purchase up to 18 million additional shares from its founder and chief executive, Charles R. Schwab, to ensure that his stake in the business remains near its current level of 18 percent. He has agreed not to participate in the auction.Besides spending up to $2.3 billion to buy back stock, Schwab also will dole out $1.2 billion through a special dividend of $1 a share next month.Schwab is flush with cash after completing the $3.3 billion sale of its wealth management subsidiary, U.S. Trust Corporation, to the Bank of America. The deal, announced last fall, closed on Sunday, generating an after-tax windfall of $2.7 billion.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','With other collections, though, you felt something less personal and very nearly unkind. The Louis Vuitton collection was called “Moon Beach,” a reference to lunar tones as well as the sea-haze images of Jacques Henri Lartigue taken at Biarritz in the 1920s.Accordingly, there were silvery coats, hologram ties, jackets with facetlike seams, and lots of sensible if expensive sportswear. But after 63 exquisitely rendered outfits in cotton, kangaroo and “pattern-engineered” silk, you felt tranquilized by products.I hate clothes that suggest little or no experience with life. This has never been John Galliano’s problem. Though his men’s clothes sometimes traffic in stereotypes — the grease-stained rogue, the street hustler — he at least connects to contemporary reality, even if he is satirizing it. A kind of ragtag army theme ran through his show, staged in a church, with airplane propellers turning menacingly in the background. There were some great variations on khaki pants — cropped, roughed-up, worn over printed leggings — and coats that seemed jury-rigged from European and North African influences, as you might expect from rebels on the run.Kris Van Assche doesn’t know how to be so convincing. He makes very nice clothes, but his designs don’t seem to arise from experience or a strong imagination. It is as if they go straight from paper to cloth, without any sense of belief or a self-created world to give them a distinctive identity. A romantic sensibility alone does not support, much less explain, a coyly pleated trouser leg or a drop-neck shirt finished with a cute bow tie.Mr. Van Assche was Dior’s choice to replace Hedi Slimane as its men’s designer. On Sunday, Mr. Van Assche, a former assistant to Mr. Slimane, presented a selection of spring looks, focusing on sleek suits with quiet details and high-waist ballooning trousers with white shirts. Given that Raf Simons showed full trousers just two winter seasons ago, he might have avoided them as an opening statement.And under Mr. Slimane, Dior Homme nearly always stood out as new and provocative, in part because of the casting of his models. Mr. Van Assche chose from the pack, giving them a ’30s coif. He has time to sharpen his skates, but he must know that the standards at Dior are a little higher.How do men feel about washed silk? I was wondering that as I looked at the Lanvin collection, which Alber Elbaz designs in consort with Lucas Ossendrijver. They made such a statement with washed silk — as fluttery shorts, as pajama trousers and layers — that you have to ask the question. The pale lavender-to-gray-cream palette was a clear winner, though, and zippered cotton jackets and loose coats lent heft to the airy beach layers.The standout collections of the Paris spring men’s shows were Yves Saint Laurent and Raf Simons — and they were standouts for a reason. You felt these designers were driven to take us to a place we didn’t know. Each had something new to say about masculine dress, and they said it in a clear and modest way. And they said it using the language and symbols of their individual worlds.Stefano Pilati was perhaps too narrowly focused in his Saint Laurent collection, though that just means the clothes were good and he could have shown more. His gift is to capture the decadence of Saint Laurent and make it seem to us alive, without the burden of nostalgia. He did this with white cotton trousers splattered with paint and beautiful cotton shirts, based on a workman’s smock, and unlaced shoes in leather or in paint-drip canvas.The clothes had a grown-up relaxed authority, supplied by a sense of proportion and such well-thought-out details as sweaters and a faded sweatshirt with embroidery that mimicked darning. There were also pajama trousers (a trend this season) and cropped slouchy sweaters in sand tones over loose linen shorts.In every collection by Mr. Simons there are clues about his intentions, and these clues, like bread crumbs, inevitably lead back to his previous shows. This season, he took the trouble, with the help of his friend Peter De Potter, a writer who has done the most to document Mr. Simons’s work, to produce a press brief, explaining that the collection was about breaking down mental barriers.“The www-generation is high on instant knowledge but seems somehow low on actual experience,” the brief said.Who would bother to dispute this? More to the point, Mr. Simons didn’t need to say it. For 12 years, he has managed to say more with his clothes than any writer with a pen (or a keyboard). That is the awesome thing about his talent. He has described the whole catalog of youthful experience and emotions through the preciseness of his vision.And so he did it again Saturday night. What’s new — and it was new for fashion — was the rethinking (or reconstruction) of sportswear fabrics as well as shapes and proportions. In fashion, as Mr. Simons knows, these quickly become self-imposed barriers. Why can’t you do long sweaters that resemble tunics? Why can’t you lose the waist? Suggest volume while holding a straight line? Turn a ski-inspired boot into a stripped-down sandal?The upshot of these design explorations were lightweight coats and tops with drawstrings that created tension or volume, trousers that fit somewhat loosely through the hips and then tapered sharply down the legs, and some terrific oversize backpacks.There was also a communal spirit about the clothes — guys headed off to a summer music festival. It brought to mind a show Mr. Simons did five or six years ago, when he had no money, a hippie show in a park in Paris. It’s the same freethinking spirit, now with better clothes.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','The new works would then be staged at either the Met or Lincoln Center Theater, depending on where they seemed most at home. Practically speaking, the program has Broadway types thinking about big orchestras, the Met’s vast space and large voices. And it has classical composers intrigued by the musical theater’s tradition of tryouts and tinkering.“It’s time we try a different way of working,” said Jake Heggie, the art-song composer who wrote “Dead Man Walking” for the San Francisco Opera. “There’s a variable success rate for new operas.”Nine composers were originally chosen. The musical theater world contributed Adam Guettel (“The Light in the Piazza”), Michael John LaChiusa (“See What I Wanna See”) and Jeanine Tesori, who is working with the playwright Tony Kushner. (Together Ms. Tesori and Mr. Kushner created “Caroline, or Change.”)More operatically inclined teams are Mr. Heggie and the playwright Richard Greenberg; Rachel Portman (“The Little Prince”) and Nicholas Wright; the post-Minimalist composer Michael Torke and Des McAnuff, better known as a director; and Scott Wheeler (the opera “Democracy”) and the playwright Romulus Linney.A commission was also offered to Wynton Marsalis. Mr. Gelb said Mr. Marsalis had discussed a collaboration with the playwright John Guare. Two other teams were later added: Ricky Ian Gordon and Michael Korie, and Bill Whelan and Frank McGuinness.Each team is being offered a $50,000 commission, Mr. Bishop said. The entire cost of the project is about $2 million, split by the Met and Lincoln Center Theater. Each team or composer will be expected to submit a piano-vocal score, which will undergo workshops overseen by Lincoln Center Theater. There is no timetable.“It’s hard to put a deadline on creativity in the world of opera,” Mr. Gelb said. “The deadline is when they get the job done.”But what, exactly, are they up to?“The projects that they want to do are as eclectic as they are,” Mr. Bishop said. “Some of them are interested in writing fairly traditional operas. Some of them are clearly not remotely interested in writing that at all.” The participants have been given free rein, he said.Composers are normally reluctant to discuss embryonic works, and several did not return phone calls or declined to comment.The furthest along is Mr. Wainwright, who has already begun writing. About 30 minutes of excerpts were played for officials at a small auditorium at the Met last month, Mr. Gelb said. Mr. Wainwright has said in published interviews that the tentative title was “Prima Donna,” and that the work explores a day in the life of a singer who falls in love with a journalist. At the other end of the scale, Mr. Marsalis is tied up with other commissions and has not made much progress, a spokeswoman for Jazz at Lincoln Center, where he is artistic director, said.Mr. Kushner and Ms. Tesori said they had settled on a large-scale original story that spans five continents and five centuries and moves back and forth in time. Mr. Kushner said he did not expect the piece to be ready for two or three years.Ms. Tesori said, “What we’re trying to examine is the relationship between art and commerce, but also the story that’s told is a great, wonderful story.” She said she would wait for the text before writing music. Meanwhile, she said she was trying to determine the piece’s “sound world,” partly by attending Met rehearsals to familiarize herself with the orchestra and the house. “I’m listening to a lot of music I wouldn’t normally hear,” she said.Mr. LaChiusa said he had brought four ideas to a meeting in May. “It was a very nice riffing session,” he said. “They all liked everything, except for one idea.” He said he had yet to find a librettist and might write the text himself.Mr. Wheeler said he would set a libretto by Mr. Linney, based on one of the playwright’s previous works. “It’s a very flattering thing to be in this group,” he said. “We hope we’re good colleagues to each other.”Mr. Heggie, without elaborating, said his idea had elements of tragedy and comedy. He has two other operas pending: a piece for the Houston Grand Opera next February and an unannounced project due in 2010.“As we workshop, they’ll decide whether it’s a piece that sizewise will work better for the Met or Lincoln Center Theater,” he said. “That was a great relief to me, that I could write the way I write.”'"
"'07-07-03,'1','Dr. Hurwitz was cleared of most of the charges on which he was previously convicted, including the one involving the patient who received the prescription brandished by Ms. Tandy. The defense successfully argued that the patient was not a drug dealer and that Dr. Hurwitz never intended to give him 1,600 pills a day — that number was the result of a clerical error, not a plot to sell drugs. None of the jurors I interviewed considered Dr. Hurwitz anything like a street drug dealer, and they were appalled to learn after the trial that he had already served more time in prison than some of his patients who were caught reselling the drugs.The only lesson for doctors I can see in Ms. Tandy’s bag of pills is, “Be afraid.”No matter what you have learned in medical school, if you are prescribing opioids in doses that seems high to narcotics agents and prosecutors, you are at risk of a trial. And once you enter the courtroom, anything can happen.At the first trial, Dr. Hurwitz was convicted of writing prescriptions that caused bodily injury, crimes that carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. At the retrial, the judge dismissed the charges for the very good reason that there was no proof the prescriptions actually caused the injuries.At the first trial, the 1,600-pill argument carried the day with the jury. The foreman cited that number in explaining to The Washington Post why, even though he was “not an expert,” he was sure Dr. Hurwitz was not a “legitimate” doctor, because the number of pills went “beyond the bounds of reason.” In Dr. Hurwitz’s retrial, the prosecution tried the same strategy by repeatedly mentioning the 1,600 pills and other high-dosage prescriptions. The defense presented reams of expert testimony that there was no recognized upper limit on the level of opioids that should be prescribed. Some chronic-pain patients need enormous amounts because they develop a tolerance.One of those patients was Patrick Snowden, the man who was prescribed the 1,600 pills. His mother wrote Dr. Hurwitz a letter praising him for giving her son his life back by enabling him to deal with the pain of a foot injured so badly that he had undergone nine operations and been advised to amputate it.There was no evidence that Mr. Snowden resold any of the pills prescribed by Dr. Hurwitz, including the famous 1,600 pills. According to the defense, that scary number was a one-time fluke resulting from a clerical error when Mr. Snowden was given two new prescriptions for pills of a lower strength because his pharmacy had run out of the usual pills. The defense maintained that Dr. Hurwitz never intended Mr. Snowden to take 1,600 pills in one day and that Mr. Snowden never did take them because he realized what his proper dosage was.The prosecution fixated on the pill counts of other patients, too, often to baffling effect, because the only thing that seemed to matter was the number of pills, not their strength. When an F.B.I. agent, Aaron Weeter, prepared an elaborate chart listing the number of pills received by Dr. Hurwitz’s patients, he was questioned about its usefulness by Larry Robbins, a defense lawyer.“Would you agree that, standing alone, we can learn nothing very important from the pill count alone?” Mr. Robbins asked.“I’m not qualified to answer the question,” Mr. Weeter replied.Mr. Robbins tried working through the math with him. Wouldn’t two 40-milligram pills be no more potent than a single 80-milligram pill? But the agent stood by his pill-count charts.After the trial, the jurors told me that the defense had persuaded them to ignore the pill counts. I suppose that this could be counted as a victory for science, but it is an isolated one, because the pill-count prosecution strategy has repeatedly worked in other cases. Richard Paey, a chronic-pain patient in Florida who uses a wheelchair, was sent to prison for drug trafficking after a prosecutor argued that he could not possibly have been taking 25 pills a day himself.Most other doctors could not hope to do as well in court as Dr. Hurwitz, who had unusual advantages at his second trial thanks to his prominence and the outrage over his conviction. He was supported by some of the leading pain experts and received a pro bono defense from two top criminal lawyers in Washington who led a legal team with more than 20 members. Paying for a defense like his would probably cost at least $3 million, beyond the means of most doctors in drug cases, because their assets are normally seized long before trial.Even though Dr. Hurwitz’s defense cleared him of most of the charges, the jurors still convicted him of drug trafficking in some cases because they decided that he had ignored signs that the patients were reselling the drugs. I think that the jurors wrongly interpreted the law and the facts of the case, but I can also understand why they had a hard time figuring out what constitutes legal medical practice.They were asked to render verdicts on dozens of prescriptions given to 19 patients — the equivalent of 19 different malpractice cases involving the treatment of pain and addiction, two of the most controversial areas of medicine. The jurors did not have the time or the expertise to sort through all the complexities.After the trial, when they learned more about the pain-medicine debate and found out that Dr. Hurwitz might still be sentenced to 10 or more years in prison, several jurors expressed regret to me. They said they hoped that he was sentenced to the two and a half years that he had already served.Even if Dr. Hurwitz does walk free next week, I wouldn’t take much solace in his victory if I were a doctor treating pain patients. I wouldn’t feel safe until doctors’ prescribing practices are judged by state medical boards, as they were until the D.E.A. and federal prosecutors started using criminal courts to regulate medicine. The members of those state medical boards don’t always make the right judgment, but at least they know that there is more to their job than counting pills.'"
"'07-07-03,'1','That is when he called his former travel agent at the Tzell Travel Group in Manhattan. “She’s available for phone calls. She returns calls,” he said. “They take really good care of me, despite the fact that I’m not General Motors. The most amazing thing is that for the price of a Starbucks coffee for my girlfriend and me, I have someone on the other end that can help me, as opposed to a Web site that can give me no response.”Allen Kay, a spokesman for the Travel Industry Association, a trade group based in Washington, said travel agencies had realigned in the face of competition from online booking. “Travel agencies have gone back to their roots and focused on expertise,” he said.This is not to say that online travel booking is on the decline. Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research, said about 77 million of the nearly 141 million American adults who use the Internet and take at least one trip a year will buy their tickets online this year, up from 62.4 million in 2005. He estimated that 64 million people buy all their travel offline.But, he said, “as the airline centers have scaled back their call centers and it’s harder to get help from the travel providers themselves, finding a travel agent who is knowledgeable and takes the burden off the customer is more valuable than ever.” He said bricks-and-mortar travel agents continue to outsell online travel agents for most airlines and hotels.At Atlas Travel International, a travel management company with headquarters in Milford, Mass., that works with business and leisure travelers, sales revenue has grown 60 percent from 2005 to 2006, said Elaine Osgood, the chief executive. The Travel Store, in Cincinnati, has had a 50 percent increase in business over the last year; the company recently hired two more employees to help answer the extra calls, many from former customers, said Deborah Morgan, a travel consultant at the shop.“When you say to them, ‘You were a customer a while back. What happened?’ They say, ‘I went on the Internet and I’d find out the hotels are not what they say they are,’ ” Ms. Morgan said. “Or, ‘It takes too much time.’ ”Barry Liben, the chief executive of Tzell Travel, a corporate and leisure travel agency with 21 branches across the country, said his company expected to sell about $700 million in airline tickets this year, compared with $300 million five years ago.“Did some of our clients leave and go to the Net?” he asked. “Yes. But a great percentage have come back because it’s 9 o’clock at night, you’ve just missed your flight, you call Travelocity and see what they’ll do for you, and there’s no one there. If you show up at the Ritz-Carlton and there’s a problem in your room — go call Priceline. No one there. People want service, someone responsible who will answer their problems in a crisis. That’s what top corporate travel companies do.”Online agencies said they had taken note and were trying to improve customer service. In May 2005, for example, Travelocity officials said, they introduced Customer Championship, which includes a team that contacts travelers before their trip should unforeseen problems arise, like potentially confusing airport terminal changes.In 2004, Priceline began offering published flight prices in addition to its “name your price” fares. This year, it began working with Zagat to offer hotel reviews, photos, maps and video tours. “The area of expansion is in information,” said Brian Ek, a company spokesman in Norwalk, Conn.Although many travel agents closed up shop or consolidated after Sept. 11, others found innovative ways to stay afloat. For many of them, that involved persuading corporate clients to use their services rather than the Internet.Kevin Martin, the owner of Martin Travel Services in Lauderhill, Fla., which caters to business travelers, said his agency lost about half its bookings after Sept. 11. To save the business, which has been in his family for 25 years, he moved into a smaller office, scaled back to four days a week and began promoting his company to corporate executives. “I showed them that their employees should be outsourcing their travel arrangements instead of making an online booking that could take an hour,” he said.It worked. Today, he said, sales are about $1 million more than they were last year, and he expects them to continue climbing.Christopher Carmicle, the president of the national accounts and direct imports division at Brown Jordan International in Louisville, Ky., said he did not go anywhere without calling Mr. Martin. He said he learned his lesson in June 2000, when he was bumped from a flight from San Francisco using a ticket he had bought on the Web. “I needed to get back for a birthday party, but I got stuck for a day and a half and I missed it,” Mr. Carmicle, 33, said.Of course, nothing in life is free. Travel agents, who lost their airline commissions in the mid-1990s when airlines first capped them and then cut them, generally charge from $10 to $75, depending on the transaction. Some also charge a consultation fee, which can then be used toward the purchase of a ticket or package.But they also offer perks. Agents have given customers cellphones, itineraries, maps and a 24-hour ear in times of crisis.“I couldn’t do my international travel online,” said Mr. Carmicle, who often flies to China. “I’d be crazy to attempt to.”Many clients said they wanted help booking more complicated, more expensive trips, especially ones involving international travel.“When the consumer is making a more expensive choice, more complex and high risk, they’re not just so inclined to push a button,” said Jack Mannix, president and chief executive of the Ensemble Travel Group, an organization of 1,000 travel agencies in the United States and Canada.“There’s a huge amount of data on the Internet,” Mr. Mannix said, “but there’s a knowledge base between someone’s ears that just can’t be replicated, regardless of how much research you do.”'"

"'07-07-04,'0','For most people, one therapist is enough; for Jennifer Fox, a Manhattan filmmaker in her 40s, exploring what she cheerfully calls her “messed-up self” required a bit more input. In “Flying: Confessions of a Free Woman,” Ms. Fox takes her issues on the road, soliciting advice from female friends in more than a dozen countries. In the process, she learns that she is not unique.Part personal diary, part transglobal slumber party, “Flying” is a six-hour exploration of modern womanhood humming with talk of men. During kitchen-table chats and late-night meltdowns, women as diverse as an Egyptian journalist and an Indian civil rights lawyer struggle to control their finances and their fertility.Turning narcissism inside out, Ms. Fox uses her own romantic crisis — a rocky impasse between a married South African lover and a sweet Swiss boyfriend — to connect, sometimes hilariously, with women whose choices are far less luxurious. Her humility is the film’s strength; employing a technique she calls “passing the camera,” the filmmaker shares point of view to create a living conversation.By turns playful, sexy, tragic and contemplative, “Flying” is an addictive soap about sexuality and sisterhood. And if that makes the average man’s eyeballs roll, all the more reason for his honey to buy him a ticket.Directed by Jennifer Fox; directors of photography, Ms. Fox and her subjects; edited by Niels Pagh Andersen; music by Jan Tilman Schade; produced by Ms. Fox and Claus Ladegaard; released by Artistic License Films. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Running time: 5 hours 50 minutes, shown in two parts. This film is not rated.'"

And just as in those movies, the upstart and the champion embraced in the end, knowing that a sequel was inevitable.That was how it went after Joey Chestnut, a 23-year-old engineering student from California, ate a world-record 66 hot dogs to unseat the six-time champ, Mr. Kobayashi, at the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in Coney Island.Chants of “U.S.A.” and “Joey!

But he also pointed straight at Mr. Chestnut and yelled, “I will definitely beat him next year.”'"
"'07-07-04,'0','“I think the numbers are in the thousands, maybe tens of thousands,” said Paul Brand, a psychologist and chief executive of Mission Critical Psychological Services, a Chicago firm hired by Dyncorp International, a major contractor in Iraq, to assess and treat its workers. “Many are going undiagnosed. These guys are fighting demons, and they don’t know how to cope.”Jana Crowder, who runs a Web site for contractors seeking help, says she gets new evidence of that every day in phone calls from desperate workers.“In the first few years of the war, we were seeing a few trickle in,” said Ms. Crowder, of Knoxville, Tenn. “ Now, as contractors start coming home, you are starting to see a lot more.”Workers tell haunting tales of their psychological torment. Tate Mallory, a police officer from South Dakota who worked as a Dyncorp police trainer, was grievously wounded by a rocket-powered grenade last fall. After returning home, he was so mentally scarred that he begged his brother to kill him.Kenneth Allen, a 70-year-old truck driver from Georgia whose convoy was ambushed in Iraq, says he endures mood swings, jittery nerves and is often awake all night. And Nathaniel Anderson, a Texan whose truck was hit by rockets while hauling jet fuel, lost a contractor friend to suicide. Though suffering from stress-related symptoms himself, he has yet to see a doctor.The toll of the war on contractors has largely been hidden from public view. About 1,000 have died since the conflict began, and nearly 13,000 have been injured. While some are well compensated, many more collect modest wages for providing support services that are vital to the military.The federal government, which has paid billions of dollars to corporations for services in Iraq since the war began, has not examined the issue of mental health problems among private workers, according to Pentagon and Veterans Affairs officials. “To my knowledge, it has not been looked at systematically,” said Dr. Matthew Friedman, a Veterans Affairs official who heads the national center for post-traumatic stress syndrome.Contract workers who are wounded or disabled in the war zone are treated in military hospitals in Iraq and Germany, but once home, they are not eligible for care in the military or Veteran’s Affairs system. And unlike troops, they are not routinely evaluated for mental or stress disorders after their tours. When soldiers and veterans complained in recent months of lapses in their care, top officials in Washington promised improvements, but the plight of troubled civilian workers has not captured such attention.Many companies conduct pre-deployment psychological screening and offer limited counseling but provide few resources when their workers return home and often go off the payroll.Employers are required by federal law to provide medical insurance for workers in a war zone. Workers have filed about 205 claims for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, according to the Department of Labor, which monitors the data. Industry officials say that number significantly underrepresents the problem because many troubled people do not file claims.Of those who do, many have been denied coverage and filed lawsuits. Gary Pitts, a Houston-based lawyer, says insurers have challenged almost every claim filed by about 50 clients, even though the insurance companies paid for medical care involving their physical injuries.“The contrast between the way the military and the civilian contractors are handled on PTSD is like night and day,” said Mr. Pitts. “The contractors have to figure it out on their own, and they often have to litigate it with the insurance company.”The insurance problems may be partly related to the dearth of civilian mental health professionals equipped to deal with combat related-stress, according to Mr. Brand, the Dyncorp psychologist, and Dr. Spencer Eth, who helped write the treatment guidelines for post-traumatic stress syndrome for the American Psychiatric Association.“The availability of mental health care providers with specific expertise in this is scant around the country,” said Dr. Eth, a New York psychiatrist. “You have problems of access to care, financial obstacles to care, and so most of these people are not going to get the help they need.”AIG, the giant insurance company that provides coverage for several of the largest contractors in Iraq, has paid about half of claims involving PTSD , according to Chris Winans, an AIG spokesman. But many of the others are delayed or challenged because the insurers’ medical experts disagree with the diagnoses, he said.Mr. Pitts, the lawyer, said many contractors live in small towns or rural areas without access to high-quality mental health workers. But even when he has sent clients to respected psychiatrists or psychologists to confirm the diagnoses, AIG still often contests the claim, he said. Dyncorp, a Texas-based firm which has a State Department contract to train the Iraqi police, is sponsoring its first conference this week on post-traumatic stress for ex-employees. The company is also treating workers in Iraq after bringing in Mr. Brand’s firm to determine the extent of problems.Twenty-four percent of the Dyncorp police trainers showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder after their deployment, Mr. Brand said. He and others say they know of no other studies that formally assess the problem among private workers in Iraq.Those findings parallel an Army study earlier this year that about 17 percent of personnel in Army combat units in Iraq showed symptoms of PTSD one year after their deployment, according to Dr. Charles Hoge, chief of psychiatry at the Army’s Walter Reed Institute for Research.If marital problems, alcohol abuse and other adjustment problems are counted, the number rises to 30 to 35 percent, according to Col. Elspeth C. Ritchie, a psychiatric consultant to the Army surgeon general.Last October, Tate Mallory, the police officer from South Dakota, was riding in a Humvee in Iraq’s Anbar Province when a rocket-propelled grenade snaked into the vehicle, hit him in the lower back and went through his abdomen before exiting his inner thigh. Miraculously, the rocket did not explode, and quick-acting Marines rushed him to a combat hospital.After intensive medical care in Iraq, Germany and finally back in Sioux Falls, Mr. Mallory left the hospital in December and went to live with his brother in the Black Hills in Belle Fourche, S.D.Though his physical injuries were healing, Mr. Mallory’s psychological wounds were left untreated. He isolated himself and turned against family members, including his sister. “I called her up and just screamed, you are dead to me,” he recalls, now deeply embarrassed.He hit bottom one day in January, when he asked his brother to kill him.Brad Mallory, 45, recalls how frightening that was. “What I saw was how hollow his eyes were,” he said of his brother. “I’m a hunter, and to me, it was like when you come up on your deer, when you didn’t get a clean kill, and they just want it to be over. “He drove his brother to a local hospital emergency room, but the doctors were suspicious that his brother was faking symptoms to obtain painkillers. Eventually, Tate Mallory said, he was put on anti-depressants and began to see a psychiatrist in Sioux Falls.Mr. Anderson, the Texan truck driver who worked for KBR in Iraq, has yet to find relief. He said combat-related stress is a constant among truck drivers in Iraq.“Just about all the drivers got it and don’t realize it when they fly off the handle,” he said. Now that he is home near Houston, the 52-year-old man has difficulty eating and sleeping. He has not sought treatment for what he believes are stress-related problems and instead sounds resigned.“It just goes through your mind over and over and over,” he said, “all the stuff you’ve been through. I dream about it half the night and during the day.”'"

"'07-07-04,'0','He said the government had evidence that Mr. Zhenli, 44, had illegally imported 19 tons of pseudoephedrine, a decongestant, and intended to sell it to drug dealers who use it to manufacture methamphetamine.Mr. Zhenli denied the charge in an interview with The Associated Press published Saturday; the news agency said the interview was given in the New York office of his lawyer, Ning Ye.Mr. Zhenli said that various party officials delivered money for him to hide, but he did not provide their names.The Mexican authorities began investigating Mr. Zhenli in December, after discovering an illicit shipment of pseudoephedrine on a boat in the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, prosecutors say. The chemical was being shipped to Unimed, a pharmaceutical company Mr. Zhenli started in 1997, they said.On March 15, federal agents raided his home in an affluent section of the capital. There they found about 205 million American dollars and $22 million in other currencies and traveler’s checks. The money was stuffed in walls, suitcases and closets. They also seized eight luxury cars and seven high-powered firearms.At the time, Karen Tandy, the head of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, called the raid “the largest single drug-cash seizure the world has every seen.”Mr. Zhenli, who was born in Shanghai and became a Mexican citizen in 2002, had disappeared before the raid. Eleven other people, among them several of Mr. Zhenli’s relatives, have been arrested and charged with drug trafficking in connection with the seizures.Over the weekend, the Mexican government said Mr. Zhenli’s lawyers had sent a letter to the Mexican Embassy in Washington threatening to expose an alleged link between the cash found at his house and Mr. Calderón’s campaign unless prosecutors made a deal beneficial to the accused businessman.“These lawyers are unscrupulously and uselessly looking to blackmail the Mexican government with absurd and untrue statements,” the attorney general’s office said in a statement on Sunday.In the A.P. interview, Mr. Zhenli said the labor secretary, an important member of Mr. Calderón’s campaign last year, gave him about $150 million for safekeeping in May 2006, during the heat of the electoral battle. He also denied the chemical he had imported was pseudoephedrine, saying it was another chemical used in cough medicines.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','Immigration lawyers raised unusually irate protests yesterday after the State Department and the immigration service abruptly withdrew tens of thousands of job-based visas they had offered last month to foreign professionals hoping to become permanent residents in the United States.The outcry was provoked by a terse announcement on Monday in which the State Department said it would not grant any more visas for the 2007 fiscal year to foreigners applying to become permanent residents based on their job skills. That notice reversed one the department had issued on June 13 announcing a two-month window starting July 2 for aspiring, high-skilled immigrants from around the world to present applications for visas known as green cards.The State Department said the 60,000 visas it had expected to offer would no longer be available because of “sudden backlog reduction efforts” by Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency that processes applications for the visas offered by the department.In a statement yesterday, the American Immigration Lawyers Association accused the two agencies of perpetrating a “hoax” and a “bait and switch” against hopeful legal immigrants who played by the book.“Here people followed the rules and did everything right, yet without warning or explanation the door was slammed in their faces,” said Kathleen Campbell Walker, the president of the association.'"

Howard, a partner at Bingham McCutchen and outside counsel for Oracle, said: “SAP’s chief executive Henning Kagermann has now admitted to the repeated and illegal downloading of Oracle’s intellectual property. Oracle filed suit to discover the magnitude of the illegal downloads and fully understand how SAP used Oracle’s intellectual property in its business.”Mr. Kagermann took a different view of Oracle’s motivation, suggesting that it was exploiting some missteps at a far-flung SAP subsidiary to try to tarnish the German company’s reputation.“I was personally surprised and disappointed that Oracle had not talked to me rather than going directly to court,” he said.SAP and TomorrowNow received subpoenas from the Justice Department last week, Mr. Kagermann said. The government investigators requested documents relating to the unauthorized downloads, he said, but declined to elaborate further.A spokesman for the Justice Department had no comment.TomorrowNow downloaded the documents using the log-ins and passwords of Oracle corporate customers like Honeywell and Merck. Third-party customer-support companies like TomorrowNow often have that privilege in working on behalf of clients. “But it went beyond what was appropriate,” Mr. Kagermann said. “They downloaded materials that were not licensed, more than the customers had the rights to get.”To tighten controls, SAP has assigned Mark White, chief operating officer of SAP America, to manage operations at TomorrowNow, adding new compliance programs and employee training. Andrew Nelson, TomorrowNow’s chief executive, will report to Mr. White.Asked about Mr. Nelson’s future, Mr. Kagermann replied, “We have no evidence that Andrew Nelson knew of these inappropriate downloads.”But Mr. Kagermann added that SAP’s internal investigation was continuing, as is the Justice Department’s.The Oracle-SAP legal conflict has had little effect on the business software market so far, as corporate customers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, said Yvonne Genovese, an analyst at Gartner.At this stage, most analysts regard the legal dispute as another form of competition between fierce rivals. “The stakes seem to be mostly about the effect on SAP’s reputation,” said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.Unless the Justice Department takes action, legal experts said, the likely course of litigation would be for Oracle and SAP to go through the discovery process, and when both sides see the evidence, that will form the basis for a settlement.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','A week ago, detectives with a New York arrest warrant knocked on the door of “her Los Angeles home,” the prosecutor said, and found her parents, who “claimed they had no way of getting in touch with her.”But when a detective called Ms. Chanla’s cellphone, she answered, and said later, through her lawyer, that she wanted to surrender in New York.Ms. Chanla proceeded to fly to New York last Thursday and back to California for the weekend, then yesterday morning returned to La Guardia Airport, where she was intercepted by detectives, the prosecutor said.The prosecutor demanded $2 million cash bail to keep her from leaving town again “at her convenience.”Ms. Chanla appeared in court about noon yesterday wearing handcuffs and casual clothes — a blue shirt stretched over a slightly bulging belly, khaki Capri pants and stacked sandals. She said a soft “not guilty,” then let her lawyer, Ruth Liebesman, do the rest of the talking.Her recitation was nothing if not Rashomon-like. Although born in Laos, Ms. Chanla is an American citizen and has no passport, the lawyer began. She used two names because Chanla is her married name, and she sometimes goes by her maiden name, “as I sometimes do, too,” the lawyer added.She truly meant to surrender last week, but by the time she met with her lawyer, it was Friday afternoon, and she would have been forced to spend the weekend in jail. So she flew back to her home in San Diego, to be with her two young children, for “a possible last weekend,” Ms. Liebesman said.On top of it all, the lawyer said, her client was pregnant.With a wry smile, Justice Brenda Soloff more or less split the difference and set bail at $750,000, cash or insurance bond. Ms. Chanla is scheduled to appear on July 27.Of the two codefendants, one, Carla Zimbalist, is in custody in California, and the other, Jennifer Wilkov, the author of several self-published investment books including “Dating Your Money,” pleaded not guilty and posted a $500,000 bail bond secured by $50,000 cash on Monday, prosecutors said.Ms. Wilkov’s lawyer, Barry Bohrer, suggested yesterday that prosecutors might have had dual motives when they made their tough assessment of Ms. Chanla’s flight risk. “If an incarcerated defendant (unable to make excessive bail) suddenly ‘sees the light’ and decides to cooperate with the authorities, this too is not a development with which a prosecutor would quarrel,” he said in an e-mail message. “But is it their goal to punish through the bail-setting process? Perish the thought! That is unconstitutional.”Ms. Chanla remained in jail, and Ms. Liebesman said she doubted that her client would make bail. As she spelled her name for reporters, Ms. Liebesman made one last request, in a small show of solidarity with her client, who appears on the indictment as Pam Chanla a/k/a/ Sayasith Khammanivong, Ms. Liebesman said.“Could you call me Liebesman Martiniuk?” she said. “No hyphen.”'"
"'07-07-04,'0','NEW ORLEANS, July 3 (AP) — Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug label does not clear the manufacturer of claims that its warnings were inadequate, a judge ruled in a decision that could potentially affect thousands of federal suits against Merck over the painkiller Vioxx.“The F.D.A.’s current view on the question of immunity for prescription drug manufacturers is entirely unpersuasive,” Judge Eldon E. Fallon of Federal District Court wrote in the opinion, handed down Tuesday.Had Judge Fallon sided with Merck, the drug company could have challenged claims brought by thousands of other plaintiffs who say it is to blame for heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.The judge rejected Merck’s attempt to throw out lawsuits brought by two people who began taking Vioxx after April 2002, when the F.D.A. approved a label warning that the drug might increase the chance of such problems.Russ Herman, a spokesman for the plaintiffs’ lawyers in the federal cases, was unavailable for comment.Merck is considering an appeal, one of its lawyers, Ted Mayer, said in an e-mailed statement.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','Lewis gives the Magic the multidimensional scorer it coveted to complement Howard’s fearsome offensive presence around the basket. The Sonics’ second-round pick in 1998, Lewis became an All-Star in 2005 and has averaged 20.9 points over the past three seasons. His ability to slash to the basket and his nimble post-up game fit into the up-tempo style Eastern Conference teams are beginning to adopt.The only way the Magic could afford to sign Lewis outright was by freeing salary-cap space, and Orlando took steps to do so yesterday by announcing it had withdrawn its qualifying offer to the 7-foot Darko Milicic, the former No. 2 pick in the 2003 draft.Milicic then became an unrestricted free agent and Orlando lost its rights to match any offer from another team. The Sonics and the Magic were still working on potential sign-and-trade deals. Seattle could receive compensation for losing Lewis and Orlando could potentially free cap space to sign Milicic.Dutt spent Monday in whirlwind negotiations with Orlando, which is where Lewis felt most comfortable, he said. “At the end of the day, he felt that as much as he always enjoyed Seattle, the change would be good for him,” Dutt said.By drafting Durant and trading for the selection of another forward, Georgetown’s Jeff Green, the Sonics were signaling their move toward youth, if not a more economical payroll. Their draft-night trade sending the veteran shooting guard Ray Allen to Boston further solidified this direction.Orlando, too, made its intentions known. As the Magic veteran free agent Grant Hill looked to sign with a championship-caliber team — one that is probably out west — the franchise sought to distance itself further from an era clouded by Hill’s persistent injuries and huge contract.The Knicks were one of about 20 teams interested in Lewis, which Dutt acknowledged. But unlike the Magic, the Knicks have no chance of getting under the salary cap anytime soon. That meant that Isiah Thomas would have had to initiate a sign-and-trade with Seattle, potentially involving other teams.Going to the Magic, Dutt said, “was a little bit easier of a decision, as hard as it was.” He said the Magic had the “the ability to commit” and “do a straight sign” without many complicated moves.As Allen, a seven-time All-Star, joined the Celtics, the Knicks received power forward Zach Randolph in a trade. The Golden State Warriors traded the explosive shooting guard Jason Richardson to the Charlotte Bobcats for their No. 8 pick, Brandan Wright.While Lewis’s departure to the East was imminent, the Pistons were still negotiating to retain the free-agent point guard Chauncey Billups.“At this point, we have not reached an agreement,” said Billups’s agent, Andy Miller, referring to a published report that Billups had re-signed.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','Economists said that the price rollbacks were unsustainable and that shops and manufacturers would soon shut down and lay off workers rather than produce goods at a loss.“You can’t buy eggs or bread or things of that sort,” said John Robertson, an economic consultant in Harare, the capital. “Suppliers can’t supply them at a price that allows retailers to make a profit.”“It’s pretty chaotic,” he added. “But I think the impact will be worse if it stays in place.”Zimbabwe’s annual inflation rate was last reported to be 4,500 percent in May, a figure the government has yet to confirm. Mr. Robertson and others say that the true rate now is probably about 10,000 percent, but official statistics apparently are no longer being released.He and others said they feared that the economic collapse would quickly lead to social unrest if Zimbabwe’s already shrunken work force were hit by huge layoffs and foods like cornmeal, cooking oil and sugar became unavailable.President Robert G. Mugabe, who faces a tough election next year, has often threatened to impose price controls during Zimbabwe’s eight-year economic decline, but the controls generally were short-lived and loosely enforced. In contrast, the latest crackdown appeared to be gathering momentum, as enforcers moved over the weekend to halt price increases by wholesalers and manufacturers as well as retailers.The Ministry of Industry and International Trade ordered companies a week ago to roll back prices to the levels of June 18, a reduction of roughly 50 percent. Many initially ignored the command, but since Mr. Mugabe delivered a caustic nationally broadcast speech last week, pledging to seize the assets of industries and businesses that evaded controls, the government has more strictly enforced the order.In Mutare, on Mozambique’s eastern border, store shelves emptied last week as shoppers scooped up low-priced goods once the controls took effect, said Sampson Mugari, a regional officer of the government-financed Consumer Council of Zimbabwe. He said that some staples, like beef and chicken, were sold at reduced prices this week at some local supermarkets, but he acknowledged that supplies were limited.“They tell shoppers to queue to buy whatever they have,” he said. Two-liter cartons of a popular orange drink, priced at 400,000 Zimbabwe dollars a week ago, were sold for 120,000 dollars, or about 45 cents at the currency’s black-market exchange rate.Gasoline was reported to be vanishing from stations as the going price, about 180,000 dollars per liter, was slashed by the government to something closer to the officially approved price of 450 dollars per liter. Mr. Mugabe’s government intends to cope with the shortages by subsidizing producers of basic goods. One of the few newspapers not under government control, The Zimbabwe Independent, reported last week that flour, which is controlled entirely by the state, will be sold to bakers for 10 million dollars a ton, half the market price. Similarly, many suppliers of basic goods have been told by the government that they will be allowed to buy gasoline at one tenth the going price, the newspaper reported. The government apparently plans to make up those losses by printing more money. Zimbabwe’s dollar has lost more than half its value in recent weeks because the government has constantly issued new bills to pay its mounting debts.The Bulawayo merchant, who said he was threatened Tuesday by a government price-control official, said that prices had been doubling almost weekly at his shop. Prices for cattle at the city’s auctions are well above the prices shopkeepers have been ordered to charge, he said.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','A former Credit Suisse Group banker and a former Pakistani financier were indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges of conspiring to make illegal insider trades related to acquisitions on which the bank advised.The indictment, filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, names as defendants Hafiz Muhammad Zubair Naseem, who worked at the New York office of Credit Suisse, which is based in Zurich, and Ajaz Rahim, former head of investment banking at Faysal Bank in Karachi, Pakistan. They must appear in court to enter a formal plea to the charges.Prosecutors charged Mr. Naseem in May with feeding tips to Mr. Rahim on a $32 billion buyout bid for the TXU Corporation and eight other takeovers in which the bank was an adviser. The indictment formalizes the case against the men and is legally required before the government can put them on trial.The case stems from an investigation of insider trading in TXU options days before Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group disclosed their leveraged buyout of the power producer TXU on Feb. 26.Prosecutors say Mr. Naseem, a Pakistani citizen, placed calls to Mr. Rahim before deals involving TXU, Hydril, Trammell Crow, John H. Harland, Energy Partners, Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands, Caremark Rx and the NorthWestern Corporation.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','In January, a federal judge ordered the National Indian Gaming Commission to reconsider its initial decision on the 2002 agreement. The agency confirmed its approval in a letter to the Seneca Gaming Corporation on Monday.“It’s a great day for the Seneca nation, it’s a great day for the Seneca Gaming Corporation and it’s a great day for the City of Buffalo,” said a spokesman for the corporation, Philip J. Pantano. Opponents plan to return to federal court to challenge the tribe’s right to open the casino. They say that in giving its approval on Monday the federal commission misinterpreted a 1990 law that settled a long-running land dispute with the Seneca in upstate New York. One author of the law, the Seneca Settlement Act, said it was never intended to give the tribe the right to run casinos.“I think the National Indian Gaming Commission is dominated by pro-gambling interests,” said John J. LaFalce, a former Democratic congressman who helped write the law. “But it escapes the essential issue of whether the Seneca Settlement Act contemplated Indian gaming, which it did not. That’s an issue that has to be decided by the courts.”Indeed, a broad coalition of Buffalo’s political, business and cultural leaders plan to go to federal court next week to challenge the Seneca’s right to run a casino on its property in Buffalo.“We are now poised to go to court without procedural impediments to discuss land status issues, whether it’s sovereign territory and whether it is Indian land,” said Joseph M. Finnerty, the lawyer who is coordinating the state and federal lawsuits opposing the casino. “We feel just as confident today that we are right on those issues and will win on these issues.”“I’d say to the patrons at the temporary casino, ‘Don’t get too comfortable,’ ” Mr. Finnerty said.By Tuesday evening, the parking lot on the site was full. Inside the small, blue metal building bearing the word “Casino” in simple white lettering, the smell of cigarette smoke hung in the warm, muggy air of the single public room.One concession stand offered hot dogs, cold sandwiches and baked goods, but no alcohol was being served. Still, every machine was in play, with short lines at a few.“It’s ridiculous,” said Loretta Tozzo of Buffalo, who spent about an hour at the slots. “You can’t breathe in there. They should have waited to open something better.”As she left, Mrs. Tozzo said she and her husband, Louis, were headed to Niagara Falls, about 20 miles away, to the Seneca-run casino there.'"

"'07-07-04,'0','TEHRAN, July 3 — Venezuela agreed to sell Iran gasoline on Tuesday, less than a week after Iran unveiled a rationing program to limit its dependence on gasoline imports.“The Iranian government has asked to buy gasoline from us, and we have accepted the request,” Rafael Ramírez, Venezuela’s energy minister, told the newspaper Shargh. He declined to specify the quantity of gasoline Venezuela would sell to Iran or at what price.Iran, a major oil exporter, imports 40 percent of its gasoline because of high consumption and limited refining capacity. While gasoline costs about $2 a gallon on world markets, the government sells it for 34 cents, a subsidy that costs it about $5 billion a year.Iran imports gasoline from 16 countries, including India, the Netherlands, France and the United Arab Emirates.Energy analysts say Tehran began rationing gasoline last week primarily in an effort to cut gasoline consumption in anticipation of possible sanctions over its nuclear program. The United States Congress is considering a bill that would impose sanctions on any company selling gasoline to Iran, and the United Nations Security Council will meet in September to discuss tougher sanctions against Tehran.“It is not clear whether it would be economical for Iran to import gasoline from Venezuela because of the long distance,” said Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst in Tehran. “But it can certainly be very important if other countries refuse to sell us gasoline because of international pressure,” he added.'"
"'07-07-04,'0','In another sign that troubles in the mortgage market are spreading, a prominent hedge fund that specializes in bonds backed by home loans has suspended redemption requests by investors.The Horizon ABS Fund managed by John Devaney, a well-known trader of asset-backed securities who is based in Florida, said yesterday that it made the decision to block withdrawals after one investor who accounted for about a quarter of its $650 million in assets sought to leave the fund.The move comes on the heels of a near collapse of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, which, like Mr. Devaney’s fund, invested in complex mortgage securities that do not trade frequently and can be hard to value. Bear Stearns was forced to lend $1.6 billion to one of the two funds after investors sought to withdraw funds and lenders to the funds demanded that managers raise more capital to make up for a drop in market value.Mr. Devaney’s firm, United Capital Markets, said it did not face margin calls and that it had $145 million in cash to meet any demands from its lenders. The firm uses Merrill Lynch as its prime broker. Merrill seized about $800 million in mortgage securities from the Bear Stearns funds.The fund’s borrowings stand at about one and half times its assets, considerably below the 10 times leverage used by one of the two Bear Stearns funds, according to someone briefed about the fund but not authorized to speak publicly about it.'"

"'07-07-04,'0','Kraft Foods, the maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, said today that it had offered $7.2 billion in cash for the biscuit business of Groupe Danone, the French food and beverage giant.The sale would give Kraft a new asset in the snack food business, its fastest growing segment, and allow it to extend its global reach.For Danone, which said that the offer was a “strong strategic and industrial opportunity,” the sale would allow it to spend more money on its long-term growth strategy. Franck Riboud, the chief executive of Danone, said at a news conference in Paris that he wanted to accelerate the development in products like dairy and water.The business that Kraft is trying to buy includes operations in 20 countries that employ about 15,000 people in 36 manufacturing facilities. It does not, however, include Danone’s biscuit brands in India or Latin America.Kraft’s footprint in Europe and Asia would grow considerably as a result. The purchase would double Kraft’s business in China and allow it to enter the market in Russia, where Danone is a big player.“Danone’s strength in Europe is a perfect complement to our strength in America,” Kraft’s chief executive, Irene Rosenfeld, said at the press conference.'"

"'07-07-04,'0','“We are on target to achieve that objective,” Ron Hartwig, a Getty spokesman, said in an e-mail message. (The museum has already offered to transfer title to the statue.)Yet the people of Aidone are tired of waiting. For this town the statue has become a blazing symbol of Italy’s legal and moral battle against foreign museums and private collectors that bought archaeological artifacts with hazy backgrounds, plundering the nation of its heritage.For decades the Sicilian countryside has been a prime target for tomb robbers and a network of compliant traders.“Morgantina was sacked for too long,” said Giovanni Calafiore, president of the Aidone chapter of an amateur archaeology association, who organized a bring-back-the-Aphrodite protest march in December. “Now we’re fighting to get back what’s rightfully ours.”Beatrice Basile, the art superintendent for the province of Enna, which includes Morgantina, said the campaign to win back the statue had had a profound psychological impact on the townspeople.“It’s given an identity to the people in Aidone, who feel very strongly that this is a restitution that in some way would compensate for a collective loss to their society,” she said.Even though the statue is still in the Getty Museum’s villa in Pacific Palisades, Calif., this newfound self-awareness has already had a practical effect. Sicilians here are now far more willing to patrol the countryside to crack down on clandestine digs and to help investigators in individual cases, Ms. Basile said.“This is the miracle of the Aphrodite,” she added.The statue, 7 ½ feet tall with a limestone torso and marble head and limbs, is also among the contested pieces cited in the case against Marion True, the Getty’s former curator of antiquities, who is being tried in Rome on charges of trafficking in looted art. She denies any wrongdoing.The museum is also negotiating with Italian officials over 51 other artifacts in its collection.The Getty bought the Aphrodite from a London dealer, Robin Symes. A handwritten bill of sale dated March 18, 1986, indicates that Mr. Symes bought a fifth-century B.C. “acrolith statue of a draped woman” from Renzo Canavesi, then a currency-exchange operator in Chiasso, Switzerland.A postscript in the bill of sale said the statue had belonged to Mr. Canavesi’s family since 1939, the year that a law was passed in Italy making it illegal to export any archaeological artifact from the country without government permission.In 2001 Mr. Canavesi was tried in Italy on charges of illegal trafficking involving the Aphrodite. But on appeal his conviction was thrown out because the statute of limitations had expired, according to Italian documents. In August 1987, before buying the artifact, the Getty contacted the Italian culture ministry through a lawyer seeking information on the authenticity and provenance of a statue of Aphrodite. The museum later said the ministry told the lawyer that Italy had no information about the statue.In July 1988 Ms. True officially informed the culture ministry that the Getty board had approved the acquisition. She invited the Italians to contact the museum with “any information on the recent history of this object that you believe might be important to us.”Italian investigators had already redoubled their efforts to track down the statue’s origins.Fausto Guarnieri, chief investigator of the Italian special art-theft squad in the 1980s, said in an interview that in the fall of 1987 some disgruntled tomb robbers led him to a spot in Morgantina and told him that the statue’s marble head had been found there.“At the time there was a rumor that the statue had been shipped to Nice with a cargo of cereal, and then smuggled into Switzerland,” Mr. Guarnieri recalled.Rumors also flew that the statue had been offered to several Sicilian antiquities traders before it left Italy. A 1988 article in Connoisseur magazine identified Orazio Di Simone, a Sicilian antiquities dealer living in Switzerland, as the suspected smuggler.Francesco Tagliaferri, a lawyer defending Mr. Di Simone in an unrelated looted-antiquities case that began in Rome in May, said his client denied involvement with the statue. “That’s a fairy tale, just rumors,” he said.Around 1988, Mr. Guarnieri said, the Italian authorities questioned two Sicilian brothers, Mr. Di Simone and a Sicilian who was believed to traffic in looted art, accusing them of looting and exporting the statue. But the case never went to trial for lack of evidence.Mr. Symes has never been charged in Italy for his role in the sale of the statue.Aidone citizens hope scientific studies will help fill in the gaps that court evidence has not, and then convince the Getty that the artifact was looted in Sicily. A decade ago Rosario Alaimo, a geochemistry professor at the University of Palermo, was asked to compare samples of the limestone of the Getty statue with samples taken from a statue 200 years younger in the Aidone museum that had been excavated in Morgantina.“We concluded that both statues were made of material that came from the same geological formation,” quarried in southeastern Sicily, near Ragusa, said Professor Alaimo, who presented his findings at a Getty workshop on the Aphrodite in May. Both statues are Sicilian, he said in a telephone interview. “That is the most probable hypothesis.”Malcolm Bell III, a University of Virginia professor who directs excavations at Morgantina, said he neither embraced nor rejected the idea that the Aphrodite came from that site.“I’ve talked to people who ought to know, and they’ve never said anything about finding the statue,” he said in an interview in Aidone. “What I can say is that it was made by an extremely talented sculptor, and if we knew where it had been found, we’d know a lot about the artistic expression of the fifth century B.C.”In the meantime, archaeologists continue their painstaking dig at Morgantina, slowly bringing to light a Greek city that fell to the Romans in 211 B.C. This spring work progressed on a bath complex at the site from the third century B.C.Sandra K. Lucore, who is overseeing the baths excavation, describes Morgantina as a snapshot of an experimental period in Sicilian history “when technology and ideas came together to spawn some very innovative solutions,” she said.“You get the sense here that they were really thinking on their feet, using materials in a new way,” she said in an interview at the site. “The baths are an excellent example of this organic development.”These days Morgantina is relatively well guarded. Custodians sleep there at night, and two years ago a new metal fence was built around the site’s perimeter.In Aidone, meanwhile, the museum, which reopened in March after a three-year restoration, is a focus of civic pride. When a national news broadcast erroneously reported in April that the Aphrodite’s return was imminent, hundreds of residents marched boisterously to the museum’s doors.“We really weren’t used to that,” Maria Locanda, a custodian there, said.Local pride was also boosted by an accord brokered last year by the Italian government with the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Under the pact, the Met also transferred title to a set of 16 silver pieces from the third century B.C. that Italy said were illegally excavated from Morgantina.The pieces will remain at the Met until January 2010, then travel to the Aidone museum. Dr. Basile said the silver would be exhibited in a showcase designed especially for it.And there is more than enough room for the larger-than-life-size Aphrodite, she added hopefully.Sicilian officials argue that a return of the Aphrodite could be a boon to the region’s economy. While the area’s culinary traditions, sandy shores and crystalline waters have long lured international tourists, they say, important cultural attractions also boost visitor numbers.“Our model for growth is the management and development of our cultural past, and we’re focusing on Sicily as a whole,” Mr. Leanza, the Sicilian culture minister, said.He cited the Roman villa of Casale in Piazza Armerina, about 10 miles from Aidone, which he said draws 700,000 people each year.“The Aphrodite will bring wealth to the territory,” he said. “She is a source of well-being we have to exploit. This is our real wealth.”“The idea is that the entire island is a museum,” he said. “Few museums in the world can match that potential.”'"

"'07-07-05,'0','In short, says Jonathan Gruber, an economist, health expert and Clinton administration veteran, the times are “radically different.”In fact, when Senator Barack Obama of Illinois unveiled a plan aimed at covering tens of millions of uninsured Americans — but not requiring coverage for all — some Democrats in rival campaigns complained that he had not gone far enough. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, once vilified for overreaching on health care, is now more often faulted in her party for moving too slowly. Her 1994 plan, attacked at the time from the left, right and center, is presented in the new Michael Moore documentary, “Sicko,” as a tragic missed opportunity.This amount of attention, this early, comes in response to the growing anxiety among voters — and much of American business — about the cost of health care. Premiums for family coverage have risen by 87 percent since 2000, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The number of Americans without insurance has grown steadily, to what the Census Bureau estimates as nearly 45 million, from 37 million when the Clintons first confronted the issue.Businesses say that health costs are a huge liability in their struggles to compete in a global economy, most dramatically in the auto industry. And health care is now rated the top domestic issue in some recent polls among Democrats, independents and voters overall. Among Republicans, it was surpassed only by immigration in June, according to the latest Kaiser survey. A Democratic pollster, Geoffrey Garin, says: “There are a bunch of issues that candidates can take a pass on. This is not one of them.”On the Republican side, few candidates have been better prepared to deal with the issue than former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who helped push through that state’s bipartisan health plan. But Republican primary voters are leery of new government requirements, and, arguably, of Massachusetts as a role model. Mr. Romney, on the campaign trail, talks generally about getting “everybody inside the health care system,” through “market reforms” state by state to make private insurance cheaper and more available. But not, he says “with a government takeover.”Sally Canfield, policy director for the Romney campaign, says that Mr. Romney is proud of his record, but that “The Massachusetts plan was crafted for Massachusetts,” and that a national plan would be different. For example, aides said he did not support a federal version of the Massachusetts requirement that individuals obtain insurance.His rivals are casting themselves as equally committed to improving the health care system, but even more determined to use free-market principles to do so, which they hope will prove themselves more attuned to the Republican base. Mr. Giuliani plans to produce a major proposal in the next month, aides say, that will elaborate on his commitment to “affordable and portable free-market solutions.”Mr. Giuliani says he wants to give individuals more control over — and responsibility for — health insurance, encouraging them to buy their own coverage on the private market and giving them “a very big tax deduction” to do it. Right now, most Americans under 65 get their coverage through their employers, who have the benefit of significant tax advantages, pooled risk and group rates.Mr. Giuliani’s approach echoes Mr. Bush’s call for an “ownership society,” which was popular with economic conservatives but widely criticized for putting too much risk on individuals. “Every one of the Democrats wants government-mandated health insurance,” Mr. Giuliani said recently. “We have to go in exactly the opposite direction.”Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, will also outline a health care plan this summer, aides said. They said it would be aimed at making coverage “affordable and available,” using tax credits and the expansion of programs like the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, but would include no new mandates on individuals.Analysts say the Democrats are clearly drawing lessons from the health care battles from 1993 to 1994, when a similar public groundswell for change collapsed in a matter of months. The 1,342-page Clinton plan that year was bewilderingly bureaucratic and easy for opponents to characterize as something that would actually worsen the status quo for many insured Americans.This year, the major Democratic proposals — including Mr. Obama’s, one from former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina and a plan expected from Mrs. Clinton — are arguably ambitious and costly, but do not attempt the wholesale reinvention of the system, or move explicitly toward the government takeover Republicans so often predict.“There’s not a lot of untested political ideas out there,” said Robert Blendon, a professor in health policy at Harvard University.The major Democratic plans announced so far attempt to cover nearly everyone by shoring up the employer-based system, creating new public insurance options and establishing new health insurance purchasing pools that offer a variety of private and public plans to people who cannot get coverage through work. People who could not afford coverage would get subsidies. Given those supports, some Democrats (including Mr. Edwards and — it is widely expected but not yet announced — Mrs. Clinton) back the idea of requiring every individual to obtain insurance.Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obama call for financing their plans with revenues from the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, which are set to expire in 2010.Diane Rowland, executive vice president of Kaiser, said candidates are responding not only to recent failures, but also to recent successes, notably in Massachusetts and potentially California.“To get something enacted, you need a lot of people who think they will gain from it,” Ms. Rowland said. “It’s a new way of talking about health reform, because it shows people with health insurance what they could gain. These proposals are not just about the haves vs. the have-nots.”Few have taken that advice more to heart than Mrs. Clinton, who is rolling out her proposals to control costs and improve quality before her ideas for covering the uninsured, which are expected in the next few months. She recently, for example, proposed a “Best Practices Institute” to assess the most effective treatments and procedures.Another hallmark of this year’s plans, in both parties, is a reliance on better health information technology and disease management to hold down costs — not the more rigorous regulatory structures proposed in 1994, which critics asserted would soon lead to rationing.By the time the general election rolls around, polls indicate that the issue will be front and center, setting the stage for another great battle to overhaul the system under the next president. Veterans of the Clinton administration say it all feels very familiar.“If the Democrats win, it will be very hard not to take this issue on,” said Mr. Gruber, who is helping to implement the Massachusetts plan. “It will be as promising as it was in the early 1990s.”'"

Temperatures are expected to peak at 113 to 116 degrees in Las Vegas today and Friday, and are expected to reach 115 to 122 along the Colorado River valley, including the areas around Lake Mead and Lake Mohave. The warning continues through 9 p.m. Pacific time on Friday.An excessive-heat warning is issued when temperatures are forecast to rise high enough to endanger many people’s health unless they take precautions. Authorities urged people, especially tourists who are not acclimated to desert heat, to confine their outdoor activities to the early morning or late evening hours, to drink plenty of water and to stay in air conditioned rooms as much as possible during the afternoon.The temperature in Needles, Calif., hit 120 degrees on Wednesday, breaking the previous record of 118 established in 1985.Even in the northern Rockies, forecasters said, temperatures will reach the high 90s and low 100s today.Meanwhile, the area from Oklahoma City to Dallas was bracing for thunderstorms that could dump 3 to 5 inches of additional rain in some areas. Since the ground in the region is already saturated by previous heavy rains, the new downpours could quickly lead to flash flooding.Authorities warned motorists who encounter flood-covered roads not to drive through water of unknown depth.

Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, had agreed to hold a hearing on the legislation, which would give members of Congress an opportunity to question officials from the park service about their management of the statue. An aide to Mr. Weiner said that one proposed solution would be to allow access to the crown only to small groups at any one time.“It’s just so symbolic of two things,” Mr. Weiner said yesterday. “One, the crown and the Statue of Liberty are so symbolic of America and American values, but it’s also so symbolic of how bureaucracies get locked into uncreative ways of thinking.”David Barna, chief of public affairs for the park service, said that the agency had been considering shutting down the staircase to the statue’s crown before the Sept. 11 attacks.“There was concern mostly about fire safety and fire protection,” Mr. Barna said. “If you had a trash can fire at the bottom of that spiral stair, you could be in trouble very quickly.”He also said that officials were concerned that if someone had a heart attack or other medical emergency at the top of the statue, it would be hard to get the person down.He said that for those reasons, when the pedestal was reopened in 2004, officials decided to keep the staircase closed.“Yes, it is and was about terrorism,” Mr. Barna said. “But yes, it is and it was about ensuring the safety of our visitors. That crown access route violates every fire code in the city of New York and the state of New York and the state of New Jersey.

"'07-07-05,'0','Perth — indeed all of Western Australia — is in the midst of what local newspapers call a housing affordability crisis. Home prices in the city jumped 46 percent last year and although they have slowed, they are still creeping up.The median price of a home here rose to 455,000 Australian dollars ($390,000), just shy of prices in Sydney. That is as if prices in Houston began to rival those in New York City, or it cost as much to live in Lille, France, as in Paris. Housing in Perth now costs eight times the average resident’s income, compared with just over seven times in New York.“It’s great news for those already in the market, but very difficult for first-time buyers and those trying to get into the market,” said Rob Druitt, president of the Real Estate Institute of Western Australia.What is happening in Perth is a side effect of the global boom in commodities on exporting countries like Australia. While property prices in the United States and elsewhere have eased in many places after an extended wave of speculation, prices in cities riding the export boom are still heading upward.They are rising, as well, in Asian cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, but young people there tend to live with their parents until they are married and can buy their own homes. In Australia, young people typically move out when they finish school, if not sooner.With its warm climate, nearby vineyards and beaches, the Perth region has been something of a sanctuary for its 1.5 million residents, the antithesis to increasingly crowded Sydney and Melbourne. A city of suburbs, Perth was a place where one could still pursue the Great Australian Dream: owning a home with a barbecue in the backyard.The scene in Perth today is in some ways a throwback to the gold rush of the 1890s; only the rush today is for copper, nickel and iron ore. Western Australia sends out $130 million a day in exports, and the big mining companies cannot keep up with demand. Roughly $58 billion in mining expansion projects are under way to bolster output.There are not enough workers to fill those projects. Mining companies are so desperate for labor that they offer to let workers live in Perth and fly them hundreds of miles to work in the mines.The pay and perks have lured workers from other industries. Plumbers and electricians are rare now in Perth. Restaurants and tourist places have cut back operating hours because of staff shortages.“Anyone who can cook is going up and earning big money on a mining camp,” said Alan Langford, chief economist at HBOS Australia, a diverse financial services company in Perth.The Australian government responded in May by lifting immigration quotas. Last year, Western Australia also started a nationwide advertising campaign, “Go West Now.”There is a sort of east-west divide, with Western Australia’s economy growing 7 percent a year, compared with 4.2 percent for the country as a whole. The national unemployment rate fell last year to 4.8 percent; in Western Australia, 3.1 percent.Huge fortunes are being made. Andrew Forrest recently reached the $3 billion mark, as higher iron ore prices swelled the value of shares in his company, Fortescue Metals.People have stopped calling Perth a backwater. In the past, career-oriented residents who wanted higher-paying jobs moved east. “Now, that’s flipped around because of the resource boom,” Mr. Druitt of the real estate institute said. “It’s changing Perth from being a beautiful place to live to being also a great place to work.”City planners are hoping to further revitalize the city by moving underground the rail line that divides the downtown area from trendier areas across the tracks. Using Potsdamer Platz in Berlin as a model, the city wants to lure singles and other professionals.But for many singles, housing is out of reach. First-time buyers fell to just 13 percent of all home purchases in Perth last year. While the average wage in Western Australia surpassed 55,800 Australian dollars last year, the average mortgage payment kept rising, to a third of that.“I just can’t get a loan for what I need,” Mr. Thomas said. “I’d have to get a crummy house.”Escalating housing prices are reflected in rents. With vacancy rates below 1 percent, rents rose 27 percent on average last year, and landlords have been able to hold “rent auctions” for eager applicants.Particularly hard hit are households earning less than 60,000 Australian dollars (about $51,000) a year, said Paul Pendergast, policy manager at Shelter WA, a community organization that advocates affordable housing. “It sounds great to talk about the boom,” he said, “but it’s not evenly spread. Anyone who’s not already a homeowner or not already working in the mining industry is suffering.”Shelter WA and other critics accuse the state government of failing to release public land fast enough for development. Mr. Pendergast also criticizes the federal government for cutting money for construction of low-cost housing.Some in the real estate business say the boom may be waning: The number of properties on the market has tripled and it can now take as long as a month to sell one. But prices rose 5.6 percent more in the first quarter, and economists say prices will keep climbing as long as the market prices of resources continue to climb.“All the stars are still aligned for the Western Australian economy,” said John Garland, a real estate agent in Perth who has been in the business since 1965.They no longer beckon to Mr. Thomas. He has decided to make a contrarian bet, head east and look for a two-bedroom apartment in central Melbourne. “When the mining stuff slows down in Perth in 10 years,” he said, “people will be more interested in Melbourne again.”'"
"'07-07-05,'0','Mr. Kobayashi bowed and was humble in defeat. But he also pointed straight at Mr. Chestnut and yelled, “I will definitely beat him next year.”While there were plenty of patriots in the crowd cheering for an American to win the belt for the first time this decade, Mr. Kobayashi clearly has established a following. Japanese and American fans flooded the stage in search of autographs after Mr. Kobayashi lost the championship this year by three hot dogs and buns. One woman carried a sign that read in Japanese, “If we get married, I’ll make you hot dogs every day.”Another fan yelled “Tora, tora, tora!” just before the event began.The showdown more than lived up to expectations and a weeklong buildup. Last month, in a Tempe, Ariz., qualifying contest, Mr. Chestnut broke Mr. Kobayashi’s world record by 6 hot dogs, stuffing down 59 and a bite in 12 minutes, or one every 12 seconds or so.Then Mr. Kobayashi reported on his Web site in late June that he had an unexplained ailment that limited the motion of his jaw: he could open his mouth no wider than a fingertip, and even then with pain. To help relieve the stress on his jaw, he had a wisdom tooth removed, leading to swelling.As recently as Friday, he appeared unable to eat anything more substantial than yogurt and rice porridge, making it unclear whether he would be able to compete. A few hours before the event, Mr. Kobayashi went to an acupuncturist to relieve his pain.Like the 15-round epics between Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed, the outcome was unclear until the end. The rivals matched each other frank for frank. Mr. Chestnut, who has also won championships for eating grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken wings and deep-fried asparagus, jumped out to an early lead, but was never more than three hot dogs ahead.Mr. Kobayashi, who wolfed down nearly 18 pounds of pan-seared cow brains to win the Glutton Bowl, made a push in the last several minutes to finish in a tie. The two men were eating so fast, stuffing several hot dogs in their mouth at once, that midway through the contest, several of the 15 other entrants had stopped eating and were watching the main event at center stage.“It was kind of hard to concentrate on my own stuff,” said Erik Denmark, a challenger from Seattle, Wash. “I felt the emotion of the event.”Since both leaders appeared to have consumed 63 hot dogs and buns at the finish, the judges spent several minutes in a somewhat bizarre recount. According to the rules, whatever is in contestants’ mouths when the buzzer rings counts toward their total, assuming they can swallow it.Mr. Chestnut seemed to have finished what he had started, while Mr. Kobayashi apparently spit out some of what was in his mouth, leading to a recalculation. The judges also counted the scraps of food left on the contestants’ plates.When Mr. Chestnut was announced as the winner with 66 hot dogs and buns eaten, Mr. Kobayashi slumped in his chair, draped in a silver-colored blanket typically used by marathon runners.Some spectators suspected that the reports of the precompetition mouth injury suffered by Mr. Kobayashi was a hoax created by the organizers to drum up publicity for the event, which was broadcast on ESPN. Others in the crowd, which spilled out onto Surf Avenue, said Mr. Kobayashi had been trying to psych out Mr. Chestnut.Scott Johnston, 42, who drove from Potomac Falls, Va., with his twin brother and nephew to see the event, held up a sign saying Mr. Kobayashi had “Chestnut-itis.”“He is playing head games,” Mr. Johnston said. “He’s the champ, so he’s the one to knock off.”Mr. Johnston said he, his brother and the 14-year-old nephew would hold their own contest to see who could eat three hot dogs the fastest. For protection, he brought along a roll of Rolaids.'"

She is a member of the American Contract Bridge League’s Hall of Fame, and has been instrumental in the explosion of bridge’s popularity in China, where she was born. Nowadays she plays little but showed that she still has a good feel for the game in the diagramed deal, which occurred on June 21 at Temple Shaarei Shalom in Boynton Beach, Fla. It was a matchpointed duplicate, where overtricks were important.A hand worth a traditional weak-two opening contains a good six-card suit, does not have four cards in another major and has fewer than two first-round controls. Here West opened with a modern weak two. When you do not have opening strength but you hold a long suit, you pre-empt.Wei-Sender (South) knew that her partner’s hand was weak. So she overcalled three hearts, getting her five-card major into the game, in preference to making a takeout double.After two passes East competed with four diamonds.Now many players holding that South hand would have doubled. If Aaron Simon (North) had passed, the contract would have been down one, giving North-South 100 points. If North had bid five clubs, he would probably have gone down one, minus 100, the defenders taking two diamonds and one heart.Wei-Sender realized that her partner had club length, and thinking that West might be void in diamonds, she bid five clubs, which was passed out.'"

"'07-07-05,'0','The first is an information bias. An intelligent decision about whether to enter any tournament requires an accurate estimate of the odds of winning. Yet people’s assessments of their relative skill levels are notoriously optimistic. Surveys show, for example, that more than 90 percent of workers consider themselves more productive than their average colleague.This overconfidence bias is especially likely to distort career choice because, in addition to the motivational forces that support it, the biggest winners in many tournaments are so conspicuous. For example, N.B.A. stars who earn eight-figure salaries appear on television several nights a week, whereas the thousands who failed to make the league attract little notice.Similarly, hedge fund managers with 10-figure incomes are far more visible than the legions of contestants who never made the final cut. When people overestimate their chances of winning, too many forsake productive occupations in traditional markets to compete in winner-take-all markets.A second reason for persistent overcrowding in winner-take-all markets is a structural problem called “the tragedy of the commons.” This problem helps explain, for instance, why we see too many gold prospectors, an occupation that has much in common with prospecting for corporate deals. In the initial stages of exploiting a newly discovered gold field, adding another prospector may significantly increase the total amount of gold found. Beyond some point, however, additional prospectors contribute little. The gold found by a newcomer to a crowded field is largely gold that would have been found by existing searchers.A simple numerical example helps illustrate why private incentives often lead to wasteful overcrowding under these circumstances. Consider a man who must choose whether to work as an engineer for $100,000 or become a prospector for gold. Suppose he considers the nonfinancial aspects of the two careers equally attractive and expects to find $110,000 in gold if he becomes a prospector, $90,000 of which would have been found in his absence by existing prospectors. Self-interest would then dictate a career in prospecting, since $110,000 exceeds the $100,000 engineering salary. But because his efforts would increase the total value of gold found by only $20,000, society’s total income would have been $80,000 higher had he instead become an engineer.Similar incentives confront aspiring portfolio managers. Beyond some point, adding another highly paid manager produces little increase in industry commissions on managed investments. As in a crowded real estate market, the additional manager’s commissions come largely at the expense of commissions that would have been generated by existing managers. So here, too, private incentives result in wasteful overcrowding.Matthew Rhodes-Kropf, a finance professor at Columbia Business School, has argued that higher taxes on hedge fund and private equity firm managers are bad economic policy. “Private equity is a very important part our economy,” he said, adding that higher taxes will discourage it. Others have characterized the proposed legislation as envy-driven class warfare.Both observations miss the essential point. No one denies that the talented people who guide capital to its most highly valued uses perform a vital service for society. But at any given moment, there are only so many deals to be struck. Sending ever larger numbers of our most talented graduates out to prospect for them has a high opportunity cost, yet adds little economic value.By making the after-tax rewards in the investment industry a little less spectacular, the proposed legislation would raise the attractiveness of other career paths, ones in which extra talent would yield substantial gains. And the additional tax revenue could pay for things that clearly need doing. For example, we could reduce the number of children who currently lack health insurance, or reduce the number of cargo containers that enter our ports without inspection.Opponents of higher taxes often invoke the celebrated trade-off between equity and efficiency. But that objection makes no sense here. Ending preferential tax treatment of portfolio managers’ earnings would serve both goals at once.'"

"'07-07-06,'1','“Was there a lack of communication between us and the State Department?” said William G. Wright, a spokesman for the immigration agency. “Certainly.”The episode started on June 12, when the State Department announced in a monthly bulletin that green cards would be available starting July 2 for applicants across the range of high-skilled categories. That was a signal to immigrants who have been working in this country on temporary visas that they would be able to apply to become permanent residents.Thousands of immigrants rushed to obtain certified documents, assemble employer sponsorship papers, take medical examinations and dispatch their applications. Many canceled travel plans so they could be in the United States when their applications arrived on July 2, as the law required.But on Monday, the State Department announced that no more green cards were available. Snared in the turnabout were well-educated, highly skilled, legal immigrants, many of them doctors and medical technicians, with long work experience in this country. All had obtained federal certification that no American workers were available for the jobs they hold. The episode laid bare conflicting interests between the State Department, which manages the offering of visas, and the Citizenship and Immigration Services, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security that processes the visa applications.By law, only about 140,000 employment-based visas are available annually, so there are huge backlogs of applications.State Department officials said their June alert that visas were available was intended to prompt the immigration agency to speed its processing so that no visas would go unused. Since 2000, a total of 182,694 work-based visas have not been given out because the immigration agency had fallen behind in processing applications, according to the 2007 report of the immigration agency’s ombudsman.“We were determined that every employment number that was available would be used,” June Kunsman, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for visa services, said yesterday.Immigration agency officials said they were surprised by the department’s action. They said they immediately advised the department that they had already finished approving enough applications to use 60,000 visas of those offered. Department officials did not revise their public notice offering visas.“We said we already have more than enough applications and we expect to complete them in time to use the visa numbers,” said Mike Aytes, director of domestic policy operations at the immigration agency.To complete the applications in time, the immigration agency put employees to work both days last weekend at service centers in Texas and Nebraska, immigration officials said. They said that 25,000 applications were processed in the final 48 hours before Monday’s deadline.In some cases, security clearances required by the F.B.I. were not entirely completed, immigration officials said. The agency approved some applications “when we were certain the process will be completed very shortly,” Mr. Aytes said.In its bulletin on Monday, the State Department said that “unexpected action” by the immigration agency had used up all the visas for the 2007 fiscal year.The news was crushing to Murtuza Bahrainwala, a 38-year-old occupational medicine doctor from India who works at Decatur Memorial Hospital in Illinois. After nearly 12 years working as a physician on temporary visas, Dr. Bahrainwala believed in June that his chance for a green card had finally come. “Apply for citizenship, that’s absolutely what we want to do,” he said. Once he has a green card, his wife would also be authorized to work, and he could accept promotions and change jobs, which he cannot do with a temporary visa.But because the application he delivered on Monday was not accepted, Dr. Bahrainwala may have to wait four or five years to apply again.“Right from complete ecstasy, you go down to the depths of depression,” Dr. Bahrainwala said. “I have never been illegal a single day in this country.”“Maybe I should have just crossed the Rio Grande,” he added.Immigration lawyers said that the situation punished immigrants who were identified as highly desirable by the system and who have always gone by the book.“They’ve played by the rules for years,” said Daryl Buffenstein, co-chairman of the global immigration practice at Paul Hastings, a law firm. “Now the government is not playing by the rules.”'"
"'07-07-06,'1','Advanced Medical’s offer arrived on the last day in the 50-day period left by Bausch’s agreement with Warburg allowing Bausch to solicit higher bids. A person with knowledge of the offer said that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, which is advising Advanced Medical; and others might join in the bid.Although Advanced Medical said in May that it was interested in acquiring Bausch, the offer came as a surprise to some analysts because Advanced Medical had subsequently been forced to undertake an expensive recall of Complete MoisturePlus, its contact lens solution.The recall came after an unusual number of MoisturePlus users came down with eye infections. Regulators and the company are still investigating the outbreak and Complete MoisturePlus’s apparent links to it.Last week, Advanced Medical told analysts that it forecast a loss as high as $1.15 a share on sales of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion this year because of the recall; previous forecasts called for earnings up to $1.55 a share on sales as high as $1.18 billion.Mark Mullikan, who follows eye care devices and drugs for Piper Jaffray, commented: “I’m not surprised by the $75-a-share price tag, but I thought that the recall would end any sort of bid by A.M.O. They have their hands full.”Acquiring Bausch would help Advanced enter the market for contact lenses and give it a better-known lens care solutions brand to go with its surgical implants and laser equipment. But Bausch’s name in lens care has been tarnished by its own recall last year of ReNu With MoistureLoc, which was linked to an outbreak of fungal infections.The provision that allowed Bausch to solicit Advanced Medical’s bid is known as a go-shop provision. Go-shop provisions, aimed at ensuring that companies receive the highest possible price in a sale, have become increasingly popular, but have rarely led to higher offers.In a recent example, Triad Hospitals abandoned a takeover offer in March from two private equity firms in favor of a $5.1 billion bid from a rival, Community Health Systems.In Bausch’s case, Advanced Medical may have been encouraged by the relatively low breakup fee in the Warburg deal. If Bausch ends up with another buyer, it must pay Warburg $40 million, or about 1 percent of the transaction price. Such fees can run to 3 percent or higher.Advanced Medical’s proposal would give it a year to complete the deal but would require it to begin paying interest at a 7.2 percent annual rate on the bid if it did not close within six months of acceptance.Advanced Medical would pay Bausch a fee of $130 million if its financing fell through or the deal was refused antitrust clearance, and up to $35 million in expenses if Advanced Medical’s shareholders voted it down. Advanced Medical could receive the same fee and expenses if Bausch accepted the deal but then backed out.'"
"'07-07-06,'1','LOS ANGELES, July 5 — In what may be one of the costliest consumer warranty repairs in history, Microsoft announced on Thursday that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 game machine consoles.While the company would not say how many units were failing, Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, said that there have been an “unacceptable high number of repairs.” The majority of Xbox 360 owners, he said, have not experienced hardware failure.Company officials said that Microsoft had sold 11.6 million Xbox 360 units by the end of June, shy of the 12 million units the company had predicted. The Xbox 360, which first went of sale in November 2005, is currently the best-selling game machine in the United States, according to NPD, a market research firm.The size of the anticipated repair bill suggests that a third to as many as half of the machines are flawed.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said it would take a charge of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion against earnings in the quarter ended June 30. Consumers know they have a problem if three red flashing lights appear on the console. Gamers on online forums have been referring to the event as “the Red Ring of Death” because the machine then shuts down.'"
"'07-07-06,'1','But Och-Ziff is no Pets.com. The latest hedge fund to go public is one of a breed of large, institutional firms that seem to be more focused on gathering assets and delivering stable but unremarkable returns with low volatility — fewer dramatic moves one way or another — than swinging from the chandeliers like George Soros taking on the Bank of England. This strategy seems to make sense, especially considering that the hedge fund party seems set to continue. JPMorgan estimates that defined-benefit plans will move 30 to 50 percent of their assets from traditional stock portfolios to alternatives, including hedge funds.Still, some may be nostalgic for the way things used to be. The early adopters of hedge funds were rich people who liked big returns, and they often received them. But times changed. The rich people sat on the boards of their universities and suddenly endowments jumped on the hedge fund bandwagon. They did well. Then, after the market meltdown of 2000, hedge funds posted positive returns and pension funds started to flock in.But pension funds don’t want chandelier swinging. They want good returns. Their managers do not want to lose their jobs for investing in hedge funds. So a lot of funds repositioned themselves to attract that money.In a June note entitled “Hedge Fund Management at a Tipping Point?”, Byron R. Wein, chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital Management, wrote: “Hedge funds are today’s asset gatherers. To gather assets, hedge funds have come to believe that they need to reduce volatility, and a number of hedge funds have given up performance to achieve it.”Och-Ziff’s recent returns would hardly amaze you. But its assets have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 42 percent, more than double the recent rate for the industry. Investors in the funds like the solid, steady returns (17 percent annualized since inception compared with 11.6 percent for the S. & P. 500), they love the low volatility (almost one-third the market’s) and they are comforted by the fact that Och-Ziff often makes money when the market tanks.But by becoming a public company, Och-Ziff and others that follow the same route are agreeing to try to maximize returns to those who buy the stock. That means gathering more assets. More assets mean more management fees — which Wall Street likes, because they are predictable — and less risk, which potentially means lower returns, which more aggressive investors don’t like. It is unclear whether Och-Ziff can manage $50 billion as well as it manages $27 billion, but it’s clear that they have satisfied their investors as they have grown from almost $6 billion in 2003.Which brings us back to the bubble. Bubbles occur when assets are bought and sold for more than they are worth. With hedge funds going public, we can see how they make money and then guess if they can make more every year. They will do this by attracting a lot more money and ideally, by investing that money well.But unlike Internet companies seeking eyeballs to justify lofty valuations, hedge funds make money. A lot of money. They charge huge fees, make big profits and take huge payouts. And as public companies, they may or may not meet the future expectations of the market.The real question should be how they manage their investments in areas that may themselves be bubbles — like the credit market, which still does not properly reflect risk. Then there’s the mortgage-backed securities market, which has been fueled by a dangerous lowering of loan standards and the practice of packaging high risk, calling it low risk and dumping it on the market. And there’s the private equity boom, fueled by the issuance of gigantic amounts of debt, much of which has been gobbled up by hedge funds. Investors are hoping they haven’t swallowed a bubble.'"
"'07-07-06,'1','While there have been promises of reform before, some riders expressed hope that the overwhelmingly negative atmosphere around their sport would begin to dissipate.“Last year, the atmosphere was so difficult for us, and still things did not change,” Christophe Moreau, the top French rider and the recent winner of the Dauphiné Libéré, a major tuneup for the Tour de France, said at a prerace news conference.“This year, things are changing,” Moreau said. “They need to change, for the sake of the teams, the sponsors and the Tour organization. We need to get the credibility of cycling back.”That will not be easy. This week, the world’s leading sprinter, Alessandro Petacchi, who was expected to be a top contender for several stage victories in the race’s first week, was withdrawn from the race by his Italian team, Milram.The withdrawal came after the Italian Olympic Committee recommended a one-year ban for Petacchi because a drug test in May, during the Giro d’Italia, showed he had in his system too much of an asthma medication that he had a doctor’s permission to use.As a sprinter, Petacchi was not expected to compete for the overall victory in the race, which covers 2,218 miles over 21 days of racing, moving from Britain to Belgium and then in a clockwise tour around France to the finish in Paris.But the race is to be considered a wide-open affair, with any one of nearly a dozen riders viewed as a possible winner. If anyone is considered the favorite, it is Alexander Vinokourov, a 33-year old Kazakh who rides for Astana. The team, named after the Kazakh capital, was put together by Vinokourov after he was unable to start last year’s race when several teammates on the Liberty Seguros team were barred for their involvement in the Operation Puerto doping scandal in Spain.Vinokourov can be frighteningly aggressive, with slashing attacks that often go against the conventional wisdom of how to ride a race. But he, too, has faced doping suspicions after acknowledging last week that he had worked with Dr. Michele Ferrari, an Italian doctor who was found guilty of sporting fraud and malpractice in 2004 but who won an appeal two years later. Vinokourov said he consulted Ferrari for training purposes but not for medical advice.Vinokourov’s top competitor could be on his own team: Andreas Klöden, 32, of Germany. Klöden finished third last year, behind Landis and Óscar Pereiro, and he won the Flèche Wallonne one-day race this year. While the team denied there was any friction between Klöden and Vinokourov, they have a history. In the 2005 Tour, Klöden and Ullrich, both riding for T-Mobile, chased down a breakaway that was being led by their teammate Vinokourov.Three Spaniards are also likely to battle for the yellow jersey: Alejandro Valverde and Pereiro of Caisse d’Epargne, and Carlos Sastre of CSC. Valverde is the team leader, but Pereiro, who finished behind Landis, will be ready if Valverde drops out, as he did last year. Sastre, always a threat in the mountains, will be dangerous if he can limit his losses in the two long, flat time trials in the second half of the race.The top American in the field is Levi Leipheimer, who has finished in the top 10 three times with other teams but who this year will have a stronger support group around him in the Discovery Channel team.Cadel Evans, an Australian rider for Predictor-Lotto, who is also expected to compete for the overall victory, agreed with Leipheimer’s assessment that the mountains would be the key to victory, particularly those in the second half of the race, when the Tour spends three tough days in the Pyrenees.That this is a year of transition for the Tour de France is evident in the official race guide, which lists no winner for last year’s Tour. That is the first time that has happened. Landis, who finished first, is expected to hear this week or next from an arbitration panel over his positive drug test during last year’s Tour. The test found the presence of artificial testosterone in his system.The guide also lists no winner for the 1996 Tour. Bjarne Riis, who finished first that year, acknowledged recently that he had used performance-enhancing drugs while racing, prompting Tour officials to void his victory and tell him that he was not welcome to attend the race as manager of the CSC team. Riis said he would stay home, but he cast it as a personal decision and not the result of pressure.Most of the riders know that whatever happens over the next three weeks of racing will be suspect, in some respects.“For sure, people are going to watch this year’s Tour and wonder if the riders are clean,” said Bradley Wiggins, a British rider for the Confidis team who is a favorite to win the five-mile opening prologue.Wiggins, 27, said he believed a new, clean generation of riders would make their mark on this year’s Tour.“As a rider in the Tour, this is perhaps the most promising time,” Wiggins said, “because the events of the last year have sparked such warning signs in the sport that something had to be done about it, and those things are being done.”'"
"'07-07-06,'1','Shares of Quest Diagnostics Inc., the biggest United States medical testing company, jumped more than 10 percent and its options volume turned busy yesterday afternoon amid renewed speculation that it is a takeover target.“The options in Quest Diagnostics are trading very actively on the call side as investors speculate that this company will be the next to be acquired,” said William Lefkowitz, an options strategist at the brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York.A Quest spokesman said it was company policy not to comment on rumors or speculation about the company or market activity.Acquisition activity among health care service companies, particularly by private-equity groups, has been healthy for the past year. Earlier this week, Manor Care, a nursing home company, agreed to be purchased for about $4.9 billion, excluding debt, by the Carlyle Group.Speculation that Quest would be the target of a leveraged buyout is not new and surfaced earlier this year.In the United States options market, Quest Diagnostics was one stock that had “unsubstantiated takeover rumors” along with near-term call buyers, the market intelligence team of the Susquehanna Financial Group said in a research note.'"
"'07-07-06,'1','Investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have rapidly expanded their carbon businesses. Scattered among the hedge funds and private equity funds in the Mayfair district of London are recently arrived niche investment banks that generate one of the main currencies of this emerging sector: carbon emissions reductions.The emergence of carbon finance in London — not only trading carbon allowances but investments in projects that help generate additional credits — is largely the result of a decision by European governments to start limiting the amounts that industries emit.Factories that pollute too much are required to buy more allowances; those that become more efficient can sell allowances they no longer need. The system, started in 2005, is part of the terms of the Kyoto Protocol and bears the imprimatur of the United Nations. Even so, doubts remain as to whether carbon finance can deliver tangible emissions reductions, let alone the vast economic transformation needed to deal with climate change.For now, green-minded graduates and an eclectic range of professionals from banks, consulting companies and aid organizations are pushing to join the new sector.“We don’t have to advertise,” said Mark Woodall, 45, chief executive of Climate Change Capital, an investment company based in an elegant 18th-century townhouse in the heart of Mayfair. ”People feel quite good about working in an organization like this.”Mr. Woodall has 120 employees with an average age around 30 and more than 10 full-time employees in China. He expects to hire 80 people in the next two years.A former British Army officer, he started his first company 15 years ago, cleaning up waste and chemical spills.The industry has not avoided criticism. One reason is that European governments handed out too many free allowances in preparing for the start of the program, rendering the system less effective than was hoped. The overallocation fueled volatility, and some traders reaped larger-than-expected profits.Controversy has also dogged some projects promoted by the financiers to generate new credits.But over all, prospects for the industry are good, especially if the United States joins the Europeans in establishing a trading system, said Imtiaz Ahmad, 34, senior carbon trader for Morgan Stanley in London. Mr. Ahmad has already lured a European Union environment official and a BP employee to join his three-member trading team, and he plans to hire more.Human activity creates some 38 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year, and governments regulate only a fraction of that. But if more governments decide to cut billions more tons of emissions, as leaders of top industrial nations discussed recently in Germany, and if the existing system in Europe is enlarged to cover transportation, there will be many more credits available — and a lot more finance and trading.Early in the decade, Wall Street firms like Cantor Fitzgerald, which calls its environmental subsidiary CantorCO2e, were successfully using markets to reduce industrial pollutants that caused acid rain in North America, and had begun investing in credit-generating projects. But New York lost its lead in carbon finance after President Bush refused to submit the Kyoto Protocol for ratification in 2001.“Technically, U.S. companies had the expertise,” said Garth Edward, 37, trading manager for environmental products in London at Shell Trading, a unit of the oil company, who formerly worked in New York for Natsource, one of the first greenhouse gas brokerage firms. “Then the Europeans really delivered.”Mr. Edward, a Scot who studied Chinese at Oxford and worked in Kenya for the United Nations Environment Program, was among those who headed for London, where interest in carbon finance was developing after the introduction of a voluntary market by the British government in 2002.His team of five traders sits next to power and natural gas teams, buys and sells carbon for Shell and devises investment projects that generate additional credits. Across town at Barclays Capital, Mr. Redshaw’s team of three helps power companies and investors manage the costs of emissions from coal or natural gas plants now and in the future, when the cost of emitting could rise sharply.Lionel Fretz, chief executive of Carbon Capital Markets, a trading and finance company also in Mayfair, is among those who are fiercely critical of projects to clean up refrigerants in China that generated hundreds of thousands of credits and large profits for investment companies like Climate Change Capital.Mr. Fretz said those projects had done too little to alter other substandard environmental and labor practices and promote renewable energy.“The moral issue is that we shouldn’t be providing a subsidy to a plant that operates at lower standards than our own,” he said.He has concentrated his funds, worth 150 million euros, or $204 million, on projects to capture and burn methane, another greenhouse gas, that is emitted at landfills in countries like the Philippines. Those projects are a new source of electricity. They also produce some carbon dioxide, but in quantities far less harmful than the methane, earning carbon credits.Even though Mr. Fretz’s projects are far more modest than some of those at Climate Change Capital, a company he helped found before he sold his stake in 2004, he also has no shortage of qualified applicants for jobs.“We’re getting fantastic people,” said Mr. Fretz, who was a financial adviser on road and pipeline projects for PricewaterhouseCoopers before taking a year off in the late 1990s to sail and rethink his career. “Maybe it’s a generational thing, but there seem to be plenty of people from world-class companies who want to do something more meaningful with their lives.”'"

Under the latest redrafting, the plan would go into effect 120 days after passage of the measure.But Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador here, said last month that any plan that resulted in independence for Kosovo was unacceptable. Mr. Churkin has strongly hinted that if the resolution is put to a vote, Russia will veto it.Kosovo has been administered by the United Nations since a NATO bombing campaign drove out Serbian forces, which had been conducting a brutal crackdown on the overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population.'"

His previous best Tour finish, third in 2003, came largely because of his unpredictable style of attacking. This year, however, everyone will be watching him.Alejandro Valverde, 27, Spaniard, Caisse d’Epargne — A strong climber, he has crashed out of the last two Tours. A stomach virus forced him out in a big tuneup race last month. A weak June rarely results in a strong July.Carlos Sastre, 32, Spaniard, CSC — Biggest weakness is his performances in time trials. Last year, he fell from third to fourth over all on the next-to-last day after finishing far behind in the final time trial.Levi Leipheimer, 33, American, Discovery Channel — Improved time-trial ability helped him lead this year’s Tour of California from start to finish. Will benefit from a strong team around him, something he has not had in previous Tours.Denis Menchov, 29, Russian, Rabobank — Thought to lack the aggressiveness needed to win the Tour. Could be hampered by his team’s pursuit of other goals, including gaining the best climber’s jersey for Michael Rasmussen.Cadel Evans, 30, Australian, Predictor-Lotto — Tenacious former mountain biker who finished fifth in last year’s Tour.

"'07-07-06,'1','WASHINGTON, July 5 — When it comes to health care, the personal is political.Presidential candidates may struggle to connect with voters on issues like job losses from a globalized economy or the daily anxiety of having a loved one in Iraq. But to a remarkable degree, almost every candidate in this race can speak from experience with the health care system, having endured his or her own health problems or those of close family members. And as they talk to voters about health care, they often allude to their own stories.Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, talks about sitting at the bedside of his mother, as she lay dying from ovarian cancer at the age of 53, “and she was spending time worrying about whether or not she would have anything left over, if she was able to survive the illness.”She died within six months, exhausting all her resources by the end, he said. Mr. Obama says he had to “spend a lot of time arguing with the insurer about when she had been diagnosed with this ovarian cancer, because they started making arguments that she had a pre-existing condition.”Former Senator John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat and a trial lawyer, describes his struggles with insurance companies after breast cancer was first diagnosed in his wife, Elizabeth, in 2004.“Here you have a former senator, presidential candidate, vice-presidential candidate, and I’m a lawyer. I’d get those statements from the insurance companies, I had no idea what they meant,” Mr. Edwards said in Iowa recently. “I felt like a blooming idiot.”'"

"'07-07-07,'0','PITTSBURGH, July 6 (AP) — Kevin McClatchy not only preserved baseball in Pittsburgh as the Pirates’ owner, but he also accomplished what was once seen as the impossible by getting a new stadium, PNC Park, built.McClatchy later persuaded Commissioner Bud Selig to bring the All-Star game back to town only 12 years after it had last been played there. He helped oversee one of the city’s largest urban development projects in decades, the growth that has occurred around PNC Park and the Steelers’ Heinz Field.Only one thing went wrong: the Pirates never won under McClatchy.McClatchy, a newspaper heir widely credited with preventing the Pirates from leaving Pittsburgh by assembling an ownership group in 1996 when no one else would, announced yesterday that he was stepping down as the team’s chief executive officer at the end of the season.The Pirates are on pace for a 15th consecutive losing season, one short of the major league record. If they do not have a winning record this season, it will be their 12th consecutive losing record under McClatchy. “I take responsibility for the losing, that’s probably in some ways reason for a change,” McClatchy told The Associated Press. “It’s good to turn the page, have a fresh perspective.”The 44-year-old McClatchy lost a majority ownership stake in the club to the West Virginia newspaper owner G. Ogden Nutting several years ago, and in January he was supplanted by Nutting’s son, Bob, as principal owner.

"'07-07-07,'0','Mr. Thompson’s link to the group was first reported Friday by the Web site of The Los Angeles Times.Any damage to Mr. Thompson’s credentials on the abortion issue could complicate his efforts to present himself as a faithful conservative. Mr. Thompson has sometimes indicated he supported some abortion rights although conservative groups say he voted with them whenever abortion questions came before the Senate.Mr. Thompson’s record on the issue of abortion rights is being subjected to particular scrutiny because many social conservatives have been looking for alternatives to the current field of Republican presidential candidates. None of the leading candidates have aroused much enthusiasm among the religious traditionalists in the Republican base: Rudolph W. Giuliani supports abortion rights; Senator John McCain supports embryonic stem cell research and sometimes clashes with religious conservatives; and Mitt Romney has only recently adopted a position in opposition to abortion rights.Spokesmen for Mr. Thompson have pointed to the fact that he voted in favor of every abortion restriction bill that came before him in the Senate. That included a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth abortion as well as a ban on government-financed abortion for defense department personnel. Mr. Thompson has said he opposed as an infringement on states’ rights the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion.But Mr. Thompson has also sometimes indicated that he opposes outlawing abortion. Among other things, he has opposed a constitutional amendment banning all abortion — something the Republican platform calls for — again on the grounds that the issue should be up to the states.In a questionnaire that he answered during his successful 1994 Senate campaign in Tennessee, Mr. Thompson or his campaign staff checked a box stating that he believed abortion should be legal under any circumstance during the first three months of a pregnancy. In a televised debate the same year, Mr. Thompson appeared to tell the moderator that he personally disagreed with outlawing abortion. “Should the government come in and criminalize let’s say a young girl and her parents and her doctor?” Mr. Thompson said. “I think not.”In addition, the Gannett News Service has reported that another questionnaire submitted during Mr. Thompson’s 1994 campaign contained a handwritten note that stated: “I do not believe abortion should be criminalized. This battle will be won in the hearts and souls of the American people.”Former Representative Michael Barnes, Democrat of Maryland, said he recommended Mr. Thompson to Ms. DeSarno, who worked for Mr. Barnes when he was in Congress.At the time, Mr. Thompson and Mr. Barnes worked together at Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin & Kahn. Ms. DeSarno said Mr. Thompson gave her regular updates by phone and that she met him on at least two occasions in person. Over dinner at the Washington restaurant Galileo one night, she said Mr. Thompson told her he had spoken with John Sununu, then the White House chief of staff, about the matter.“Fred had a big smile and he said, how about if only the doctors can talk but not all these other nurses and volunteers,” Ms. DeSarno recalled, referring to a potential compromise on the ban. “It wasn’t formal. It was, ‘How about this?’ ”Ellen Battistelli, who worked with Ms. DeSarno on getting the ban lifted, said: “He was certainly willing to contact the administration about this.” Mr. Sununu did not respond to messages left for him on Friday.'"

As Lebanon falls increasingly into a state of political paralysis, the risk of militants setting up base here is raising alarms, especially among European intelligence officials.One year ago, this country found itself in the middle of a war between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah after Hezbollah fighters crossed the border and seized two Israeli soldiers. Although the war’s catastrophic damage drew Lebanese together, they quickly turned on one another politically. Killings, bombings and political protests have become routine.Political forces find themselves stalemated, with no one firmly in charge. Neighborhoods of rubble from last year’s war remain uncleared, and politicians on each side accuse those on the other of blocking reconstruction to prevent them from getting credit.Parliament has to select a new president in September, but with the governing coalition and the opposition hostile to each other, that could set off an unraveling of what remains of the system of governance.“If you are in a hole, at least stop digging,” said Ali Hamdan, foreign affairs adviser to Nabih Berri, speaker of Parliament, leader of the Shiite Amal movement and a close ally of Hezbollah. “Unfortunately, the Lebanese keep digging.”While Lebanon’s troubles are not principally about Islamic militancy, some fear it could become the kind of place that attracts more of it, especially from the Iraq war.General Rifi, the internal security chief, estimates that 50 to 60 fighters are still in the camp and they include skilled and determined militants from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen and Algeria who fought with the insurgency in Iraq.The group’s leader, Shakir al-Abssi, was an associate of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia killed last summer. He has been sentenced to death in Jordan for helping Mr. Zarqawi organize the 2002 slaying of an American diplomat in Amman, Jordan.“One reason we attacked Abssi was to get a message to those people that you don’t have to come to Lebanon after your mission in Iraq,” General Rifi said.But Mr. Abssi has been drawing support from Europe as well, according to a Western European intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity. There is some evidence that Islamic militants in Western European countries traveled to Lebanon and joined Mr. Abssi’s group, the official said, citing recent reports from intelligence agencies of countries other than Lebanon.Meanwhile, Lebanon has been hit with a rash of car bombings and other violence since the fighting with Fatah al Islam began, including a car bomb in the south that killed six United Nations peacekeepers.Today, the Lebanese are increasingly divided by rolls of razor wire spread across roads and wrapped around buildings and homes. They are separated by military checkpoints that tie up traffic. Nearly a dozen members of Parliament have left the country, fearful they will be killed. Some United Nations officials have moved from their heavily guarded offices in the center of Beirut to smaller, less obvious space deep behind a sea of razor wire.Given Lebanon’s fractured politics — and the backing of Hezbollah by both Iran and Syria and of the government by Western powers — it is too soon to know who has been behind the many incidents. General Rifi said the F.B.I. director, Robert Mueller, paid him a surprise visit last week and offered forensic assistance in analyzing the bombings.But Lebanese officials say they have had shootouts with several clusters of foreign Islamic militants, some of whom had clear ties with Mr. Abssi’s group. On June 7 a car-bomb factory was discovered in the Bekaa Valley in which two Mercedeses and a Jeep were being prepared for explosives. The operation was run by a Saudi and two Syrians who had fought in Iraq and their technique had some sophistication, including the use of fiberglass shields in a possible attempt to hide the explosives from detection devices, two Lebanese Army officials said.“We have no sleeper cells in Lebanon,” said a Lebanese Army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They are all waking up.”If there is one unifying element to the national psyche, it seems to be that the leadership — both of the government and of the opposition — has failed by paralyzing the country and failing to find a governing consensus.Hezbollah came out of the war against Israel highly popular. But today its leaders are accused by some of focusing too much on domestic politics and failing to achieve their stated goals, which has prompted unusually heated debate within Hezbollah over its direction.“They were not expecting the results of instigating against the government to be transformed into sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shiites in the street, which was about to become an even bigger problem,” said Talal Atrissi, a political sociology professor at Lebanese University and an expert on Hezbollah. “The other party was able to use the sectarian tension to face Hezbollah and to transform the battle to its benefit.”Omar Nasra, 26, a barber in the southern Beirut suburbs, the Hezbollah stronghold, carefully pulled a razor across a customer’s beard as he expressed his own frustration with the government and the opposition, saying, “We wish all these politicians would be replaced by people who can sit together on the same table, talk, and agree on how to govern this country.”On the street, there remains great admiration for Hezbollah’s social and military effort, but dissatisfaction with its political management.Central Beirut remains paralyzed since the Hezbollah-led opposition — which includes the Shiite party Amal and the followers of the Christian general Michel Aoun — began a sit-in on Dec. 1. The goal was to force the government to resign. But the government has hunkered down, the prime minister and others living in their office on a hill overlooking hundreds of pitched tents.The majority coalition, known as March 14, has not become more powerful but has found itself less on the defensive and has defiantly projected an image of still functioning.But its detractors say the coalition has hamstrung the country and has not dealt in good faith with the opposition.“We are trying to lead the country to unity and they don’t want unity,” said a Hezbollah representative at the tent city, who identified himself as Shumran.Opposition leaders are pessimistic about a deal being reached that could end the political impasse. “If we don’t form a national unity government from now until September, I think we are heading to chaos,” said Trad Hamadeh, who stepped down as labor minister last fall and is associated with Hezbollah. “The Constitution will no longer be implemented. There will be no cabinet able to control and run the country. This means the country will be in a state of no laws, the loss of the system.”That is just the kind of state in which militant groups could thrive.Fatah al Islam, which Mr. Abssi formed late last year, has already been getting vocal support from groups with more established ties to Al Qaeda. On May 25, a group calling itself Al Qaeda in Bilad al Sham posted a video titled “Return of the Crusader War,” on the Islamic militant Web site al Hesbah.“We will tear out your hearts with traps and surround your places with explosive canisters, and target all your businesses, beginning with tourism and ending with other rotten industries,” a leader of the group says in the video. “We warn you for the last time, and after it there will only be rivers of blood.”The stalemated politics have posed a huge obstacle to reining in the violence. The Arab League came to Lebanon to try to work out the mechanics of the political struggle, and failed, prompting the secretary general, Amr Moussa, to say that Lebanon was running out of time.The opposition has threatened to form a parallel government, a move that Moody’s Investors Service said would be like turning it into a country in bankruptcy.More ominous is the fear that the one institution that has so far held firm in the face of political turmoil, the army, may not be able to withstand a split government and might fracture along sectarian lines. All the army factions, including Sunni Muslims, have fought the extremists.The problem in the north is not just that there is suddenly a group of Qaeda-minded extremists looking to pursue a political agenda through violence, but that the conflict has also disturbed a delicate balance between Lebanon and the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have lived for generations in squalid refugee camps.In a sign of how sour the environment has become, many Lebanese say the only good news lately has been that the army fought against the extremists in the Nahr al Bared refugee camp. The optimism stems in part from the notion that Sunnis in the army have agreed to fight and kill Sunni extremists in the camp.But the destruction has created a humanitarian crisis, with thousands of residents of the camp fleeing. Most now live in the Beddawi refugee camp a few miles away. They are crowded into classrooms, often as many as seven families sharing a space divided by blue tarps hanging from ropes strung between the walls.So even before Lebanon has figured out how to rebuild and provide homes for the thousands displaced last summer, it has thousands more now without homes in the north.'"

Alcoa said it would comply with the request from the Department of Justice “as soon as possible,” without saying what details it would provide. Alcoa reiterated that it intended to complete the takeover this year. The offer expires Tuesday and can be extended. Alcan has urged shareholders to reject Alcoa’s bid, saying it is too low. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)BANK FACES TRIAL IN ITALY A judge in Milan has ordered Bank of America to stand trial on market-rigging charges arising from the multibillion-dollar collapse of the food conglomerate Parmalat in 2003. The judge, Cesare Tacconi, indicted the bank and scheduled the trial to start Jan. 23. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., said the charges were not criminal but “purely administrative in nature” and “completely unfounded.” In June, four other banks — Citigroup, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley — were ordered to face trial in Milan on charges that they failed to take steps that might have prevented Parmalat’s failure. In market rigging, false information is given to the market to influence prices. (AP)GENZYME DRUG IS DELAYED The Genzyme Corporation’s experimental medicine for a type of diarrhea proved less effective than an antibiotic, the second setback this week in the company’s effort to develop drugs. The study results mean the drug tolevamer, for severe diarrhea in hospital patients, will not reach the market by 2009 as predicted, said Maria Cantor, a spokeswoman for the company, based in Cambridge, Mass. Genzyme had earlier said it might end development of an arthritis treatment, hylastan, after the product failed to prove better than steroids. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)CANADIAN PAPERS GET HIGHER BID Quebecor, Canada’s leading tabloid publisher, increased its bid for a chain of small newspapers in Ontario once largely controlled by Conrad M. Black to 414 million Canadian dollars ($391 million). Its bid topped a rival bid of 405 million Canadian dollars from Black Press, a publisher that is not connected to Mr. Black, the former chairman of Hollinger. Quebecor’s new offer was endorsed by the board of the Ontario chain, the Osprey Media Income Fund. Quebecor first reached a deal to acquire Osprey on May 31. But Black Press, which is partly owned by Torstar, publisher of The Toronto Star, countered with a higher bid last month. IAN AUSTENMICROSOFT TO EXPAND IN CANADA Microsoft said it would open a software development center near Vancouver, British Columbia, expanding in Canada to attract foreign engineers who face immigration issues in the United States. The center will open later this year, the company, based in Redmond, Wash., said in a statement. Microsoft is also adding offices in Boston and in Washington State. Microsoft and rivals like Google have lobbied the United States government to add more visas for skilled workers, saying American schools are not producing enough qualified applicants. The Senate’s failure to move forward with immigration legislation last month blocked a measure that would have almost doubled temporary visas for skilled workers.'"
"'07-07-07,'0','That statement might have been an implicit criticism of the decision under review, issued last year by Judge Anna Diggs Taylor of Federal District Court in Detroit. Judge Taylor’s ruling, which was stayed during the appeal, had attracted criticism from across the political spectrum. Legal experts said it overlooked important precedents, failed to engage some of the government’s arguments and relied on novel constitutional arguments where more straightforward ones were available.A number of other challenges to the program have been consolidated before a federal judge in San Francisco, and the federal appeals court there, the Ninth Circuit, will hear an appeal from one of the judge’s preliminary rulings next month.Some of the plaintiffs in that case contend that they have been personally injured by the program, which if proved could give them standing to sue, even under yesterday’s ruling. Those plaintiffs, an Islamic charity and two of its lawyers, say they have seen a classified document confirming that their communications were actually intercepted.A second Sixth Circuit judge, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons, concurred in the judgment dismissing the case yesterday but did not join in Judge Batchelder’s extensive and technical discussion of whether the plaintiffs had standing to sue. Judge Gibbons agreed, however, that the case turned “upon the single fact that the plaintiffs have failed to provide evidence that they are personally subject to the program.”She added that “the plaintiffs are ultimately prevented from establishing standing because of the state secrets privilege,” a legal doctrine that requires courts to limit or dismiss cases when allowing them to proceed would disclose information harmful to national security. Judge Batchelder did not discuss the privilege.In his dissent yesterday, Judge Ronald Lee Gilman wrote that the issue of the plaintiffs’ standing presented “the closest question in this case.” But he wrote that at least the plaintiffs who were lawyers did have standing.Those lawyers said they had had to change the way they communicated with clients in the Middle East because they feared that their discussions would not be confidential.“To my mind,” Judge Gilman wrote, “the attorney-plaintiffs have articulated an actual or imminent harm” because the program “puts them in the position of abrogating their duties under applicable professional-responsibility rules if they communicate with clients and contacts via telephone and e-mail.”Standing, Judge Gilman wrote, is the hard part. “Once past that hurdle,” he said, “the rest gets progressively easier.”Judge Gilman also put some distance between his views and those of Judge Taylor. “Without expressing an opinion concerning the analysis of the district court,” he wrote, “I would affirm its judgment.”In January, not long before the appeal was argued, the White House announced that it would submit the N.S.A. program for supervision by a secret court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Judge Gilman, the only judge to address the significance of that move, discounted it. He said that the administration had reserved the right to resume surveillance without warrants and that the appeal was therefore not moot.Judge Batchelder was appointed by the first President George Bush, Judge Gibbons by President George W. Bush and Judge Gilman by President Bill Clinton. Judge Taylor, the district court judge, was appointed by President Jimmy Carter.Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, expressed satisfaction with the decision.“We have always believed that the district court’s decision declaring the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional was wrongly decided,” Mr. Fratto said in a statement. “The court of appeals properly determined that the plaintiffs had failed to show their claims were entitled to review in federal court.”The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union.“We are deeply disappointed,” the group’s legal director, Steven R. Shapiro, said in a statement, “by today’s decision that insulates the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance activities from judicial review and deprives Americans of any ability to challenge the illegal surveillance of their telephone calls and e-mails.”Mr. Shapiro said the A.C.L.U. was weighing its options, including the possibility of appealing to the Supreme Court.Legal experts said the standing question was a substantial and difficult one.“It’s probably right,” Orin S. Kerr, a law professor at George Washington University, said of the appeals court’s decision. “The day this lawsuit was filed most people would have predicted this result.”Cass R. Sunstein, a law professor at the University of Chicago, said courts often relied on doctrines like standing “to avoid entering into politically hot controversies.”“This, for at least two of the judges, was a very sensitive, substantive issue,” Professor Sunstein added, referring to the legality of the N.S.A. program, “which, once they get into it, is an uphill fight for the government.”'"
"'07-07-07,'0','Though a handful of other towns have been auctioned on eBay since Bridgeville made history, locals are sour on the approach. It is a funny thing, they say, for a town, even a small one, to be bought like bric-a-brac or collectible comics through the impulsive rush of online bidding.Bridgeville has had bad luck with its winning bidders, and vice versa. Its first buyer, Bruce Krall, a banker from Orange County, Calif., who bought Bridgeville for $700,000 in 2002 (after the original eBay high bidder backed out), generated unwanted publicity when he decided it would cost too much to fix up the town and relisted it on eBay last year.Daniel La Paille, a 25-year-old entertainment manager from Los Angeles, picked up Bridgeville for $1.25 million last August. He had plans for a hotel, parks and houses. But a few months later, in November, he committed suicide, leaving Bridgeville in limbo.Residents speculate that the burden of resurrecting the fading town had proved too much. “He never complained,” said Daniel Morris, a tree-cutter who lives in one of four small houses in the two-street town. “But I could see the stress in his face, in his eyes.”Mr. La Paille’s relatives disagree. “His death was personal,” said Claudia Zellner, his grandmother. She had driven to Bridgeville from Palm Springs, 14 hours away to the south, to spend the July 4 week here to work on four abandoned cabins, each about the size of a large storage shed.“This is all family-done,” Ms. Zellner said, waving her hands around a gutted cabin. “We haven’t had any paid labor on these cabins. It’s all been what we could do, a little at a time.”After Mr. La Paille’s death, the family thought it would keep Bridgeville. “But it’s too hard,” Ms. Zellner said. She walked the two streets of town proudly. “This cafe used to be quite the spot,” she said. “And have you seen the view from the historic bridge?”Another grandson, Adam Wade, 24, loved Bridgeville so much that he and his wife moved here from Ontario, Calif., in October. “We came to help out,” he said, “but now we want to stay.”Mr. Wade was putting in wiring in one of the cabins, having learned how to do so from a manual.The family had a broker announce the town’s sale a few weeks ago. The asking price is $1.3 million.Of course, Bridgeville is a town in name and ZIP code only. It has about a dozen buildings, half of them vacant. There is an elementary school with about 55 students, who also come from the neighboring hamlets, and a post office and cemetery. During the Gold Rush, the town was an important stop on the wagon trail connecting San Francisco to Eureka. Now San Francisco, about 270 miles south, seems like another country, and the nearest city, Fortuna, is 45 minutes away, on a twisty two-lane road.People who choose to live here do so because they want to be away from it all.“My family likes the country,” said Spirit Herzog-Bottom, 14. Her family lives in a hot-pink house with three wolf-hybrids. Except for her 21-year-old brother’s girlfriend, who is 18, there are no other girls her age or near it in Bridgeville.Fun in the summer is a day at one of the swimming holes in the Van Duzen River, or watching the boys in town — there are 10 boys in two families — riding dirt bikes behind their houses.“I could settle here,” said Daniel Morris, who, after years away, moved back to Bridgeville last year so his five sons, ages 6 through 15, would stay out of trouble.All he hopes now, Mr. Morris said, is that a new Bridgeville owner does not evict them back into the real world.'"
"'07-07-07,'0','TAKEOVER OFFER Virgin Media, the British cable company, received a takeover proposal, though it did not identify who made the offer. People familiar with the situation said that the Carlyle Group, a private equity investor, was preparing a bid of $20 billion, including debt.Virgin Media, whose largest investor is Richard Branson, said the proposal “is based on public information and is subject to various conditions, including a due diligence examination and a period of exclusivity.”Another private equity group, Providence Equity Partners, was also considering a bid, according to people with knowledge of the situation.A takeover of Virgin Media would be the biggest acquisition of a cable company in Europe and the second biggest of any British company after the $22 billion deal last month by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts to take over the drugstore chain Alliance Boots.Providence, Kohlberg Kravis, the Blackstone Group and Cinven withdrew last year from plans to make an offer for Virgin Media in the face of opposition from shareholders because of price and because the company had just made two large acquisitions of its own.Analysts have identified Kohlberg Kravis, Blackstone and Cinven as possible competing bidders this time around as well.HOTEL DEAL The Blackstone Group announced it would buy Hilton Hotels in a deal worth $26 billion, including the assumption of $7.5 billion in debt.At $47.50 a share, the all-cash deal represents a premium of 40 percent over Hilton’s closing price on Monday, the day before the acquisition plan was announced.Besides its namesake hotel brand, Hilton owns the Waldorf-Astoria, Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Embassy Suites.The deal is Blackstone’s largest since it acquired Equity Office Properties in February for $38.9 billion.Over the last three years, Blackstone has invested about $15 billion in hotel companies, among them La Quinta Inns and Suites and a group of luxury hotels including the Boca Raton Resort and Club in Florida.Blackstone said it planned to invest in Hilton, integrating the company’s brands with its other hotels.PUBLIC PRIVATE EQUITY The private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts filed documents to raise $1.25 billion in an initial public offering, joining a recent march of buyout firms and hedge funds into the public markets.The move comes amid mounting uncertainties for buyout firms. Congress is considering changing the way private equity managers are taxed, which could substantially raise their tax bills. And the stock market’s reception of the Blackstone Group, another buyout firm that went public less than two weeks before Kohlberg Kravis’s announcement, has been anemic. Also, trouble in the debt markets threatens to raise the cost of borrowing the funds needed to complete buyout deals.Kohlberg, founded in 1976, is credited with creating the leveraged buyout. Its takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1989 was depicted in the book “Barbarians at the Gate,” which was made into a movie. That deal stood for years as the biggest leveraged buyout until a spate of deals during the current buyout boom surpassed it. Kohlberg was part of a group that agreed to acquire TXU, the Texas energy giant, in what now stands as the biggest leveraged buyout ever.Kohlberg will use the money raised in the offering to build new businesses around the globe, reduce dependence on third parties like pension funds and endowments for financing and give the firm a currency — its stock — for acquisitions.BIG REPAIR BILL Microsoft announced it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair failing Xbox 360 video game consoles in what may be one of the most expensive warranty repairs ever involving a consumer product.Microsoft did not say how many consoles needed repairs, but it said the majority of them had not experienced hardware failure. The amount Microsoft said it would spend suggests that a third to a half of the machines need repairs.The company said that it had sold 11.6 million of the consoles as of the end of June. They were introduced in November 2005. Xbox 360 is the best-selling game machine in the United States.Consumers know there is a problem if three flashing red lights appear on the console, an event described by users in online forums as “The Red Ring of Death” because the machine subsequently shuts down. Microsoft did not explain the nature of the flaw, but said it was not caused by a single problem.Customers who have already had their machines repaired because of the problem will be reimbursed, Microsoft said. One market researcher said the situation was “bound to affect discussions between Microsoft and its developers and retailers.”MOST POPULAR Following are the most popular business news articles on nytimes.com from June 30 through July 6:3.

"'07-07-07,'0','His secret? He put some lead tape on his putter, forcing him to put more oomph in his stroke after leaving so many putts short of the hole the day before.“Made it a little bit heavier,” Woods said of his putter, “because the greens were a touch on the slow side.”The putter was in the bag, though, when Woods was in trouble at the long par-4 sixth, a hole that plays as a par 5 for the club’s members. He had to lay up after hitting his tee shot in the heavy rough, then botched his third shot by hitting the ball over the green.Then he bailed himself out with a flop shot to 6 feet.“The flop shot was actually just pure luck,” he said. “I was just trying to get it on the green and it just happened to stay up on the top shelf. I didn’t want to have that go to waste by missing a makeable putt, and I was grinding pretty hard on that putt to make it. Knocked it in — and birdied the last three.”At the final hole, the large gallery that had constantly poured its adoration upon Woods for bringing the PGA Tour back to the Washington area got the payoff it had been wanting. After two days of stone-faced club-tossing over bad shots, Woods waved to the crowd with a nod of satisfaction after making a 14-foot birdie putt.By then, there was no question Woods would be back for the weekend.“I was just trying to get myself back in the tournament,” he said. “I didn’t know what the cut was going to be. I was just trying to get to even par, one under par.”The rest of the field was taking notice, too. Appleby, who made a 16-foot putt to save par at No. 18 and has only two bogeys in the tournament, would not concede that he has a comfortable lead over Woods, the world’s No. 1 player.“You always expect him to be there, so it becomes pretty much standard practice,” Appleby said.WATSON LEADS U.S. SENIOR OPEN Tom Watson made four consecutive birdies on his way to shooting a six-under 66 in the second round of the United States Senior Open in Haven, Wis. He moved to eight under for the tournament and took a three-shot lead over five players.Taking advantage of calm winds at Whistling Straits, Watson made eight birdies. Accurate approach shots and his famed short game played a role in his string of four in a row, which came toward the end of his first nine holes.Watson’s closest pursuers at five under are Loren Roberts, Des Smyth, Lonnie Nielsen, Ben Crenshaw and Vicenté Fernández. The first-round leader Eduardo Romero had a rough afternoon capped by a triple-bogey meltdown on the 18th hole, finishing five over for the day and one under for the tournament.Teeing off on the back nine, Watson began his birdie run on the par-4 14th hole, where he hit a chip shot within 12 feet and made the putt.VAN DE VELDE TO MISS BRITISH OPEN Jean van de Velde will miss the British Open’s return to Carnoustie, where he squandered a three-shot lead on the last hole in 1999. Van de Velde, the French player who eventually lost a three-man playoff to Paul Lawrie that year, has had a virus for more than three months.'"
"'07-07-07,'0','PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm that audited Tyco International when it was run by executives who later went to prison, has agreed to pay $225 million to settle claims of Tyco investors.The settlement, which is on top of the $2.975 billion that Tyco agreed to pay in a settlement announced in May, almost completes the recovery that investors are likely to see. But as part of the Tyco settlement, the company gave the investors the right to sue three former Tyco officials on Tyco’s behalf and to keep half of any money recovered.Tyco, which split into three companies a week ago, became a highflying conglomerate under its former chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, but disclosures that the company had concealed how much he and other top executives were paid led to a rapid fall in the stock price.PricewaterhouseCoopers had argued that the plaintiffs could not show that its conduct had led to losses for investors, and it pointed out that the changes in financial statements of Tyco after the fraud unraveled were relatively minor.But there was still great risk for the accounting firm if the case went to trial.Its lead auditor for Tyco, Richard P. Scalzo, was barred by the Securities and Exchange Commission from auditing public companies. The commission said that from 1999 on, Mr. Scalzo had good reason to doubt the honesty of Mr. Kozlowski and of Mark H. Swartz, then Tyco’s chief financial officer, but did not pursue auditing procedures that could have uncovered the fraud.'"

"'07-07-07,'0','PARIS, July 6 (Reuters) — Judges searched the offices of a former prime minister, Dominique de Villepin, on Friday, a day after raiding his home, as they investigated allegations that he unlawfully tried to wreck Nicolas Sarkozy’s presidential hopes.Judicial sources say investigators believe Mr. de Villepin might have tried to use falsified documents to smear his political rival in 2004 in a murky plot that almost pulled his government apart when details emerged last year.Mr. de Villepin has denied any wrongdoing and returned home from a holiday late on Thursday to be on hand when judges searched his office. “I have just been through moments which, as you can imagine, are not very pleasant, but I know the truth will emerge,” he told the French news media on Friday.The scandal started in 2004 when anonymous letters were sent to an examining magistrate alleging that Mr. Sarkozy and a group of other senior politicians held accounts in Clearstream, a financial clearing house in Luxembourg.The money was said to be linked to hundreds of millions of dollars in kickbacks from the sale of navy frigates to Taiwan in 1991, but the accounts proved bogus and the supporting documents were shown to have been falsified. Deleted files retrieved this week from the computer of an intelligence officer suggested that Mr. de Villepin encouraged the anonymous tip-off to the magistrate, judicial sources said.The sources have said Mr. de Villepin could be placed under formal investigation for complicity in false accusations. Bringing such an action against a former prime minister does not imply guilt, but would be almost without precedent in modern French history.Judges Jean-Marie d’Huy and Henri Pons spent six hours at Mr. de Villepin’s Paris apartment on Thursday and confiscated several documents. On Friday, they visited his office in an annex of the Foreign Ministry. Mr. Sarkozy lodged a complaint last year, saying he had been the victim of a smear campaign. Mr. de Villepin has repeatedly denied allegations that he was involved in the campaign.'"
"'07-07-07,'0','At the heart of Vietnam’s air pollution problem is dirty fuel, according to Hoang Hai Van, managing editor of the newspaper Thanh Nien, which recently published a series of groundbreaking articles on the topic.Mr. Van says the Vietnamese companies authorized to import fuel are resisting buying higher-quality fuel because it is more expensive.“The point is that they don’t want to import fuel of better quality because they don’t want to see a fall in profits,” he said in an e-mail message. The government is divided on the issue, Mr. Van and others say: the Ministry of Trade sees the fuel import business as a cash cow, while the Vehicle Registration and Inspection Agency says poor-quality fuel is negating any benefits of higher emissions standards.In February, car makers based in the country, represented by the Vietnam Automobile Manufacturers Association, sent a letter to the prime minister’s office complaining that newer engines would be damaged by the low-quality fuel.“The issue of fuel quality will have to be addressed sooner or later, but we can’t do it all at once,” said Dang Duong Binh, director of the environment section of the Hanoi Department of Natural Resources, Environment and Housing.As of July 1, all gasoline stations in Vietnam were supposed to carry fuel compatible with Euro II standards, which were in place in the European Union until 2000 and limit levels of benzene, sulfur and microscopic dust, among other pollutants. The Union now imposes significantly stricter regulations, known as Euro IV.But Mr. Van says poor-quality fuel is still being sold. “In reality, diesel for vehicle use is not up to standards,” he said.The irony for Vietnam is that for several years, it has pumped higher-quality “sweet” crude oil offshore that could produce clean-burning fuel if refined properly, according to Hoang Viet Cuong, a technical consultant and a former employee of Petrolimex, the Vietnamese national oil company.But with no refineries of its own, Vietnam must send the crude abroad. “We have very high-quality sweet crude, but then we import low-quality refined oil,” Mr. Cuong said. Vietnam is building a refinery, but it will not be working until 2010.Another problem is lax enforcement. Vehicle inspectors have a reputation for accepting bribes, vehicle owners and drivers say. The going rate for a passing grade is around 200,000 dong, or about $12, they say.At an inspection station in the Phap Van neighborhood of Hanoi, Do Van Hoa, the head of the station, says about 30 percent of vehicles do not even pass the existing emissions tests, which are well below Euro II standards and do not apply to motorcycles. But Mr. Hoa denies accepting bribes.“It is not the case that we pass the vehicles if someone offers us money,” Mr. Hoa said. “We have cameras,” he added, pointing to the four corners of an inspection station reeking of car emissions.Euro II regulations apply only to new vehicles, said Mr. Thanh, of the Vehicle Registration and Inspection Agency, and there is no plan to subject existing cars and motorcycles to more rigorous inspections. “You’ll have to be patient and wait until they die out,” he said.But there are also signs of rising awareness about air quality, environmentalists say, and they are encouraged that in a country where information is still tightly controlled, the authorities allowed publication of critical articles like the series in Mr. Van’s newspaper.“People were recently outraged after 17 local brands of soy sauce were found to contain a carcinogenic chemical,” he wrote in an editorial. “They should, however, realize that fuels with high pollutant levels are worse than soy sauce since, no matter who uses the fuels, everyone breathes the same air.”'"
"'07-07-07,'0','SPIN TO WIN Last year, when Agilent Technologies spun off Verigy, its semiconductor business, shares in the new company took off. Verigy is up 55 percent since the spinoff, compared with a 9 percent climb in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index during that time.Sally Beauty Holdings is up 20 percent, in a period when the S.& P. climbed only 7 percent, since being shed by the Alberto-Culver Company.These gains are not a coincidence, according to Kiplinger’s.“Studies have shown that spinoffs are very good investments,” the magazine wrote. “Lehman Brothers found that spinoffs beat the S.& P. 500 by an average of 18 percentage points in their first two years as independent companies.”The magazine offers three possible explanations for this success.First, managers of the new companies often have incentives “tied directly to its performance in a way that was impossible in a larger company.”Second, the new stock often trades at a discount initially, as shareholders who receive the stock in the spinoff sell it, content to hold on to what remains of the parent company.Also, “the market often assigns a higher value to easy-to-understand companies.”ASIA NOW Ten years ago this month, a financial panic forced the so-called tiger economies of Indonesia, Malaysia and other Asian nations into recession and set off a spate of bankruptcies.A lot can happen in a decade, Bloomberg Markets reports. The Asian countries have diversified their exports, thanks in large part to a consumption boom in China, and have reduced their debt. As a result their stock markets are soaring.For the 12 months that ended May 9, the Malaysia market was up 44 percent; the Philippines and Indonesia each climbed 36 percent. Singapore was up 35 percent, and Thailand was up 6 percent.SERIOUS PURSE STRINGS Pink magazine reports that women frequently make the buying decisions in many categories where marketing attention is traditionally focused on men.According to the numbers compiled by Marti Barletta in her book “Marketing to Women,” women drive the purchasing decisions in the following categories: home improvement, 80 percent; computers, 66 percent; new cars, 60+ percent; consumer electronics, 55 percent; and investments, 53 percent.FINAL TAKE Cosmopolitan, citing an unnamed online dating study, said that women would “relax their standards of how tall they want their mate to be” if the man earned enough money.A man who is 5-foot-6 would need to make $175,000 more a year to be considered as desirable as a man who is 6 feet tall.'"
"'07-07-07,'0','NEVER have investors been more eager to put up money to be lent to poor corporate credits. That fact, in part a result of financial alchemy that allows those who put up the cash to think they have investment-grade investments, helps to explain the boom in leveraged buyouts.In the quarter that just ended, the total value of leveraged loans in the United States rose to a record $204 billion, according to figures compiled by Standard & Poor’s and shown in the accompanying charts. In the first six months, loan volume came to $390 billion, more than in any full year before 2006.Lending in other markets is also rising rapidly. S.& P. says $155 billion was lent outside the United States in the leveraged loan market during the first half of 2007, up 80 percent from the same period in 2006.As June ended, the leveraged loan market began to look a little nervous, as some deals were postponed, and spreads — the difference in what the market charged on such loans relative to the rates banks themselves pay — rose slightly, although they remained at historically low levels.“I think spreads will have to widen,” said Robert Polenberg, a director of S.& P.’s leveraged commentary and data unit. He pointed to a backlog of $215 billion in loans being marketed, including the buyouts of Chrysler and First Data. “That is a lot of money to place,” he said.The role of leveraged buyouts in the market is greater than ever before. S.& P. reports that 42 percent of the second-quarter loans went to finance such buyouts, largely by private equity firms.'"

"'07-07-08,'0','WASHINGTON, July 7 (Reuters) — The lawyer for a former White House aide told lawmakers Saturday that he expected the Bush administration to try to block the aide from testifying about the dismissals of 93 United States attorneys.The statements came as the White House and Congress appeared to be moving toward a legal contest over Congressional subpoenas.In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the lawyer for the former aide, Sara Taylor, said she would be happy to testify, but expected a letter from the White House directing her not to do so.“In our view, it is unfair to Ms. Taylor that this constitutional struggle might be played out with her as the object of an unseemly tug of war,” the lawyer, W. Neil Eggleston, wrote in a letter to the committee and to the White House counsel.The chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, Patrick J. Leahy, said Ms. Taylor’s testimony was important to the committee’s investigation of the prosecutors’ dismissals.Mr. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, said it was “unfortunate that the White House is trying to interfere with Ms. Taylor’s testimony.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Cancellara’s victory was mostly expected because of his time-trial prowess. But the margin of victory was shocking. The gap of 13 seconds over the second-place finisher was bigger than the difference between any other two consecutively placed riders, except for the last two places.The last-place finisher, Ruden Lobato of Saunier Duval-Prodir, finished 18 seconds behind the next-fastest finisher and 1:51 behind Cancellara. Amazingly, Lobato also was the slowest rider in the 2006 Tour prologue, and this year he was nearly 30 seconds slower than Stuart O’Grady, who crashed on the course and had to change bikes.Arguably as surprising was Klöden’s ride. Much of the talk in the days leading up to the start of the Tour has been about the relationship between Klöden and Vinokourov and who would actually lead Astana through the three-week race. At a team news conference earlier in the week, the two riders sat separated by their team manager and, while paying lip service to the idea that Klöden is here to support Vinokourov, they did not appear too friendly.Klöden, 32, finished second in the 2004 Tour, more than six minutes behind Lance Armstrong. He finished third in last year’s Tour, behind Floyd Landis, who is awaiting the outcome of a hearing into charges that he used performance-enhancing drugs during last year’s Tour, and Óscar Pereiro.Few of the riders expected to compete for the overall victory produced outstanding times. Levi Leipheimer of Discovery Channel, who won the prologue at the Tour of California, finished 26th, 40 seconds behind Cancellara and only fourth best on his team. Cadel Evans of Predictor-Lotto finished 17th, 36 seconds back, and Denis Menchov of Rabobank finished 27th, 40 seconds back. David Zabriskie, the American time-trial champion, finished 11th, 32 seconds behind.Many younger riders shined. Three of the top 10 finishers — Gusev, Thomas Dekker of Rabobank and Benoit Vaugrenard of Française des Jeux — are under 25 and will battle for the best young rider prize.The mostly British crowds seemed to welcome the Tour, which has visited the country before but has never been to London. “I think it’s brilliant,” said Caroline Hope, who came with her three children from Manchester.“So many people here couldn’t ever go to see it in France,” she said.She said she was not discouraged by the doping scandals that have swirled around cycling over the past few years. “I think everyone just picks on cycling. People in other sports dope as well, but cycling is what gets splashed all over the cover of L’Équipe,” the French sports newspaper.Not everyone in Britain was so welcoming of the Tour de France riders. Wiggins, the British rider with the French Cofidis team, said that when the team was training earlier this week in Essex, the coastal county northeast of London, they attracted shouts from passing drivers “who said we’re all dopers and they don’t want the Tour de France here.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','BISSAU, Guinea-Bissau, July 7 (Reuters) — The United States reopened a diplomatic office here on Saturday after a decade of absence, amid fears that the West African country is becoming a growing hub for Latin American drug traffickers.Washington closed its diplomatic mission in Bissau more than 10 years ago, shortly before a brief civil war. It has maintained diplomatic relations with the former Portuguese colony through its embassy in neighboring Senegal.“Reopening this office paves the way for the reopening of a U.S. Embassy in Guinea-Bissau,” Janice Jacobs, the United States ambassador to Senegal, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony here.With its lawless, island-dotted Atlantic shoreline, Guinea-Bissau has become a major hub for smuggled Colombian cocaine on its way to lucrative markets in Europe and elsewhere, prompting calls for international action to stem the trade.Washington challenged the country’s government last month over its firing of a police chief who won international praise for tackling Latin American cocaine traffickers.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','“I love being this close to history,” Lewis said. “But sometimes it makes me a little nervous.”The Giants’ last road series, in Cincinnati, made him a little dizzy. Bonds hit the 751st home run of his career Tuesday, Lewis hit the second grand slam of his season Wednesday, and the two of them pretended to wrestle on a clubhouse couch Thursday.To hear Lewis’s side of the story, he was sitting quietly on the couch, watching television by himself, when Bonds plopped down beside him and playfully threw an elbow at his ribs.“You know I can crush you,” Bonds said, adopting the tone of an older brother.For Bonds, size is always at the heart of the conversation. As a young player, he was slender and smooth. At 42, he is bulky and slow, fueling speculation that he took steroids.At 26, Lewis is trying desperately to muscle up. But no matter what off-season workout program he tries, he cannot seem to gain weight. Compared with his stocky contemporaries, he looks like a man who was built in another era.“He has that good, lean body,” said Roger Cador, who coached Lewis at Southern University. “It’s like he’s from the 1980s.”The ’80s produced Eric Davis, Darryl Strawberry and Bonds, players who were lanky, speedy and strong. Giants Manager Bruce Bochy, who played in the ’80s, said that Lewis was “big enough.”The Giants arrived Friday at Busch Stadium, where Lewis was cheered by relatives and Bonds was booed by fans who once embraced Mark McGwire.St. Louis is accustomed to home run chases and steroid accusations. Playing for the Cardinals in 1998, McGwire set a season record with 70 home runs. Since then, Bonds hit 73, and McGwire refused to tell a Congressional committee if he had used steroids.One theory, popularized in the book “Game of Shadows,” is that Bonds saw the attention McGwire received in St. Louis during the 1998 season and felt compelled to use steroids. But that theory assumes that Bonds really wanted more attention.During a casual conversation with reporters at his locker Friday, Bonds was asked about the hype accompanying his home run chase. Bonds thought for a moment, rubbing his right hand over his shaved head. “I’ve got to bunt more,” he said.Bonds’s sense of humor is among the most underrated parts of his game. When Lewis hit a grand slam July 4, after hitting for the cycle on Mother’s Day, he said that Bonds asked him, “Are you just going to hit on holidays?”By teasing Lewis, Bonds has made clear how much he likes him. As they stretched together Friday, Bonds told Lewis about the wind pockets at Busch Stadium, which make it difficult to hit home runs to right field.Lewis listened intently to the lecture on meteorology. “He talks to me about everything,” Lewis said. “At first, I was kind of speechless around him. I was starstruck. But he’s become like a big brother to me.”Lewis has played in only 42 major league games, but his career has been charmed. He hit for the cycle in his fourth start. He became the first Giants rookie to hit two grand slams in a season since the team moved to San Francisco. And he befriended Bonds, who is not exactly famous for making pals.Despite all the traits that Lewis and Bonds have in common, one of the players is more approachable. Lewis grew up in small-town Mississippi, talks in a slow drawl and listens to music from his church choir.He is old for a rookie and needs polish against left-handed pitching, but the Giants consider him one of their top prospects, a potential successor when Bonds retires.After the Giants-Cardinals series ends Sunday, Bonds will fly to San Francisco for the All-Star Game. Lewis will head home to Wiggins, Miss., where he learned to play baseball on an empty lot next to his church, using a broomstick for a bat.Bonds and Lewis had hardball in the family. Bonds’s father, Bobby, and his godfather, Willie Mays, starred for the Giants. Lewis’s cousin, Matt Lawton, played in the major leagues for 11 years.In 2005, when Lawton was with the Yankees, he tested positive for steroids. Lawton then became one of the rare athletes to admit that the test was accurate and acknowledge that he deserved his punishment.Lewis has seen steroids — and the suspicion of steroids — damage his cousin and his new big brother. Then again, he has also seen what each of them accomplished before steroids were even mentioned.“I’d still love to add 10 pounds of muscle,” Lewis said. “But for some reason, it just won’t come. And, you know what? That’s O.K. I like my weight the way it is.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Five of them met recently for lunch in the airy Park Avenue apartment of Mr. Redel, 84. They began chattering immediately, kindling memories, each a poignant vignette of a refugee’s past.Bright spots on the voyage broke through the solemnity of the departure. Mrs. Miness viewed the trip as a grand adventure, and Mr. Redel, who was 17 at the time, brimmed with a sense of youthful invincibility.“All we ate was sardines, sardines, sardines,” said Elza Weinman, 81, who was 14 at the time. “And then everyone got seasick.”Mrs. Weinman’s mother wore the same corset every day, because she had sewn diamonds into it for safekeeping. Mrs. Parnes’s fetching young aunt sneaked into lifeboats at night with equally fetching young men. When the ship reached New York, Mrs. Miness’s lovely, vain mother begged to be taken to Ellis Island, because she had heard that there was a salon there and was desperate to have her hair coiffed.There were luminaries aboard, too, to the delight of other passengers. They strained to catch sight of people like the French movie star Marcel Dalio and his glamorous wife, Madeleine LeBeau, who would later appear in “Casablanca.”Irving Redel’s family members were not luminaries. They fled their home in Brussels in early May as the Germans advanced, first hitching a ride toward France, where thousands of refugees clogged the roads in cars, wagons, baby strollers and overflowing wheelbarrows.Malvina Parnes’s family fled Antwerp after her aunt charmed two young men into driving them part of the way. The family sought shelter where they could, spending one night in a farmhouse. While Malvina was standing by its front window, a bomb dropped feet from the glass but did not explode, a memory that haunts her still.People scrambled to get visas, including phony ones, for anywhere outside Europe. In Toulouse, the Redels got visas to China and Morocco. Mrs. Miness’s family got visas for Mexico. Mrs. Weinman’s family had visas for Venezuela. The Quanza’s captain also made many of the passengers buy return tickets, because he doubted their visas would gain them entry anywhere.The Atlantic crossing was not easy. A hurricane hit. The windowless bunks were stifling. Mr. Redel’s mother developed pleurisy. A New York Times article noting the Quanza’s arrival described the bulk of the passengers as “lowly refugees.”Malvina’s father, who had been admitted to the United States months ahead of his family, met the ship in New York. He was allowed on board only once, and came bearing food, clothes and kisses. Malvina, her mother, aunt and sister were not allowed off the ship, and Malvina paced its length, playing an imaginary piano to chase her jitters away.Sailors hoisted her screaming little sister overboard in a chair fastened to a pulley, so her father could kiss her goodbye before she was hoisted back and the ship steamed away.The Quanza headed to Vera Cruz, Mexico, where 35 passengers, including Nina Miness’s family, were admitted. But the authorities rejected the visas of other passengers, including the families of Mr. Redel, Mrs. Weinman and Mrs. Parnes, 78. As the ship steamed around the Caribbean, Mrs. Weinman’s father wired different governments, begging to be let ashore. No one answered his call.Preparing to return to Europe, the Quanza stopped for coal in Virginia, where at least one despairing passenger threw himself overboard. (He swam to shore and was returned to the ship.) A lawyer, J. L. Morewitz, managed to keep the ship in dock until Mrs. Roosevelt stealthily instructed a State Department official, against the wishes of the secretary of state, Cordell Hull, to arrange for everyone onboard to get visas. The refugees raced ashore and scattered.Mr. Redel’s family ended up in Brooklyn. He went on to found a commodities trading business on Wall Street and raise his family in Westchester before moving to Park Avenue. Mrs. Miness lived blocks away. Mrs. Weinman lived on the Upper West Side, and so did Mrs. Parnes. While a few met up roughly 10 years ago, when the Morewitz family arranged a reunion, no one stayed in touch, despite their proximity.Now, in their twilight years, the last of the survivors say it is gratifying to find each other again. The rekindled memories brought pain, they said, but solace, too.“Many of the things that happened to people is a matter of luck, of us being in the right place at the right time,” Mr. Redel said. “It’s a story of desperation and hope.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Questions are already being raised over why the government waited so long to move against the clerics of the Lal Masjid.Government officials are privately saying they hope that the government will next go after another radical cleric, Fazlullah, the acting leader of the extremist group Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi, or the Movement for the Enforcement of Islamic Law, who has been vocal in his support for the Taliban and suicide bombing as well as the clerics in the mosque.But going after individuals may not be enough.An investigation published Friday by The News, a national daily, found that 88 seminaries belonging to various sects were giving religious education to more than 16,000 students in the capital. Moreover, the number of students here attending religious schools belonging to the Deobandi sect, an anti-Western, pro-jihadi fundamentalist school of thought that inspired the Taliban, among other movements, has doubled in the last year alone.The newspaper cited figures for students taking exams, using information collected from unidentified government agencies. In 2006, 5,039 students from Deobandi seminaries took exams conducted by the sect’s central examination board, with about 3,000 of them coming from the two seminaries attached to the Lal Masjid.Today those two seminaries hold 10,700 students, the report said. “The reason for this big surge in the number of students is still not known to the government,” it said.The number of students at the Lal Masjid’s two madrasas, or religious schools — 5,039 — is not far short of the total in the whole province of Baluchistan. It also is almost equal to the number of students in the 74 schools belonging to other sects in the capital, which together have 5,400 students.The spread of madrasas in the capital has been steady since the 1980s when Gen. Zia ul-Haq, then in power, promoted the madrasas as a source of mujahedeen to fight the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the report said.Seven madrasas were founded in the capital during his 11-year rule, 15 more during the 11 years of civilian governments under Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif from 1988 to 1999, and 14 during General Musharraf’s eight-year rule.Certain lessons must be drawn from the Lal Masjid episode, the national daily Dawn wrote Friday in an editorial. “Characters like the two Lal Masjid brothers are to be found all over the country,” it wrote. “They have money and arms and brainwashed followers willing to do their bidding.”While their followers may be innocent and sincere in their belief, their leaders often operate with impunity, it said. “It is, thus, the brains behind them that the government should go after.”“The Lal Masjid drama is a symptom of a deeper malaise,” it said. “The nation expects the government to move against terrorism until it no longer becomes a force.”A successful end to the Lal Masjid showdown will provide a much-needed lift to the Pakistani government and General Musharraf himself, Teresita C. Schaffer, a former assistant secretary of state for South Asia and the director of the South Asia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a speech this week.Failure to act earlier was a reflection of the severe erosion of the government’s authority, she said.“But Musharraf and his government are not out of the woods,” she said, listing major problems confronting the general, who faces elections this year, and the country. The militancy issue alone is daunting.“Fighting between government forces and groups friendly to the Taliban in the provinces bordering Afghanistan, is still going on, with at least two suicide bombings in the last 24 hours,” she said. “Sympathizers of the Red Mosque as well as Afghan-oriented parts of the militant movement may be looking for more opportunities to make their presence felt.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Why did firefighters in Montgomery, Ala., head to the ballpark after a relief pitcher slammed the door?This is not a trick question. They were called because Mobile BayBears pitcher Matt Elliott had locked himself in the bathroom and could not get out to pitch the ninth inning against the Montgomery Biscuits in a Class AA Southern League game June 23.Elliott was angry about giving up the tying run on a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth and headed to the bathroom behind the dugout at Riverwalk Stadium.“He slammed the door and he broke the locking mechanism that is set inside of a steel frame in the side of a concrete wall,” said Greg Rauch, the general manager of the Biscuits.”Elliott declined an interview request, but Tim Hagerty described the scene on the BayBears’ broadcast.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','The company’s main purpose “is to contribute to development,” he adds. “It is not a capitalist enterprise that aims at declaring dividends to its shareholders.” Central to his ethos is the notion that his investments can prompt other forms of economic growth within a country or region that results in greater employment and hope for the poor.Economic developments experts say the Aga Khan’s activities offer a useful template for others — including philanthropists like Bill Gates and George Soros — who are trying to assist the world’s poorest by marrying business practices to social goals, but whose foundation work usually stops short of owning businesses outright in poor countries.Paul Collier, an economist at Oxford University who specializes in the problems of poor countries, says he believes that aid agencies could benefit from operating more like venture capitalists — and more like the Aga Khan. “He gets a multiplier effect from his investments that’s really lacking in foreign aid,” Mr. Collier says. “I’m impressed with his way of accepting risk and thinking long term.”At the same time, the Aga Khan embodies many of the conflicting social and financial tides sweeping the global economy. He is the spiritual leader of the Ismaili Muslim sect, but he is also surrounded by unusual material riches — none of which he or his followers see as a contradiction.The Aga Khan concedes that he owns two jets, but says that he drives an Audi and that his yacht is 25 years old. Ismailis “wouldn’t like to see him living the life of a pauper — we want him to live a decent, an affluent life,” says Kris Janowski, the Aga Khan’s spokesman. Mr. Janowski adds that the imam is “surprised that anyone would apply the word ‘lavish’ to his lifestyle because he doesn’t see it as lavish.”PART of the Aga Khan’s personal wealth, which his advisers say exceeds $1 billion, comes from a dizzyingly complex system of tithes that some of the world’s 15 million Ismaili Muslims pay him each year — an amount that he won’t disclose but which may reach hundreds of millions of dollars annually.The Aga Khan, 70, has had unconditional control of this money since his grandfather placed him in his position 50 years ago. He has invested those resources in a free-form portfolio of 90 businesses that employ more than 36,000 people. These holdings include five-star hotels, cellphone companies and an airline, but most are small and medium-size enterprises in Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.“The Aga Khan is making a significant contribution that people too often underestimate — many of his investments have become huge successes, but he’s not driven by profit,” says Praful Patel, a vice president in Central Asia for the World Bank. “He’s treated like a head of state, has access to the highest levels in any country and his gravitas is worth a lot. It allows his outfit to succeed in investments where others cannot.”THE Aga Khan was born Prince Karim in 1936 in Geneva. He grew up in Nairobi during World War II, and he attended a Swiss boarding school before he was named imam at age 20.There have been 49 Ismaili imams over the centuries, but only three previous Aga Khans, a title the King of Persia bestowed on the family in the 1830s. The third — the current Aga Khan’s grandfather — was Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan, a legendary figure in colonial India who later moved to Britain and served as a president of the League of Nations.Upon his death in 1957, Shah Aga Khan’s will instructed that his son (the current Aga Khan’s father), Aly Khan, be passed over in favor of his grandson, Prince Karim, who was studying Islamic history at Harvard at the time.That the Aga Khan attended secular universities, wore Western dress and espoused Western values reflected his sect’s historical need to adapt to varying cultures. The Ismailis are a minority within the minority Shia branch of Islam and have experienced frequent persecution through the centuries; as recently as the 1990s, the Taliban in Afghanistan persecuted Ismailis.Over the centuries, as the Ismailis dispersed across Asia and Africa and later Europe and North America, they often adopted Western ways. This invited criticism from other Muslims, who questioned how someone could wear a suit and still call himself an imam. But Ismailis say they see no conflict between Westernization and their faith.“The central trait of their long history is a remarkable tendency to acculturate to different contexts,” says Ali S. Asani, a professor of Indo-Muslim languages and culture at Harvard and an Ismaili.The Aga Khan’s fluency in Western ways — and what he describes as his desire to show that “an imam’s responsibilities include caring for the quality of life of the people who he leads, including their economic progress” — animated his first major business venture, the start of a media company in Nairobi in 1961. “The origin of this exercise was the need at the time of British withdrawal from Eastern Africa to have African politics explained to the African public in African terms,” he says. “There was no independent media in the region at the time, so we had a delicate mandate but a necessary one.”Over time, his Nairobi company, the Nation Media Group, became the most successful media concern in East Africa, with print, radio and television properties in Tanzania and Uganda as well. The company is profitable and considered among the most professional in Africa, while also offering a voice to government critics. “If he was a nonsophisticated, profit-only guy, these newspapers and broadcasters would not be the independent voices for the public good that they are,” says Andrew Mwenda, a radio commentator and a newspaper columnist in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.The 1970s and 1980s were difficult times for the Aga Khan’s businesses, most of which were in Africa. African leaders nationalized industries. Civil wars broke out. And economies contracted or collapsed. In East Africa, where a large number of Ismailis lived, African leaders blamed outsiders for their troubles. The government evicted most Ismailis from Uganda, while Ismailis in Central Asia suffered under Soviet repression of religious groups.“The cold war was prominent on my horizon all the time,” the Aga Khan recalls. “The question I was asking all the time: ‘What is going to happen after the cold war ends?’ It wasn’t going to be eternal. So we stayed engaged and waited.”With the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the cold war did end, and the Aga Khan saw fresh opportunities to energize and expand his Ismaili institutions. In Tajikistan in Central Asia, where many Ismailis lived, a civil war created an urgent need for outside assistance, and the Aga Khan rushed charitable resources into the country. More recently, he has invested in power generation and a cellphone company there.In Uganda, decades of civil war and social collapse came to an end when Yoweri Museveni consolidated political power in the early 1990s. Mr. Museveni personally appealed to the Aga Khan to encourage Ismailis to return to Uganda, promising to restore all their properties seized by the deposed dictator, Idi Amin. Many Ismailis returned to Uganda, and so did the Aga Khan’s business.“Uganda is still lacking big-time investors, and the Aga Khan provides some of that,” says Moses Byaruhanga, a political adviser to Mr. Museveni.Today, Uganda is home to some of the Aga Khan’s most ambitious business enterprises. He owns the country’s largest pharmaceutical company, a tannery, a bank and an insurance company. And then there is the fish net factory.On a spring morning in Kampala, amid the pounding noise of textile machines spinning nylon into sturdy nets, Karen Veverica, an aquaculture expert with Auburn University, cradles in her arms a new net, made to her specifications by the Aga Khan’s factory. The net is part of her campaign, financed by the United States Agency for International Development, to help jump-start a fish-farming industry in Uganda.“Fish farmers can’t just grow fish out of the blue,” she explains. “To get fish out of the pond, we need a net like this.”Making new types of nets represents a classic economic development quandary: there is no demand for the nets, yet without them fish farming cannot take off. New nets, in short, are an unlikely “enabling technology” that might spur growth in the local economy. But it requires patient investors.“We can take a decision like this because we think long term,” Mahmood Ahmed, the Aga Khan’s representative in Uganda, says of the nets. “We won’t enter a business without the promise of profit, but we have more considerations than profit.”WHILE fish nets are decidedly small potatoes, the same mind set applies to the $750 million hydroelectric system that the Aga Khan is developing in Uganda. The project, at Bujagali Falls on the Nile River, is the largest project ever undertaken by the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development, known by its acronym, Akfed. Despite vast unmet needs for electricity in the region, the Bujagali project is one that few capitalists would touch, partly “because the big global power companies have shunned Africa, fearing risks,” says Kevin Kariuki, who was born in Kenya and is a senior executive in the Aga Khan’s infrastructure unit. “The American electricity companies aren’t going to come. The Europeans will stick to their home markets. We want to be the developer of choice in this part of the world, and Bujagali creates an opportunity for us.”In what analysts describe as one of the most innovative electrification campaigns in Africa, the Aga Khan’s infrastructure group is building a series of inexpensive “minihydro” systems around very small dams. They provide electricity to parts of Uganda where the national electricity grid does not reach.The poor West Nile region of the country now has electricity 18 hours a day, compared with its previous schedule of just four hours every other day. And prices for the electricity, which the Aga Khan sells as well as produces, are high enough to generate internal profit rates of more than 10 percent, Mr. Kariuki says.Financing businesses that can spur economic growth in marginal regions is what the Aga Khan says animates many of his investments. That has led him, he says, to forgo the merger-and-acquisition plays of Wall Street, to avoid investing in booming domestic economies like China’s and to shy away from charitable giving that is not linked to a clear business goal. He says he prefers to put money into unglamorous enterprises that are engines of employment and have great long-term potential — even if profits aren’t immediate.Ismaili investments occur alongside cultural, educational and health initiatives, carried out by various units of the Aga Khan’s development network. Spending on these nonbusiness activities can run into the hundreds of millions of dollars annually, Semin Abdulla, a spokeswoman, says. (She says the group’s charitable giving will amount to about $320 million this year.) The Aga Khan Development Network, formed 10 years ago, looks for synergy between its business and philanthropic activities.Mixing business and charity, while long at odds with mainstream capitalist practice, is growing in prominence, making the Aga Khan an unlikely innovator.“If you can get capital that’s partly philanthropic, you can help reach a lot of people,” says Mark Kramer, managing director of FSG Social Impact Advisers, a consulting firm in Boston. “In many cases, businesses are much better positioned to deliver sustained social benefits than charities.”Evaluating the effectiveness of the Aga Khan’s charitable network is difficult because neither the network nor Akfed publishes any performance data. But analysts who are conversant with Akfed and its finances say that the investor deserves credit for taking risks and backing projects that might otherwise not attract any private support.After the United States started an offensive against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001, he stepped in with private investments, including building both the first five-star hotel in Kabul and Roshan, the leading mobile phone company.Roshan has 1.3 million subscribers and is adding 60,000 a month. The Afghan government gets 6 percent of its tax revenue from the company, Ms. Abdulla says. Roshan says it employs 900 people, about 180 of whom are women.“In Afghanistan, the Aga Khan is creating an enabling environment for business,” says Mr. Patel at the World Bank. “While producing results, these are early days. It’s too soon to see a payoff from his investments.”That does not bother the Aga Khan. Building businesses, he says, “is part of the ethics of the faith.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','If the housewives hadn’t gotten there yet and broken through the gates, Lucky G’s father would smash the hot-wired van right through supermarket windows. They loaded the van with entire aisles of Pampers, including the diapers in the stock room. They hit most of the supermarkets in Spanish Harlem, stopping only long enough to dump their booty before heading to their next target, hoping the housewives hadn’t yet cleaned out the place.The following morning, there was not a diaper to be bought in the neighborhood. Word spread quickly as to who had Pampers and who didn’t. For weeks Lucky G’s father sold Pampers at discount rates. He made a killing. He even had a system for storage: Pampers for newborns were stacked in the bedroom, Pampers for little babies were in the living room, and diapers for older babies were in Lucky G’s room. When I went over to hang with Lucky G, I saw boxes and boxes of Pampers stacked against the walls like bricks.Lucky G.’s father really had hit the biggest score. It was way bigger than the score at the Ace Pontiac on Jerome Avenue in the South Bronx, where about 200 people had crashed through the plate-glass windows of the dealership and driven off with 50 Pontiacs. We didn’t need cars, and we certainly couldn’t afford them, especially during a gasoline shortage.For a few days, a blackout black market flourished in Spanish Harlem. Those who stole televisions, radios and jewelry could not unload them anywhere as fast, or for as much money, as those who stole useful things like Pampers, baby food, whiskey and sneakers. At one abandoned tenement, Pro-Keds and Converse went for $5 a pair.The ethos of getting something for nothing gripped entire families, especially those living in bleak apartments furnished with couches and beds purchased on the installment plan. For these people, the idea was not to steal anything, but simply to make sure that the books of the furniture stores were set ablaze.WHEN the lights went out, I was drenched in sweat, having just finished playing handball in Jefferson Park, along the East River near 116th Street. About 9:30, the light in the lamppost outside the handball court flickered, then flat-lined. Only car headlights shone on the streets.I had to be home by 10 so my mother wouldn’t get angry with me. As I walked along East 116th Street and crossed Pleasant Avenue, where the last remnant of the old Little Italy still survives, I saw a bunch of armed wiseguys, their guns in full display, tucked between their shirts and their pants. They had parked their Cadillacs close together, blocking off Pleasant Avenue from the rest of Spanish Harlem to protect their beloved Rao’s restaurant from the looters. Brandishing their guns, they were happy to let people pass through as long as they behaved.As I crossed the blockade, I recall, I overheard one of the men cheerfully announce that he would shoot all the Latinos passing through because in the blackout they looked just like blacks. Another of the men chimed in: “Are you crazy? Do the math.” He was smart. He and his pals were outnumbered by the looters.The cops, too, had done the math. Through the night, as looters seemed to appear out of thin air, you could hear the sirens and gunshots. But they were nothing but hollow sounds. The cops knew that fighting back was pointless, and to their credit, they simply shot in the air to scare the looters away. Some looters dropped their booty right then and there; others just ran faster. Arrests were made, but for every 20 looters the cops locked up, 50 more would take their place. The cops understood that the looters could take the 23rd Precinct, too, if they felt like it.Arriving home, I found my mother unworried and laughing. Her church friend from next door had thrown a saucepan at her husband, who she thought had once again gambled away the money for the electricity bill. My mother, a seamstress in the garment district, was making phone calls (the phones were working; it was Con Ed, not Ma Bell, that had ceased to function), spreading this juicy gossip to her Jehovah’s Witness sisters.IN the days following the blackout, I took a cue from Lucky G’s father and the other looters and began searching for an opportunity. There were no jobs for adults, let alone for a scrawny wannabe tough guy like me, so when the chance arrived in the name of dog-napping on the Upper East Side, I took it.During the blackout of ’77, the Upper East Side was left unscathed. With a bustling economy of its own, it was the destination for the mothers of many of my friends, who woke up every morning and took a bus to the Upper East Side to clean apartments for next to nothing. As a teenager, I’d see Upper East Siders walking down Fifth Avenue, young girls in summer dresses, young men in khakis and crisp white shirts. I dreamed of living their lives, in their buildings, in their neighborhoods. I wanted to know where they were going. What doorman building did they call home? What smoothly operating elevator carried them to lofty and wonderful heights?Back then, I felt that the only advantage I had over the Upper East Siders was that I sensed their fear that the damage we had done to our neighborhoods during the blackout we would one day do to theirs.Yet I knew one of their weak spots: Furry creatures they treat like children. As good as gold. We’d call our dog-napping forays hunting. “You want to go hunting?” I’d ask a friend. We would take a laundry bag and a folding knife with a six-inch blade and roam the swanky streets of the Upper East Side. We were on the lookout for small dogs leashed to lampposts while their owners were running an errand or inside a cafe drinking coffee. We would unleash the dog or cut the leash, stuff the dog in the laundry bag and run as if the devil were behind us.We would take the dog home, feed him, walk him, groom him, and two or three days later, we would prowl the street where we had stolen the dog in the first place, looking for the reward fliers. When we found them, posted to a bus stop or lamppost or the window of a beauty salon, we would return to Spanish Harlem to get the dog and my 6-year-old cousin. I would practice the word “aimlessly.” My cousin’s job was to be the cute, innocent child who had become attached to the dog.Then we would all dress up, comb our hair and return the dog. The dog usually lived in a doorman building, and the owner was usually a woman.“Lady, is this your dog?” I would say. “We found him aimlessly wandering around. My little brother loves him, but when we found out he was lost, we brought him back.”The woman would be so happy and would reach out to take the dog from my cousin, who in turn would hold onto the dog and start crying as if his mother had died in his arms.“I’ll get you another one, one that looks just like that one,” I’d tell him. And right then and there, the woman would fork over the reward.I ran this scam to get money to buy stuff I wanted — Pumas, jeans — and sometimes, if there was money left over, I’d help pay the phone bill. I ran this scam with precision and skill.The period during the blackout and its aftermath was the most dishonest in my life, but I will never shy away from what I did in El Barrio.In the ’70s, the city was a cold place, but its residents were far from defeated. In the ghettos we waited for daylight, and when that first luminous ray broke through the crack on the wall, like the restless people that built this city, we saw an opportunity and we took it.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','It was all part of the company’s attempt to make the bikes more family friendly, an effort echoed in the United States. Not wanting to scare off the curious, the organizers did not include Harley in the name of the event, instead calling it Blue Sky Heaven. Wise to the country’s mania for animation, Harley placed cartoon hogs — a nod to the nickname for its largest models — around the event.“The biggest difference between our bikes and Japanese bikes is we’re a lifestyle,” said Katsuya Masuda, a sales promotion manager for Harley-Davidson, which sells in Japan through a network of Harley-only dealers. “We want riders to enjoy our bikes, but also families, too.”The formula seems to be working. The number of new Harleys registered in Japan hit a record 14,026 in 2006, 48 percent more than in 2000. Sales jumped 13 percent last year when the government scrapped a rule that prevented two people from riding on one motorcycle on the highway.Harley in Japan attracts older and more affluent riders than usual, no surprise because the bikes and accessories are costly. In Japan’s rapidly aging society, older people are spending more time on leisure pursuits, and motorcycle touring fits that trend. The Japanese have also taken to Harley’s network of owners’ groups that travel together, and swap parts and repair tips.Japanese Harley enthusiasts interviewed at the festival were aware that the Hell’s Angels and movies like “Easy Rider” have helped define Harleys in the popular American imagination and some were aware that Harleys once had a reputation for being poorly made. But the bikes are more reliable now, so the Japanese view them as classic American driving machines.“Technically there’s no reason Honda, Yamaha or Suzuki can’t make a bike as good as Harley,” said Christopher Richter, an auto analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets in Tokyo. “It’s all about the brand.”Harley has a burnished image even with Japanese who do not ride motorcycles. Several riders at the festival said that innkeepers and restaurant owners routinely welcomed them when they toured the country.“These bikes are expensive in Japan, so people think we have families, homes and understand quality,” said Jun Toda, 50, a trading company executive from Tokyo.Mr. Toda started riding motorcycles when he was 16, but could not afford his first Harley until a year and a half ago, when he spent $25,000 on a new white Dyna Low Rider with leather saddlebags.“In the 1980s, motorcycles were for young people, and now that many of these people are retiring, they are buying Harleys,” said Mr. Toda, whose wife and two adult children ride smaller Japanese bikes.In a uniquely Japanese touch, he had two trinkets hanging from his handlebars, a policeman to ward off speeding tickets and a white ghost to keep the rain away.Though thunderstorms kept Mr. Toda’s wife from attending this year’s festival, plenty of other couples made the trip. Yoshihisa and Midori Uehara, in matching black-and-orange Harley outfits, traveled with their two Boston terriers in denim shoulder bags. Ms. Uehara fell in love with Harleys after seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger ride one in the movie “Terminator 2: Judgment Day.” The Ueharas take their Softail Deluxe bikes on weekend trips along the Pacific coast, staying at inns that allow pets.“A lot of women ride on their boyfriend’s bikes, but we ride our own,” she said.Still, women make up just 7.4 percent of all Harley owners in Japan, versus more than 10 percent in the United States. The typical rider is close to 40 and male, Mr. Masuda said.Masaaki Iwashita, 55, bought his first Harley, a blue and white Softail Deluxe with whitewall tires, after he retired from an insurance company two years ago. Like many Japanese retirees, Mr. Iwashita wanted to find a community of people who share his passion, so he joined the Harley riders’ club near his home in Yamanashi Prefecture.“A new life, a new bike,” he said.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','In “The U.S. Attorney Who Roared” (June 24), the United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, is portrayed as a heroic upholder of the law. You do not mention the series of ominous but ultimately baseless accusations against Senator Robert Menendez that leaked from Mr. Christie’s office just before the 2006 election, when they would do the most damage.United States attorneys with integrity and independence who refused to abuse their office to influence elections in favor of Republicans have been forced out by Karl Rove and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales. Mr. Christie still has his job.I agree with your July 1 editorial “Stepping Up on Climate Change.” It is sad, as this should be a national issue, with a president leading on the issue, and since that will never happen with the current president, it is important for states to step up.This is not even a partisan area. New Jersey, led by a Democratic governor, is doing it, while California, with a Republican governor, is also a leader in the field. We must all unite to tackle this huge issue.“A Good Deal” (editorial, June 24) labeled Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s congestion pricing proposal “a bargain” for New Jersey commuters. I cannot fathom how forcing commuters to pay a fee for driving into Midtown Manhattan is a bargain for anyone other than the mayor.The revamped congestion pricing proposal would charge commuters entering Midtown an $8 fee if they have not paid a Hudson River bridge or tunnel toll. Commuters who pay the $5 toll would be required to pay an additional $3 to drive into Midtown. Either way, the monies collected amount to nothing more than a commuter tax.Mr. Bloomberg is trying to sell this proposal as a way to reduce to traffic congestion and vehicle emissions in the city. I share his quality of life and environmental concerns, but does he really believe that a $3 surcharge will lead to fewer polluting vehicles in the city?'"
"'07-07-08,'0','“The critical point is that we do this right and ensure that the manufacturer has worked through all the issues,” said Mr. Stessel. A Canadian company, Bombardier, is building the cars, which cost about $1.5 million apiece. “We’re interested in the fleet getting delivered on time, but we’re obsessed that we have quality cars in service.”That is cold comfort to commuters who often must stand on overcrowded trains to Manhattan during peak hours. New Jersey Transit officials say the multilevel trains, even when they are in use, are a temporary solution. The larger problem of train congestion will be solved only after 2016 when a second tunnel under the Hudson is expected to be completed, doubling the number of trains that can get in and out of Manhattan, they say.Even in the short term, the multilevel trains were supposed to help offset the loss of the “clockers,” the Amtrak trains that New Jersey Transit monthly pass holders could ride at no extra cost.Until October 2005, Amtrak was paid $6 million a year to carry New Jersey Transit riders on some morning and evening rush trains between Trenton and Manhattan. New trains, including the multilevel cars, were supposed to make the subsidy unnecessary.The 11-car multilevel train has 1,485 seats, 105 more than in a 12-car single-level train. The multilevel cars, though, do not have three-seat benches that some commuters avoid because they do not want to sit between two other riders.“Every seat is useable and desirable,” Mr. Stessel said, adding that both single-level and multilevel trains are running at around 95 percent capacity during peak hours on lines running into Manhattan.Riders on one recent run from Trenton to New York gave the new cars two thumbs up, particularly the larger windows, extra legroom and cleaner floors and restrooms.“I hope they replace the rest of the cars with these,” said Nick Sheremetta, who has commuted from Hamilton to New York for 27 years.The big drawback, he and other riders say, are the luggage racks, which barely fit a briefcase. There are separate areas for luggage, but that comes in lieu of extra seats.Some train advocates are concerned that heavier trains take more time to speed up and slow down, which can lengthen commuting times on lines like the Morris & Essex, where stations are closer together than on the Northeast Corridor Line.“The bilevels just can’t accelerate as fast as the single levels, and that means the schedules will be longer,” said Albert L. Papp Jr., who runs the New Jersey Association of Railroad Passengers. “They ride very, very well, which is good. But they are rolling apartment buildings.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','“Just wondering how much of an expert he is,” he added.Inside the warehouse, you could tell the curators by their white cotton gloves. They all seemed to be wearing them; it didn’t matter if they were dressed in suit and tie or blue overalls. The cops, meanwhile, wore latex gloves, if they wore gloves at all. There were uniformed officers standing guard at the doors, as clear a case as Ransome had ever seen of shutting the stable door — and typical of Hendricks, of whom there was no sign as yet, much to Ransome’s relief. He didn’t want Hendricks asking him what he was doing there. Any lie would do, but Ransome doubted his colleague and adversary would believe them.I’m walking all over your investigation, Hendricks, he said to himself. And at the end, I’ll be right and you’ll be wrong, and I’ll be the one staring promotion in the face. . . .The three unlocked vaults were still open, or had been reopened this morning. Plenty of paintings were still left inside. The ones that had been taken would be allowed home only after fingerprinting was complete. They had already been declared unharmed and genuine — verifications made by Professor Gissing. And this led to another query in Ransome’s mind: Why abandon the van? He knew the glib answer: the gang was disturbed and they panicked. Maybe they’d been transferring the paintings from the van to a car; a motorist became suspicious and phoned the police. The alarm had already been raised after a guard at the warehouse noted the van’s license plate as it was speeding away, so the thieves dropped everything and fled. To Hendricks, this all made sense.But not to Ransome.Abandoning the van? Yes, fine. The police were already on the lookout for it. Fleeing the scene? Well, maybe . . . but why not take the paintings? Even if only one or two, tucked under an arm? They reckoned on somewhere between 6 and 10 men involved. And only eight paintings in total, none of them larger than 5 feet by 4, even in their frames. Why leave them? After all that meticulous planning and the perfect execution. . . . Were these the sort of criminals who’d be panicked by a passing motorist? They were carrying guns — so what could possibly have scared them?The more Ransome thought about it — and he had spent much of a sleepless night doing little else — the less sense it made. His conclusions were simple: no inside job and no panic.So here he was, giving up his Sunday morning to examine the scene and maybe ask a few questions and glean a few facts of his own. He looked into the CCTV room. This was where the “hostages” had been held, told to keep their eyes closed. Why? From the descriptions of the gang, it was obvious they had all been wearing disguises, yet for some reason the tour party had to be herded into the control room and made to crouch down with eyes closed.Ransome peered through the window, the window that gave a clear view of the warehouse interior and the route the gang would have taken between the vaults and the loading bay, where their van was parked.“There was something they didn’t want you to see,” he muttered to himself. The drawstring blinds were open now, but he knew from reports that the gang had closed them. “Something they didn’t want you to see,” he repeated with a slow, steady nod. And found himself staring at a face through the window, a new arrival.Ransome left the room. “Professor?” he said, proffering his hand.“You have the advantage of me,” Gissing said, returning the handshake.“Good for you.” Gissing was making to move off.“Just wondered if I could have your take on things, sir,” Ransome said quickly. “Bungled robbery . . . someone on the inside . . . is that how you read it?”Gissing folded his arms and looked thoughtful. “I dare say more fanciful scenarios exist, but then that’s not my job.”“So what is your job, if you don’t mind me asking?”“I was invited here by Alasdair Foy.”“The very same. He seems to think I may be able to help pinpoint any gaps in the holdings of 19th- and 20th-century Scottish paintings.”“You know the stock here then, sir?”“But you are an expert?”“Mr. Foy seems to think so.”“I’m sure he’s right.” Ransome took a step back. “I’d best leave you to it. Looks like the inventory’s well under way already.”For the first time, Gissing seemed to notice the activity around them.“It was due to happen in a few weeks anyway,” Ransome added.“So it was,” Gissing answered in an undertone. To the detective’s mind, some of the blood was leaving the old man’s face, headed who knew where.The two paintings, both by Monboddo, were still propped up on one of the sofas in Mike Mackenzie’s apartment. Mike could hardly bear to tear his eyes away from the portrait of the artist’s wife, the work he’d coveted and now possessed.“Shouldn’t those be tucked away somewhere?” Allan Cruikshank asked.“What have you done with yours?”“They’re under the desk in my study.”“You think there’s a chance the cops will miss them there if they come looking?”“What the hell else can I do with them?”Mike just shrugged. Allan looked awful. He kept wandering over to the window and peering down toward the parking lot, as if fearing the imminent arrival of flashing blue lights. Mike had made him peppermint tea, which Allan said he couldn’t remember asking for. He held the mug in both hands anyway, as if he were worried about spillage.“Ever read any Poe?” he asked now. “ ‘The Tell-Tale Heart’?”“It’s splashed across the TV and the papers!”“So what? We just have to hold our nerve. A few days, and it’ll all be over.”“How can you say that? We’ll still know what we did!”“Keep it down, Allan,” Mike advised. The apartment was in a new building; no telling how much the neighbors downstairs could hear.“You should hide those,” Allan wailed, putting down the mug so he could wave an arm toward the paintings on the sofa.“Anyone asks, they’re copies,” Mike said soothingly. “You could do the same: stick your paintings on a wall where you can see them . . . might calm you down. Whole point of this exercise was the pleasure of owning a masterpiece or two. Gissing will put everyone’s mind at rest today — nothing missing, the stolen paintings recovered. After that, the media interest will disappear in a puff of smoke.”“I wish I could disappear in a puff of smoke. . . . ” Allan headed for the window again. “What about this detective you mentioned?”“I wish I hadn’t,” Mike muttered to himself.“He’s already on our trail,” Allan persisted.“He’s got nothing. Even if he thinks something fishy’s going on, how’s he going to prove it?”But Allan was not to be comforted. “What if I give mine back? Or just abandon them somewhere?”“Good thinking — then they’ll know the ones they found in the van are copies, despite what the esteemed professor has told them.”Allan clenched his fists in front of him. “You take them, then. I’ll give you my paintings. I can’t sleep with them in the house!”Mike thought for a moment. “O.K., how about if you bring them here, and I’ll look after them for a few days or maybe even a week or two, just until you start to feel good about them?”“As long as we’re agreed: I’m holding them for you, not taking them from you.” He watched Allan nod enthusiastically. “And we don’t tell anyone else?” he added, to another nod.Mike didn’t want anyone knowing Allan was buckling. If Chib Calloway found out. . . . Best not to think about it; Chib already had his suspicions. Meantime, Mike had problems of his own, because now Chib had given his painting a small, ugly Utterson to some Scandinavian debt collector, along with Mike’s full name. And who the hell could tell where that might lead?“I’d never grass you up, Mike,” Allan was saying. “You know that, right? I mean, we’re friends, always will be. That’s right, isn’t it, Mike?”Allan gave a sickly grin. His face was pasty, coated with perspiration. “You’re always in control, Mike, always got answers . . . one of the things I like about you. You really enjoyed it yesterday, didn’t you? Liked being in charge?”“It was a buzz, Allan,” Mike conceded. Yes, but meeting the debt collector had been another kind of buzz altogether, one that informed Mike that he was playing with the big boys now.Allan had collapsed into an easy chair. It rocked him to and fro as he held his head in his hands.Friends . . . always will be. . . .You never could tell.When Westie checked at the A.T.M., the money was in his account. Paid in full for services rendered: eight good likenesses and true, which were now busy fooling the world into thinking the heist had failed. Just because he could, Westie withdrew 400 quid and marched with it to the cafe, where Alice was sitting in front of a stack of papers.“Front page of most of them,” she squealed at him.“Tell the whole cafe,” he whispered, before reaching over to kiss her. When he drew back, she saw the bank notes fanned out across the table and gave another squeal, louder this time.“Know what it feels like?” she eventually asked, having pocketed most of the cash. “A Tarantino film — we’re the young lovers who’ve gotten away with it!”He couldn’t help grinning, but he had a warning too: “We don’t go splurging — the money’s for putting you through film school. Just promise me you won’t go turning this into your first screenplay.”She reached across the table and hugged him, breaking off as the young waitress — was she Polish? — came to take their order. Afterward, Alice joked that for once they could afford to leave a tip. Westie winked at her and settled into reading about his exploits. They kept swapping papers, ordered more coffee, happy to see the morning become afternoon . . . until Westie noticed that Alice had stopped reading and was staring out of the window instead.She gave a shrug, seemed to be considering her response, then turned toward him and leaned her elbows on the table, chin resting on her palms.“I was just wondering,” she began, as if musing aloud, “why they all got two paintings apiece and you only got one.”“The guy who supplied the muscle only got one,” he corrected her.“But he wasn’t there, was he? Look at the work you put in: all those days and nights. . . . ”“But then you went on the raid, switched the paintings. . . . You said so yourself, Professor Gissing was taking forever to swap those frames. It was down to you, Westie, and you came good.” She tapped the topmost newspaper. “Says here some of the artists would fetch high six figures. High six figures,” she repeated, “and we end up with one lousy DeRasse.”“One of our favorite painters,” he reminded her. Alice just made a face, and it was one Westie recognized: she was not going to be convinced.“It just seems unfair, Westie, that’s all I’m saying.”“Bit late to do anything about it,“ he pressed.Her eyes met his, and he felt skewered by them. “Is it?” was all she said.Next week: Chib Calloway pays Mike an unexpected — and disconcerting — visit.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','By now a wholehearted fan of Fearnley-Whittingstall (if not of hogget or mutton), I decided it was time to brave the first half of the book. And there it was that I found the heart of his mission. Passionate, dogmatic and entirely unforgiving, he is determined to change the way we farm, cook and eat meat. Sustainable-meat production is a growing conversation throughout Europe and the United States, but the tenor of that conversation varies wildly from country to country.In America, it is the health of the consumer — read: eater — that has inspired the huge interest in (and business of) “natural” and organic meat production. Shoppers will reach deeper into their wallets for their own benefit, but perhaps less so on behalf of the slaughtered animal they hope to cook that night. In Britain, sustainable animal husbandry has taken on a moral imperative, and the well-heeled British consumers spend either out of noble compassion or to relieve their carnivore’s guilt.In his Meat Manifesto, Fearnley-Whittingstall corners the reader: “Are you,” he demands, “among the millions of consumers putting pressure on farmers to produce mountains of cheap meat of dubious quality, by dubious means?” I thought I had perhaps passed this test, as I try to buy organic meat whenever possible, but I flat-out failed his next question. Have the animals you’ve consumed “lived well? . . . Have they been cared for by someone who respects and enjoys their contact with them?” Guilty, I read on. His argument is one we all know but perhaps don’t always adhere to: buy locally, know the farmers, visit their farms, ask questions, be involved, change the landscape of meat production one demand at a time. And best of all, cook well.You should never taste a dish and feel like shouting: “You mean an animal died for that?” Failure to cook meat well, it would appear, is an unforgivable sin. Moral intimidation is undeniably part of Fearnley-Whittingstall’s plan. But it’s his almost academic thoroughness on everything from animal husbandry to curing meats, from hanging beef to skinning a rabbit, from stuffing a turkey (don’t) to finding theYou begin to believe that it will help to make bad meat — and bad meals — a thing of the past. But despite Fearnley-Whittingstall’s strenuous efforts, there remains something a little paradoxical about this book. All those excellent recipes make you want to cook more, not less, meat — and that really isn’t to any cow’s advantage so far as I can see.1. Season the pork with salt, pepper and a little grated nutmeg. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan and gently brown the pork, turning it occasionally so it is lightly colored all over. Remove from the heat.2. In a casserole or saucepan just large enough to fit the pork, melt the butter over medium heat. Add a third of the hot milk and the brown sugar and stir until the sugar dissolves. Transfer the pork to the casserole, pour in the remaining hot milk until it almost covers the meat and bring it to a simmer. Lightly scrunch the bay leaves and thyme and add them, along with the lemon zest and a few gratings of nutmeg. Cover with a lid, leaving a slight gap, and cook at a very gentle simmer, so the surface is undisturbed. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, during which time the milk will curdle and form a rice-pudding-like crust.3. Remove the pork from the pan, cut it into thick slices and set a few slices on each of 6 plates. Spoon the crusty, milky curds from the pot over the meat. Top with the thinner, milky gravy. Serves 6.1. Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil in a large casserole. Add the carrot, onion and celery, and sweat over low heat, until tender. Add the thyme, bay leaves, garlic, tomato paste, wine, and broth, along with all but a few pinches of the zests and a tablespoon of each juice. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer.2. Meanwhile, season the lamb with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in a separate large sauté pan and brown the shanks on all sides. Add the shanks to the casserole and cover. Transfer to the oven and cook until the meat is completely tender, about 2 1/2 hours.3. Remove the shanks from the pan and keep warm. Skim the fat from the surface of the sauce. Reduce the sauce to the desired consistency. Stir in the reserved citrus juices and season to taste with salt and pepper.

"'07-07-08,'0','“A Raise Won’t End Poverty,” by Jill Jenkins (Op-Ed, July 1), is another sad note in perpetuating the myth that increasing the minimum wage is bad for small business.I own a small landscaping business in Westchester and have raised my employees’ salaries every year for the past five years and it has not hurt my business one iota. In fact, I feel as though I have contributed to a raise in the standard of living for my employees, and yes, I have raised prices a bit to cover this.Jill Jenkins argues that the average household with a minimum wage worker earns $53,370. But averages are skewed by a few very high earning families at the top — the average salary of nine families making $10,000 and one making $410,000 is $50,000.Jared Bernstein, former deputy chief economist for the Department of Labor, testified before Congress that only 3 percent of the benefit of a $1 minimum wage increase goes to the top 10 percent of earners, while 29 percent goes to families in the lowest 10 percent of earners (average income $11,700) and 53 percent to the lowest 30 percent.Furthermore, recent growth in the number of small businesses, employment and payroll are all greater in high minimum wage states than low minimum wage states.'"

"'07-07-08,'0','In your July 1 editorial “It’s July 1, So Pay Up,” you stated, “And in a boon to the trucking industry, the Legislature voted a few months ago to exempt diesel fuel” from the gross receipts tax.This is not a boon to the trucking industry, since the gross receipts tax has been replaced by an increase in the Connecticut excise tax from 26 cents to 37 cents per gallon.Federal law requires truck owners to reimburse states for miles traveled in that state. Out-of-state trucking companies paid miles based on 26 cents per gallon but not on the most recent 15 cents per gallon gross receipts tax. The gross receipts tax is not an excise tax but a special hidden tax originally implemented to clean up contaminated petroleum sites.The new legislation makes for a level playing field for both in-state and interstate trucking companies.Connecticut continues to have one of the highest combined state diesel fuel and gasoline taxes in the nation.

"'07-07-08,'0','In Millwood, Mr. Kavy and Mr. Parkis say the stone house could provide housing for four bachelors, including, perhaps, Mr. Parkis. They have had an architect draw up plans free of charge for converting the interior and are willing to raise the necessary funds, which they estimate at more than $200,000 even if Habitat for Humanity pitches in. They figure that all those well-paid professionals moving in among Millwood’s 1,800 families can afford to pony up.But the five commissioners who run the Millwood Fire District don’t want the headaches of a landlord and have too much on their plate right now to supervise a renovation. Their priority is building a firehouse to replace decrepit Station No. 1 in downtown Millwood. Anyone who has ever lived through a kitchen renovation can sympathize. Still, said the chairman, Anthony Olenik, the commissioners are willing to listen because they are achingly aware that the force is shrinking.“Depending on the time of day, we only have five or six guys,” he said. “After college we lose them. They can’t afford to live here, so they move away.”But if younger volunteers are to replenish the force, time, as they say, is of the essence. Mr. Parkis, a six-footer who is studying at Westchester Community College, lives in nearby Ossining with a disabled mother, who will soon move in with his sister in Brewster, compelling him to find new quarters. If he can’t find something near Millwood, he may quit. Mr. Kavy, too, worries about leaving Millwood once he finishes college. Four volunteers have already moved to Rockland County, Connecticut and Maryland. Of the remaining 60, half live outside Millwood, in paging distance but not always close enough to help contain a blaze. Mr. Parkis recalls one recent house fire fought with only one truck because no one was available to drive a second.The two brothers-in-arms have relished the few years spent as members of a corps that responds to 300 calls a year — car accidents, flooded basements, even the occasional smoke alarm with a defective battery. Mr. Parkis remembers as a boy being enchanted by the volunteers’ rough camaraderie and by rituals like the extended ladders with flags aloft that punctuate a firefighter’s funeral. He recalls the satisfaction he felt two years ago steadying a young man who was gasping for air in a car at the bottom of an embankment.“I took his hand and put it on my chest so he could breathe with me,” he said, “and that calmed him down until I could get him some air.”Or the time a few months ago when a 20-ish woman in a crumpled car had stopped breathing and he reached her with an oxygen mask.“The feeling that I may have saved somebody’s life is pretty cool,” he said.Three years ago, at 17, Mr. Kavy rescued three small children from a car that had rolled off an ice-slicked Taconic Parkway and landed in a stream. He worked much of the time in freezing waist-high water. Mr. Kavy said he was inspired to perform such feats by his brother-in-law, who once pulled a woman out of a burning building.“Just the thought of going into a building for someone you don’t know is pretty cool,” he said.Keeping these unassuming heroes on a firefighting force that badly needs them would be pretty cool too.'"

"'07-07-08,'0','Over all on the South Fork for the first quarter of 2007, the number of sales declined 14 percent in Southampton and 3 percent in East Hampton, but sales of properties for more than $10 million keep going up.There were 36 such sales in the Hamptons in all of 2006, one of the most lucrative years for high-end sales, according to Suffolk Research Service, a company that tracks East End real estate transactions.It looks as if 2007 is keeping pace, with nine sales above $10 million in the first quarter and, in May and June, three exceptionally pricey sales on Meadow Lane alone in Southampton — two in May for more than $30 million and another in June for $23.8 million.A home on Highland Terrace, the same street as the property to be auctioned, but not fronting Sagaponack Pond, is now listed at $19.995 million. That 18,000-square-foot house was the setting for a charity-benefit event last year for which interior designers staged its rooms, although it is being sold without those furnishings.Another 26-acre subdivision on Highland Terrace, but not on the pond, includes six two-acre lots, being offered at $7.995 million each, and 14 acres of preserved agricultural land. The whole subdivision is also for sale, for $49.995 million.Susan Breitenbach, the broker with Corcoran in Bridgehampton who represents the property, declined to identify the developer, but said, “There was so much interest when he bought it that he decided that he would put it back on the market.”The scarcity of land south of Montauk Highway has driven up both waterfront and inland prices for property near Sagg Pond, Ms. Breitenbach said, using the shorthand name for the pond.Two years ago, Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive of Warner Music Group, paid $31 million for four acres “south of the bridge” that spans the pond near the ocean, according to Paul Brennan, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Southampton, who handled the sale. About three years ago, Millard S. Drexler, chief executive of the clothing retailer J. Crew, bought six acres on the pond near the ocean for $18.5 million, Mr. Brennan said.Mr. Brennan has intimate knowledge of the parcel up for auction. His father, John Brennan, owned and operated a potato farm on that land and more than 40 acres around it.The property, which includes a ranch-style home that Ms. Saatchi said would probably be torn down by a new owner, is actually two 2.4-acre lots. Both have a waterfront border, one with 150 feet and the other 200 feet.“It’s not primo, but it’s nice,” Mr. Brennan said of the property, citing its relatively lesser location on the neck of the gourd-shaped pond. The pond itself connects with the ocean on the south. Nevertheless, it has good light and sunset views. The land is also bordered by an agricultural preserve, which cannot be developed, and an as-yet-undeveloped lot, Ms. Saatchi said.Sagaponack Pond, which is in the town of Southampton, separates Bridgehampton on its west side and Sagaponack on the east side. Sagaponack is known on the East End as the village with the “most expensive ZIP code in the U.S.” for its ranking in the Forbes magazine 2006 list (Bridgehampton ranked 25th). Land on the roundest part of the pond, which is closest to the ocean, brings in the highest prices.“Waterfront in the belly of Sagg Pond probably goes for as much as the ocean,” said Judi Desiderio, a broker and part owner of Town & Country Real Estate. She and Mr. Brennan estimated the value of the land at $12 million to $15 million.Chris Burnside, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens in Bridgehampton, put the high estimate at $18 million, but said he thought the owners, five grandchildren of Jack and Helen Swords, who bought the lots from the elder Mr. Brennan in 1961, were looking for $25 million. “It’s been unofficially on the market for years now,” he said.Prospective bidders will be offered tours and a package with title documents, surveys, tax maps and a contract of sale. Each bidder must submit a sealed bid along with a check for 10 percent of its value. On July 18, the sellers will open the bids and select the highest, if it’s high enough, Ms. Saatchi said.Some say that having the bids sealed and giving the sellers an easy out blunt the competitive drive of an auction. “There’s no emotion in it,” Mr. Brennan said. “There’s no bidding-up process, so the benefit of having an auction is lost.”Lawrence Porter, a broker in the Westhampton Beach office of Brown Harris Stevens, concurred. “It’s a total marketing ploy, in my opinion,” he said. Without a price that the seller must accept, he added, “what are you bidding on?”But Ms. Saatchi defended the approach. In a conventional real estate listing, she said, a buyer negotiates with the seller, typically offering less than the asking price and raising it to some final limit. But in an auction, the buyer is competing with other buyers and has only one chance to outbid the others.Mr. Brennan and Mr. Burnside are two of a group of brokers skeptically awaiting the outcome of the event. Neither man thinks it will end with a sale.“They’re not saying what the price is,” Mr. Burnside said of the owners, “but I don’t think they’re going to let it go for less than $20 million. And you have to buy the two lots together. It’s a lot of money.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Unlike Mr. Lawrence, who retired on July 1, Mr. Mulvey spent 28 years with the Nassau police before retiring in 2001 to become a security consultant. His appointment is subject to the approval of the County Legislature, which is scheduled to vote on Monday.“Although Lawrence really seemed to be concerned about cops and police work, it was a mistake to choose someone out of the department,” said Lt. Gary N. Learned, president of the Superior Officers Association, which represents police officers with the rank of sergeant and above.Lieutenant Learned said that it took years to learn the commissioner’s job and that the department had not made many advances in areas like increasing the number of personnel and updating facilities while Mr. Lawrence and John Haviken, a deputy commissioner who also came in from New York City, gained experience.For example, Lieutenant Learned said, the Bureau of Special Operations, which handles hostage situations and other crises, was critically low in manpower. Also, he said, the department’s firing range was severely in need of repair.“Now, we will hopefully go back to being more innovative and responsive to the needs of the residents and be able to apply the resources that we have to fill those needs,” Lieutenant Learned said.Mr. Mulvey said he expected his first weeks at work to be filled with listening and observing. His priorities, he said, are clear.“Morale is the first thing out of the box, because that has to improve,” he said. “The key is there has been too much rancor and ill will. We have to work together.“One of the themes that I am excited about is we have continued to suppress crime. We can increase morale and add the component of training and discipline. Training, discipline and morale equals more productivity. We can do great things by just lifting morale.”Mr. Mulvey said he had other plans as well. “I think there are untapped resources,” he said. “My background is different than other commissioners. I had some fiscal management duties in the past and have gained quite a bit of experience.”He said he believed that the department could exercise fiscal conservatism and provide better service. “I think you can get improved performance and not necessarily spend money on it,” Mr. Mulvey said.Working closely with the commissioner will be Anthony W. Rocco, a 39-year Nassau police veteran who remains chief of department.“I think we want to continue in the areas we have had success, such as crime suppression, and continue in the most effective way possible, cutting costs and, at the same time, taking advantage of new technology that is coming in so fast,” Chief Rocco said.'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Historical volatility bears him out: he says that since 1993 the annualized standard deviation of returns, a customary measure of volatility, has been 22 to 23 percent in emerging markets, versus 13 to 14 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. It takes an iron constitution to tolerate markets that bounce around nearly twice as much as the familiar domestic counterpart.There’s another important reason for investing abroad. In an increasingly globalized world, says Michael J. Hogan, executive vice president, chief investment officer and head of equity investments at Delaware Investments, it’s high time that people shed their home-country bias in stocks, a preference that investors exhibit throughout the world.He favors an asset allocation based on the market capitalization of global equity markets: 45 percent domestic, 45 percent developed international markets and 10 percent emerging markets. For investors who can’t stomach such a big allocation abroad, he recommends that they divide whatever international exposure they have between developed and emerging markets in proportion to those markets’ total capitalizations. That works out to about 78 percent in developed markets and 22 percent in emerging ones.Mr. Hogan says integration of the global economy is making a company’s country of origin less important. For example, an investor in the United States who is considering an investment in Ford Motor or General Motors can no longer look at them in isolation. “The competitors are not just domestic anymore,” Mr. Hogan said. “You had better have a good idea about what is going on at Honda and Toyota.” It’s the same story in most other industries, too.Although Mr. Hogan acknowledges the risks often found in emerging-market economies — poorly defined property and legal rights; underdeveloped financial markets and banking regulation; and, in some cases, greater corruption — he says that markets do a good job of discounting for those risks in stock prices. And emerging markets can add spice to an investment portfolio.“It’s like pepper,” Mr. Hogan said. “I would never eat it on its own, but pepper in the right dose in a spaghetti sauce tastes great.”To James Donald, a managing director at Lazard Asset Management and portfolio manager of the Lazard Global Total Return and Income fund, emerging markets have lost some of their zest, relatively speaking, compared with five or six years ago. Back then, long-term and reasonably aggressive investors could justify having 35 to 40 percent of their international exposure in emerging markets, but today he suggests a range of 10 to 30 percent, depending on one’s time horizon and tolerance for volatility.“The rates of return on the emerging markets are probably going to continue to be higher than on developed markets,” Mr. Donald said, “but they are not going to have as big an advantage as in the past.”Emerging markets can offer more than just higher growth and geographic diversification. Investors can gain more exposure to commodities than they do in developed markets. And emerging markets also offer much exposure to technology, through companies based in places like South Korea, Taiwan, India and even Israel.Lazard doesn’t aim for specific exposures to individual countries because it uses a bottom-up approach to stock-picking, looking for the best combination of valuation and profitability. The approach leaves Mr. Donald’s mutual fund portfolio with weightings in Brazil, Indonesia, Egypt, Israel, Turkey, South Africa and India, that are above those of the MSCI emerging-markets index.In addition to the obvious political risks — now exemplified by nationalization under the populist left-wing government in Bolivia, the constitutional crisis over official secularism in Turkey and the recent military coup in Thailand — Mr. Donald said he was concerned that a long-simmering dispute between rich and poor nations over trade barriers could boil over if the Doha round of trade talks, initiated by the World Trade Organization five years ago, finally fails.Poor countries, he said, “feel that their agricultural industries are not being given a chance to thrive because of the policies of the rich countries.” Emerging markets that depend on export-led growth have the most to lose from restraints on world trade.Although George Evans, senior vice president and director of international equities at OppenheimerFunds, remains a firm believer in the long-term growth of emerging markets, he also worries that valuations have become stretched, especially in China.“In the first quarter of 2003, emerging markets were on low valuations of somewhat depressed earnings,” he said. “They are now up a lot on higher earnings. We are probably in the seventh inning of an emerging-markets cycle.”As portfolio manager of the Oppenheimer International Growth fund, Mr. Evans has pared his emerging-markets exposure to a relatively low 9.6 percent, concentrated in India, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico, where he says he still finds high-quality companies at reasonable prices.And Mr. Evans has additional indirect exposure to the emerging markets through natural resource companies like Rio Tinto, the mining giant. He favors plays on luxury goods, too, including LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Richemont and Porsche, which, while based in developed markets, benefit from purchases by the newly rich in emerging markets. In the developed markets, he sees better value among large-capitalization stocks than in small- or midcap stocks. And after several years when value stocks have delivered superior returns, he thinks that growth stocks are cheap, too.“The premium that one has to pay for growth stocks over value stocks is lower than it has been for a long time,” Mr. Evans said. “That’s where we see an opportunity right now.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','Now the Hammer is discovering how much that good will is worth in a marketplace where so many collectors are competing for the same artworks and so many museums are competing for the same collectors. Visitors can judge early results by checking out the “Hammer Contemporary Collection: Part Two” show, a sampling of recent acquisitions that runs through Aug. 12.The process of collection building started in earnest two years ago, when Ms. Philbin hired Gary Garrels, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as her deputy director and chief curator and entrusted him with overseeing contemporary acquisitions.When Mr. Garrels arrived, the Hammer had a few core collections under its umbrella, including some 100 paintings and drawings from Mr. Hammer and the numerous prints, drawings and rare books that make up the U.C.L.A. Grunwald Center for the Graphic Art, a university study center. But in terms of contemporary art, the Hammer was operating more like a kunsthalle, a temporary home for a constantly changing roster of exhibitions.This model has a particular set of challenges, said Jill Medvedow, director of the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. “With a kunsthalle-type space, you have the risk of being viewed in many ways as a movie theater, only as good as what’s currently on view,” she said. “If you’re trying to build an audience, interest, affection and investments, one thing that helps is to build a sense of attachment by giving visitors artworks they can fall in love with and return to again and again.”Ms. Medvedow has faced this problem herself, as her museum had no permanent collection until five years ago. At that point the board resolved to begin collecting judiciously, she said, “focusing on art and artists out of I.C.A.’s own exhibition history, starting with the 21st century.” The institute now owns about 40 works, including installations by Cornelia Parker and Christian Jankowski, all received as donations.The Hammer developed another strategy. Building on their own expertise and the Grunwald Center’s strengths, Ms. Philbin and Mr. Garrels chose to concentrate on drawings, photographs and works on paper, leaving the more expensive fields of painting and sculpture to play a supporting role. They are focusing on works made since 1945, with particular attention to the last decade, and showcasing artists from Southern California above other regions. (They decided, as a matter of policy, “not to buy straight from art schools,” Mr. Garrels said.)The goal is to be financially savvy “without sacrificing quality,” said Ms. Philbin, who was previously head of the Drawing Center in New York. “Unless you have millions and millions of dollars at your disposal, the art market doesn’t allow an institution to put together a noteworthy paintings and sculpture collection.”Mr. Garrels added: “Drawings can be closer to the artist’s process, to their way of thinking and working through issues. And they’re often the things that tend to get overlooked, so we have the chance to do something here that’s distinctive.”The Hammer can thank Bill Gates for its annual acquisition budget, which was about $600,000 last year and is expected to be closer to $800,000 going forward. In 1994, a few years after Mr. Hammer’s death, the museum put up for auction a gem from his collection: a 72-page scientific manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci covered with musings and drawings. It was called the Codex Leicester after one of its earliest owners, Thomas Coke, the first Earl of Leicester. Mr. Hammer renamed it the Hammer Codex. Now Mr. Gates presumably has naming rights: he bought it at Christie’s for $30.8 million.Since then the yearly interest on that money has been split. Half has supported Hammer exhibitions and collections. The other half was initially used to pay off a bank loan. When that loan was repaid last year, the money was freed up for acquisitions. In the future, Ms. Philbin hopes to use all of the interest for acquisitions, in keeping with industry guidelines on deaccessioning.So far Hammer curators have used this fund to buy nearly 100 works, including a set of drawings by Raymond Pettibon, a light box photograph by Jeff Wall and photographs by Sharon Lockhart from her Pine Flat series of portraits. Recently Mr. Garrels set his sights on several artists in his current exhibition, “Eden’s Edge.” And since organizing her exhibition in the spring, he has been pursuing a Vija Celmins drawing. (“It’s very high on our list and everybody knows it,” he said. “There just isn’t one available.”)Yet it’s clear that a curator can’t do all of this alone. The bulk of the acquisitions to date, nearly 500 pieces, have come from private collectors, who either donate holdings, buy works on behalf of the museum or buy through the museum’s Collections Committee. Formed two years ago as part of the Board of Overseers, this group has just started making its own purchases by pooling board dues to create a fund of about $100,000 a year.In April, after considering several options, the Collections Committee used this sum to buy a suite of 10 new drawings by Lari Pittman. “It was clear to everyone that this was an opportunity that might not come along again,” Ms. Philbin said. “Lari is such an important figure, a father figure, in Los Angeles. And this is a very ambitious piece, a suite of drawings with the same power and presence as his paintings.”In other cases, as with the Lockhart photographs, a committee member brings work to the museum’s attention. “The Collections Committee acts as a kind of sounding board for us,” Mr. Garrels said. “They are also our eyes and ears. It’s important to have supporters out there gleaning information, visiting studios, seeing shows.”Some of these supporters come from Hollywood. Members of the 23-member board include Peter Benedek and Jeremy Zimmer, both of United Talent Agency; Michael Rubel of Creative Artists Agency; George Freeman of William Morris; and the independent writer-director Phil Robinson. Having this concentration of industry types is no easy feat.“L.A. is a really hard nut to crack,” Ms. Philbin acknowledged. “What I’m told is that people in the industry feel that their wealth is fleeting.” She describes cultural philanthropy in the city as no longer in its infancy, but still in its adolescence.That’s surely one reason the museum has cultivated major supporters outside California as well. The legendary New York collectors Wynn and Sarah-Ann Kramarsky have given 60 drawings, including works by Sol LeWitt and Agnes Martin. The Aspen collectors Larry and Susan Marx, who have a second home here, have just rewritten their will to leave 64 works on paper to the museum. The promised gift includes drawings by Willem de Kooning, Brice Marden and Philip Guston, “things that we could never dream of buying,” Ms. Philbin said.Mr. Marx said the couple had many reasons for choosing the Hammer, starting with advice from a friend and fellow collector, Kent Logan. “He advised me early on: Just make sure wherever you give your collection, it’s important to them,” Mr. Marx recalled. “I think MoMA is a fabulous museum. But if we gave this to MoMA, it wouldn’t be important to them.”He also simply likes the Hammer team and its commitment to drawings. When Mr. Garrels suggested that he buy an early Guston drawing to round out his collection, Mr. Marx e-mailed an image to the curator before writing the check.Yet other collectors express doubt about the museum’s focus on works on paper, wondering whether it’s too narrow. One skeptic is Dean Valentine, a board member from Los Angeles. He began discussing the issue with Ms. Philbin when she was new to town, over a dinner at Lucques with Mr. Pittman and the collector Joel Wachs.They got to talking about the pros and cons of doing a paper-only collection. “Annie and Joel are very attracted to drawings, as am I,” Mr. Valentine said. But, he added, he also loves big, “ugly” things. “I thought collecting works on paper was too narrow a focus,” he said.So what happened when the Hammer decided to pursue this route? Last year Mr. Valentine and his wife, Amy Adelson, generously yet pointedly offered the museum about 40 recent sculptures, including unruly pieces by Liz Craft, Jason Rhoades and Nathan Mabry. “It’s been my theory that sculpture is the strongest body of work that has emerged out of L.A. in the last decade,” Mr. Valentine said. “And part of the reason for my gift, frankly, was to encourage them to broaden their view about what can be done.”This encouragement seems to be working. When Mr. Valentine offered his sculptures, the Hammer decided to make room for them. “It was definitely not the track we were traveling on, but it was very exciting,” Mr. Garrels said. “A great collection is always a matter of being both strategic and opportunistic. You go forward with a plan, and if a ball comes from left field, you grab it if you can.”Especially when that ball contains so many works of art. “You can’t create a collection with any heft or meaning by buying one painting by this artist and another by that artist,” Mr. Valentine said. “For a museum to have an impact, it needs voluminous donations. Museums at this point are collections of collections.”'"
"'07-07-08,'0','The key to their argument is the need to differentiate between two types of risk. While a short-term investor is equally worried about each type, a longer-term investor is primarily interested in just one of them. The researchers found that, though growth stocks have more total risk than value stocks, they have less of the kind that is of most concern to long-term investors.The first of the two kinds of risk is discount rate risk — which in some ways can be viewed as the risk that interest rates will rise. Growth stocks are particularly vulnerable to it, because their current valuations depend so much on the discounted value of their future earnings. The second kind of risk is that of economic trouble, or even catastrophe — what the researchers call cash-flow risk. They found that value stocks are more vulnerable than growth stocks to this type of risk.The researchers argue that most investors with very long time horizons — a decade or more — will be less interested in discount rate risk because it tends to be largely self-correcting. A growth stock whose price comes down because of higher interest rates will recover most of that loss when those rates decline again. By contrast, the researchers found that cash-flow risks tend to be much more enduring. Needless to say, a company that goes out of business will never recover.PROFESSOR CAMPBELL and Mr. Vuolteenaho offer this analogy: Risk is like cholesterol in that both have a “bad” variety and a “good” variety. Doctors are not particularly alarmed by a high total cholesterol level, if the bulk of it is the good variety. Similarly, the researchers argue, long-term investors shouldn’t be concerned about growth stocks’ apparently high levels of risk, because the bulk of it is the “good” variety, the discount rate kind.The analogy isn’t perfect, of course. For the short-term investor, both kinds of risk are equally bad. That’s because stocks over short periods don’t have a chance to recover from any losses generated by higher interest rates. It’s only over longer periods that the investor becomes more concerned with cash-flow risk than discount-rate risk.What does all of this mean for the choice of stock mutual funds in a retirement portfolio? An answer is provided by a study that has circulated for several months as an academic working paper. Titled “Optimal Value and Growth Tilts in Long-Horizon Portfolios,” it is by Luis M. Viceira, a finance professor at Harvard Business School, and Jakub W. Jurek, a Ph.D. candidate there. A version is at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=796207.Building on the research by Professor Campbell and Mr. Vuolteenaho, and assuming that the future will be like the past, Professor Viceira and Mr. Jurek calculated which allocations to growth and value funds will produce the greatest future returns, relative to the amount of risk incurred. They concluded that an investor whose time horizon is relatively short — just a year or two — should place almost all of his equity allocation in value funds. But unless he is eager to take on risk, an investor with a very long time horizon — more than decade, for example — should invest as much as half of his equity allocation in growth funds.The study by Professor Viceira and Mr. Jurek also illustrates the need to rethink the relationship between the short and long terms in the stock market. For years, many financial planners have made the implicit assumption that the long term can be viewed as a succession of short terms. The new study shows that this assumption is not always correct.'"

North Korea promised to shut down the reactor as part of an agreement with four neighboring nations and the United States, reached at six-way talks in China in February.Under the pact, North Korea agreed to freeze its plutonium production at the five-megawatt nuclear facility, and then to allow inspectors to monitor and verify its compliance. In return, the United States, China, South Korea and Russia agreed to provide North Korea with food and fuel aid. Japan is the sixth party to the pact.When a deputy director of the U.N. agency, Ollie Heinonen, visited the facilities at Yongbyon last month, “we agreed on the modalities that need to be taken to shut down these facilities, the four facilities there, with a view to eventual abandonment,” said the atomic agency’s director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, who spoke to reporters in Vienna after the board’s decision.'"

"'07-07-09,'1','HAVEN, Wis., July 8 (AP) — In the end, Brad Bryant was left with the biggest moment of his career — and the second-biggest final-round comeback in a United States Senior Open.Bryant shot a four-under-par 68 Sunday in stiff winds and searing 90-degree heat at Whistling Straits to take advantage of another collapse by Tom Watson and win his first senior major.Bryant, who started the day five strokes behind Watson, finished with a six-under total of 282 to win by three strokes over Ben Crenshaw. He was four ahead of Loren Roberts and five ahead of Watson.“I’ve always been a journeyman, and to come out here and beat a couple of the best players in the world on a day like today is near miraculous, actually,” said Bryant, who won only once in more than two decades on the PGA Tour. “I was pretty good.”Watson, who finished second in three of the previous five Senior Opens, shot one under on the front nine and began the back nine with a birdie to go to nine under for the tournament.But then came the collapse. Watson frittered away six strokes in five holes, a stretch that included two double bogeys.'"
"'07-07-09,'1','EVERETT, Wash., July 8 — Step aside Steve Jobs. You, too, “Ratatouille.” In a nation where pocket-thin technology and Hollywood movies have hyped their way to consumer obsession, an unlikely rival for the public imagination is trying to restore a retro literalness, and largeness, to the art of the product rollout.On Sunday, before nearly 15,000 employees and worldwide customers in a hangar here in this Seattle suburb, with 25,000 others watching remotely from a football stadium downtown, Boeing unveiled the 787 Dreamliner, its new long-distance, fuel-efficient jet, which already has $110 billion worth of orders for 677 planes.The arrival of the new plane — stuck together partly with temporary fasteners at the moment and scheduled for its first delivery next May — highlights what a striking counterpoint this part of the Northwest has been in a country where manufacturing jobs have long been in decline. The jet was presented on July 8, 2007 — 7-8-7 — with no shortage of corporate sheen.“We’re rolling her in, not out,” said Yvonne Leach, who has spent much of the last year coordinating publicity for Boeing for the plane’s debut. The smooth-sided, $155 million mix of carbon fiber and global subcontracting had a path to production that bears little resemblance to Boeing’s earlier locally produced aluminum planes, including the 747 jumbo jet first presented nearby nearly 40 years ago. The 787 is being assembled here, but many of its key parts were made around the world, a fact that has not gone over well with some local workers. Boeing says the new business model is necessary for the company to survive and reflects its increasingly global focus.For Western Washington, where aerospace employees have experienced a roller coaster of layoffs and hiring surges, the run-up to the 787 production has pushed aerospace employment close to 80,000 this year, adding another piece of good news to a region accustomed to growth in high-technology, cargo shipping, alternative energy and other areas.“We’re in the sweet spot,” said Michael J. Parks, who edits Marple’s Pacific Northwest Letter, a biweekly economic update. “We’re out of step with the national trends. We’ve got manufacturing jobs going up.”'"
"'07-07-09,'1','But that site, like the heliport’s current location, is also inside the boundaries of the park, and therein lies the nub of a dispute that has involved Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the State Senate.The trouble started in late May when a disgruntled helicopter operator, Michael Roth, sued the Hudson River Park Trust and the heliport operator. Mr. Roth has had a long-running dispute with the operator, Air Pegasus, and asked a federal court in Manhattan to shut the site down.The Friends of Hudson River Park agrees with Mr. Roth that the heliport is not legal, and is preparing its own lawsuit against the trust, Mr. Butzel said. He said his group is not satisfied by the promise to move the heliport, which handles as many as 100 takeoffs and landings a day.“You just get one helicopter after another zooming up the West Side,” he said. “We’d be very happy if the heliport went away altogether.”Mr. Butzel voiced his complaints before Saturday’s accident, which involved a sightseeing flight run by Liberty Helicopters, the biggest operator of tourist excursions from the heliport. The helicopter plunged into the river, but the pilot and seven passengers were unhurt.At the least, Mr. Butzel said, his group wants the heliport moved away from the park, which extends from West 59th Street to Battery Place, and banned from accommodating pleasure trips. Those were two conditions included in the Hudson River Park Act when it was written in 1998, he said.Then, the heliport was operating much as it is now, run by a company controlled by Alvin Trenk and his family. The Trenks’ lease expired in 2001, and since then, the trust has renewed it on a month-by-month basis.Mr. Butzel and other opponents of the heliport contend that those renewals violated the act, making the heliport an illegal operation for the last six years. But a spokesman for the trust, Christopher Martin, said last week that the existing heliport had been grandfathered under the park act.In a letter to Mr. Butzel in late May, Connie Fishman, the president of the trust, wrote that the site of the “new nontourism/nonrecreational heliport” would be where Pier 72 jutted into the river near 32nd Street. The pier would need to be rebuilt or replaced by a floating platform to accommodate a heliport.The trust has provided no timetable for the creation of a new heliport, leaving Mr. Butzel doubting that the park will be more peaceful anytime soon without a court order. “It’s apparent that unless we do something, people just sort of hang around and do what they want,” he said.Mr. Butzel said he had no doubt that a judge would rule that the current heliport must stop allowing sightseeing flights. He said he was less certain that a judge would order a complete shutdown of the heliport, because Mayor Bloomberg has argued that the city’s corporate executives need it.A spokesman for the mayor, John Gallagher, said last week that the city’s Economic Development Corporation was working with the trust to draw up a contract “that would transition the heliport to a location allowed” by the park act. “Until that occurs, the city believes it is important to find a compromise that avoids an interruption in corporate flights at the current location,” Mr. Gallagher said.But avoiding a complete shutdown may require legislative intervention in Albany. That’s where Mr. Bruno came in.In mid-June, the Senate Rules Committee, led by Mr. Bruno, the state’s most powerful Republican, introduced a bill that would amend the park act to allow the heliport to continue operating. The bill, which did not move out of the committee, would authorize the continued use of the heliport for charters, sightseeing and emergency purposes until a new heliport was built.It would also require the trust to put the contract for operating the West 30th Street Heliport up for competitive bids for the first time in more than two decades.The proposed legislation was the idea of the operators of Liberty Helicopters, which runs sightseeing tours and charters from the heliport, said Tom Yessman, the company’s chief executive. Mr. Yessman referred to the bill as “our legislation” and said that Mr. Bruno “basically tried to fix the problem” by introducing the bill to amend the park act.“The threat that the heliport might actually be shut down by court decree should motivate the Legislature and the governor to act,” said Randy Mastro, a Manhattan lawyer and former deputy mayor who is advising Liberty Helicopters. “If they don’t address this, the courts will, and the courts are being asked to shut down the heliport altogether.”The bill was introduced in the Senate Rules Committee just two weeks before Mr. Bruno got caught in a flap over his travels between Albany and Manhattan on state helicopters. Mr. Bruno has denied making improper use of the helicopters, saying that he needed the protection provided by State Police escorts.Mark Hansen, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno, said that Mr. Bruno had “no particular interest” in preserving the West 30th Street Heliport, which he and other officials, including Gov. Eliot Spitzer, use.'"
"'07-07-09,'1','But for Mauritanians, who have to get from one place to another in northern Mauritania without paved roads or planes, the train is the closest facsimile to a mass transit system, even if most of what passes for seating is in 10-foot high, open-air iron hoppers.“What else can I use?” asked Sidini Ould Ali, a 35-year-old schoolteacher from Zouerate after he climbed down from an iron-ore carriage one recent Saturday morning, coughing, exhausted and blackened by the load of mineral he rode on. He, his wife and two children wanted to spend the July school break in comparatively exciting Nouadhibou. “There is no plane, no buses, no trucks,” he said.For others, it is a good business proposition. “It’s for free,” said Mr. Cheikh, a merchant who was busy stacking sacks of goods a few hours later, waiting for the train to head back north. “You know I am a shopkeeper, and I make a lot of profit by transporting my goods for free.”The train’s operator, the government-controlled Société Nationale Industrielle et Minière, or SNIM, officially frowns on the hitchhikers. “It is not safe for people to be on the train,” said Ely Ould Abeilly, SNIM’s representative in Nouakchott, the capital. “If there were any other means, we would stop it. It is a very heavy train, and if it derails it can be a very big disaster.”Yet neither the threat of accident, the lack of comfort nor the prospect that their goats will leap out and be eaten by jackals deters travelers. At 11 a.m. sharp every day, the train materializes seemingly from nowhere, kicking up a late-morning dust storm after its 17-hour rumble through the Sahara at a top speed of no more than 31 miles per hour.The ore-blackened inbound passengers climb down off their perches on wagons brimming with ore and the train plods off to the harbor to dump its 22,000-ton load. An hour or more before it is due back, the outbound passengers gather at the whitewashed train station — dozens of them in donkey carts and cars, bearing cases of water and canned goods, bags of animal feed, blankets to ward off the frigid desert night air, goats, sheep, family pets, end tables, digital satellite dishes, you name it.Families stake out positions beside the railroad track, at courteous intervals from one another. Relatives and friends stand by, ready to assist in the boarding process.The instant the train approaches, at 2 p.m., passengers sprint to the cars, and a frantic rush begins to load people and goods into the hoppers.Bleating goats are hoisted into the air and yanked by their horns into the bins; bags of sand are handed up, to be used as bases for charcoal fires or as a form of toilet. After a 15-minute pause, the train lumbers away, some goods heaved in during the final seconds, others left behind with owners who failed to move fast enough.Its outbound riders are better off than their inbound counterparts because their containers are empty except for a patina of ore dust, the odd automobile or camel loaded in the harbor and whatever goods they have managed to load.Still, the journey is exquisite torture, the iron hoppers like ovens in the day and freezers at night. Privacy is nonexistent. Men have an option; when the train slows to a crawl as it passes through towns, some jump off, relieve themselves and race back before it speeds up again.Most Mauritanian women, who are prized here for their heft, are not up to such escapades. “Can’t you see how fat I am?” said Marième Mint Ahmed, who was traveling to visit her Zouerate relatives over the holiday. “You think I can jump out of the wagon every time the train stops to get something to drink or go to the bathroom?”A $4 ticket in hand, she battled her way into an enclosed passenger cabin that was equipped with a rudimentary toilet.Not that that would make the trip pleasant. “We are 75 for a cabin designed for 25 people,” she groused. “But at least we are not with the goats, sheep, dogs.”Western backpackers, as rare as thermal underwear here, are invariably nonplussed by the race to board.Hans Rossel, a Belgian travel writer and photographer who rode the train in 2003, advises trying to outrun the Mauritanians, with their heavy loads, to secure a spot on one of the wooden benches in the second-class passenger car.He was too slow up the ladder, he wrote, and a stout Mauritanian woman grabbed him by the neck, swung her hips and neatly bumped him into the sand. He wound up sharing the floor of a dark, windowless cabin with 150 people.“We probably would have had a better time in one of those iron buckets,” he wrote.'"

Parks, who edits Marple’s Pacific Northwest Letter, a biweekly economic update and outlook. “We’re out of step with the national trends. We’ve got manufacturing jobs going up.”Long before Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks revised Seattle’s identity as a new-economy city, Boeing was the new economy of an earlier era, and it was the region’s dominant employer. Aerospace remains a major force, but where it once supplied 1 in 10 jobs in the state (in 1990 there were almost 127,000 aerospace jobs), it now makes up less than 3 percent.“What’s happened is that Boeing keeps going up to these peaks and dropping down, meanwhile the rest of the economy is growing up around it,” Mr. Parks said.Today was Boeing’s day, however, and the company, like the local economy, emphasized that its future depends on diversity as it competes for a growing global market with its European rival, Airbus. Over the weekend, Boeing hosted journalists from Vietnam, Japan, New Zealand and France. Today, it broadcast the 787’s debut in nine languages, and Tom Brokaw was the master of ceremonies. Many of the guests of honor at the hangar were the international airlines, including ANA, whose order for 50 new planes was the first the company received.But the local connections still run deep. Down at Qwest Field in Seattle, Boeing enlisted a group of company retirees to greet guests who came to watch the debut on a giant television screen.“When we first talked about retirees going over there, we thought we needed about 10, then we got 20, then 30,” said Bob Lambert, 79, a retired Boeing engineer. “If they’d have said 60, we’d have had 60.”'"
"'07-07-09,'1','Many other companies have reacted with staff reductions, and newsrooms across the country — including those at The Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Boston Globe (which is owned by The New York Times Company) — are shrinking.Several factors, though, set The Journal apart from other newspapers, in ways that make cuts there more likely — including a slender profit margin that gives it less room to maneuver. While most major American papers have eliminated jobs in their news departments in recent years, The Journal has expanded as it added a Saturday edition and introduced features in print and online, so that its news staff stands at an all-time high of 760. And the paper is continuing to fill open positions.At the same time, Dow Jones has been looking to reduce its dependence on print advertising and emphasize its digital properties, like MarketWatch and Factiva.Traditionally, ad spending grew along with a growing economy, but no more. From mid-2005 to the end of 2006, ad revenue for the major newspaper companies increased barely 1 percent. The Journal was an exception, with ad revenue rising 8.8 percent in 2006 over 2005, but that was in large part because 2006 was the first full year that the Saturday Journal was published.So far, 2007 is shaping up much worse than even the dourest predictions, with ad revenue among the major newspaper companies down about 5 percent through May, and down 4.2 percent at The Journal (though its much smaller overseas editions have had healthy increases). Officials at The Journal say ad revenue is running tens of millions of dollars behind the projections made at the start of the year.And The Journal, like other financial publications, relies heavily on business-to-business advertising, which aims for corporate customers more than retail consumers.This sector — which pitches, say, overnight mail delivery and management consulting services — took a nose dive at the end of the dot-com era and has never really recovered.B-to-B advertisers, in particular, have moved their dollars online, especially those that sell computers and related equipment. The Internet allows them to pinpoint their audiences and gives them the space and flexibility to convey complicated messages.I.B.M., for example, was the top single advertiser in the print Journal in 2004, spending more than $41 million, but that fell to $17 million in 2006, when it was eighth-largest among the paper’s advertisers, according to estimates from TNS Media Intelligence. For the first five months of this year, I.B.M. fell to No. 34.Other publications — like The New York Times, Forbes and Fortune magazines — have felt the cutbacks at I.B.M. Its overall magazine and newspaper ad spending dropped to just under $37 million last year from $144.6 million in 2004, according to TNS — a faster rate overall than the percentage drop at The Journal.“Mass media, we still use it, but it’s become less and less something we rely on,” said Deirdre Bigley, I.B.M.’s vice president for worldwide advertising at I.B.M. “We still are very supportive of traditional media, but I’d say that our focus has gone to more Web properties.”Some other big advertisers have notably cut their spending in The Journal. Dell’s spending in the newspaper plummeted to barely $6 million last year from almost $26 million in 2005. But other companies increased Journal advertising. Microsoft spent roughly $32 million more in 2006 than it did in 2004, according to TNS data. Other advertisers like Exxon Mobil, Sprint and Allstate increased their spending as well.For most of this decade, advertising aimed at consumers has fared better than B-to-B, and The Journal has tried hard to capture more of that market, one reason the Saturday edition was created.But now consumer advertising — automotive and real estate, in particular — have sharply diminished or joined the growing exodus to the Web. Even so, there are plenty of other consumer advertisers, like packaged-goods and luxury-product companies that are keeping their offline spending high.In the first quarter of 2007, about 60 percent of Journal revenue came from B-to-B ads, and, in recent years, Dow Jones financial statements have warned that the company might rely too heavily on that.“B-to-B advertisers are early adopters, I think, to more targeted media online,” said L. Gordon Crovitz, executive vice president of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, in a telephone interview.Mr. Crovitz said he thought that B-to-B advertising would not return to the levels it reached during the Internet bubble of the late 1990s, but that his paper was well-positioned to sell both print and online ads. Last month, Dow Jones created a chief revenue officer post to manage online and offline sales in an integrated fashion, Mr. Crovitz said. And when Dow Jones sells Internet and print ads in a package, it typically collects 20 percent more revenue than when it sells them separately, he added.But executives at advertising and marketing agencies say it is unclear whether B-to-B advertising will stick with traditional print outlets in the long run. Spending on ads in business magazines and national newspapers fell 23 percent from 2001 to 2005, according to B-to-B magazine, which will release 2006 figures in the fall. In that same period, B-to-B advertising on the Internet was up 240 percent.B-to-B product messages are often more complex than ads about a new car or breakfast cereal, so B-to-B ads work particularly well online, where space for product specifications is unlimited, Ms. Bigley of I.B.M. said. B-to-B advertisers learn the Internet allows them to display more information than they ever could in print.“Since 2000, we’ve had continuous double-digit growth as far as investing in the Internet,” said Nancy Wiese, vice president for advertising at Xerox. “It’s coming from both print and television. It’s not that we’re growing budgets, unfortunately.”B-to-B messages are also aimed more at specific groups than consumer ads are, and the Internet allows for such precision. In consumer ads, “you’ll be talking to millions of people,” said Eduardo Conrado, vice president for global marketing and communications at Motorola. “On the B-to-B side, we are actually talking to a few thousand, and we know most of them.”While all advertisers want better measurement of their ads, the B-to-B niche has been particularly aggressive in demanding more data about their ads, said Mike Dukmejian, group publisher at Time Inc.’s business and finance network.“It is response-driven,” he said. “Whereas when you get into things like apparel and packaged goods, they are more committed to brands, and brand building is not about every single data point.”'"
"'07-07-09,'1','One reason Vodafone has experienced rapid growth in Kenya is that the formal banking sector reaches just 19 percent of the country’s 36 million people, the report said. An additional 8 percent of Kenyans have access to financial services only through savings cooperatives and microfinance institutions.The value of mobile technologies has benefited microlenders, too. Jamii Bora, the largest microfinance institution in Kenya, has more than 150,000 borrowers. The organization, whose name means “good families” in Swahili, began to experiment last year with mobile point-of-sale devices, magnetic-stripe cards and fingerprint authentication to take its remote branches online.“This year we rolled it out over the whole country,” said Ingrid Munro, the founder and manager of Jamii Bora. “We have about 200 point-of-sale machines now, and we expect to expand.”Geraldine O’Keeffe, director of implementation and support at Craft Silicon, the company that adapted point-of-sale devices for Jamii Bora, said, “Technology is changing the field of microfinance.”The system that Jamii Bora uses allows clients in the countryside to make loan repayments, receive disbursements and do other business electronically. Once clients log in with a fingertip, authenticating their identity, they are connected to a central database in Nairobi.In a system similar to the one Vodafone has set up, cash is paid and received through loan officers or sales agents in gas stations or shops, which settle their accounts with Jamii Bora.“This is the most inexpensive way of being linked,” Ms. Munro of Jamii Bora said. “Every loan officer and man on a bicycle is online with our central server in Nairobi. And at the end of each day, we know the cash position of each branch.”Ms. O’Keeffe of Craft Silicon said she had seen other attempts to improve microfinance technology fail because of the cost of communications. But with the advent in Kenya of GPRS, a new telecommunications protocol and data-transfer service, going online has become “infinitely cheaper,” she said.“To computerize rural branches,” she said, “is a massive project and a huge cost. So what Jamii Bora did instead was put the point-of-sale in the branches, and leapfrogged the need to computerize.”Craft Silicon expects to help Jamii Bora set up 700 more terminals in the next two months.The technology has allowed Jamii Bora to centralize operations and introduce a transparent accounting system to administer the loans and other services it provides, like health insurance. In doing so, the company said, it has increased efficiency and reduced the risk of fraud. If that means reducing its operating costs, making the organization more sustainable, Jamii Bora said it could lower the size of its average loan and still break even.“This technology has created so much excitement,” Ms. Munro said. “By being on the cutting edge of technology, we have the capacity of reaching the poor and remaining financially viable. What many organizations do is raise the interest rate.“We refuse to abandon the poor. Actually, we are the poor: all our staff are recruited from our members.”'"
"'07-07-09,'1','LOS ANGELES, July 8 — Facing slower-than-expected sales of its PlayStation 3 video game system, Sony said it would announce Monday that it planned to lower the price of its console in the United States by $100, to $500, effective Thursday. The lower price of the 60-gigabyte device comes as a rival system, the Microsoft Xbox 360, is inundated with reports of widespread product failures. Microsoft announced last week that it would spend up to $1.15 billion to repair the machines.The other rival system, Nintendo’s Wii, is hard to find in stores because the company miscalculated demand. Lines still form at stores that announce they have the product, and units are listed by sellers on Amazon.com at up to twice the suggested retail price of $250.Sony said it would also introduce an 80-gigabyte PlayStation for $600. It had discontinued a 20-gigabyte model earlier.Although PlayStation 3 is more technologically advanced than its rivals, sales have drastically trailed those systems. NPD Group, a market research company, said that as of May, Americans had bought 5.6 million units of Xbox 360, 2.8 million of Wii and 1.4 million of PlayStation 3.Since it began selling the PS3 last November, Sony has been criticized for setting the price higher than the competition and including expensive features that most consumers were not ready to use, like a Blu-ray high-definition DVD drive.'"

Combined spending was estimated at $135 million.Splenda, previously at Alchemy, part of the Lowe Worldwide division of Interpublic, was shifted to BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, which also picked up the creative assignments for Monistat and Stayfree. Those ads had been created by McCann Erickson Worldwide.Of the three other J.& J. creative accounts leaving McCann Erickson, the Band-Aid and Reach brands went to JWT, part of the WPP Group, and K-Y went to Mother. Trade publications have reported that J.& J. is likely to give JWT three other creative accounts from Alchemy — for Cortaid, Mylanta and Pepcid — with spending estimated at $70 million.The Nokia mobile phones group, in Espoo, Finland, chose Wieden & Kennedy for new assignments, as worldwide lead agency for creative and strategic work.Spending was estimated at $150 million to $300 million for the assignments, to be overseen by the agency’s London office. The office was also named to create campaigns for Visa International centered on the new Visa sponsorship of the World Cup; spending was estimated at $200 million.Refinery, Hatboro, Pa., an interactive marketing agency, was acquired by G2 Worldwide, New York, part of the Grey Global division of the WPP Group.

Ivanov, a Russian first deputy prime minister, called the planned factory a sign of the country’s appeal to investors. “We are attracting representatives of the best brands in the world,” he said.The Nissan plant will be the second opened by a Japanese automaker in Russia.

"'07-07-10,'0','“No, no, no, no,” Mr. McCain said. “I’d describe the campaign as going well. I’m very happy with it. People are free to make their own assessments. I think we’re doing fine.”When asked whether he intended to stay in the presidential campaign, he replied, “Of course.”Advisers to Mr. McCain also said the senator had no intention of quitting the race, and would continue with a campaign schedule that is to take him, among other places, to New Hampshire this weekend.Beyond the two resignations, Mr. McCain’s advisers said a third close friend and adviser, Mark Salter, was now taking a smaller role in the campaign, serving as an unpaid senior adviser. Mr. Salter is perhaps Mr. McCain’s closest staff member, and has cowritten books with him.Aides to Mr. McCain said that Rick Davis, who had served as the chief executive officer of the campaign, was now taking over as campaign manager. They said that move was likely to be announced later today.Some of Mr. McCain’s associates described the campaign as wracked by infighting, with Mr. Davis, who was with Mr. McCain when he ran for president in 2000, butting heads with Mr. Nelson, who was the political director for President Bush’s 2004 campaign. The associates said the infighting intensified in the aftermath of the announcement last week that the campaign had just $2 million left after spending at a rate of $1 million a week.At the time, Mr. McCain was forced to lay off 80 of the campaign’s 120 staff members. Mr. McCain’s associates said that more senior officials were expected to leave in the coming days as part of the upheaval.Mr. McCain’s advisers said that Mr. Nelson and Mr. Weaver told Mr. McCain on Monday about their plans to leave, and that Mr. McCain did not try to talk either of them into staying on.Neither Mr. Nelson nor Mr. Weaver immediately returned calls requesting comment. Both issued statements announcing their decisions and wishing Mr. McCain well.Mr. Nelson said, “I believe John McCain is the most experienced and prepared candidate to represent the Republican Party and defeat the Democratic nominee next year.”Mr. Weaver said, “It has been my honor and a distinct privilege to serve someone who has always put our country first. I believe that most Americans will come to the conclusion that I have long known there is only one person equipped to serve as our nation’s chief executive and deal with the challenges we face, and that person is John McCain.”Mr. McCain said he accepted their resignations “with regret and deep gratitude.”“Terry is a consummate professional, who has ably led this campaign through a challenging political environment,” he said. “John Weaver has been my friend and trusted counselor for many years, and to whom I am greatly indebted.”By any measure, the announcement of the departure of these two Republican strategists marks another huge complication for a candidate who just a year ago was viewed as the likely front-runner for the presidential nomination. Mr. McCain has far less money than two of his main rivals — Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Mitt Romney of Massachusetts — and has seen his standing decline in a series of recent polls, particularly after he became identified as a promoter of the immigration bill in Congress that was opposed by many Republicans.He has also girded for the expected entry into the race of Fred Thompson, the actor and former Tennessee senator, who has sought to appeal to conservative Republicans who have long been suspicious of Mr. McCain’s ideological credentials.'"
"'07-07-10,'0','NASA’s Dawn spacecraft, originally scheduled to head into space this past Saturday on a mission to visit two large asteroids, will now be launched in September. Bad weather and problems with an aircraft and a ship needed to observe the launching first prompted NASA on Friday to push back the launching date by a week, to July 15. On Saturday, NASA decided on the longer postponement, worrying that further delays could complicate the launching of the Mars Phoenix lander, which must get off the ground by Aug. 25, before Earth and Mars move out of alignment for two years. The delay in launching the Dawn craft will add $20 million to $25 million to the mission’s $446 million cost, but will not affect its science goals in visiting the asteroids Vesta and Ceres.'"

"'07-07-10,'0','The Senate Health Committee will have to dig beneath the surface on Thursday to consider the nomination of Dr. James Holsinger to be surgeon general. Dr. Holsinger has high-level experience as a health administrator, but there are disturbing indications that he is prejudiced against homosexuals.Though routinely called “the nation’s top doctor,” the surgeon general is a midlevel official who oversees the 6,000 uniformed professionals in the Public Health Service. His main mission is to serve as “America’s chief health educator,” with potentially enormous capacity to shape public opinion.Dr. Holsinger served for 26 years in the Department of Veterans Affairs, where he rose to be chief medical director and under secretary for health. After retiring, he became chancellor of the University of Kentucky Medical Center and, briefly, secretary for health and family services in Kentucky.Although he is a Christian conservative, he is difficult to pigeonhole ideologically. He testified against an anti-cloning bill in Kentucky that he felt would impede research, a position at odds with that of the president. He backed a session on lesbian health issues at a state health conference despite protests from angry legislators, favored raising cigarette taxes in a tobacco-growing state and worked to limit junk food in schools.What’s troubling is the view he once expressed — and may still hold — on homosexuality, through his activities as a lay leader in the United Methodist Church. On the church’s judicial council, he supported a minister who refused to allow a gay man to join his congregation and argued that a lesbian minister should be removed because church doctrine deems the practice of homosexuality to be “incompatible with Christian teaching.” His supporters say these rulings should not be read as his personal views because the council can’t change church doctrine. However, some council members opposed his views, and the bishops later rejected one decision.His strongest statement on homosexuality can be found in a murky, loosely reasoned paper that he wrote for a church committee in 1991. Titled “Pathophysiology of Male Homosexuality,” the paper purported to be a scientific and medical review. It argued that gay sex was abnormal on anatomical and physiological grounds and unhealthy, in that anal sex can lead to rectal injuries and sexually transmitted diseases. Dr. Holsinger did not brand the large number of heterosexual women who engage in anal sex as abnormal, failed to acknowledge the huge burden of disease spread heterosexually and implied that women are more likely than men to avoid injuries with generous lubrication.'"
"'07-07-10,'0','The 20-count indictment, which included conspiracy and other charges, detailed a scheme that began in the 1970s and continued as recently as 2005. In that scheme, lawyers inside Milberg Weiss paid $11 million in “secret and illegal kickbacks” to named plaintiffs in more than 150 class-action and other shareholder lawsuits. The lawsuits, according to the indictment, earned the firm more than $216 million.Lawyers from Milberg Weiss have also had settlement talks with prosecutors. Recently, those discussions have centered largely on what sort of monetary penalty the firm’s remaining partners will have to pay, according to a person briefed on the talks but unauthorized to speak for attribution.Like other plaintiffs firms, Milberg Weiss does not have a large cash pool to pay a significant fine. Instead, individual partners would have to put the cash up themselves.Yesterday, the firm changed its name from Milberg Weiss & Bershad to simply Milberg Weiss and said that Mr. Bershad, who had been on a leave of absence, had been terminated.“We remain confident that his actions will have no effect on the firm’s commitment to its clients and its ongoing work to protect public shareholders and consumers,” the firm said in a statement.Hired in 1968, Mr. Bershad, 67, of Montclair, N.J., is the first Milberg partner to plead guilty in the investigation and is a critical witness to prosecutors because he has intimate knowledge of the firm’s finances, several people briefed on the investigation said.In pleading guilty in Federal District Court in Los Angeles to one count of conspiracy, Mr. Bershad also agreed to give back $7.75 million, pay a $250,000 fine, and cooperate in the government’s investigation of other participants in the conspiracy, prosecutors said.The conspiracy charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, although it is unclear what, if any, jail time he will serve. A sentencing hearing was scheduled for June 23, 2008.“David Bershad is committed to making amends for what he has done,” his lawyer, Robert Luskin, said in a statement. “His efforts to right these wrongs, together with his many good works throughout his career, should be remembered along with the offense he admitted today.”Yet, in court documents, Mr. Bershad details how from the 1970s through 2005 he and other lawyers at Milberg Weiss recruited and retained named plaintiffs by secretly paying them a portion of the legal fees, generally 10 percent, that the firm obtained.By having a stable of paid plaintiffs on hand, Milberg Weiss was able to file more class-action lawsuits and do so more quickly than competing firms, Mr. Bershad said in the documents. That enabled the firm to obtain lead counsel status in cases more often and a larger share of the legal fees, his statement said.It is illegal for a plaintiff in a lawsuit to receive a portion of the legal fees because lead plaintiffs in class actions cannot have incentives that might persuade them to enter into a settlement that may not be the best for the class.In the early years of the conspiracy, Mr. Bershad said in court documents, a number of the partners involved pooled their personal cash into a fund that he maintained in his office, and which was then doled out to pay plaintiffs.Mr. Bershad said in the documents that he kept track of the amounts contributed and the secret payments that were made. Later, according to the documents, the partners involved arranged to have the firm award them “bonuses” that equaled the amounts of cash they had contributed to the fund. That allowed them to “use Milberg Weiss profits to compensate themselves for the cash they had contributed to the secret payment fund,” Mr. Bershad said in court filings.The partners at the firm who agreed to the secret payments included himself, Mr. Schulman, who has vowed to fight the charges and is scheduled to go on trial in January, as well as numerous unnamed partners, including “Partner A” and “Partner B,” according to the plea agreement. People briefed on the investigation say Partner A and Partner B are Mr. Weiss and Mr. Lerach.A call to Mr. Schulman’s lawyer was not returned. Mr. Bershad also named individuals who served as lead plaintiffs and accepted payments from the firm, including Steven G. Cooperman, who is expected to plead guilty today to conspiracy and is cooperating with the investigation, according to prosecutors.Last year, two others also entered guilty pleas in the case A former Milberg Weiss plaintiff, Howard J. Vogel, pleaded guilty to making a false declaration to a court in connection with secret payments he had received.And a Los Angeles lawyer, Richard R. Purtich, pleaded guilty to a tax charge related to claims that he had funneled money to a client of the firm. Mr. Purtich did not work at Milberg Weiss.'"

"'07-07-10,'0','In May, the Army fell 400 enlistees short of its goal of 5,500, the first time in two years that the active force failed to meet its monthly target. The downturn has coincided with sharply higher casualty numbers in Iraq, where 331 American soldiers were killed from April to June, the highest three-month level of the war.The downturn is particularly worrisome to Pentagon officials, especially because it has come in the summer, when recruiters normally find more fresh high school graduates eager to join.“One of the greatest challenges of an all-volunteer force is recruiting in a protracted war, and I think you are seeing that,” a Pentagon official said.Colonel Baggio pointed out that the Army was still on track to meet its yearly target of 80,000 new recruits because recruiting exceeded goals for several months earlier this year.In contrast to the Army, the Marine Corps will report that it met its recruiting goals in June, said an official who declined to provide further specifics.The recruiting demands on the Army have increased this year, as the service has embarked on a five-year effort to increase its active-duty strength to 547,000, from the currently authorized level of 514,000. The plan was announced by the Pentagon in January as a way to ease the strain on the Army in coming years of conducting continual deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.Colonel Baggio said that — aside from those conflicts — recruiting had been hurt by the fact that 7 in 10 potential recruits in their late teens and early 20s do not meet Army standards, largely because they are too heavy or failed to graduate from high school.Recruiting may also have been harmed by the fact that soldiers are now required to serve 15-month tours in Iraq or Afghanistan, an increase from the previous requirement of 12 months. The longer tours were imposed to sustain a Bush administration decision earlier this year to send an additional 30,000 troops to Iraq.Early in the war in Iraq, the Pentagon’s goal was for active-duty troops to spend two years at home for every year deployed. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said the Army eventually wanted to return to those goals. That will have to await either a reduction in overall force levels, however, or an increase in the size of the military, which has been set in motion but will take years to accomplish.'"
"'07-07-10,'0','WASHINGTON, July 9 — A small but confusing issue about President Bush’s commutation of the prison sentence of I. Lewis Libby Jr. appeared to have been cleared up Monday.Both Mr. Libby’s lawyers and the prosecutors filed papers saying they saw no problem in having Mr. Libby submit to two years of supervised release as a form of probation. When Mr. Bush last week wiped out a 30-month prison sentence for Mr. Libby’s conviction on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, he specified that Mr. Libby would still have to serve the two years of probation to which he had been sentenced.Last week, after the sentence he had imposed was lifted, the judge, Reggie B. Walton of Federal District Court, said that the law did not allow for a sentence of supervised release unless the defendant had actually served time behind bars.But in filings to the court, both sides said that the president’s constitutional power to grant clemency trumped any details in a statute and that the condition of two years of supervised release could be enforced.Mr. Libby, former chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, will thus have to abide by several conditions over the next two years, including those of obtaining a job and providing a written report to the probation office every month about his activities. He was convicted in March of lying to a grand jury and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an investigation of the leak of the identity of a C.I.A. operative, Valerie Wilson.Mr. Libby paid $250,400 in fines and penalties and will have to do 400 hours of community service.'"
"'07-07-10,'0','DETROIT, July 9 — The Delphi Corporation, the large auto supplier, said Monday that it had terminated a $3.4 billion financing plan to bring the company out of bankruptcy protection but that it expected to sign a new deal this month.The company said it planned to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of the year, within six months of its original timetable. Its board is scheduled to meet next Monday to consider a new financing agreement.“We would anticipate that some of the same plan investors would be involved with the transaction going forward,” said a Delphi spokesman, Lindsey Williams.Delphi said previously that the lead investor in the deal, the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, was likely to withdraw as talks stalled on a labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union and Delphi’s former parent, General Motors.After nearly two years of negotiations, the three parties signed a deal last month that allows Delphi to cut the wages of longtime workers in exchange for upfront payments of up to $105,000 and to close or sell all but four plants in the United States.'"
"'07-07-10,'0','The oil company ConocoPhillips announced yesterday it had approved a stock buyback of as much as $15 billion through the end of 2008.And the pharmaceutical and consumer products giant Johnson & Johnson said its board approved the repurchase of up to $10 billion of its common shares.ConocoPhillips’ program includes $2 billion remaining under a previously announced $4 billion stock buyback authorization. Based on the current share price, the company said it expected to repurchase $2 billion to $3 billion in stock in each of the third and fourth quarters.Conoco shares rose as high as $84.73 yesterday, closing up $3.01, or 3.7 percent, at $84.05.Analysts say it is not uncommon for large companies like ConocoPhillips to institute stock repurchases to help increase the share price, and Conoco has indicated that it wants to maintain some control over the number of its shares outstanding. The company, based in Houston, reported 1.63 billion shares outstanding as of March 31.ConocoPhillips said earlier in the year that it would reduce capital spending by 25 percent. The chief executive, James J. Mulva, said taking the step this year would enable the company to “more quickly reduce debt and increase dividends and share repurchases.”'"

"'07-07-10,'0','Findings from animal studies have suggested that the antioxidant selenium improves glucose metabolism, so researchers decided to see whether it would reduce the incidence of Type 2 diabetes. They found that on the contrary, selenium might actually increase the risk.The researchers used data from 1,250 people with an average age of 63, originally recruited to test selenium as a cancer preventive. The study was randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, which is generally considered the most reliable design. Half the people took a 200-microgram dose of selenium daily, and the other half an identical-looking dummy pill. They were followed for an average of 7.7 years. Fifty-eight selenium recipients and 39 of those who took the placebo developed Type 2 diabetes.The study, published online yesterday, will appear in the Aug. 21 print issue of The Annals of Internal Medicine. (The findings on cancer, which were published in 1996 and 2002, were at best mixed.)Over all, people who took selenium supplements had more than one and a half times as much risk for Type 2 diabetes as those who did not, and the higher the blood level of selenium, the greater the risk of developing the illness. The findings held even after controlling for age, sex, body mass index and smoking status.“There is no need for Americans to take selenium supplements,” said Dr. Saverio Stranges, the lead author and an associate professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Warwick Medical School in England. “There is already enough selenium in the average American diet.” Still, he said, “this is a single study, and no single study gives the final answer.”'"
"'07-07-10,'0','In the realm of breaking news events, the release of the All-Star Game rosters is not momentous. But how and when they should be released are concerns that led Major League Baseball to tell ESPN last week that the network could not use a studio set beyond right field at AT&T Park in San Francisco for All-Star Game editions of “Baseball Tonight” and “SportsCenter.”The kerfuffle began July 1, when TBS televised its first All-Star Game selection show as part of its new $150-million-a-year deal with baseball. The show, which was formerly carried by ESPN, gave TBS a chance to show off its studio team of Cal Ripken Jr., Tony Gwynn and Ernie Johnson.The TBS program was supposed to air at 4 p.m., but because of a rain delay during its Braves-Marlins game, the network didn’t start the show until 6. ESPN had by then carried a “Baseball Tonight” All-Star preview from 5 to 6. After each starting team and its reserves were revealed on TBS, ESPN announced them on “SportsCenter.”That is precisely what ESPN was not supposed to do. Baseball officials told ESPN a few days earlier that it could not release the rosters until after the TBS show ended. But ESPN never intended to follow baseball’s guideline, because it said it had never been asked to obey such a strict embargo.“We understood that it was an embargo through the end of show, but we considered that impractical and really unfair in terms of its enforceability,” said Len DeLuca, an ESPN senior vice president. He said nothing was signed but added, “We were very clear about what we would do.”'"

"'07-07-11,'1','¶They are more patient, and thus better able to stick to long-term strategies.¶They are more tenacious. Men can be pretty dogged, but not a single one, to my knowledge, has had to endure childbirth.I searched the Internet for evidence for this thesis and found none. The book titles I came across, like “Nice Girls Don’t Get the Corner Office” by Lois P. Frankel, seemed to contradict it. It’s a familiar tune: women leaders need to drop that nurturing nonsense and kick butt the way men do.Perhaps it is the other way around. Perhaps men ought to imitate the opposite sex. The tide is turning in women’s favor, after all. They now account for 57 percent of college students. They are rising up the ranks in corporate America and invading formerly male sanctuaries like engineering and even construction. Most profoundly, they are changing the entrepreneurial landscape, with the number of businesses they own increasing at twice the overall rate for the last two decades, to 10.4 million today, or 40 percent of the total, according to the Center for Women’s Business Research (www.cfwbr.org/).Sure, women would do well to borrow a few weapons from the male arsenal, like canning poor performers. But if they cultivate their innate strengths, they will gain a competitive edge.Especially if they are as tenacious as Ms. Mashiach. She showed an entrepreneurial spark as a child, selling yarmulkes her friends knitted. She was captain of her high school basketball team and president of her senior class. At 18, she married a musician and opened a company called Dimensions to promote his band. At 19, she had her first baby and opened a store to sell ethnic Jewish music. At 20, she gave birth to her second child. All this time, she was taking courses at Loyola University’s business school. “I’d come home late at night, exhausted, and want to hang out with my husband and relax with my baby,” she said. “Instead, I studied and wrote term papers.”The band business made money but the store folded. A failure? No. Ms. Mashiach had learned crucial business skills like accounting and the value of pushing herself to the limit.At 22, she started techcloseouts to sell refurbished computers for Dell through a barter network. It fizzled into another business lesson: If you aren’t passionate about something, drop it.At 23, she gave birth to her third child and fourth business brainstorm — to run events, from weddings to corporate-awards dinners, at hotels. In 2004, the couple started Eved Services (www.eved.com) out of their suburban Chicago home and went on the hunt for customers. The director of catering at the Hilton Chicago was interested, but elusive. He couldn’t escape her, however.“I’d sit outside his office for an hour just in the hope of grabbing him when he walked out,” she said. Realizing he loved talking business, she began calling him on his cellphone every morning at 8:15 sharp, just as he was getting into his car, and had him to herself for his 30-minute drive to work. Most men wouldn’t have thought of that.Alas, he finally told her, not yet. Maybe next year. “My husband said, ‘Forget it,’ ” she said. Instead, she borrowed $50,000 and persuaded the Hilton executive to help her get her foot in the lobbies of smaller hotels. She signed her first contracts in April 2004.Weeks later, at 4 p.m. on June 27, 2004, she gave birth to her fourth child. At 8:15 the next morning, lying bone-weary on her hospital bed, she picked up the phone to talk to the hotel executive about a deal.“I was probably insane,” she said. “But I am not ABLE????? to just sit around and not do anything.”The breakthrough came four months later, in October, when she got into the 1,544-room Hilton Chicago and the 1,640-room Palmer House Hilton. For a year after that, she would leave the house at 6:45 a.m. and return at 8 p.m. She rarely saw her kids. She pulled all-nighters every other Saturday.That was then. Now, it is time to relax a bit. Eved Services has 29 employees, contracts with more than 30 hotels and projected revenue this year in the low eight figures. Ms. Mashiach spends more time with her family — and is thinking about having more children. “That’s what really matters in life,” she said.Will she make it to six kids? Will Eved Services become a household name? Possibly both, if my hunch about female business prowess is correct.Is it? Sharon Hadary, director for the Center for Women’s Business Research, chooses her words carefully as she says men and women can learn from each other. In focus groups her organization has sponsored, for example, women acknowledged that men were better at delegating authority. Even so, the list of advantages men conceded to women was longer: they were better at multitasking, better at dealing with obnoxious customers and better at resolving workplace conflicts. Other research the center has conducted showed that women entrepreneurs were more likely than men to consult with employees and customers and to seek the advice of outside experts.“I do believe that as we move deeper into the information age, when skills at interpersonal relations and collaboration become increasingly important, women will be well positioned to be successful as entrepreneurs,” Ms. Hadary said.I’d love to hear from moms who started businesses in between changing diapers for tips on how they did it and tales of how crazy it got.'"

He said ABN was cooperating with the investigation, but could not comment on whether there was any reason to suspect insider trading.

"'07-07-11,'1','Although Mr. McCain’s problems have been apparent for months — he shook up his staff and promised to run a leaner operation after a disappointing fund-raising performance in the first quarter — aides said the full scale of his difficulties only became clear to him toward the end of last month. Donations were drying up, in part because of Republican opposition to Mr. McCain’s stances on issues like immigration, and the campaign was falling far short of its fund-raising goals.And the campaign had burned through most of the $24 million it had raised in the first half of the year on hefty salaries for staff members and consultants, a heavy travel schedule and all manner of other expenses, leaving it with less cash at the end of June than even the bare-bones presidential campaign of Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas.Aides said that the problems started to peak two weeks ago at a meeting with Mr. McCain and about 100 contributors in 100-degree weather at his home in Sedona, Ariz. It was just before that meeting, aides said, that Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy, were told how bleak the campaign’s financial situation was.They said the McCains were startled and enraged.Aides said Mr. McCain expressed concern that the image of his campaign overspending would invite mockery from opponents at a time when he is attacking excessive government spending. One McCain associate said the senator expressed astonishment at the Sedona meeting that he had spent so much money without putting a single advertisement on television.It was that gathering that led to the shakeup announced on Tuesday.Mr. McCain’s campaign quickly moved to plug the holes caused by the departures of Mr. Weaver and Mr. Nelson. It announced that Rick Davis, who was serving as the chief executive officer in the campaign, would step in as manager, reprising the role he fulfilled for Mr. McCain in his 2000 presidential bid. Mr. Davis had battled furiously with Mr. Nelson and Mr. Weaver for influence over the past three months, aides said.“No, no, no, no,” Mr. McCain said when asked by reporters on Capitol Hll if his campaign was in trouble. “I’d describe the campaign as going well. I’m very happy with it.”When asked whether he intended to stay in the presidential race, he replied, “Of course.”But Mr. McCain finds himself in a situation that his own supporters said Tuesday was largely a function of what has been his uneven performance as a candidate and in overseeing his campaign.They said Mr. McCain and his aides had made two fundamental strategic decisions that so far have proven flawed. One was that voters would reward Mr. McCain for taking principled decisions on issues — especially immigration, where he is out of step with much of the grass roots of the Republican Party, and the war in Iraq, where his steadfast support for fighting on has left him on the defensive. Instead, polls suggest that Mr. McCain has alienated much of the Republican base.The other stemmed from a belief in Mr. McCain’s inner circle last year that he would be anointed the Republican front-runner and would enjoy the political and financial advantages that go with it.Last November, Mr. Davis, with the assent of Mr. Nelson and Mr. Weaver, argued that Mr. McCain would have no trouble supporting a political machine on the scale of the 2004 Bush campaign, presenting himself as the president’s anointed heir.From that perspective, Mr. Davis argued, the campaign should expect to raise $120 million this year, including $50 million in the first six months, about twice as much as what turned out to be true.“We had false assumptions about how much money could be raised,” said Mark Salter, a senior aide to Mr. McCain. “It’s not fair to pin it on anybody. We all had this expectation that money was going to be very easy for us to raise.”Beyond that, Mr. McCain muddied up his image as a moderate independent in his second bid for his party’s nomination. He embraced President Bush after their bitter fight in 2000, and sought to make amends with the religious conservative leaders after denouncing them. But by all appearances, he has not had great success in fortifying his stand with the party’s conservative wing, even as he may have undercut his appeal as an independent candidate.Mr. Nelson told Mr. McCain he was quitting Tuesday morning, after offering his resignation several times since the campaign’s announcement last week that its fund-raising had been weak for the second quarter in a row, campaign officials said. Mr. McCain’s advisers pointedly said he made no effort to dissuade Mr. Nelson.Mr. Weaver quit after learning that Mr. Nelson, who was the political director of Mr. Bush’s re-election campaign in 2004, was leaving and that Mr. Davis — with whom Mr. Weaver has feuded for years — was stepping in. Aides said some lower-level aides, most of whom Mr. Nelson had brought over from the Bush campaign, quit as well. Mr. Weaver’s move was unexpected even by him; he gave up a rent-controlled apartment in Greenwich Village three weeks ago to move to Washington.Mr. McCain, after first insisting neither man had been fired, described the departures as “a consensus decision.”They came a week after campaign aides said they were laying off 80 members of its 120-member staff. Mr. McCain’s advisers were trading blame throughout the day about what was at fault — lackluster fund-raisers overseen by Mr. Davis or exuberant spending under the purview of Mr. Nelson.McCain aides said a third close friend and adviser, Mr. Salter, was now taking a relatively diminished, though still important, role in the campaign, serving as an unpaid senior adviser. Mr. Salter is perhaps Mr. McCain’s closest staff member; they have co-written several books and Mr. Salter will travel with Mr. McCain to New Hampshire on Friday.The campaign’s financial expectations could be seen in its spending reports. In the first three months of the year, it paid $30,000 to Mr. Davis’s firm, Davis Manafort; $42,600 to Mr. Nelson as well as $10,000 to his firm, Dawson McCarthy Nelson Media; and $71,000 to Mr. Weaver. It also paid Michael Dennehy, the campaign’s former political director, $52,000, plus $15,000 to the Dennehy Group and $13,000 for Mr. Dennehy’s travel.The campaign paid rent not only in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, but also in states where most candidates do not bother at this stage, like Alabama and Michigan, its first quarter filings showed. Beyond that, the campaign spent $11,000 for photography, $27,000 for a parking lot operator in Washington, $24,723 to Carey International for limousines and $460,000 to Flight Options for charter planes.There were also reports of Mr. McCain’s aides benefiting by their association with the campaign, exacerbating long-standing tensions between Mr. Weaver and Mr. Davis. The campaign retained a company co-owned by Mr. Davis, 3eDC, to run its Web site, and Mr. Weaver went to Mr. Davis and tried to stop the arrangement, aides said. The campaign owed the company $175,802 at the end of the first quarter, according to its filings.Mr. Weaver’s fiancée, Angela Hession, was a strategist for Mr. McCain; at one point she was being paid $1,000 a month, but — like many other advisers since the financial problems overtook the campaign — began working without pay. She was among the staff members who left on Tuesday.'"
"'07-07-11,'1','As the debate began Tuesday, Mr. Bush’s national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, and his new Iraq coordinator, Lt. Gen. Douglas Lute, arrived on Capitol Hill to lobby senators, while Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates fielded phone calls from lawmakers in both parties. The officials were, effectively, previewing a progress report to be delivered to Congress by week’s end.Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Maine Republican, said she received a call on Tuesday morning from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, urging her to wait until September to denounce the Bush policy. Ms. Snowe, who has previously opposed hard-and-fast deadlines for removing troops, said the time had come to change course in Iraq.“The tide has turned,” Ms. Snowe said. “They obviously would prefer that we wait until September, but my view is that we should send a very strong message now.”Among the proposals to be considered over the next two weeks is a plan requiring a troop withdrawal to begin within 120 days and to be completed by the end of April 2008. The sponsors of the plan, Senators Carl Levin of Michigan and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both Democrats, said the legislation would allow troops to remain in Iraq for a limited mission of combating terrorism, training Iraqi forces and protecting American forces.While debate over the Iraq war has dominated the first six months of the new Congress, Democrats have struggled to use their narrow majority to influence the administration’s policy. But Mr. Bush’s own words on Tuesday signaled the beginning of a White House counteroffensive aimed at emphasizing that, like Americans around the country, he, too, wants to bring troops home.“I fully understand that when you watch the violence on TV every night, people are saying, ‘Is it worth it, can we accomplish an objective?’ ” Mr. Bush said. “Well, first I want to tell you, yes, we can accomplish this fight and win in Iraq. And secondly, I want to tell you, we must, for the sake of our children and grandchildren.” While Mr. Bush hinted in his remarks that he was open to exploring different options in the future, he did not expound on them in any significant detail, only broadly mentioning border protection and counterterrorism. He did not mention either providing security in Baghdad or training Iraqi troops, both of which remain central to the current American mission.In a White House memorandum circulated on Capitol Hill and beyond, the administration said it was “too early to declare the surge a success or failure,” but highlighted what it called signs of progress, including “a substantial drop in sectarian murders in Baghdad since January,” “total car bombings and suicide attacks down in May and June” and “signs of normalcy in Baghdad like professional soccer leagues, amusement parks and vibrant markets.”Even as several members of Congress said Tuesday that they were awaiting a progress report on Iraq this week before rendering their judgment, administration officials sought to play down the review of the benchmarks of progress in Iraq.The document, required by Congressional budget legislation, is based on reports from senior commanders and diplomats in Iraq, and is being written in Washington by the National Security Council staff with participation from other departments, including State and Defense.“This week started to take on greater importance than anyone in the administration had intended,” said one senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. “September is our window.”The Republican senators who believe September is too late for a new strategy began huddling privately on Tuesday to begin discussing compromise legislation to change course in Iraq. Senators Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and Senator John W. Warner of Virginia are among those who are shaping such proposals.At the same time, a string of Republicans stepped forward and voiced support for the president, while Democratic leaders accused Republicans of using procedural maneuvering to delay votes on the Iraq legislation.Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said the critics were being hasty. “Do we not have the patience to see a totally new strategy, which is appearing to work, given a chance?” he asked.But Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, said the two-week Congressional debate needed to produce some signs of progress. He and Senator Ken Salazar, a Colorado Democrat, are proposing a bipartisan plan to put into law the provisions of last year’s Iraq Study Group report, which called for a gradual troop withdrawal and change of direction in the mission.“At some point we’re going to have to stop shouting at each other and see what we can agree on,” Mr. Alexander said. “We owe that to our troops and we owe that to our country.”'"
"'07-07-11,'1','The most unbending construction crew in city history is complete again after one of the ironworkers, bound in black plastic, was discovered Monday night behind a church in Queens.Last night, the iron figure was retrieved by its sculptor, Sergio Furnari, who says he will return it to the 10 other ironworkers in his life-size depiction of a celebrated 1932 photograph of 11 ironworkers seated on a beam above the Rockefeller Center construction site.The police called Mr. Funari on Monday night after the figure was found by a homeless man in the backyard of a church near 31st Avenue and 41st Street in Astoria. “He was laying there like someone basically tried to kill him,” Mr. Furnari said. “It looks like they tried to hammer him down, against his arms, against his head, against everything. For sure, if they had done it to a human being, he might be in heaven already.”Mr. Furnari first reported the figure missing in January, after it was taken from a truck outside his studio in Long Island City. He has found the disappearance perplexing. The mystery still remains: Why?“This whole time, I was looking at the original photo,” he said. “In my head, I was like ‘What did they do to you?’ It’s been like killing me. Where did they throw it out?”He said he strolled by the river, wondering if the thieves had tossed it into the water. At times he started the process of forging a new sculpture, but gave up for lack of money. The sculpture, which the police fingerprinted when it was recovered, will require extensive repairs, Mr. Funari said. “I am going to try to bring him back to life. For sure they didn’t kill his soul.”'"
"'07-07-11,'1','SANTA MONICA, Calif., July 10 — As Microsoft executives played down the impact of an extensive repair program for defective Xbox 360 game machines, they announced several efforts to broaden the appeal of their machine to families.Opening the annual E3 game conference here, Microsoft executives announced a deal to distribute films from the Walt Disney Company on Microsoft’s Xbox Live Internet service and outlined a broader array of games focused mostly on children and families.Executives predicted that the company’s recently announced plan to spend up to $1.15 billion to fix defective Xbox 360 game machine would improve, not undermine, the system’s image with consumers.“The important impact for us is that our customers know we’re going to support the console and support them and if they have issues, we’ll take care of it,” said Robert J. Bach, president of Microsoft’s entertainment and devices division, in an interview. “It won’t change what’s happening in the marketplace because the industry is about the games and we think we have the games that will get people really excited this year.”As the game industry’s growth has slowed in recent years, game developers have tried to reach beyond the young male players who have been the target audience.'"
"'07-07-11,'1','But after just about every home sale, documents must be filed with a local government office. A research firm called DataQuick Information Systems gathers these records, and a New York Times analysis of them shows that the story of today’s real estate market is really two different stories.In the Boston area, for instance, the number of homes selling for at least $1 million plummeted to 619 in the first five months of 2006, from 773 in the period in 2005, according to DataQuick. But the number jumped to 711 in the first five months of this year.In the New York region, sales at the top end — that is, homes in the most expensive 5 percent of the market — have also been rising, while they have been falling in the middle and bottom of the market. The same is true in the San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; Denver; and Houston areas. In San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Miami, high-end sales are down but not by nearly as much as sales in other price segments.Separate statistics from the California Association of Realtors also show million-dollar-plus homes to be selling better than others in that state.The high-end market is far from booming, to be sure. Many houses would still sell for less today than they would have a year ago. But the market has stayed strong enough to catch a lot of buyers and sellers off guard. They keep hearing about a real estate meltdown and then finding a different reality when they go to make a deal.A three-bedroom apartment around the corner from the Guggenheim Museum, on 88th Street near Fifth Avenue, was recently put on the market for $2.8 million, and the first bid came in slightly lower than that. Ten days — and nine bids — later, the seller accepted an offer about $500,000 above the asking price.In Brookline, Mass., near Coolidge Corner, a big Victorian house went on the market for $1.4 million this spring — just as it had in 2006, without selling. “I thought it was still overpriced,” said Chobee Hoy, the seller’s real estate agent. Yet the house ended up selling for about $30,000 more than the asking price.There seem to be three main causes of the split in the market. The first is that affluent families continue to do better than others, thanks to healthy income gains and a rising stock market. “To some extent, it is the rich getting richer,” Andrew LePage, an analyst at DataQuick, explained. “The folks who don’t rely solely on a weekly or monthly paycheck seem to be doing better.”The upper end of the market has also been helped by an influx of well-off foreign investors whose buying power has grown with the recent decline of the dollar. Hard as this may be for an American to imagine, New York, San Francisco or Miami can now seem like a bargain, compared with London, Moscow or Sydney. Jason Haber, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman in Manhattan, said he had recently taught himself how to convert square feet into square meters — you divide by 10.8 — because of all of the international buyers traipsing through New York apartments.Finally, both the recent rise in interest rates and the problems in the mortgage market have had a much bigger effect on low-income and middle-class buyers than affluent ones. It’s become harder to get a subprime mortgage, while the uptick in interest rates this year has added about $100 to the monthly payment on an average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage.As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, summed up the market: “The low end is getting creamed. The middle is struggling. The high end is running on its own dynamic.”It’s tempting to conclude, then, that the top of the housing market has somehow become bubble-proof. And some real estate agents will doubtless make this pitch to buyers who are on the fence. But it is almost certainly wrong.In fact, the very top of the housing market — the sprawling vacation homes and 10,000-square-foot mansions — seems to be doing considerably worse than merely expensive homes. Ines Hegedus-Garcia, an agent in Miami, recently looked at sales volumes there and found the market for homes that cost $1.2 million to $2.5 million to be holding up decently. The situation was much worse for those priced above $2.5 million.There are also a couple of areas, like Washington and San Diego, where the high end of the market, broadly defined, is already doing about as badly as everything else. So perhaps the recent comeback won’t last long in other cities.Remember, it’s not as if the wealthy are immune to irrational exuberance. Just think back to the 1990s — or the 1920s. Any asset can end up becoming overvalued. Right now, though, there is a bit more of a rational explanation for home values at the high end of the market.'"
"'07-07-11,'1','In a Gandhi-inspired protest, foreigners working legally in the United States sent thousands of flowers to a top immigration official yesterday to draw attention to their complaints about job-based visas.The official, Emilio Gonzalez, director of Citizenship and Immigration Services, arranged for trucks to haul the bouquets of roses, carnations and other flowers to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington and the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda, Md.“The reaction from the patients, family and staff was overwhelming,” said Michael Briggs, an American Red Cross employee at Walter Reed who helped distribute the flowers. “They were very appreciative, and they were excited.”The flower protest was staged by temporary workers, many from India, who felt jilted by the immigration agency’s decision last week to withdraw tens of thousands of job-based visas. The State Department announced last month that green cards would be available starting July 2 for applicants across the range of high-skilled categories, but the immigration agency later said there had been a misunderstanding and no visas would be available.With a more typically American form of protest under way in the courts — the first lawsuits over the about-face were filed last week — an agency spokesman, Dan Kane, would not discuss the complaints behind the flowers.Vikas Chowdhry, a software developer who helped coordinate the protest, said the flowers had served a good purpose.'"

"'07-07-11,'1','The lenders have assembled an armada of Democratic lobbyists and communications specialists. Sallie Mae, for example, hired former Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, as well as Mark Schuermann, a former senior aide to former Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat who lost his bid for a Senate seat last year.And J. C. Flowers & Company, a private equity firm in the process of buying Sallie Mae, has retained Stephanie Cutter, a former press secretary to Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.The tactics are new for an industry that for years relied on its close ties to Republicans. But President Bush broke with lenders with his budget this year when he proposed cutting subsidies to loan companies by nearly $16 billion over five years.Moving to advance Democratic plans to overhaul the student loan system, the House plans to vote this week on legislation that, in addition to cutting subsidies by about $19 billion, would increase the size of Pell grants to poor students, cut the interest rates paid by student borrowers and cap students’ monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income.The bill would also require the Education Department to test the possibility of auctioning off the right to make student loans, giving that business to the lender that proposed to charge the least. Such an auction could end the system of subsidies to student loan companies.The Senate plans to follow later this month with its own bill that would cut subsidies by $18 billion and increase Pell grants but not cut interest rates for borrowers. Because of special language inserted in the budget, the legislation is not subject to a Senate filibuster and needs only a simple majority vote to pass.The White House revealed its preference yesterday, stating that if the House bill were the one to win final approval, advisers would recommend that the president veto it for not directing enough new money to the Pell grants for low-income students.The lenders say they are fighting for survival. “Our view is that the combination of these cuts could destabilize the program significantly,” said Kevin Bruns, executive director of America’s Student Loan Providers, a Washington group. “Some companies are going to exit.”The sponsors of the bills were dismissive of the accusations that black students would suffer. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Education Committee, said, “If Sallie Mae really wants to help minority students, it should support our bill to provide the largest increase in student aid since the G.I. Bill.”But some of the lobbying appears to be paying off. Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, wrote in May to the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, echoing loan industry talking points.“Some of the changes being discussed could have a very harmful impact on students, parents, colleges and universities in Louisiana, particularly those students attending the many historically black colleges and universities in our state,” Ms. Landrieu wrote.Ms. Landrieu’s press secretary, Adam Sharp, said her letter was prompted by a letter from the president of Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans. Mr. Sharp added that the senator was still studying the legislation and had not taken a final position. A spokeswoman for Dillard, Karen Celestan, said lenders had not communicated with the university.Another Democrat, Representative Lincoln Davis of Tennessee, wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, expressing worry that cuts to the guaranteed loan program could hurt students. Mr. Davis’s press secretary did not return calls for comment yesterday.Supporters of the legislation say they are being forced to work harder than they expected to shore up support, given recent revelations of conflicts of interest in the student loan industry.“It’s made us increasingly busy in explaining why some level of subsidy cuts is really appropriate,” said Luke Swarthout, of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington.The unions have also swung into action to counter lenders’ efforts to make inroads with their members.“The student loan program has been subject to abuses that harm, not help, students and their families,” Richard L. Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., wrote to national and state union officials and the organization’s executive council.Harrison Wadsworth, special counsel to the Consumer Bankers Association, said the organization had contacted chambers of commerce, as well as unions. “We didn’t target union leaders,” Mr. Wadsworth said.At the United Negro College Fund, Dr. Lomax said he had listened carefully to the arguments of Sallie Mae and was unconvinced. “I was not prepared to support their position,” Dr. Lomax said.'"
"'07-07-11,'1','WASHINGTON, July 10 (AP) — United States counterterrorism officials are warning of an increased risk of an attack this summer, given Al Qaeda’s apparent interest in summertime strikes and increased Qaeda training near the Afghan-Pakistani border.On Tuesday, Michael Chertoff, the secretary of homeland security, told the editorial board of The Chicago Tribune that he had a “gut feeling” about a new period of increased risk. He said he based his assessment on patterns of terrorists in Europe and intelligence he would not disclose.“Summertime seems to be appealing to them,” Mr. Chertoff said. “We worry that they are rebuilding their activities.”“Our edge is technology and the vigilance of the ordinary citizen,” he added.Other American counterterrorism officials expressed similar concerns, saying that Al Qaeda and like-minded groups have recently been able to plot and train more freely in the tribal areas along the Afghan-Pakistani border, where Osama bin Laden and his top deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are believed to be hiding.Mr. Chertoff’s department has not raised the level of terror alerts. Airlines are under high alert, the second-most-serious level on a five-point scale. The rest of the country remains a step below, at elevated.The secretary urged Americans to be alert in the wake of recent terrorism episodes in England and Scotland.

"'07-07-11,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission approved a plan yesterday to allow companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange to retain their three-letter ticker symbols should they transfer to Nasdaq.Traditionally, investors have been able to differentiate among companies traded on Nasdaq and other exchanges based on how many letters a stock symbol contains.

It would have let Charles Schwab keep its SCH symbol when it switched to Nasdaq last year. It now trades under the ticker symbol SCHW.The S.E.C. said in its decision that removing the three-letter symbol rule would “remove a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate.” The regulator also said it would reduce confusion among investors of companies that might switch.The new rule will not apply to N.Y.S.E. companies that have symbols with one or two letters, and it will not allow Nasdaq to list new companies with three-letter tickers.'"

It is thrust into swirls of soft ice cream at parks all over London, creating a dessert called a 99.Alan Palmer, who is an owner of Blue Apron, said the British candy bars have been strong sellers since he opened the shop five years ago.“Anybody who went to school there or had any kind of business or family connection over there is totally addicted to them,” he said.Mr. Smart, who has lived in the United States for 25 years, learned early on in his life here that British and American chocolate bars are different, even if they share a name and a look.“One day I was eating a bar of Cadbury Dairy Milk and I thought, this has absolutely no flavor,” he said. “I looked at the label and saw it was made by Hershey. I was outraged.”Cadbury Dairy Milk is the iconic British candy bar, the one most likely to be tucked into the suitcase of a Yankee tourist looking for an inexpensive souvenir. Versions are filled with caramel, whipped fondant, whole nuts or pellets of shortbread cookie.It’s a different bar from the Cadbury bar available in the United States. According to the label, a British Cadbury Dairy Milk bar contains milk, sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, vegetable fat and emulsifiers. The version made by the Hershey Company, which holds the license from Cadbury-Schweppes to produce the candy in the United States under the British company’s direction, starts its ingredient list with sugar. It lists lactose and the emulsifier soy lecithin, which keeps the cocoa butter from separating from the cocoa. The American product also lists “natural and artificial flavorings.”Tony Bilsborough, a spokesman for Cadbury-Schweppes in Britain, said his company ships its specially formulated chocolate crumb — a mash of dried milk and chocolate to which cocoa butter will be added later — to Hershey, Pa. What happens next accounts for the differences.“I imagine it’s down to the final processing and the blending,” he said. After consulting with chocolate manufacturers in each country, Cadbury tries to replicate the taste people grew up with, he said. In the United States, that means a bar that is more akin to a Hershey bar, which to many British palates tastes sour.Kirk Seville, a spokesman for the Hershey Company, declined to explain the manufacturing process, saying the company preferred not to take part in a discussion about the manufacturing differences between a British and an American Cadbury bar.For people here with a taste for British candy, no explanation is necessary. Their opinions are already formed.“Hershey’s tastes like ear wax,” said Kevin Ellis, an Alaskan-born designer with Adobe Systems in San Francisco. Mr. Ellis, who says Canadian and British chocolate bars are comparable, anticipates with delight the boxes of imported chocolate bars his wife's family sends.The appeal of British chocolate is powerful. When the Ellis family moved not long ago to another Bay Area house, a burly man from Birmingham who was helping to haul the sofa spied a box.“Do you mind if I have a Curly Wurly?” he asked with the tenderness of a hopeful child.The Curly Wurly, a thick strip of braided caramel covered in chocolate, is a sibling to the discontinued Marathon bar, which any American who was in high school when Jimmy Carter was president will remember fondly.The Curly Wurly is not as popular in Britain as the Crunchie. With its crisp honeycomb interior, it’s what a Butterfinger might be if it went to finishing school and married up.But neither rivals the Mars bar, the prom queen of British candy bars. About three million of them are made daily in Slough, just west of London. It’s like a less sweet version of the American Milky Way, rather than the almond-stuffed American Mars bar. The smart set in London melts it over ice cream for a fast dinner party dessert. Mars bars are also fried in the same sort of batter used to coat cod.And then there is the television producer’s beloved Kit Kat, invented in York, England, in the early 1930s and available in versions that match the tastes of, variously, Japanese, Germans, Australians, Canadians and Americans.Nicky Perry has sold chocolate bars from her home country for more than a decade at her store, Tea and Sympathy, in Greenwich Village.Her theory is that the bars from the United Kingdom are made from a better recipe, containing fewer stabilizers. They melt more quickly than a Hershey bar, which is why she cuts back on the amount she stocks in summer.“I can’t afford to keep the A.C. on all night or a chocolate bar would cost $10, wouldn’t it?” she said.At the London Food Company in Montclair, N.J., about 17 percent of the store’s sales are British chocolate bars, said Samantha Codling, the owner.Ms. Codling, who is from Essex, offers a range of Cadbury Milk bars, including the mint crisp, whole nut and Turkish delight with rose jelly. The British Smartie, which resembles an M & M but has a thicker shell, and the Malteser malt ball, also sell well.“All the ex-pats definitely know the difference already and the Americans soon figure it out,” she said.Bryn Dyment, a Web developer in the Bay Area who grew up in Canada, said he was shocked when his parents took him to a candy counter in the United States. He found out that not every child in the world was eating the same chocolate bars he was.It wasn’t until he moved to the United States as an adult that he realized just how vast that divide is.“You get in these religious arguments with people,” he said. “I haven’t met a Canadian who likes a Hershey bar, but Americans think you’re crazy when you say that, because they think everyone loves a Hershey bar.”'"
"'07-07-11,'1','I’VE never fallen afoul of a Texas Ranger, but my first bite of the fatty brisket at Hill Country hit me like a Chuck Norris roundhouse kick to the head. I was stunned. Was I eating beef barbecue this ridiculously good in Chelsea?The New York-born pitmasters Robbie Richter and Lou Elrose shepherd brisket to perfection in big black smokers in the back of the restaurant. Alchemy, really, is what they’re practicing back there. No other barbecue place that has opened in New York in recent years has gotten it so right, right out of the gate.It’s one of those multimillion-dollar joints: blaring music (live bands occasionally perform on the stage downstairs); a calculatedly weathered look that is more T.G.I. Friday’s than Freemans; a fair number of communal tables that can be reserved for groups of eight or more.If the vibe is new school, the service is not: meats, sides and drinks are dispensed at separate counters; a “meal ticket” is used to tally the total at the end of the meal.Which brings us to that brisket, that exemplary specimen of Texas-style salt-and-pepper pit cooking Mr. Richter and Mr. Elrose practice. The fatty part — the deckle, sold as “brisket moist” (the less marbled part, the flat, is sold as “brisket lean”) — should first be contemplated with nothing more than bare fingers and closed eyes. One should take a moment to appreciate the textural contrast offered by the ring of sweet-salty meat crust that surrounds the yielding, moist flesh, slick with fat, and the smokiness that never threatens to overwhelm the beef flavor. It is a thing of balance and of beauty.'"

"'07-07-12,'1','WASHINGTON, July 12 — President Bush’s nominee for surgeon general, whose predecessor said he was handcuffed by political pressure, told a Senate committee today that he would resign if he were asked to put politics over science in dealing with an important issue.The nominee, Dr. James W. Holsinger Jr., testified at his confirmation hearing that he would support bans on the advertising of prescription drugs and sugary children’s cereals, that high school students should be told that condoms are an appropriate form of birth control, and that he was not anti-gay.“I can only say that I have a deep appreciation for the essential human dignity of all people, regardless of background or sexual orientation,” Dr. Holsinger said. “Should I be confirmed as surgeon general, I pledge to you to continue that commitment.”Gay rights advocates have sharply criticized Dr. Holsinger for a 1991 paper he wrote for a church committee that characterized homosexual sex as unnatural and unhealthy. Under pointed questioning, Dr. Holsinger said the 1991 paper did not represent his present views, was not intended to be published and was not “an example of my scientific work.”“I would simply ask that you read the scientific papers that I have published as an example of my scientific work,” Dr. Holsinger said told the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.'"

"'07-07-12,'1','The apparel company Liz Claiborne said yesterday it planned to cut 600 to 800 jobs and was considering whether to sell 16 brands to cut costs and focus on profitable fashion lines.Under the plan, the company expects to save $100 million in 2008 and an additional $90 million over the next two years.The cuts amount to 7 to 9 percent of its nonretail global work force, including senior positions.The brands under review account for about $800 million of its projected annual sales of $5 billion.“We are at a turning point,” the chief executive, William L. McComb, said at an investor conference. “Everything we do will be centered on one key principle: building powerful brands.”The company will separate its brands into two operating segments.Its retail-based segment, which the company said should generate about $2.2 billion in revenue in 2007, includes Juicy Couture, Kate Spade, Lucky Brand Jeans and Mexx brands.Mr. McComb intends to focus on those four brands and expects they will account for $3 billion in sales by 2010 as the company expands its marketing effort and adds stores in the United States and abroad.'"

The company’s domestic business has struggled since more than 70 people fell ill late last year because of an E. coli outbreak linked to Taco Bell restaurants in the Northeast.

"'07-07-12,'1','Even as Sallie Mae agreed in April to sell itself to two private equity firms — J. C. Flowers and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe — and two investment banks — JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America — the specter of the legislation has haunted the deal.But revelations yesterday — shortly before the House voted to cut subsidies to student lenders — suggested that the buyout group was trying to pay a lower price.At issue is the interpretation of an escape clause in the sales agreement, which indicated that the deal could be scuttled if any change in the student-lending laws was substantially harmful to either side.The buyout group contends that the proposed new laws meet that condition; Sallie Mae contends that they do not.In February, before the Sallie Mae bid was announced, the Bush administration proposed to cut subsidies to student lenders by $16 billion over five years. Yesterday, the House passed a measure to reduce subsidies by $18.8 billion over the same period, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis. A Senate proposal calls for $19.5 billion in cuts. The president has threatened a veto.Analysts said that even if the buyout group did not withdraw its offer, it could cause Sallie Mae’s board to compromise.The buyers are “trying to get a discount,” said Richard Hofmann, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in New York.“The legislative risks were well telegraphed at the time the offer was announced,” Mr. Hofmann said.“While they are blaming legislation, we think it is really driven more by the conditions in credit markets as they start to do the financing for this deal,” he added. “That pushback is going to cause them to pay higher interest costs, which lowers their returns on their investment.”Since the deal was announced, Wall Street analysts have questioned whether the company could withstand the heavy debt load that private equity typically adds on. Over the last few weeks, credit conditions have soured and made it harder for buyers to borrow at favorable terms.There could be other explanations. The split between the Sallie Mae’s buyers and its board surfaced in regulatory filings released yesterday; the parties may be trying to guard against potential lawsuits.There may also be a political motive. News was released shortly before the House voted, and some analysts suggested the buyout group was sending a message to Congress.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Matt David, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, confirmed that Mr. McCain made the phone call from the cloakroom. Mr. David said Mr. McCain used his campaign cellphone and did not specifically ask the fund-raisers for campaign contributions, which would have been a crime. And the spokesman sought to distinguish Mr. McCain’s call, made as he was managing the Republican side of a fierce Senate debate over the Iraq war, from the accusations once made against Mr. Gore.“This is very different than systematically abusing your office to raise money,” Mr. David said.Whether a conference call with fund-raisers could constitute a solicitation of campaign contributions and thus violate the criminal law as well as the internal Senate ethics rules can depends on the details of the call, several legal experts said.“If it is a solicitation, it is illegal,” said Lawrence Noble, a nonpartisan expert on political law in Washington.Marc Elias, a Democratic campaign lawyer, said, “It is going to depend on the precise words that were used on the call,” noting that courts might consider an exhortation to pump up his fund-raisers a solicitation, depending on the context. (Mr. David insisted there was no form of solicitation on the call.)As his aides confirmed the location where Mr. McCain made his call, the candidate himself was vowing Wednesday that his campaign would press on. Mr. McCain said he would compete all-out in his presidential bid, not only in New Hampshire and South Carolina but also in the caucuses in Iowa — a state where he has acknowledged that his support for an immigration overhaul has hurt him badly in the polls.“I want to assure you: I have no consideration of dropping out of the race,” Mr. McCain said, in between floor speeches to defend President Bush’s Iraq strategy. “We’re just trying to restructure and maintain the focus and do the same things we’ve always done.”Acknowledging that his campaign’s expenditures had been “out of whack,” Mr. McCain pledged once again to get its finances under control. (After spending heavily on private jets during the first quarter, he will be taking a commercial flight to New Hampshire later this week.) And he said his financial backers and primary state campaign workers were still on board.Voters will dismiss the campaign shake-up as “an inside-the-Beltway kind of thing,” Mr. McCain said. He then added, “But clearly, it’s not helpful.”With just $2 million in the bank, undisclosed debts, a campaign burning cash at a rate of more than $3 million a month and the recent layoffs of more than half its staff, the McCain campaign is reading its obituaries in the comments of some observers.“It’s effectively over,” said Charlie Cook, the editor of The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter. “The physicians have left the hospital room and it’s the executors of the estate that are taking over.”Rick Davis, Mr. McCain’s new campaign manager, joked that the campaign had been “exceptionally successful” in lowering expectations about its chances in Iowa. He said the campaign would concentrate on the kind of inexpensive retail politics and town hall meetings where many aides feel Mr. McCain excels.“He has proven that he can run this kind of campaign,” said Mr. Davis, who was Mr. McCain’s national campaign manager in 2000. “So if anyone wonders is this is possible — that’s exactly what he did once before.”Back then, the need for campaign finance reform was one of Mr. McCain’s favorite themes, and he often mocked Mr. Gore’s argument that there was “no controlling legal authority” forbidding his fund-raising calls from another federal property, the White House.“The American people deserve a controlling ethical authority,” Mr. McCain used to repeat on the campaign trail, “as well as controlling legal authority.”'"
"'07-07-12,'1','“When you look at adults who commit crimes or children who get into trouble, there’s not a lot of public pressure on politicians to do the right thing,” said Robert McDuff, a veteran Mississippi civil rights lawyer who helped draft the lawsuit. “And unfortunately the current administration has not paid the proper attention to correcting these problems.”The chairman of the juvenile justice committee in the State House, Representative George Flaggs Jr., a Vicksburg Democrat, said of the abuses mentioned in Wednesday’s lawsuit: “It’s indefensible, it’s embarrassing to the state of Mississippi, and it’s unnecessary. Shackles should never be used unless they are being transported. It’s clearly stupidity.”Six workers at the school were suspended by the Department of Human Services two weeks ago, and raises have been announced for workers at the schools, though the lowest-paid will still receive only slightly under $19,000.The department declined to comment on the lawsuit.The lawsuit, filed by a branch of the Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery, Ala., paints a grim picture of teenage girls subjected to systematic harsh treatment at the school, a sprawling facility in Columbia, in the state’s southern pinelands, where inmates are confined for as long as several months. And despite the troubled mental state of the girls, the school provided virtually nothing in the way of counseling.The girls were shackled because they were suspected of wanting to run away, according to the lawsuit, which said there was “absolutely no security or other penological or rehabilitative justification for shackling of the girls.”Still, they were made to wear the restraints going to and from sleeping quarters, the cafeteria and the medical clinic. Sometimes, the staff did not properly lock the shackles, thus chafing the girls’ ankles as they walked and causing them “excruciating pain,” the suit says. Girls were also subjected to sleep deprivation when the lights were left on in their sleeping quarters, lawyers said.One girl was sexually abused by a guard who grabbed her inside the disciplinary cell in which she had been placed. When she struggled, he left, according to the suit. The girl, already traumatized by sexual abuse at the hands of her father, never received any counseling after the guard’s assault, despite complaining about it.Another troubled girl, put on suicide watch, was placed alone in a cell “for over 14 hours,” and was not given mental health counseling, the suit said. Unmonitored, she was able to carve the words “hate me” into her forearm. Another girl on suicide watch, similarly neglected, was able to slice her wrists with glass, it said.“The lawsuit indicates that the model of juvenile justice in Mississippi is a failed one, and these resources are much better spent on programs proven to turn lives around,” said Sheila Bedi, a lawyer with the Youth Justice Project.Mississippi’s plans for dealing with troubled youth have “proven themselves failures over and over,” Ms. Bedi said, adding, “State officials have been deliberately indifferent to the rights of these children.”'"
"'07-07-12,'1','The News Corporation announced yesterday that its all-business news cable channel, to be called the Fox Business Network, will start on Oct. 15.The channel, which the company has previously said would be capable of reaching 30 million homes on its first day, will be based in the Manhattan headquarters of the Fox News Channel.Neil Cavuto, the Fox News program host who is the managing editor for business news at Fox, made the announcement.“I’m extremely excited to be part of such a dynamic venture, and I look forward to building on the success of our existing top five business programs in cable news,” Mr. Cavuto said.The channel will be a third competitor in the field of business news channels, taking on the leader, CNBC, which is managed by NBC Universal and owned by General Electric, and Bloomberg Television.Kevin Goldman, a spokesman for CNBC, said his channel would enjoy a wide advantage in distribution. “CNBC is in over 90 million homes in the U.S.,” he said, adding that it also has worldwide distribution to about 340 million homes. But he said the channel had “never underestimated any competition.”'"
"'07-07-12,'1','A Marine lawyer investigating evidence against an infantryman accused of murdering three Iraqis in Haditha in 2005 has recommended dismissing all charges, citing a lack of evidence to show any wrongdoing.In his 18-page report, the investigator said that the preliminary case presented by military prosecutors against the infantryman, Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt, was “unsupported and incredible,” and that Lance Corporal Sharratt had killed the three men in a darkened bedroom of a home in response to a perceived threat “in accord with the rules of engagement and use of force.”The report by the Marine investigator, Lt. Col. Paul J. Ware, has been sent to the commanding general of the First Marine Expeditionary Force, James T. Mattis, who will make the final decision whether to allow the case to proceed from its initial stages to a full court-martial. It is unlikely, military and civilian lawyers said, that General Mattis will seek grounds to diverge from Colonel Ware’s recommendation.Lance Corporal Sharratt is one of three enlisted members of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marines, who were charged with murder in connection with actions taken in the hours after an insurgent bomb killed one marine as a convoy drove through Haditha on Nov. 19, 2005.Two other marines, Staff Sgt. Frank D. Wuterich and Lance Cpl. Stephen Tatum, also face murder charges in connection with the deaths of 21 other Iraqis who the military’s prosecutors said were civilians. Hearings to examine the charges against those marines are to begin later this summer.Four officers, including the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, were charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate adequately the Haditha killings, which occurred during a violent day of fighting against Sunni Arab insurgents. The investigator looking into the case of Capt. Randy W. Stone, a battalion lawyer and another of the four officers, recommended dismissing the charges in favor of a lesser, administrative punishment.The investigator in Colonel Chessani’s case has recommended that the charges against him proceed to court-martial, said the Thomas More Law Center, which is representing Colonel Chessani for free.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Scarcity figures big in the escalating prices. Mr. Miller estimated that less than 1 percent of all co-op and condominium buildings in the city have private garages. The city also limits how much parking new buildings below 60th Street can offer, requiring that no more than 20 percent of the units have spaces.“It’s a fairly rare amenity,” Mr. Miller said. “And in the world of pet spas and on-site sommeliers, it’s actually a pretty functional amenity.”In other densely packed cities where space and parking are at premium, parking spaces in condos also tend to trade at high prices. In Boston, they can sell for as much as $175,000, and they go for as much as $75,000 in Chicago. But in other cities, like Los Angeles and Dallas, most condos include parking in their prices.For developers in New York, parking is the highest and best use for below-grade space and fetches about the same price per square foot as actual living space, which costs much more to develop. According to Miller Samuel, the average parking space costs $165,019, or $1,100 per square foot, close to the average apartment price of $1,107 per square foot. Those are averages, of course. A $200,000 parking space is about $1,333 per square foot.If parking at the Onyx Chelsea, a new 52-unit condo at 28th Street and Eighth Avenue, is any indication, there is plenty of demand. The first two spots sold for $165,000, the third for $175,000 and the last two for $195,000. Each space will include about $50 in monthly maintenance costs. Still, there are three buyers on a waiting list.Cynthia Habberstad is at the top of that list. She chose not to buy a spot when they were selling for $165,000, but changed her mind only to learn that all the spaces had been taken.“At first, I was getting overwhelmed and didn’t want to spend the money,” Ms. Habberstad said. “I’m kicking myself now, believe me.”She and her three children, ages 7, 9 and 11, live on Long Island, but the children’s modeling schedules bring them into the city at least twice a week, and the apartment they bought in the building will be a pied-à-terre.“If we’re coming in late from dinner or we have a lot of stuff in the car, do we really want to have to walk a few blocks to get home?” Ms. Habberstad said. “It all makes sense now that I don’t have it.”Developers are well aware of the demand. “We’re putting in parking in pretty much every development that we’re working on,” said Shaun Osher, the chief executive of Core Group Marketing, which represents 246 West 17th Street and about a dozen other new condo buildings.In-building parking allows city dwellers with cars to replicate the suburban ideal where they can park, take their keys and walk right into their homes, Mr. Osher said.At the Fifth Street Lofts in Long Island City, Queens, which are scheduled for completion at the end of the year, Jackie and Lee Freund bought an apartment and three garage spaces at $50,000 each, even though they own only one car.“We bought three because we know the parking situation is bad now and its only going to get worse,” Jackie Freund said.The Freunds, who have a 2-year-old son, have lived in a nearby rental building for the last three years. After dealing with the hassles of parking on the street, they got a space in a nearby garage.“We’ve had the car towed, and my sister had hers towed when she came to visit and parked on the wrong side of the street,” she said. “They’re crazy for towing around here since the tow pound is nearby.”The Freunds plan to sell one of their extra spots at the Fifth Street Lofts and rent out the other.Buyers and brokers across the city are confident that prices will only go up as finding a parking space becomes more difficult. In fact, 40 parking garages or lots in the city have closed within the last nine months while only 23 new ones have opened, said Margot J. Tohn, publisher of “Park It! NYC 2007,” a parking garage guide.“It’s not at a huge, huge scale, but we definitely are losing parking,” Ms. Tohn said.Tom Postilio, a broker for Core Group Marketing and the director of sales at 246 West 17th Street, said: “There are people looking for apartments who have the attitude, ‘Love me, love my car.’ And for them, if there’s no place to park on the streets, it’s practically a deal to get a parking spot for $225,000.”'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida has drafted a series of executive orders to slow climate change and cut the state’s emission of heat-trapping gases by more than 25 percent, to 1990 levels, over the next 18 years. By 2050, the goal is to cut emissions to one-fifth of those levels.One order would require state officials to find ways to cut emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks. Another would set new energy-efficiency standards for state buildings and cars and require that 20 percent of the state’s electric power eventually came from renewable sources “with a strong focus on solar and wind energy.” Current federal calculations show that Florida gets 2 percent of its electricity from such sources, down from 2.9 percent in 1990.Whether Mr. Crist, a popular Republican, can single-handedly mandate strict new controls on electric utilities and other industries remains to be seen.At least one major initiative on Mr. Crist’s agenda — copying California’s requirements for reducing vehicle emissions — could not take effect under current federal regulations because Florida is not eligible to adopt such strict rules. Also, the orders of one governor can be nullified by a successor and may provide problematic underpinnings for policies reaching four decades into the future.Mr. Crist’s moves are intended to put him and his state in the company of Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and other state and local officials who have taken steps to slow climate change and moved into a regulatory arena the Bush administration has largely shunned.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules ensuring that it can sue hedge funds for misleading investors, after a court ruling put in doubt the regulator’s authority over the $1.6 trillion industry.The S.E.C. barred hedge funds from lying about investing strategies, performance, a manager’s experience and the risks of putting money in a fund. Commissioners unanimously approved the rule in a public meeting in Washington yesterday.“This rule will give the commission an important tool to help us police this market to deter misconduct,” the agency’s chairman, Christopher Cox, said.The S.E.C. acted after a federal appeals court rejected regulations last year that required hedge funds to report their size to the agency and submit to routine inspections. In its decision, the court said the client of a hedge fund adviser was the fund itself, raising questions about whether the agency could take aim at managers for defrauding individual investors.The S.E.C. approved rules in 2004 that required hedge fund advisers to register with the agency, out of concern that the industry’s rapid growth and a lack of regulatory oversight would hurt investors and financial markets.Phillip Goldstein, founder and principal of Bulldog Investors, a hedge fund in Saddle Brook, N.J., sued the S.E.C., prompting the United States Court of Appeals in Washington to strike down the rule in June 2006. Instead of appealing the decision, Mr. Cox proposed the antifraud measure.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','PARIS, July 11 — The Simon Wiesenthal Center has called on the Vatican to discipline a powerful Polish priest for making anti-Semitic comments and claiming that President Lech Kaczynski of Poland “is in the pockets of the Jewish lobby.”The priest, the Rev. Tadeusz Rydzyk, who controls a conservative Catholic media empire that includes the influential Radio Maryja, made the comments during a private meeting in April. A tape of his harshest remarks was leaked to the Polish press last week.“He isn’t just an individual; he is a priest and speaks in the name of the Catholic Church,” said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, who insists that the Polish church has an obligation to act. “He is sort of a Goebbels with a collar.”Rabbi Hier said he had written to the head of the Warsaw bishops’ conference and to the head of Father Rydzyk’s religious order at the Vatican, demanding that he be punished. “It is inconceivable that Father Tadeusz Rydzyk be allowed to use his radio pulpit as a means of inciting people to bigotry and hatred,” the rabbi wrote.The uproar comes at a difficult time for the Polish church, reeling from disclosures that some of its highest-ranking clergy members cooperated with Poland’s secret police during the Communist era.'"

He also found grounds to sue Mayer Brown and Ernst for helping Refco commit fraud, though it was a “close question,” he said, regarding Ernst.The examiner also said the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges could be sued for failing to use appropriate care in its representation of Refco, though this was also a close call, he added.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Moody’s Investors Service may reduce the ratings of $5 billion of collateralized debt obligations after lowering the ratings of subprime mortgage bonds that make up the securities.A downgrade would affect 184 tranches of 91 C.D.O.’s, representing about 3.6 percent of rated C.D.O.’s containing asset-backed securities, Moody’s said yesterday. C.D.O.’s are divided into tranches to allow investors to choose how much risk they bear for the returns they receive.Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, after coming under criticism for failing to downgrade subprime mortgage bonds, began taking action Tuesday. Moody’s lowered ratings on 399 bonds valued at $5.2 billion, and Standard & Poor’s said it might reduce ratings on 612 bonds valued at about $12 billion.“It is anticipated that the current rating reviews will be resolved over the upcoming weeks as more information becomes available and Moody’s completes its analysis,” the analysts, led by the senior credit officer, John Park, said in a statement.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, a best-selling genre novelist widely credited with having founded the historical romance in its modern — carnal — incarnation, died on Friday in Princeton, Minn., where she lived. She was 68.The cause was cancer, said Carrie Feron, her editor at Avon Books, which published the paperback editions of all Mrs. Woodiwiss’s novels.With her first novel, “The Flame and the Flower” (1972), Mrs. Woodiwiss took a genre formerly known for its slim volumes, gothic settings and comparative chastity and infused it with literal heft, historical sweep and generous billows of steam. (Often the steam was literal: an astonishing number of Mrs. Woodiwiss’s characters are shown taking baths. The literal steam frequently leads to the figurative, which in turn leads to more of the literal, and so on.)If Mrs. Woodiwiss’s books did not always find favor with reviewers, they were hugely popular with readers. Her 13 novels have together sold more than 36 million copies, Ms. Feron said, and she was a frequent presence on The New York Times best-seller list. Her work also helped set the stage for other well-known writers in the genre, like Rosemary Rogers and Johanna Lindsey.Mrs. Woodiwiss’s best-known titles include “Shanna” (1977), “A Rose in Winter” (1982), “Come Love a Stranger” (1984) and “The Reluctant Suitor” (2003). Her final novel, “Everlasting,” is to be published in hardcover by William Morrow in October.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Mr. Stratyev, the supervisor of a mining crew, uses a dredge and bulldozer to scoop up the black sludge, rich in nickel that once fell from the sky. He gathers it in mighty piles from a large pond that lies directly downwind from the smelters and returns it to the factory from which it came.“They should put a monument up to us,” Mr. Stratyev said, standing in front of the dredge he just used to mine air pollution from the bottom of a pond. “We’re solving an ecological problem.”At the factory, the sludge is hauled to the metal smelters, mixed with ore and refined into pure nickel and other metals, including platinum and palladium. Most nickel is sold to steelmakers, who use it to create the low-sheen metallic finishes so popular now in upscale kitchen appliances. Palladium, paradoxically, is primarily used in catalytic converters, to reduce air pollution from automotive exhaust.While raw nickel oxides and salts are carcinogenic, they are also valuable. The price of nickel on the London Metal Exchange is about $36,900 a ton.Over the years, the smelters here spewed out thousands of tons of nickel dust — 1,280 in 1995, a typical year — before new owners introduced some controls that lowered the figure to 800 tons. But even that reduced amount is worth about $30 million at today’s prices.The factory plans a new, multibillion-dollar effort to bring emissions into compliance with Russian standards by 2015, Yevgeny V. Romanov, a deputy director of the factory, said in an interview.In the meantime, pollution permeates most aspects of life here in a city singled out by the Blacksmith Institute in New York, an environmental group, as one of the 10 most polluted places on earth.At one factory, street sweepers scour the parking lot and then empty the dust back into the smelters. Urban legend has it that drunks, rather than collecting bottles for money, put buckets out to collect rainwater, then boil off the water and sell the residue to the factory. Factory officials said that nothing of the sort took place.A study by the Oslo-based Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program, considered the foremost authority on pollution in Russia’s Arctic, found that the local population suffered from a number of environmental maladies, including elevated rates of lung cancer, allergies and a skin lesion called “nickel eczema.” High levels of nickel were found in children’s urine.Yet the long-term health effects remain something of a mystery because the Russian authorities have never allowed a detailed analysis, according to the Norwegian study, a legacy of the Soviet secrecy about environmental health risks.In another problem for a town that has many, pollutants are lowering the freezing point of groundwater, much the way salt scattered on a roadway prevents the formation of ice, said Ali G. Kerimov, a member of the Norilsk City Council.That is particularly unfortunate here, because the city is built on permafrost, and as foundations once anchored in solid ice shift and crack, buildings become uninhabitable. Mr. Kerimov said 70 out of 1,000 buildings in Norilsk had been forcibly abandoned.In the surrounding countryside, sulfur dioxide emissions have killed 1.2 million acres of forest, a little less than twice the land area of Rhode Island. On a recent car trip through this otherworldly zone of mud and dead tree trunks, draped in an eerie mist of sulfur dioxide, passengers reflexively rolled up the windows while gaping in wonder at the destruction.The pollution mining began five years ago, according to Aleksandr I. Korolev, a deputy chief engineer at the factory. “It’s a year-round operation,” Mr. Korolev said of the work, which has accelerated recently because of high metals prices. “The pond does not freeze,” he said, because of the chemicals and the inflow of warm effluent from the factory.Children take refreshing dips in the pond on hot summer days, Mr. Stratyev said, despite his best efforts to shoo them away. “I tell them, ‘You can’t swim here, this is a heavy metal pond.’ ” Four years ago, a boy drowned; it took the authorities days to find his body in the sludge.Mr. Stratyev said he knew “many” places in town where he might work such rich veins of pollution. “And when I die,” he said, “they’ll probably put me in the smelter and melt me down, too.”'"
"'07-07-12,'1','I do not agree with your editorial regarding Dr. James Holsinger’s nomination as surgeon general (“A Nominee’s Abnormal Views,” editorial, July 10). He is a talented physician who has proved throughout his impressive career in public service and education that he is dedicated to caring for all Americans.The surgeon general serves as America’s chief health educator, giving our citizens the best current information to improve the health of Americans. In this role, Dr. Holsinger will lead the president’s efforts to combat childhood obesity, a serious epidemic threatening the health of millions of America’s children. Leadership is crucial in responding to threats to public health, and he is the right choice to face this threat.Our nation needs a doctor who can speak directly to Americans and encourage adoption of healthier lifestyles. Dr. Holsinger will be a strong voice for the public health needs of all Americans and should be confirmed without delay.The writer is a former secretary of health and human services.I support your views and skepticism concerning President Bush’s nominee for surgeon general, Dr. James Holsinger. I am questioning the appropriateness of your use of the words “practicing homosexuals.”I, for one, never “practiced” homosexuality but am simply gay. I won’t burden you with my story of trying to be a practicing married homosexual and how that failed. In my case, I “practiced” heterosexuality, and the practice never worked.The term “practicing” seems to try to be in opposition to celibate homosexuals. That does not make those individuals less gay, but it does mean that they are not sexually active with others. Is that what you meant? If so, what does celibacy have to do with it? Would you use also use the term “practicing heterosexuals” in an editorial? If so, what idea would that express? Jerry Douglas, M.D.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','“I loved working on the house,” Ms. Lau says. “I learned so much.”Mr. Kentis, who grew up in Mahwah, N.J., and studied filmmaking at New York University, is 44, funny and spontaneous, the sort of guy who will volunteer information about the purchase price of the house and the cost of the renovation, then worry about it later. (The house, bought in 2005, cost $2.1 million; he estimates that the renovation cost in the high six figures.)Ms. Lau, who grew up in San Francisco and studied writing at Columbia, gives the impression of being the more businesslike one, the one more in control. You will eventually get her age, 44, but you will have to wait until she is ready to tell you. It is not a surprise to learn that she was the producer of “Open Water,” overseeing the $120,000 budget, which came from their savings, and that Mr. Kentis was the writer and director, editing feature trailers in the day, working on the film with his wife during their vacations and cutting it at night.The film grossed $58.7 million worldwide, according to Daily Variety, so it is a surprise to find that neither is cavalier about money. But perhaps that is because they worked so hard to make it.Their approach to the renovation of their 4,000-square-foot 1886 brownstone was also interesting. They worked in the same kind of collaborative spirit they had when making their film, depending not simply on Eric Liftin, the lead architect from MESH Architectures in Manhattan, and Alex de Looz, the project architect, but on their close friend Miro Gal, an Israeli artist who lives in Park Slope. Mr. Gal, who was paid for his efforts, was their on-site representative during the renovation, offering advice and assistance. When he realized the couple had difficulty visualizing the architects’ sketches, for example, he built rough models, like a kitchen countertop made from cardboard boxes.He also introduced the family to Park Slope. Ms. Lau and Mr. Kentis, who have been together for 18 years and married for 10, had been living in a three-bedroom rental in Brooklyn Heights, where their daughter, Sabrina, now 9, attended private school. They loved Mr. Gal’s neighborhood: the restaurants, the easy subway access to Manhattan. But then they bought a brownstone that was in excellent condition, which became something of a problem, because they wanted the wide-open feeling of a loft.“The architects would say, ‘This is in good shape,’ as if you’re not allowed to touch it,” Mr. Kentis says.“They were very conservative in their approach,” Ms. Lau says. “We’re an unusual group: Chinese-American” — that would be Ms. Lau — “German-Irish” — that’s Mr. Kentis — “Israeli. We wanted to find someone who was in sync with our sensibilities.”Mr. Kentis says: “There was a sensibility that didn’t seem to exist. A sense of preserving details and combining it with something more innovative.”Landmark guidelines precluded changing the exterior, so Mr. Liftin’s design left the facade untouched but opened up the inside of the house. “You had constricted circulation space in the middle: narrow stairs and narrow hallways,” Mr. Liftin says. “The idea was to take that vertical space and open it up skyward. It’s all about light and revealing space.”The walls on the parlor floor were ripped out, creating a large open space where there had been a living room, a dining room and a kitchen. The brownstone had a skylight, which the architects had planned to enlarge. But a few months into the renovation, they decided to remove the roof, raise it and add skylights, bold moves since there was nothing wrong with the existing roof. Four skylights were installed. The most playful one is over a closet in Ms. Lau’s office, which has a translucent door that glows during the day.Translucent glass and panels are used throughout the house but are a particular theme in the master bathroom. The tiles are glass, and the common hall and bathroom wall are made out of a translucent material called Panelite. Standing in the hall, one might see the phantasmal shape of someone in the shower.A small part of the brownstone’s original interior architecture remains: the mahogany molding around the windows and the front door on the parlor floor and a number of fireplaces, including the ones in the couple’s top-floor offices. Once obscured by layers of paint, the gray stone fireplaces in the offices now have a surprisingly clean, modern line.The fireplace in the couple’s bedroom, however, was torn out — to brownstone purists, a move tantamount to architectural homicide (and one even the filmmakers appear not to have taken lightly: the fireplace did not work, they point out, and space was limited). Many of the furnishings are custom, including the L-shape seating area in the family room, which hides the DVD player, sound equipment and children’s games beneath its seats.But not everything is new. The dining room table was made by a Pennsylvania carpenter out of old barn wood, which the couple estimate to be 130 years old. Ms. Lau stores CDs in her office in an old metal cabinet stripped down to its gray metal finish. The skylight in her room is encased in wood salvaged from the stairs that were removed on a lower level.Ms. Lau found a yellow parakeet, whose gray cage goes perfectly with the surroundings, on the front doorstep a few weeks ago. It was weak and barely able to fly, and Ms. Lau nursed it back to health and adopted it. In a way, it, too, was salvaged.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','There have been angry C.I.A. books before. In the mid-1970s, with the revelation of ugly secrets about death plots, illegal openings of domestic mail and use of drugs for mind control came a rash of volumes decrying the notion that Americans could ever have countenanced “so immoral” an agency.“Legacy of Ashes,” a deeply researched new chronicle of the Central Intelligence Agency by Tim Weiner, who covered intelligence issues for many years for The New York Times, is impassioned too. He is just as indignant about the offenses that Congress and other parts of our government investigated three decades ago — and others have exposed since then.The chief target of Mr. Weiner’s anger, however, is not C.I.A. immorality but C.I.A. incompetence. “The most powerful country in the history of Western civilization has failed to create a first-rate spy service,” he complains. “That failure constitutes a danger to the national security of the United States.”In this sense “Legacy of Ashes” is conspicuously a book of its time. In 2007 many Americans who think of the C.I.A. — when they consider the now-diminished agency at all — wonder bitterly why it could not help us avoid the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and why it claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction so dangerous that we had to fight a costly war in Iraq.The C.I.A.’s loudest champions have traditionally insisted that its successes were classified and its failures heralded, and that anyone with full access to the secret record would venerate its role in United States national security since its founding under President Harry S. Truman. With Iraq as the end point, Mr. Weiner’s thesis is instead that from the 1940s on, intelligence gaffes, sloppy covert action and bootlicking in the Oval Office have kept the agency from making the kind of grandiose contributions often claimed for it and, at crucial times, have done this country damage.Anyone tempted to write this book off as an anti-C.I.A. screed had better look at Mr. Weiner’s sources. The author has impressively studied the archival record, teased out newly declassified primary documents and done numerous interviews to glean as much as can be publicly known about the agency’s history. Some of the most damning criticism of the C.I.A.’s past performance in this book comes not from gadflies or ideologues but from ex-officials and long-secret authorized accounts by C.I.A. historians.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','It is unfortunate that economists have to debate whether natural resources are a blessing or a curse for a developing nation. Minerals, diamonds or oil may appear to represent automatic wealth but resource-rich countries usually become mired in corruption. High oil revenues, for instance, allow a government to maintain power and reward political supporters without doing much for its people. The government of Nigeria has taken in billions from high oil prices, yet the average person was probably better off 40 years ago. The easy-to-reach wealth of a resource also encourages coups, and thus political stability is problematic.The solution is to make these governments more accountable in spending their money, but how can that be done? Paul Collier, an economics professor at Oxford University, has a new and potentially powerful idea. In his recently published book, “The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries Are Failing and What Can Be Done About It” (Oxford University Press), Professor Collier favors an international charter — some widely publicized guidelines that countries can voluntarily adopt — to give transparency in spending wealth from natural resources. A country would pledge to have formal audits of its revenues and their disposition. Imagine PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing the copper revenues of Zambia and issuing a public report.Professor Collier’s proposal at first glance seems toothless; a truly corrupt country probably wouldn’t follow the provisions of the charter, which, after all, is voluntary. Yet citizens could pressure their government to follow such a charter, and the idea of the charter would create a focus for political opposition and signify international support for concrete reform.Foreign corporations would bring further pressures to heed the charter. Multinational companies that are active in corrupt countries might receive bad domestic publicity. Eventually the companies might push for adherence to the charter, even if the charter limited their ability to bribe. In another context, De Beers has been stung by bad publicity about “blood diamonds,” and the company is now a force for positive change where it operates.In the optimistic case, a few poor countries start abiding by the charter. Those countries prosper and attract more investment and status in the international community. The pressure to adopt the charter would then spread. Of course, promoting the charter costs relatively little and the potential benefits are significant. International pressures did eventually force a change in South African apartheid. So maybe they can improve other countries as well.'"
"'07-07-12,'1','Shot almost entirely with hand-held cameras in Super 16 millimeter, the show has no opening titles or bouncy incidental music; aside from the sexual encounters, it’s not even particularly plot heavy. Instead “Tell Me You Love Me” is a peeling-the-onion sort of series about the difficulties of being in a long-term relationship: the miscommunications, the tiny betrayals and the constant assessing of which partner is sacrificing more for the good of the team.Many of these issues are revealed as the couples sit side by side on a gray couch in the sparsely decorated office of Dr. May Foster (Jane Alexander), a poised, snowy-haired therapist they’re seeing in hope of repairing their eroding relationships. It is part of the quirky integrity of the show that viewers get a glimpse of the sex life of the therapist too. Maybe it’s because Dr. Foster’s marriage of 43 years is solid, and she has no privacy-draining children.Meanwhile, because Ms. Walker’s Katie is a middle-aged mother of two, she spends much of the series padding around the family home in baggy casual wear, emotionally adrift and wondering why she and her genial husband (Tim DeKay) become total strangers when they close the door of the master bedroom.It was roughly three years ago that Ms. Mort, a film and television writer who began her career as a supervising producer on the ABC blue-collar comedy “Roseanne,” started noticing how many of her married friends rejected the notion of divorce, but seemed to be unhappy. “I began to wonder when two people who spend their lives together, have kids or don’t have kids but are in love, are no longer able to reach across the bed and touch each other,” Ms. Mort said. “What happened in that space? That’s what I wanted to dismantle and put back together.”But would HBO executives, accustomed to scheduling big, polished, glossy dramas like “Rome” and “Deadwood,” think that this was the type of show that would help them fill the post-“Sopranos” void? Even Ms. Mort was not sure until she received a call from HBO’s president for entertainment, Carolyn Strauss. “I knew they were into it because she said, ‘Look, it’s not going to be easy, but we’re up for it if you are.’ ”When asked what it was like months and months later, to view the eye-popping footage borne of this arrangement, Ms. Strauss said: “Obviously it’s always very, like, ‘Whoa!’ But I think it’s all in the language of a relationship. It’s not there to be prurient. We talked about it a lot prior to. It wasn’t anything that was shocking. We knew what we were going to get.”Of course even if all the physically graphic content were excised from “Tell Me You Love Me,” the series would still feel different from most other television shows. While it’s filmed on location in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles, the actual city where the action takes place is never identified. And though everyone is gainfully employed, what the characters do for a living is almost tangential.“I wanted a voyeuristic feel,” Ms. Mort said about the tone she was aiming for. “That was important to me, just being there with a person.”Adam Scott, who plays Palek, a young real estate investor who is working on having a child with his high-powered-lawyer wife, described a scene where a character sits in her car watching her boyfriend roam through a gas station convenience store. “There’s no music,” Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview. “You just hear the sounds of the gas station and what it sounds like in the inside of a car when you’re waiting for someone to come back from buying their soda. The show feels like it’s comprised of things that happen between scenes on other shows, things you recognize from life — not things you recognize from television or movies.”Mr. Scott’s point is made no better than in the counseling session scenes where seemingly pleasant exchanges — “So, what’s going on?” “Uh, not much. How about you?” — soon open the floodgates on painful revelations. In these scenes the long, queasy silences and the tight voices and stricken expressions on the faces of the couples are authentic enough to assume that Ms. Mort had had her own adventures in therapy.“Oh, off and on,” Ms. Mort replied with a light wave of her hand. “I’m slightly crazy, but not in a dramatic way. But, yeah, I think there’s value in it.”At the time Ms. Mort said this, she was eating a piece of buttered wheat toast as she sat slumped in an easy chair in the lobby of the Chateau Marmont Hotel here. Perhaps in deference to a hotel guest who sat nearby typing on a laptop, Ms. Mort would whisper or even silently mouth the parts of her answers that contained salty language. But what others might consider controversial, she sees matter-of-factly.“Immediately what you feel with certain pitches is a point of view from the person who is going to execute the work. I think certainly with Cynthia that’s what you felt,” Ms. Strauss said when asked why HBO was willing to gamble on Ms. Mort, who at 47 has never overseen a series by herself and is HBO’s first female show runner. “She came in, and she knew exactly what she wanted to talk about. There’s a couple of people you just know. You just go: ‘You know what? We’ll roll the dice. We’ll see what happens.’ ”But television executives are one thing. What will others think of “Tell Me You Love Me”? “I don’t know how critics will respond,” Ms. Mort said. “I’m sure they’ll want to talk about Jane, that we dare to show 60-somethings au naturel. But what are you going to do?” Would she be insulted, Ms. Mort was asked, if interest in the choreography and running time of the sex scenes overshadowed any discussion of the series’ more serious intentions as a raw television drama about the trials of monogamy?“I won’t be offended,” Ms. Mort said with a laugh. “But I will be a little irritated.”'"

"'07-07-13,'1','In the anime “Tekkonkinkreet,” two orphans of life’s storms sail through the air like birds, like superheroes, like Jackie Chan. Known as Black and White (voiced by Kazunari Ninomiya and Yu Aoi), the boys live in an atmospherically derelict and imaginary Japanese place called Treasure Town, a surreal explosion of skewed angles, leaning towers, hanging wires, narrow alleys and gaudily cute flourishes that bring to mind a yakuza cityscape by way of a Hello Kitty theme park. Pigs don’t fly here, though these two children certainly do with a flourish.Perched like a crow high above the streets, Black watches over this strange, nearly all-male realm, fending off interlopers while keeping tabs on White. The two boys sleep in a broken-down car parked in a seemingly abandoned garage, far from both the prying and the protection of the grown-up world. Save for an avuncular prune, Gramps (Rokuro Naya),, the adults who pass through their lives, including a couple of kindly cops and some oddly dressed gang members (they look ready to rumble with droogs), generally pass through without much comment. They offer the children greetings though precious little else, which makes the loneliness that clings to Black and White — illustrated by the expressive use of negative space — all the more poignant and unacceptable.Beautiful and a touch bewildering, “Tekkonkinkreet” kinks up a fairly familiar story of love and loyalty with a helping of underworld crime action, the usual juvenile agonies and some fuzzy philosophy. The first-time feature director Michael Arias, an American who lives and works in Japan, stuffs a lot of exposition and action into 100 eminently watchable if baggy minutes. But the laudably ambitious screenplay attributed to Anthony Weintraub tends to distract as much as it engages. Amid all the sharp turns, the periodic slicing and dicing, the gangsters and the shifty deals, the old man in the bathhouse and the snake in its lair, it can be tough to pinpoint what precisely Black and White are up to, much less the filmmakers.Even so, “Tekkonkinkreet” demands to be seen, if only for its beauty. The generally bright palette and overall soft look work a nice contrast to the dark theme, as if the world itself were on the children’s side. The character design of the boys is particularly lovely, almost loving, from the scar slashed across Black’s right eye like a warning to the hat shaped like a bear’s head that White wears, his mischievous, smiling face peeping through the animal’s open mouth. There’s a touch of Saint-Exupéry’s “Little Prince” in these two children, whose adventures and lessons seem plucked right from this book: “To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups. ...” And that, as everyone knows, would be disastrous.“Tekkonkinkreet” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some adult language, fighting and bloodshed.Directed by Michael Arias; written (in Japanese, with English subtitles) by Anthony Weintraub, based on the manga by Taiyo Matsumoto; animation and production design by Studio4°C; music by Plaid; produced by Eiko Tanaka, Eiichi Kamagata, Masao Teshima and Ayao Ueda; released by Destination Films.

"'07-07-13,'1','His speech drew more reporters and camera crews than any other since he formally announced his campaign for president in April. This time, they were there to ask about his campaign woes. When Mr. McCain was asked if there was any instance in which he could envision dropping out before the New Hampshire primary next year, he replied, “Contracting a fatal disease.”Mr. McCain acknowledged that his support of the Iraq war was costing him with the independent voters who helped propel him to victory in the New Hampshire primary in 2000. And at the luncheon here on Friday — where the crowd greeted him with a standing ovation and later applauded his remarks on federal spending and laughed at his jokes — his somber speech on the war was not interrupted by applause a single time.Mr. McCain, who always notes when he talks about the war that it was “terribly mismanaged,” called for increasing the size of the Army and the Marines to 900,000 members, up from the 750,000 currently planned, which he said would cost $15 billion a year. He voiced support for creating an Army Adviser Corps to work with allied militaries abroad. And he spoke of creating a new civil-military agency similar to the Office of Strategic Services from World War II to fight terrorism.“I have told you how I intend to fight this war,” he said. “Other candidates will argue for a different course. Democratic candidates for president will argue for the course of cutting our losses and withdrawing from the threat in the vain hope it will not follow us here. I cannot join them in such wishful and very dangerous thinking. Peace at any price is an illusion, and its costs are always more tragic than the sacrifices that victory requires.”After the speech, Judy Havenstein, a supporter in the audience, asked him what he would do to try to win over the more than 60 percent of Americans who now support bringing the troops home. Mr. McCain responded that he would just try to make better arguments, and that he would not be moved by the polls.“My whole life has prepared me for this task,” he said. “I spent my life in the military and on national security issues, and I am fully prepared.”Ms. Havenstein said in an interview that she appreciated the way Mr. McCain was unafraid to voice unpopular views.“There’s lots of little policies we could talk about,” she said, “but if you boil it all down to a leader — that’s what I’m looking for, someone who will say what he means whether it’s what I want to hear or not.”It is something the McCain campaign hopes he will get credit for from the voters. But, as Mr. McCain himself said jokingly later in a conference call, “It hasn’t worked so far, but you can always hope.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','WASHINGTON, July 13 — Two leading Republican senators said today that President Bush should seek a new war authorization and present a plan to Congress by Oct. 16 outlining contingency plans in Iraq. Those plans, which would include reducing American forces, should begin by the end of the year.Senators John W. Warner of Virginia and Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, both of whom have criticized the administration’s troop buildup plan, introduced a measure expected to be considered next week when the Iraq war debate resumes. The senators said it was critical to move beyond the current clash between Congress and the White House and begin making plans to be implemented after the military releases its progress report in September.“I continue to counsel the president and his administration to move now to construct a more sustainable policy in Iraq that reduces our troop commitments and transitions away from the missions of interposing ourselves between sectarian factions,” Mr. Lugar said in a statement.Mr. Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Warner, a former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, are viewed among Republicans as respected and reasoned voices on the war debate. They had both agreed to withhold judgment until the interim report on Iraq that was presented Thursday to Congress.One of the main elements of their amendment, which was filed shortly after noon today, would require the president to seek a new rationale for the war authorization by the time Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top military commander in Iraq, delivers a report in September on the progress of the troop buildup. The measure also would require the president to review and update the National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq no later than Sept. 4.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','After allowing a run on a sacrifice fly, and with his pitch count at 102, Pettitte could not escape the sixth inning.Yankees Manager Joe Torre said before the game that Pettitte needed to regain command of his pitches. When it was over, Torre seemed satisfied. “I thought his command was better,” Torre said. “I thought he mixed his pitches pretty well.”But even as he earned his first victory since June 14, his performance was far from vintage Pettitte. He said after the game that he lacked rhythm and that he still felt out of sync. He also said his command was shaky.Pettitte ran into trouble in the bottom of the fourth inning, allowing a double, a walk and a single to load the bases with no outs. But with a strikeout, a sacrifice fly and another strikeout, he escaped with minimal damage, something that he might not have been able to do earlier this month.“I’m very grateful to be able to get out of that inning only giving up one run,” Pettitte said. “Whenever I get in that situation, I’m like, If I can just give up one here, that’d be great. So that was nice to be able to make some pitches and get a couple of strikeouts and get out of that inning with only one run. That was pretty big.”Pettitte’s pitch count was already 75 after the fourth inning and that, more than anything, foretold the early exit that was to come.Pettitte fell into a deep slump before the All-Star Game break, with one of the worst two-game performances of his career. He pitched one and two-thirds innings on July 1, giving up seven earned runs against the Oakland Athletics. Five days later, he allowed eight earned runs in five innings against the Los Angeles Angels.Though Pettitte defeated the Devil Rays, his E.R.A. rose slightly, to 4.27.“There were some positives tonight,” Pettitte said. “After the last two, you got to take this as a positive.”Pettitte was good enough Thursday to leave his team with a 6-3 lead in the sixth, and the form he showed may be enough to get quality starts over the next month. The Yankees will not face a team with a record currently above .500 until Aug. 10.It also helped Pettitte that the Yankees showed off their offense. In winning their sixth game in their last eight, the Yankees managed 10 hits and 3 home runs. Bobby Abreu continued his hot streak by going 3 for 4 with a double and a home run.Perhaps the real test for Pettitte will come when the Yankees are not playing teams with losing records and are not getting quality support from their offense and their bullpen. The Yankees can only hope that by that time, it is as easy for Pettitte as it was at the beginning of the season.'"

Including debt, the transaction is worth $1.9 billion.Energizer is adding to its personal-care products like the Schick-Wilkinson Sword men’s shaving line because zinc, a metal used to make batteries, has become more expensive. In April, Energizer said zinc costs cut into profit.The two companies have “similar customers and distribution channels in the U.S. and Canada,” Energizer’s chief executive, Ward M.

"'07-07-13,'1','General Electric will abandon the subprime mortgage market by selling the company’s unit that makes loans to borrowers with weak credit histories. The decision to sell the unit, WMC Mortgage, was announced by the company yesterday in an e-mail message to employees, and confirmed by a person who had read it.The current subprime market environment has had a negative impact on the business, Laurent Bossard, chief executive of unit, wrote in the memo.Russell Wilkerson, a spokesman for the company declined, to comment on the memo or sale.Defaults in the subprime market have exploded this year, causing more than 50 subprime lenders to shut their doors. General Electric entered the subprime market three years ago.In the past year, WMC Mortgage laid off more than 1,200 workers, reducing its staff to about 700.In the year’s first quarter, the company announced that it had made just $3.4 billion in new loans, down from $9 billion in the preceding quarter.The company has been aggressively selling loans on its books, decreasing its portfolio by $3 billion, and leaving the unit with less than $1.5 billion.Analysts said that it was unlikely G.E. had already identified a buyer, but that the company had hired Morgan Stanley as advisers in the sale.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','But the ambient business and political wattage, some arrayed in shorts and flip-flops like the former C.I.A. director George Tenet, make it too tantalizing to miss. News has been known to have been made here — the marriage of ABC and Capital Cities was arranged in Sun Valley and the courting of YouTube last year ended with Google stepping up to the plate a few months later — but there is a huge emphasis on informality and a sincere effort to include the families of those attending.The programming is hardly onerous — a couple of hours in the morning and then it’s off for golf or whitewater kayaking. But while moguls may come to frolic, there is very little profiling or preening, in part because of Allen & Company’s mellow management of the event.“You could randomly pick any event and it would be far more pretentious than this one,” said Blake Krikorian, a founder of Sling Media, which makes a device that allows consumers to shift content from home to wherever they are, and one of this year’s potential beanie babies in terms of acquisitions.The informality hides a kabuki where business and finance folks pivot from table to table, and reporters, standing at a distance, try and conjure something, anything out of juxtapositions. Most of the speed dating about potential deals takes place out on the paths, away from prying eyes. Reporters are tolerated as optional amenities.Harvey Weinstein, normally a garrulous type had little to say to reporters.A few of those in attendance will stop and drop an aphorism or two about the proceedings, mostly it seems, out of pity. Rupert Murdoch, who is here with his wife, Wendi Deng, will have none of it, smiling in glee as he slipped out while reporters were busy listening to Mr. Brin.Still, there Mr. Murdoch stood yesterday afternoon, far out in the parking lot near the Inn with David F. DeVoe, the chief financial officer of his company, the News Corporation. Given the drama over his company’s possible purchase of Dow Jones & Company — Mr. Murdoch told The Associated Press that the Bancoft family “keep changing their minds” — it was striking to see the two men in khakis, their tennis shoes bumping the asphalt as they spoke. Their conversation was probably as significant as it is unknowable. The Sun Valley conference has been like that: full of portent and empty of current content. Here’s a few peeks from a distance:The media, an asymmetric threat that will worm into any available space, have overtaken the bar at the Inn, one of the few places that is not cordoned off with a full-stop sign, one that says, “Private Event.” Yesterday, Mr. Stringer ambled in with a clutch of newspapers for a quiet afternoon read, seemingly unaware that he had stepped into a den of hungry jackals. Most left him alone. With a deadline looming, I did not feel I had that luxury.In general, Sony is well situated at a time when deals have given way to efforts to remain relevant on all types of platforms. With its hands in content, devices and software, Sony is one of the more converged companies in the game and has the share price to show for it.Mr. Stringer said that there was no question that this conference, with its blend of the old and the new, the young and the old, represented a new kind of melting pot for technology and business.“The events of the last two years have gotten everyone’s attention so that no one is complacent,” he said. “I think the overlaps between software, hardware and content are now so significant, that people are rushing to understand the new distributions forms.”“The hostility toward people that are perceived as pirates has evaporated in the face of changes that are so profound it is difficult to predict what may happen even in the very near future,” he said. “Synergy is back with a vengeance and I don’t have to defend myself anymore because the ability to access content any time, any where on any kind of device is now accepted.”Having made a reporter’s day, he went back to his papers.“You guys,” Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of Time Warner, said, indicating a nearby gaggle of reporters, “have to think that there is more going on here than there is.” He continued: “The plain fact is that you have to look at how the conference has changed. We are dealing in a lot bigger issues than we used to — flat earth, terrorism, war — than just deals.”“This is what it looks like, which is some socializing, some schmoozing, and yes, some learning. I’ve had some interesting conversations and some time to relax. It’s been a great event.”Mr. Brin, sitting atop the zeitgeist at Google, is hardly a press hound. But as one of the people of the moment, he was willing to show a little leg on the way out of yesterday morning’s conferences. Standing in the lobby of the Inn, he took questions after a morning panel.What about Facebook? That’s the social networking start-up that has Silicon Valley in blogging overdrive these days — partly because of the site’s growth spurt, but also because of its new “Facebook Platform” that lets developers build shareable applications. Yahoo offered to buy Facebook for nearly $1 billion last year but its overtures were turned down.“Facebook? I really like the Facebook guys,” Mr. Brin said, pausing as if to consider what might be the right thing to say. “We don’t really look at companies for acquisitions unless they are really interested. If they come to us, we’d certainly be open to talking. But I think they’re building a great company of their own.”All indications, including that one, seem to suggest that Facebook will make its own way to the market.Mr. Brin was asked if he was worried that all of the hype around social networks will take some of the heat out of the Google phenomenon. Naw, he said — content is content. “It only added to it,” he said. “Social networks are creating lots and lots of content, which was the subject of the panel and that means more for us to search.”I slinked back to a table in the Inn after the noon break and was typing a few items for the DealBook blog — and then suddenly heard an avuncular, folksy voice — the voice of God, only less scary, from the next table over.Warren E. Buffett, modestly holding forth, for a group of folks. Paydirt. “Content has many ways of getting to the world, we’ve learned that,” Mr. Buffett said. “But the problem is, you still have only two eyeballs to take it in ...”Just then, a gigantic security guard came over to the table where DealBook had been sitting on and off, and said, “Are you going to make us move them,” gesturing toward Mr. Buffett and his group, “by sitting here and writing down everything he says?”I guess not. I grabbed my stuff and slinked away.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','Peter J. Henning, a professor of securities law at Wayne State University in Detroit, said executives of public companies are required to make financial disclosures available to all investors, not just a select few.“He wasn’t speaking on behalf of the company,” Professor Henning said, adding, “He certainly was talking about it. And he was attempting to influence the stock price.”After hearing some of Rahodeb’s postings, Professor Henning added, “I would have to believe that Whole Foods’ general counsel nearly keeled over when they learned about this.”Lewis D. Lowenfels, a securities law expert at Tolins & Lowenfels in New York, said he, too, believed that Mr. Mackey’s remarks could be illegal.“For a C.E.O. of a public company to make public postings regarding his company while concealing his true identity behind a pseudonym may, in and of itself, be an illegal misrepresentation.”A spokesman at the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.Mr. Mackey’s online pseudonym, Rahodeb, surfaced in a sealed court document that was filed last month by the Federal Trade Commission but only became public Wednesday evening. The agency is trying to block Whole Foods’ $565 million buyout of Wild Oats Markets on the grounds that it would limit competition.In the court document, F.T.C. lawyers cite a remark that Rahodeb wrote about Wild Oats to bolster its case. “Whole Foods is systematically destroying their viability as a business — market by market, city by city.”When the merger was announced in February, Mr. Mackey said he had previously tried to acquire Wild Oats about six years earlier but the deal fell through. About that time, in April 2001, Rahodeb had this to say about Wild Oats: “I find it simply amazing that some investors continue to have faith in this company.”Rahodeb added later in the same posting, “The ‘emperor has no clothes’! Am I the only one who sees this?”Whole Foods’ public relations staff declined to comment yesterday, and Mr. Mackey was not available for comment.On the company Web site, Mr. Mackey wrote on Wednesday night that his online postings were simply for fun and that he never disclosed proprietary company information. He said he often took contrary positions for the sake of argument.“Rahodeb’s postings therefore do not represent any official beliefs, policies or intentions by either Whole Foods Market or by me,” Mr. Mackey wrote.David Gardner, co-founder of the Motley Fool and a longtime champion of Whole Foods stock, said it would be difficult for Mr. Mackey to continue leading the company since its code of conduct and ethics warns against such activities.The code reads: “Team members have a primary business responsibility to WFM and are expected to avoid any activity that may interfere or have the appearance of interfering with the fulfillment of this responsibility.”“You look at this and say it looks like he acted in violation of his own code,” Mr. Gardner said. “I clearly think he should step aside for a while.”John B. Elstrott, a Whole Foods board member and a professor of entrepreneurship at Tulane University in New Orleans, declined to discuss Mr. Mackey’s future, saying only, “This too shall pass.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','“As a matter of principle, the Russians will not have companies as owners of the assets underground,” Jan T. Thompson, an energy attaché at the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow, said in a telephone interview. The Norwegian companies Statoil and Norsk Hydro had also bid for a role in the Shtokman field.“Some other formula had to be found,” Mr. Thompson said. “This would seem to be that formula.”The operating company with Total as a minority partner will also help finance the field, considered one of the most technically challenging energy projects in the world. It will not own the gas that is eventually produced, or have any say over where it is sold. Gazprom will retain the license to the field through a separate subsidiary, the company said in its statement.A spokeswoman for Total declined to elaborate, other than to say Christophe de Margerie, the chief executive, plans to be in Moscow on Friday for a signing ceremony.The field, expected to go online in 2013, can supply either the East Coast of the United States or Europe. It holds 3.7 trillion cubic meters of gas and 31 million metric tons of gas condensate, or the equivalent of enough to supply the total gas demand of countries in the European Union for seven years.The chief executive of Gazprom, Aleksei B. Miller, presented the deal as a positive step, perhaps healing the breach with foreign companies opened after the forced sales of Shell and BP property.Shell — just six months after the loss of control its Sakhalin II project — also expressed interest in further work in Russia this week by signing a partnership agreement with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company.Russia holds the world’s largest reserves of natural gas and eighth-largest reserves of oil, according to the International Energy Agency in Paris.The Shtokman field, far above the Arctic Circle, is dark six months of the year and subject to fierce winds and storms. Platforms would need to be impervious to icebergs. And once extracted, the gas would have to travel by undersea pipeline to Russia’s northern coast.Negotiations, which have been going on almost since the field was discovered in 1988, with two previous consortium deals collapsing, became a balancing act between the oil majors’ offer of technical help and the Russians’ insistence on national control.“Historically, the majors tended to control projects,” Charles Swanson, a managing partner in the Houston office of Ernst & Young, said. “Now, national oil companies dictate terms. Like it or not, it’s the wave of the future.”In such deals, oil majors sometimes cannot book the reserves under Security and Exchange Commission rules because it is unclear what, if anything, they control, he said.Before a cooling in American-Russian relations last year, the Shtokman field had been the centerpiece of a continuing effort by the Bush administration to encourage direct Russian oil and natural gas shipments to the United States, as a method of diversifying supplies away from the Middle East.But in October Gazprom abruptly halted talks with five foreign oil companies — Total, Norsk Hydro and Statoil, and ConocoPhillips and Chevron of the United States — and said it would develop the Shtokman field on its own. Mr. Miller said at the time that companies might be invited back as contractors.Total, the Norwegians and ConocoPhillips continued talks; Chevron said it was no longer interested. Norsk Hydro and Statoil are in a merger planned for Oct. 1, and will be called StatoilHydro.Total had not done well in Russia recently. The company owns 50 percent of a midsize production sharing agreement in the Russian north. But just last year, Rosneft canceled a partnership with Total to develop the $3 billion Vankor oil field in Siberia, and Total lost a court appeal of the decision.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','BOSTON, July 12 — The Rhode Island attorney general dismissed charges on Thursday against a man accused of raping a teenager 32 years ago when he was 16.Michael J. Healey, a spokesman for the attorney general, Patrick C. Lynch, said that prosecuting the case against the man, Harold Allen, 48, of Narragansett, would be problematic because the woman making the accusations said that she had repressed the memory of the attack for more than 30 years.The dismissal, filed in Washington County Superior Court, said that because of Rhode Island case law, “the high burden for admissibility, at trial, of testimony based on repressed memory” would create “a legal impediment that the state is unlikely to overcome.”Mr. Lynch said in the statement: “Perhaps a prosecutor’s greatest power is to dismiss a charge and end an unwarranted criminal prosecution. In this case, focusing upon the legal issues that have arisen due to the passage of time since the alleged crime occurred, we have dismissed the charge.”Mr. Healey said that prosecutors had also mistakenly charged Mr. Allen under a statute, first-degree sexual assault, that did not exist at the time that the rape was supposed to have occurred.“Because the law that we used to indict didn’t exist then, we also would have problems prosecuting this case, and it wouldn’t be right for us to press on,” Mr. Healey said.'"

"'07-07-13,'1','Germany’s debate underscores the growing conviction of security officials here that German cities will not escape the kinds of attacks that have bloodied London, Glasgow, Madrid and Istanbul since 9/11, a plot hatched by militant Muslims who used Hamburg as a refuge.Last month Mr. Schäuble warned that Germany faced a heightened threat of attack, possibly even a suicide bombing, because of its military engagement in Afghanistan. His deputy, August Hanning, said the danger level was comparable to that of the months before 9/11.The debate also comes at a time of rising tension within Germany’s large, mostly Turkish, Muslim population. On Thursday, four major Turkish groups boycotted an annual meeting on integration held by Mrs. Merkel, to protest the recent tightening of German immigration laws.Given the growing concerns, several experts here said, it is time for Germany to re-evaluate the balance between personal liberties and collective security in its counterterrorism policy.“We need this discussion about how far we have to go, and how far we can go legally,” said Guido Steinberg, who advised the previous chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, on terrorism issues.Mr. Steinberg, now a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs in Berlin, said some of Mr. Schäuble’s proposals, particularly targeted killings, went too far.But he said Germany needed to close other loopholes in its laws, including one that distinguishes between giving material support to a terrorist group, which is a crime, and simply promoting its message, which is not.While few here want to set up a German outpost like the Guantánamo Bay military prison, current laws in Germany prevent the authorities from detaining people who they believe might be terrorist conspirators but whom they cannot extradite.Mr. Schäuble has been calling for more muscular policies to combat terrorism since he joined the current government in 2005. A seasoned Christian Democratic leader, Mr. Schäuble, 64, is regarded as a shrewd tactician and one of the political heavyweights in Mrs. Merkel’s cabinet.In January he said he would seek a constitutional amendment to allow authorities to shoot down a hijacked airplane to head off a terrorist attack. The Federal Constitutional Court struck down a similar law proposed by the previous government in 2006.He also has not hesitated to seize on terrorist threats, at home or abroad, to press his agenda. Mr. Schäuble’s latest public-relations campaign came days after the botched car-bombings in London.“The old categories no longer apply,” he said in an interview in the German weekly Der Spiegel. “We have to clarify whether our constitutional state is sufficient for confronting the new threats.”Describing a situation in which Osama bin Laden’s exact whereabouts were discovered, Mr. Schäuble said, “The Americans would execute him with a missile, and most people would say, ‘Thank God.’ ”These remarks, which were confirmed by a ministry spokesman, brought heated criticism from opposition leaders and even some Social Democratic members of his own “grand coalition” government.“He would lead the country down a very dangerous path,” said the co-chairman of the opposition Green Party, Reinhard Bütikofer. “He is advocating the exact opposite of what Prime Minister Gordon Brown has demonstrated so admirably: a combination of determination and equanimity.”No other European country has publicly debated its terrorism laws since the failed British attacks. One of the few responses of any kind has come from France’s new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who reiterated his support for installing 1,000 closed-circuit surveillance cameras in Paris.The timing and nature of the debate in Germany troubled some experts.“One of the time-honored tactics of terrorists is to draw governments into overreacting,” said Gijs de Vries, a Dutchman who is the former counterterrorism coordinator for the European Union. “Governments should resist public pressure to pile on new measures after each incident.”But Germany is also debating this issue now because of its deep involvement in Afghanistan. Germany has 3,000 troops there, part of a NATO force that has battled a persistent Taliban insurgency.With the Parliament scheduled to vote in October on whether to extend the deployment, security officials worry that Germans, either in Afghanistan or at home, could become targets for attacks.Last July Germany narrowly avoided a potentially deadly attack after a pair of suitcase bombs failed to explode on commuter trains. The suspects, from Lebanon, were said to be enraged by satirical cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper.That close call, Mr. Schäuble said in Der Spiegel, shows, “We could be struck at any time.”Still, for now, he is facing a German public that treasures its liberties at least as much as its security. Already, his campaign has drawn unflattering historical parallels. On the Internet, a group promoting data privacy has sold T-shirts with Mr. Schäuble’s image above the slogan “Stasi 2.0” — a reference to an “improved” version of the reviled State Security Ministry of the former East Germany.Peter Waldmann, a terrorism expert and emeritus professor at the University of Augsburg, said even a major attack would not overturn the German consensus in favor of protecting individual rights.The shock of learning that the 9/11 attacks had been plotted in Hamburg was not enough, Mr. Waldmann said, because Germans comforted themselves that the threat was directed against the United States, not at Germany itself.Now, authorities say the threat is directed squarely at Germans, which may make it tougher for people here to dismiss Mr. Schäuble’s arguments.“If something happened, the same people who are criticizing him for going too far would criticize him for not going far enough,” said Eckart Klein, a professor of law at the University of Potsdam.Some experts suggest that the real goal of Mr. Schäuble’s campaign is to win agreement on rules allowing secret searches of computer hard drives — something that seems within reach after officials from the Social Democratic Party said this week that they were open to a dialogue on the issue.As for his more draconian proposals, Mr. Schäuble’s aides said he welcomed the sharp reaction.“He’s trying to force our society to face up to these really difficult questions, for example, killing a terrorist,” said Christian Sachs, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. “The German public has tried to stick its head in the sand, ignoring this dimension of this unorthodox war.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','The hearing came two days after former Surgeon General Richard H. Carmona told a House committee that Bush administration officials had repeatedly tried to weaken or suppress important public health reports because of political considerations.Again and again, senators asked Dr. Holsinger whether he could stand up to similar political pressure. Indeed, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee, began the hearing by announcing that he would soon introduce legislation to give the surgeon general’s office greater political independence.Senator Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont, told Dr. Holsinger that what had “happened to Dr. Carmona sounds more like what would happen frankly under Stalinist Russia.”Dr. Holsinger assured the senators that he would not sacrifice his principles.“If I were faced with a situation that I felt I could not in good conscience do, I think I have a clear response to that. I would resign,” he said.If confirmed, Dr. Holsinger said that his top three priorities would be tackling childhood obesity, “making America a tobacco-free nation” and improving the ability of the Public Health Service to respond to emergencies. He said he supported President Bush’s stem cell policy, which prohibits federal financing of some stem cell research.A difficult moment in the hearing for Dr. Holsinger came when Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, began her questioning. Fifteen years ago, Ms. Mikulski was chairwoman of a Senate committee with oversight of the Department of Veterans Affairs, where Dr. Holsinger was the chief medical officer.“Well, Dr. Holsinger, we meet again,” Ms. Mikulski began. “As I recall those times, we did not have a good time together. You were often indifferent or dismissive of oversight.”She accused him of mishandling a sexual harassment scandal at an Atlanta veterans’ hospital. Dr. Holsinger, the father of four adult daughters, countered, “I care greatly about issues of women’s health.”From 1994 to 2003, Dr. Holsinger served as chancellor of the medical center at the University of Kentucky and then as the state’s health secretary until 2005. His tenure in those jobs won praise from state lawmakers in both parties and advocates for the mentally ill, disabled and elderly.As the state’s top health official, he fought for more accessible and flexible care and pushed to raise taxes on cigarettes and limit junk food in schools.Dr. Holsinger told the panel that “we need to have every American covered for health care.”“We have spent years Band-Aiding our system,” Dr. Holsinger said. He did not offer an opinion about how to fix the system.Because of the August recess, the committee is unlikely to vote on Dr. Holsinger’s nomination until September. Republicans on the panel expressed support for the nomination.Dr. Holsinger’s wife, three of his four daughters and his 98-year-old mother were in the audience during the hearing. His mother, Ruth R. Holsinger, said after the hearing that “for many years, I was father and mother to my child” while her husband fought in World War II and the Korean War. She said she was pleased by his testimony, although she admitted that she could not hear it all.“I see my son standing tall like his dad,” she said.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','TORONTO, July 12 (AP) — Edwin Mirvish, the businessman known as Honest Ed and the flamboyant producer who restored the famed Old Vic theater in London, died here on Wednesday. He was 92.His death was announced by his family.Mr. Mirvish got his nickname from his popular Toronto discount store. His theater career began in 1963, when he bought the stately Royal Alexandra Theater and saved it from demolition.Besides buying and restoring the Old Vic in 1982, he and his son, David, built the Princess of Wales Theater, which opened in Toronto in 1993. Their theater productions introduced Canadian audiences to musical blockbusters like “The Lion King,” “Mamma Mia!” and “Miss Saigon.”Mr. Mirvish opened his discount emporium in 1948 in the heart of Toronto’s immigrant district. His first newspaper ad read: “Our building is a dump! Our service is rotten!... But ...!!! Our prices are the lowest in town!”He once said he named his store Honest Ed’s because “it was so ridiculous. As soon as you claim to be honest, everybody gets suspicious.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','T-Mobile is targeting experienced riders like Hincapie and younger Americans whose names are not widely known outside cycling, Stapleton said, and his strategy is twofold. First, though T-Mobile is part of Deutsche Telekom, the German telecommunications giant, Deutsche Telekom earns a substantial portion of its revenues from T-Mobile’s cellphone service in North America.Second, with the Discovery Channel team struggling to find a sponsor for next year and beyond, “maybe there is a little bit of a vacuum there for us to exploit,” Stapleton said.Discovery Communications, the cable television company that is the parent of the Discovery Channel, said earlier this year that it would not continue its sponsorship of the team, which began in 2005. Team officials said they were talking with several potential sponsors but that no deal had been finalized. They acknowledged that some of the difficulty in attracting candidates had come as news of illegal doping dominated the headlines in recent months.T-Mobile is also hoping to gain notice for its antidoping program, which it has heavily promoted. The program uses baseline values of riders’ physiological measurements to monitor them throughout the season, with the aim of catching illegal drug use before it affects a race.But T-Mobile has been fighting its own image problems lately. Ullrich was dismissed from the team last year after he was linked to the Spanish Operation Puerto doping investigation. This year, Erik Zabel, who now rides for the Milram team, and Bjarne Riis, the winner of the 1996 Tour de France, admitted they used performance-enhancing drugs while part of the Telekom team in the mid-1990s.Discovery is the only team on the ProTour, the top rank of professional cycling, that is based in the United States. Some European-based teams employ American cyclists, most notably CSC, which is based in Denmark but which is sponsored by an American technology company. CSC currently has two Americans, David Zabriskie and Christian Vande Velde, on its Tour de France squad, and it has long been the home of another, Bobby Julich.The Phonak team, based in Switzerland, was led by Floyd Landis, who finished first in the Tour de France in 2006 but who tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the race. An appeal is pending. And even the T-Mobile/Telekom squad has employed Americans; Kevin Livingstone defected from the United States Postal Service team in 2001, to the dismay of Armstrong.The T-Mobile team will still be based in Germany, Stapleton said, but with teams now using cyclists from several nations, where a team is based can sometimes be less important than the home nation of its top riders.T-Mobile’s current Tour de France team is led by the Australian rider Michael Rogers, and also has a British sprinter, Mark Cavendish, and riders from Luxembourg, Belgium and Austria, in addition to four Germans. The 29 riders on the extended T-Mobile team hail from 14 countries, Stapleton said.“We’ve gone from being a German team to being an international program,” he said. “I’ve talked to many of the top Americans. We are going to focus on younger riders, but also try to support them with some talented veterans.”Johan Bruyneel, the sports director of the Discovery Channel team, said that the team knew that several riders whose contracts end this year had been talking to other teams, but that he did not begrudge them for doing so, given the uncertainty about ongoing sponsorship.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','The immediate goal for the owners of The Green Monkey is a maiden special weight race this summer at Saratoga, where a victory would mean $37,200. Of course, that would still leave them $15,962,800 in the hole, but you have to start somewhere.The world’s most expensive racehorse may not be a lost cause after all. The Green Monkey, purchased by Coolmore Stud for a record $16 million in February 2006 at a 2-year-old sale, is finally nearing his debut. Unable to run for the last year because of problems with a gluteal muscle, The Green Monkey has had four workouts since mid-June and the trainer Todd Pletcher said yesterday the colt should be ready to race in about a month.“The next two or three works will really tell me where I am with his fitness and ability level,” Pletcher said. “The horse looks fantastic. I think the time off did him well, not just to allow the injury to heal up, but over all.”Before being sold last year at Fasig-Tipton’s Calder select juvenile auction, the then-unnamed son of the sire Forestry worked an eighth of a mile in a sensational 9.8 seconds. That ignited a bidding war between the two most powerful breeding and racing operations in the world, Coolmore and Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum’s Darley Stud. Coolmore prevailed, bidding $16 million. That shattered the previous record price for a horse at auction, the $13.1 million that Sheik Mohammed paid in 1985 for Seattle Dancer.With no horse having earned more than $9.99 million on the racetrack, the only way The Green Monkey can pay for himself is to have a successful career at stud, where he could earn hundreds of millions of dollars if he can establish himself as one of the world’s top sires. But the vast majority of good sires were good race horses first, so it is imperative that The Green Monkey accomplish something of importance on the racetrack.“Given one industry yardstick, that an entering stallion’s value is 300 times his initial stud fee, The Green Monkey would have to be able to stand for $50,000 to recoup his purchase price,” the breeding expert Bill Oppenheim said. “In order to justify that stud fee, and considering that his pedigree is O.K. but not mouth watering, I’d say he’d need to be a good Grade I stakes winner to be able to stand for that price.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','Mr. Padilla, who had just returned to the United States on a flight from Zurich, also told the agents that he had married an Egyptian woman but could not remember her telephone number.“It led me to believe that Mr. Padilla was being evasive with regard to his answers about his travels overseas,” Mr. Fincher said.Under defense questioning, Mr. Fincher conceded that Mr. Padilla could not recall his mother’s phone number or his most recent address in the United States.Mr. Padilla was carrying a picture of his baby sons at the time of his arrest, Mr. Fincher said, and a piece of paper with his mother’s contact information. Mr. Padilla told the agents that he had never been to Afghanistan, but that he had gone to Pakistan to study Islam on the advice of a Pakistani he met in Saudi Arabia.Earlier Thursday, a government expert in document analysis testified that Mr. Padilla could have filled out the training camp application in July 2000, the date written on it. But under defense questioning, the expert, Gerald LaPorte, acknowledged that there was no way to determine who filled it out or when.Most of the government’s case in the two-month trial focused on Mr. Padilla’s co-defendants, Adham Hassoun, a Palestinian computer programmer accused of recruiting men to be Qaeda fighters from his home in South Florida, and Kifah Jayyousi, a Jordanian-American school administrator in Detroit accused of providing money and equipment to terrorism groups overseas.Prosecutors played dozens of wiretapped calls in which they said the men used code phrases like “fresh air” and going “on the picnic” to discuss jihad activities in Kosovo, Somalia and Chechnya. But the F.B.I. agent who led the investigation, Special Agent Brian Kavanaugh, said under defense questioning that he could not be certain the men were speaking in code.Defense lawyers will probably try to convince jurors that the code theory is nonsense and that the wiretapped conversations — including one in which Mr. Hassoun and Mr. Jayyousi enthusiastically discussed a CNN interview with Osama bin Laden — were innocent. There is no evidence that Mr. Padilla ever saw or discussed the interview.The defense has sought to persuade jurors that in sending money and recruits to volatile Muslim countries, Mr. Hassoun and Mr. Jayyousi were only obeying a tenet of Islam: helping other Muslims who are under attack. They have described the persecution of Muslims in Chechnya, Kosovo and Somalia, and said that in the context of aiding them, jihad is not a malevolent act.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond who has followed the case, said the government had not put on a particularly strong case, but added, “It’s hard to read the jury on this.” Professor Tobias said the government’s most damaging evidence might have been the decade-old bin Laden interview, even though Judge Marcia Cooke told the jurors not to consider it evidence against Mr. Padilla.“It evokes 9/11,” Professor Tobias said, “and so even with the charge to the jury by Judge Cooke, it could be damaging to his case.”'"
"'07-07-13,'1','SALT LAKE CITY, July 12 (AP) — A chemicals maker, the Huntsman Corporation, agreed to a $6.5 billion buyout offer from an affiliate of Apollo Management on Thursday, terminating an earlier deal to sell itself at a lower price to a Dutch company.Apollo, through its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit, offered $28 a share in cash for Huntsman, which had previously accepted a bid of $25.25 a share from the Dutch manufacturer Basell.Huntsman, based in Salt Lake City, gave Basell until Wednesday to raise its bid but said Basell failed to do so.“We had a deal, and we were very comfortable with that,” a Basell spokeswoman, Patricia Vangheluwe, said. “We stick with that deal.”Huntsman’s chief executive, Peter R. Huntsman, said he could not ignore a bid that was hundreds of millions of dollars higher.Huntsman’s board approved the Apollo deal and recommended that shareholders vote in favor.Mr. Huntsman said his company paid a $200 million breakup fee to Basell. Hexion agreed to reimburse half of that fee.'"
"'07-07-13,'1','BEIJING, July 12 — A Chinese doctor who exposed the cover-up of China’s SARS outbreak in 2003 has been barred from traveling to the United States to collect a human rights award, a friend of the doctor and a human rights group said this week.The doctor, Jiang Yanyong, a retired surgeon in the People’s Liberation Army, was awarded the Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award by the New York Academy of Sciences. His army-affiliated work unit, Beijing’s Hospital 301, denied him permission to travel to the award ceremony in September, Hu Jia, a Chinese rights promoter who is a friend of Dr. Jiang’s, said Thursday.The Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy, which is based in Hong Kong, also issued a statement reporting the rejection of the travel request. The doctor could not be reached at his home for comment, and a person who answered the phone in the director’s office of Hospital 301 said the situation was unclear, declining to provide further details.Dr. Jiang rose to international prominence in 2003, when he disclosed in a letter circulated to international news organizations that at least 100 people were being treated in Beijing hospitals for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. At the time, the Chinese medical authorities were asserting that the entire nation had only a handful of cases of the disease.The revelation prompted China’s top leaders to acknowledge that they had provided false information about the epidemic. The health minister and the mayor of Beijing were removed from their posts.'"

"'07-07-13,'1','At a news conference yesterday, President Bush was asked what his own gut told him. “My gut tells me that — which my head tells me as well — is that when we find a credible threat, I’ll share it with people to make sure that we protect the homeland,” Mr. Bush said.So here we are, once again trying to decipher Delphic pronouncements from those charged with keeping us safe. Given New York’s exalted orange status, who has more reason to keep eyes peeled than us? But what exactly are we supposed to look for or to do? Rummage through the sock drawer for scraps of plastic sheeting and maybe a discarded roll of duct tape? Avoid ballparks and movie theaters? Keep off buses and subways?Mr. Chertoff’s “gut feeling” is an echo of vague admonitions from his Homeland Security predecessor, Tom Ridge, and from other senior officials. You may recall back-to-back warnings issued in May 2002. Vice President Dick Cheney said a new Al Qaeda attack was “almost certain,” and the F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, called suicide bombings in this country “inevitable.”No sensible person doubts that we face real threats from Islamic fanatics. It is why most New Yorkers have accepted with little protest glancing blows to civil liberties in the form of increased camera surveillance on streets and random bag inspections in the subways. The failed car bombings in London and Glasgow — a plot hatched by doctors, no less, the British authorities say — are sobering reminders of the risks.Still, “gut feelings” and other unspecific warnings may only reinforce a sense many people already have that the government’s message amounts to little more than: Always be afraid, be very afraid. A similar theme is echoed by some presidential candidates, not the least of them New York’s former mayor.The thing is, though, Al Qaeda’s leaders are supposed to be the ones running scared, not New Yorkers, who at times find themselves whipsawed emotionally when it comes to terrorism threats.Last month, for example, law enforcement officials disclosed what they called a plot to blow up fuel pipelines and storage tanks at Kennedy International Airport. The potential devastation was described as “unfathomable.” But then officials suggested that everyone take a deep breath; the plot was barely embryonic, they said, and system safeguards would have prevented any explosion from turning into a catastrophe.Many New Yorkers probably share the view of Representative Bennie G. Thompson of Mississippi, who is chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. He wrote to Mr. Chertoff, reminding him that “words have power” and must be chosen “wisely.”“What color code in the Homeland Security Advisory System is associated with a ‘gut feeling’?” Mr. Thompson wrote.Actually, there might be two colors: black and blue. They’re what you get when you’ve been bruised.'"

"'07-07-14,'0','“I come out of that history,” he said, “a history they can’t erase.”But the federal court where Mr. James’s case will be tried draws jurors from across northern New Jersey — both from Newark, where he remains a popular folk hero, and the largely white suburbs where he is viewed with suspicion — so legal experts say that any overt appeals to race would be risky. Instead, they predicted a fierce legal battle over the racial make-up of the jury during the jury selection process.“Race will be the white elephant in the room,” said Alberto Rivas, a former federal prosecutor who has represented several elected officials since becoming a defense lawyer.Unlike the previous investigations of Mr. James, which never led to charges because, prosecutors said, Mr. Mattison or other city officials could not be persuaded to testify against the mayor, this case is based largely on an extensive collection of financial records.The 33-count indictment details hundreds of credit card transactions that prosecutors cite as evidence that Mr. James fraudulently billed taxpayers for lavish personal travel and to entertain eight female companions.It also refers to an assortment of property records, charging that Mr. James used his office to help one of those women, Tamika Riley, buy city land at prices so far below market value that she quickly resold them for a profit of more than $600,000.Prosecutors accuse Mr. James of charging $2,976.64 on his city credit card to rent a storage unit where he hid the records of Ms. Riley’s land deals.In a hint at the approach prosecutors might take in court, Anne Milgram, New Jersey’s attorney general, lambasted Mr. James by noting that while presiding over a city where a third of the population lives in poverty, “He wasn’t even willing to pay $10 out of his own pocket to buy a movie ticket — he made the taxpayers do it.”In his public statements during the past year, Mr. James has said that his actions were responsible for jumpstarting Newark’s once-moribund real estate market, and that they were sanctioned by other officials. The land sales were approved by the City Council, he noted, and the credit charges reviewed by the finance office.But in addition to the documents, grand jurors heard testimony from at least three Newark police officers who accompanied Mr. James on trips and were asked to detail what, if any, city business took place. Prosecutors also elicited testimony from employees in the city development office who reportedly said that Mr. James had personally lobbied for Ms. Riley to receive preferential treatment in purchasing land.“In the end, every corruption case revolves around the question of the public person and the private person,” said Kim Guadagno, a former federal corruption prosecutor in Newark who is now running for sheriff in Monmouth County. “And what you need to do is show is that they can have one arm around a taxpayer’s shoulder and the other hand picking his pocket.”Some legal experts said they were surprised that after federal agents spent three years and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the case, the indictment made mention only of the land deals involving Ms. Riley.During his final years in office, Mr. James sold hundreds of city lots to friends, business associates and campaign donors at steeply reduced prices, and the city’s current mayor, Cory A. Booker, won a court injunction last year to halt many more deals.In the end, however, the case is likely to revolve around the competing narratives of Mr. James. Cathy Fleming, who defended another former Newark mayor, Kenneth A. Gibson, long after he left office on corruption charges that ended in a hung jury, said that with well-known political figures, it can be hard to find jurors who do not have a preconceived notion of the defendant.“But at least you want people with an open mind,” she said.'"
"'07-07-14,'0','This quarter, G.E. booked $13.1 billion in domestic and international orders for major equipment, which includes turbines and engines, up 54 percent from the period a year ago. That outpaced the 11 percent growth in orders for services, the more profitable part of the equipment business. Total orders in the quarter rose 32 percent, to $25 billion.The entertainment division, NBC Universal, continued its turnaround, and Mr. Immelt reiterated that he had no plans to sell the unit. The sale of the plastics business, which had been hurt by materials costs, removed a drag on industrial sales.“I haven’t had to look at benzene prices for six weeks,” Mr. Immelt said, “and that’s a relief.”“It’s been a while since our stock went up on an earnings report,” Keith S. Sherin, G.E.’s chief financial officer, said.Although G.E. shares have lagged in recent years, most analysts have maintained a buy rating. According to Thomson Financial, 15 of the 18 analysts who follow the company have a buy rating on the shares.“G.E. is a primary beneficiary of the global infrastructure boom, and we’re going to see double-digit order growth for the next several quarters,” said Deane M. Dray, who follows G.E. for Goldman Sachs.The quarter had some dark spots. G.E. still suffered from the implosion in the subprime mortgage market, a sector it entered three years ago.“It would have been a good business for them to avoid, and it is a good business for them to get out of,” said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at Standard & Poor’s Equity Research.Mr. Immelt said G.E. would likely sell other financial units besides WMC.GE Healthcare reported a 1 percent decline in revenue and an 8 percent decrease in profit, mostly because of lower sales of diagnostic imaging equipment. On Wednesday, G.E. and Abbott Laboratories called off a deal for G.E. to buy two Abbott diagnostic units for $8.1 billion.“I am troubled that they were unable to come to terms because G.E. could have dramatically increased the margins in that business,” said Daniel J. Rosenblatt, an analyst with Marble Harbor Investment Counsel, which owns G.E. shares.G.E. investors had shown dissatisfaction with the deal, sending shares down $4 in the two months after it was announced in April.“Investors always prefer the immediate certainty of buybacks to a risky, challenging acquisition,” Mr. Dray of Goldman Sachs said.Mr. Immelt said he had no replacement purchase in mind. “It’s a pretty safe bet that there will be no sizable acquisitions for the rest of 2007,” he said. But analysts are not as sure.“The health care companies are already pricey, and an acquisition rumor would drive prices even higher,” Mr. Tortoriello said. “So denying interest is certainly the prudent thing to do.”'"
"'07-07-14,'0','Intel in recent years has pursued a competing plan focused on training teachers to use somewhat more expensive computers equipped with Microsoft Windows software and applications.Mr. Barrett and Mr. Negroponte favored radically different educational approaches. The M.I.T. professor evoked a vision of self-teaching in which schoolchildren would teach each other both to use their computers and to learn.There is no plan yet to use Intel chips in future versions of the group’s laptop, which now uses an Advanced Micro Devices microprocessor.The organization, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., is still testing its laptop, which will have a price expected to fall to $100 by the end of 2008.The foundation said Friday that it intended to begin full-scale manufacturing at the end of September or early October.On Friday, executives at the organization, which has until now worked with Advanced Micro, declared that the organization had a big tent open to all comers.“By aligning here we are just going to help more kids,” said William A. Swope, an Intel vice president and the director of the company’s corporate affairs group. He said that in working through the issues between the organizations, executives had realized that the issues were not black and white.Intel contributes about $100 million to educational activities annually, he said, and the company now views the new partnership as a simple way to expand its impact.As part of the partnership, Mr. Swope will take a position on the One Laptop Per Child board and the group will use the chip maker’s server technology as a component in the educational systems that are deployed in countries abroad.Intel has also made a substantial contribution to the organization, but the dollar figure was not disclosed because the group is negotiating with several other companies to join the effort.Advanced Micro issued a statement welcoming Intel’s participation in the organization. In addition to supplying a version of its Geode microprocessor to the project, Advanced Micro has contributed $2 million to the effort since joining the organization in 2005.'"
"'07-07-14,'0','Dr. Ralph S. Paffenbarger Jr., an epidemiologist who led an early and long-running health study of Harvard graduates that has been influential in promoting vigorous exercise as a primary tool in preventing heart disease, died Monday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 84.The cause was heart failure, his family said.In the early 1960s, Dr. Paffenbarger and other researchers began to look at exercise and its effects on about 17,000 Harvard graduates, all men ranging in age from their 30’s to 70’s. The study, which was conducted at Harvard and Stanford, considered physical activities like sports, walking and climbing stairs and translated the exercise into calories expended by the men in the course of a week.By the 1970s, the study’s preliminary findings suggested that men burning 2,000 or more calories a week faced a substantially lower risk of death from heart disease than their more sedentary peers. Indeed, in 1984, Dr. Paffenbarger concluded that, among 640 men in the study who had died of cardiovascular disease, the death rate for the most sedentary was nearly twice that for the most active. By the ’90s, the study refined that figure, finding that regular exercise reduced coronary death rates by 25 percent to 33 percent.The results of the Harvard study became a major impetus for the aerobic exercise movement of the 1980s, as Dr. Paffenbarger and others argued that the benefits of exercise could accrue even if it was begun in middle age. He later calculated that vigorous activity, started early enough, could increase further life expectancy by one or even two years at age 80, adding that quality of life would probably also be enhanced, as there would be fewer chronic diseases like diabetes. In the 1990s, the study found that men ages 45 to 54 who began to exercise could expect to live 10 months longer on average than their sedentary peers.By that time, Dr. Paffenbarger had taken the findings to heart. He was himself a sedentary man who became a long-distance runner at 45, eventually completing marathons in Boston and South Africa as well as the Western States Endurance Run, a grueling 100-mile race on a mountainous course.'"
"'07-07-14,'0','It was in New Hampshire, when his campaign was tottering amid questions about his Vietnam War draft history and accusations of infidelity, that Mr. Clinton, with a head cold and laryngitis, talked his way to the point of exhaustion from one end of the state to another, scoring a strong second-place finish that righted his candidacy.Jim Rounds, 50, was among many in the crowd Friday morning who said they voted for Mr. Clinton in the 1992 primary. Mr. Rounds recalled having first heard him on a radio show back then, when he was still a relatively unknown governor from Arkansas.He told his wife, Mr. Rounds said, “Watch out for this guy. He’s going to be the next president.”His wife, Donna, who sat next to him in Keene under the baking sun, confessed sheepishly that she had probably come to hear Mr. Clinton more than Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Clinton spoke for less than 10 minutes at each stop, introducing his wife but clearly basking in the couple’s return to New Hampshire.His main task Friday, as it was in Iowa a week ago, was to serve as cheerleader-in-chief for Mrs. Clinton.In what has become his own stump speech, Mr. Clinton repeated a line he used in Iowa: “I would be doing this, if asked, if we were not married, because in my lifetime, I believe she is the best prepared nonincumbent I have ever had a chance to vote for for president of the United States.”And he told the crowd about her early years after law school as an advocate for children, and about how “she represented our country in 82 other nations” as first lady.“You want to restore America’s standing in the world virtually overnight?” Mr. Clinton said. “Elect her president.”He closed with the same story he had used in Iowa, about meeting a firefighter on a golf course who told him how much he appreciated what Mr. Clinton’s wife had done after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to sound the alarm about the health risks facing workers who toiled in the rubble in Lower Manhattan.And once again, Mr. Clinton summoned up the kind of political charisma that has served him well over the years. His voice getting husky and emotional, he said the firefighter had told him, “I’d do anything I could to elect her.”“And so should you,” Mr. Clinton told the crowd.With that, he took a seat on a stool on stage as Mrs. Clinton took over the microphone. At each stop, she shared her fond memories of New Hampshire back in 1991 and 1992, describing it, to more than 1,000 people gathered outdoors at a college in Nashua, as an “incredible experience.”She diverged a bit from her regular stump speech to dwell on the inequities that she said existed in the way investment returns earned by certain Wall Street firms were taxed compared to the income of average Americans.Mr. Clinton seemed to struggle with the proper posture for him at his wife’s side, alternately sitting up straight on his stool or slouching slightly, crossing his legs or crossing his ankles, keeping his hands in his pocket or putting a hand on his chin.Nevertheless, afterward in Keene, the couple waded into the crowd together, quickly separated by the throngs, signing autographs and spawning some giddiness.One supporter of Mrs. Clinton, Kathy Manns, 55, seemed to speak for many in the crowd when she said, “I do believe with Hillary, you get two for one.”'"
"'07-07-14,'0','VIENNA, July 13 (AP) — United Nations nuclear inspectors, banned by Iran earlier this year from visiting a heavy-water reactor, will be allowed to inspect it before the end of July, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Friday.The agency, which is based here, said Iran had also agreed to answer questions on past experiments that could be linked to a weapons program.For years Iran has failed to cooperate with the agency on the agency’s terms, leaving it unable to ascertain the truth of Iran’s claims that it has no plans to build nuclear weapons and that its atomic activities are meant strictly to generate energy. Its refusal to cooperate or stop enriching uranium prompted the United Nations Security Council to pass two sets of sanctions.Any Iranian decision to cooperate could weaken a push by the United States and Western allies on the Council to impose new sanctions.In talks between Iranian officials and the agency’s deputy director general, Olli Heinonen of Finland, “agreement was reached” to allow an inspection of the heavy-water reactor at Arak by the end of July, the agency said in a statement.The two sides also agreed on how “to resolve remaining issues regarding Iran’s past plutonium experiments.”'"

But the cost is just too high. In basketball you don’t have to forgo the whole season to make the Olympic team. No one else loses as much as the Olympic marathoners do in choosing to make the team.”USA Track and Field officials said they were sensitive to the marathoners’ financial sacrifice. The New York City and Boston marathons are each providing prize packages of $250,000 at the trials.“There are a lot of people giving up potential income and U.S.A.T.F. wants to do what we can to alleviate some of that,” said Jim Estes, the senior manager of long distance running for USA Track and Field.At the men’s trials in New York, the top 10 men will receive prize money, with the top three receiving $60,000, $40,000 and $30,000. The prize for 10th place is $2,000, which is $1,000 more than the 10th-place prize in the New York City Marathon.In Boston, the top three women will receive $50,000, $40,000 and $30,000, but the prize money will be allocated to 15th place.The American men who compete in Beijing will earn an additional $20,000 from the New York Road Runners. There is a small prize money structure offered by USA Track and Field, with the winner earning $4,000. The total payout would top out at $84,000.“You are taking somewhat of a hit,” said Alan Culpepper, who won the 2004 marathon trials and finished 12th at the Athens Games. “When it comes to making the Olympic team, we would probably all sacrifice monetary gain.”Some runners and officials proposed combining the trials with a major marathon to avoid making runners choose one or the other.“This is a big step forward, now that the trials are being held in a major market,” Wittenberg said. “It could be even bigger if you put the trials with the major marathon.”For now, Estes said, “why it can’t be inserted into the marathon is largely to do with marketing rights.”If a sponsor buys into an event, that precludes another competing company’s sponsorship. For example, the New York City Marathon has ING as its title sponsor, which conflicts with the U.S.O.C.’s financial sponsor, Bank of America. The New York City Marathon also has Asics as its shoe sponsor, but Nike is a U.S.O.C. and U.S.A.T.F. sponsor.Other countries, including Japan, Britain and Kenya, choose their Olympic marathon team based on time and winners from different races. But the United States uses a one-day, qualify-or-stay-home trials format.“The focus can be just on making the team,” Culpepper said. “Mixing it in with the other race leads to other dynamics; it changes the whole feel of the race.”Khalid Khannouchi, the national men’s record holder, who was injured at the 2004 trials, will be in the trials field. His wife and agent, Sandra Khannouchi, said they would prefer running the New York City Marathon, but she said they understood the process.Ryan Hall, 24, who finished seventh in his marathon debut in London in April, will not earn the appearance fee he would if he were making his New York City Marathon debut.“On the commercial side of things, an Olympic champ or medalist will reap long-term benefits that will surpass any appearance money that they would have to forgo in the process of making the team,” Hall’s coach, Terrence Mahon, said in an e-mail message.“At the end of it all, these runners did not get involved in the sport for money. It is not that type of sport that produces a lot of millionaires.”'"
"'07-07-14,'0','His speech drew more reporters and camera crews than any other since he formally announced his campaign for president in April. This time, they were there to ask about his campaign woes. When Mr. McCain was asked if there was any instance in which he could envision dropping out before the New Hampshire primary next year, he replied, “Contracting a fatal disease.”Mr. McCain acknowledged that his support of the Iraq war was costing him with the independent voters who helped propel him to victory in the New Hampshire primary in 2000. And at the luncheon here on Friday — where the crowd greeted him with a standing ovation and later applauded his remarks on federal spending and laughed at his jokes — his somber speech on the war was not interrupted by applause a single time.Mr. McCain, who always notes when he talks about the war that it was “terribly mismanaged,” called for increasing the size of the Army and the Marines to 900,000 members, up from the 750,000 currently planned, which he said would cost $15 billion a year. He voiced support for creating an Army Adviser Corps to work with allied militaries abroad. And he spoke of creating a new civil-military agency similar to the Office of Strategic Services from World War II to fight terrorism.“I have told you how I intend to fight this war,” he said. “Other candidates will argue for a different course. Democratic candidates for president will argue for the course of cutting our losses and withdrawing from the threat in the vain hope it will not follow us here. I cannot join them in such wishful and very dangerous thinking. Peace at any price is an illusion, and its costs are always more tragic than the sacrifices that victory requires.”After the speech, Judy Havenstein, a supporter in the audience, asked him what he would do to try to win over the more than 60 percent of Americans who now support bringing the troops home. Mr. McCain responded that he would just try to make better arguments, and that he would not be moved by the polls.“My whole life has prepared me for this task,” he said. “I spent my life in the military and on national security issues, and I am fully prepared.”Ms. Havenstein said in an interview that she appreciated the way Mr. McCain was unafraid to voice unpopular views.“There’s lots of little policies we could talk about,” she said, “but if you boil it all down to a leader — that’s what I’m looking for, someone who will say what he means whether it’s what I want to hear or not.”It is something the McCain campaign hopes he will get credit for from the voters. But, as Mr. McCain himself said jokingly later in a conference call, “It hasn’t worked so far, but you can always hope.”'"
"'07-07-14,'0','CONCORD, N.C., July 13 (AP) — Dale Earnhardt Jr. will have a new sponsor in 2008.Hendrick Motorsports said Friday that contractual commitments to the team’s current sponsors would preclude Budweiser from being the primary sponsor of Earnhardt’s car when he joined Hendrick next season.“We have agreements in place with sponsors for the 2008 Nascar Sprint Cup season, which prevent us from having a relationship with Budweiser,” the team’s owner, Rick Hendrick, said in a statement. “Honoring our commitments is important to us. The trade-off is missing an opportunity to bring Budweiser, a marquee brand synonymous with Nascar and its fans, into the fold.”After deciding to leave Dale Earnhardt Inc., the team founded by his father, Earnhardt signed to race for Hendrick. But the primary sponsorship of his team remains undecided.Earnhardt has a personal-services contract with Budweiser that runs through 2008, but Budweiser is reportedly talking with other teams about sponsorship.“Budweiser has sponsored Dale Jr. for nearly a decade, and we wish him the very best,” said Tony Ponturo, the Anheuser-Busch vice president for global media and sports marketing.'"

"'07-07-14,'0','Re “Nominee for Surgeon General Testifies He Would Not Give In to Politics” (news article, July 13):President Bush has repeatedly nominated appointees who assured the Senate that they would be fair, exercise good judgment and not be pressured by political considerations. Whether or not the Senate believed these assurances, they went on to confirm these nominees, including Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.Each of these men has clearly demonstrated loyalty to Mr. Bush and the fringe elements of the Republican Party rather than to the Constitution and the people of the United States.As a result, the Senate should be wary of Dr. James W. Holsinger Jr.’s assurances that he would resign rather than submit to political pressure or that he no longer holds offensive views regarding a significant percentage of the American population.Rather than take the risk of confirming this appointment, the Senate should leave the position vacant until a more responsible nominee can be named in 2009. Matt MeyerDr. Richard H. Carmona’s testimony to a House committee underscores the need for science to be free of political ideology (“Unhealthy Interference,” editorial, July 12).As surgeon general, Dr. Carmona was our nation’s top public health official, charged with improving the health of all Americans. And yet he was prevented from sharing his own expertise and knowledge about key issues like emergency contraception and comprehensive sex education. Why is the current administration so opposed to honest talk about reproductive health?'"
"'07-07-14,'0','“I’m a pastor; I always preach about idolatry,” said Jorge Del Toro, a Galaxy season-ticket holder. “I have qualms about being here, but he’s David Beckham. He seems to be a blessed individual with creative talent and a humble spirit.”Not to mention the ability to rake in money as a global brand as he attempts to elevate soccer into the American mainstream. On Friday, commerce was as urgent as soccer, an observation that could not have been more evident if the stage that held Beckham had been shaped like a cash register.The Galaxy will pay him at least $32.5 million, and up to $250 million, over five years in a profit-sharing arrangement, and the team wasted no time attempting to make its money back.A new blue-and-white uniform has been introduced for Beckham’s arrival, and the jerseys were selling for $80 to $100 outside the Home Depot Center, while water was being hawked inside for $3.25 a bottle.His international appeal is such that the Galaxy has already sold 250,000 of the jerseys, team officials said, a considerable number given that Beckham will not play in his first match until July 21 in an exhibition against the British power Chelsea.Tim Leiweke, the chief executive of the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which owns the Galaxy, has said that Beckham’s presence could be worth $1 billion to the team. Lest anyone forgot about merchandising, a giant replica of the new team jersey lay in the end zone of the Home Depot Center, while a banner featuring Beckham in the new outfit hung from the stadium roof.This is a cult of personality rarely seen outside North Korea. Still, Beckham has undeniable star power. Pablo Ruiz, a Galaxy season-ticket holder, canceled three meetings Friday to welcome Beckham, the team’s star midfielder.“The world is looking at my team today,” Ruiz said. “It’s a circus, a gimmick, but it’s a good gimmick. Oscar Wilde wrote that you should be concerned when people don’t talk about you.”Carlos Almendarez, a high school counselor, flew in from San Francisco, and he is not even much of a Beckham fan.“I just wanted to see the hysteria,” he said.Jeff and Teri Miller, season-ticket holders, surprised their 11-year-old daughter, Courtney, and let her play hooky from summer school. “She thinks Beckham’s cute,” Teri Miller said of her daughter. “I think he’s cute, too. Courtney told me I was too old to think he’s cute.”Jeff Miller, the commissioner of a regional youth soccer league, said Beckham’s arrival felt like a seminal moment, similar to Wayne Gretzky’s arrival in the late 1980s to play for the Los Angeles Kings.“Hockey wasn’t such a big draw,” Miller said. “Then the Anaheim Ducks came into existence,” eventually winning a Stanley Cup title. “Now you’ve got youth hockey all over Southern California.”Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer, called Friday “truly a historic day for soccer in America.”Beckham is sure to raise interest in the sport. Still, he has his work cut out for him. Until now, the most famous soccer star playing in the United States was Mia Hamm, and she has been retired for nearly three years.“Potentially in the States, soccer can be as big as it is everywhere else in the world,” Beckham said, a statement perhaps made more out of politeness than accuracy.Not everyone was impressed, or even aware, of his arrival. The actor Richard Chamberlain, asked about Beckham in a television interview at a movie premiere, said, “I’m not sure I know who he is.”Some British reporters have accused Beckham of wanting to become an American idle, moving into semiretirement here in a lesser league while his wife hobnobs with Tom Cruise and other celebrities. In the sports pages of The Los Angeles Times on Friday, a column by Bill Plaschke bore the headline “Hype Gripe” and asked why anyone should care about a player who is more celebrity that athlete.But Beckham’s career is on the rise again at 32. Whether it is ascendant enough to invigorate the woeful Galaxy and boost long-term fan interest in M.L.S. cannot yet be known. But on Friday, his charisma was enough to draw Alexander Mira, a Galaxy fan who banged on a drum and wore something on his head that was either a diorama featuring photographs of the team’s players or a small shrub.“I see David Beckham and my heart is happy,” Mira said.There was one clumsy moment Friday. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, who has been involved in a much-publicized extramarital relationship with a newscaster from a Spanish-language network, was booed, then heckled when a spectator yelled, “Is your girlfriend covering this?”Shortly after, the half-hour introduction concluded and Beckham prepared to walk soccer’s version of the red carpet, providing sound bites to television reporters lined up along one end of the field. As fans began to leave, Alexi Lalas, the general manager of the Galaxy, had one final exhortation: be sure to buy a jersey on the way out.'"
"'07-07-14,'0','On its face, the affirmative action case decided on June 28 by the Supreme Court turns on whether two school districts in Washington and Kentucky violated the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection guarantee when they assigned children to schools on the basis of race.But the underlying issue is whether the court should be attentive to history and the societal consequences of its decision, or should turn a blind eye to those consequences and attend only to the principled protection of individual rights. The plurality opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, strongly affirms the latter position, citing Justice Anthony Kennedy’s declaration (in Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. F.C.C., 1990) that: “Our Constitution protects each citizen as an individual, not as a member of a group.”From this it follows that while groups may suffer disadvantages in the course of history, race-conscious efforts to ameliorate those disadvantages sacrifice constitutional principles, which are timeless, to the achieving of a result that is considered good by the ephemeral standards of the time.Chief Justice Roberts acknowledged that the motives for race-conscious policies may seem benign, but he quoted Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s admonition (again in Metro Broadcasting) that “ ‘Benign’ carries with it no independent meaning, but reflects only ... the current generation’s conclusion that a politically accepted burden, imposed on particular citizens on the basis of race, is reasonable.” By “independent meaning,” Justice O’Connor meant a meaning independent of history.In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens accused the majority of ignoring history and thereby obscuring what is at stake both now and when the 14th Amendment was passed. He is particularly incensed at Roberts’s invoking of Brown v. Board of Education (1954) in the concluding paragraph of his opinion. “Before Brown, schoolchildren were told where they could and not go to school based on the color of their skin.” Now, the chief justice said, it’s happening again.'"

They are also seeking to hold the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.Organizers postponed two baseball games — the United States against the Dominican Republic and Brazil against Nicaragua — after a power outage at the new site.Earlier, Panama defeated Cuba, 4-3, and Venezuela and Mexico were tied, 2-2, when darkness forced a suspension of the game.The United States-Dominican Republic game was rescheduled for Sunday morning. The United States’s previously scheduled game against Nicaragua was rescheduled for Monday.Organizers said issues with broadcast cables inside the Rio Multisport Arena led to a brief delay of television coverage of the men’s team gymnastics competition Saturday.

"'07-07-15,'0','In the American Legion post here, Mr. McCain took on Mr. Fahey’s question. “I’m not a very good fund-raiser, I’ll admit it,” he said. “But I can outcampaign these guys, and I will, and I can, and we’re going to be doing just fine both here and Iowa and in South Carolina, and I have every confidence.”Later, as the audience filed out, Mr. Fahey said he was still undecided. “I thought he gave a good answer, but he still didn’t convince me that he can overcome the funding issue, and I still feel he’s been too close to Bush,” he said. “I’m going to look for the strongest leader that we can get, and it could be McCain.”The financing issue is serious. When the campaign releases its second-quarter report on Sunday, it will show that while there is around $2 million left, there is also roughly $1.7 million in debt, said a person who saw the figures and was granted anonymity because the figures have not been released. While the campaign hopes to raise $7 million to $9 million in the third quarter, the person said, the events of last week will probably make that hard to attain.Mr. McCain’s new management team said it had not decided whether to accept public matching funds. Accepting the funds would yield a much-needed infusion of cash but would tie the campaign’s hands in how it could use the money. It would limit the campaign to a total budget of about $50 million for the period, an official at the Federal Election Commission said, but severely limit what it could spend in the early states: about $1.5 million in Iowa, $800,000 in New Hampshire and $2.2 million in South Carolina.Mr. McCain was said to be furious behind the scenes about his campaign’s dire straits. Some top donors said they were still nervous. But publicly, Mr. McCain is taking responsibility. “To state the obvious, the responsibility is mine and mine alone,” Mr. McCain said in a call to bloggers on Friday afternoon.While Mr. McCain spoke inside the hall here about the need for the government to cut spending — repeating a line about how Congress spends like a drunken sailor — someone wearing a John McCain mask outside tried to undercut his message. “My Campaign Spends Like a Drunken Sailor,” said a sign strapped to the back of the man, who walked around tipsily, holding a flask.More staff defections are expected, but some older hands who were let go earlier this year are being brought back. They include Carla Eudy, who was replaced as Mr. McCain’s fund-raiser after a disappointing first quarter but who rejoined the campaign after the even more disappointing second quarter.Before he took his commercial flight to New Hampshire on Thursday night, Mr. McCain stopped by his campaign headquarters to try to rally the remaining troops at an emotional meeting, where he choked up at one point thanking his aide, Mark Salter, who has been with him for more than 18 years and was a constant companion this weekend.In New Hampshire, Mr. McCain did everything he could to reassure people that he would remain in the race. He delivered a somber speech on Iraq, gave local interviews, met with the editorial board of The Manchester Union Leader, and even held court with stories about his adventures as a midshipman, politics and Ernest Hemingway to a group of staff members and reporters over sodas at a pub near his hotel.'"

"'07-07-15,'0','The Liberty began the season 5-0 before a 67-57 loss to Detroit on June 8 started a stretch in which the Liberty lost 8 of 11. Moore said the Shock’s physical play threw the Liberty off its game.“Detroit showed it off first, and everybody started doing it,” Moore said. “I think we did back down, we did get a little bit timid, and we didn’t really attack like we know we can. And now we’re seeing if everyone’s going to do it, we have to do something about it. Now, we’re starting to attack.”Last weekend, the Liberty won consecutive games against Detroit and Sacramento — last year’s W.N.B.A. finalists — before a loss at Indiana on Thursday night sent it into the All-Star Game break at 10-9. Moore credits McCarville for the Liberty’s aggressive play recently.“It’s her presence inside,” Moore said. “Having that toughness in her kind of carries around everybody else. And everybody plays the same way she does.”COMETS SEEKING HELP INSIDE With Sheryl Swoopes out since May 29 because of a back injury, the Houston Comets have been lacking a second scoring threat to complement the All-Star Tina Thompson.The Comets have been looking to Michelle Snow to help fill the void, but she has struggled with consistency.“We just keep reiterating to Michelle how important it is for her to score,” Comets Coach Karleen Thompson said.“We have other production coming from our other players, which is a good thing. To have someone dominating down in the paint is a definite need.”After averaging 17.7 points in the first six games, Snow is scoring 9.5 in the last 14. She has reached double figures only six times during that stretch, including a career-high-tying 24 points in the Comets’ 87-77 victory over Minnesota on Thursday.“I was wanting her to be a little bit more aggressive and take the ball to the basket and have a presence, and she did that” against the Lynx, Tina Thompson said.FEVER SHOWS NO SIGN OF BREAKING The Indiana Fever entered the All-Star Game break a league-leading 15-4, topping the previous franchise best of 12-7 accomplished in each of the last two seasons.“I have a good team, good veteran players and a lot of depth,” Indiana Coach Brian Winters said. “They’ve done a good job all year long, and when we’ve needed a big play in crucial situations, we’ve had different people step forward.”The Fever has also held opponents below 40 percent shooting from the field for a W.N.B.A.-record 13 consecutive games, including 38 percent by the Liberty on Thursday night.In Indiana’s 86-70 victory over Chicago on July 8, Tamika Catchings had 16 points, a career-high 11 assists, 7 rebounds and 7 steals. According to Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time in league history a player had at least 7 points, rebounds, assists and steals in the same game.“I guess it would be one of my more memorable games,” Catchings said. “The thing that really matters is that we won, and it was a team effort.”MONARCHS COMPENSATE FOR LOSSES Just because DeMya Walker is out with a season-ending knee injury and Yolanda Griffith is mired in the worst season of her career, opponents should not expect to have an easy time against the Sacramento Monarchs.Rebekkah Brunson and Nicole Powell have been making up for the diminished production in the frontcourt, and the Monarchs have the league’s second-best scoring defense — limiting the opposition to 71.1 points a game.Even with consecutive losses heading into the All-Star Game break, Sacramento (12-8) is in second place in the Western Conference, one game behind San Antonio.Powell is averaging career bests with 12.7 points and 6.5 rebounds. Brunson, starting in Walker’s place, is averaging career highs with 11.9 points and 8.3 rebounds to earn a reserve role for the West in today’s midseason contest.Despite her struggles, Griffith — averaging career lows of 7.6 points and 4.2 rebounds, about half of her averages (15.1 and 8.5) coming into the season — was voted to start in the All-Star Game for the fourth time in her seventh appearance over all.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','Each year for the last seven, the family’s financial advisers have held a cozy briefing with a small clutch of reporters at Buckingham Palace, all in the name of financial transparency. The briefing includes details about how they spend their annual government allowance for public duties and upkeep of the royal residences, as well as some details about their personal wealth. The goal of the affair is to make the Windsors more accessible — and, observers say, to allow them to better protect their fortune. Longtime critics of royal privilege, however, argue that greater transparency has also led many people to wonder exactly how much of the family’s fortune is truly its own.“There is a lot of blurring of the edges about what is actually theirs,” said Ian Davidson, a Labor member of Parliament. “What does the concept of holding in trust for the nation actually mean? There does not seem to be a register of the works they own. They have modernized, but they are still not as open and as transparent as we would wish. They don’t pay tax in the way they should.”The Windsors’ representatives dismiss such chatter as it arises, but they also now find themselves in the uncomfortable position of having to field questions about one of the world’s most secretive family businesses.During the recent round of royal financial debriefings, Prince Charles’ private secretary, Sir Michael Peat, a straight-backed accountant who has been one of the chief advocates for transparency in the Windsor household, tried to explain to reporters assembled in St. James’s Palace just why the prince’s spending on official business had risen to about $20 million this year, from $18 million in 2006.(All dollar figures are based on Friday’s exchange rates.)“He has been very busy,” Mr. Peat noted, before cataloging a flurry of overseas visits. “He really does care about this country and everyone in it.”Then Mr. Peat pointed out that the prince, who has emerged as among the more entrepreneurial of the Windsors, has converted his Range Rover and Jaguar to run on used cooking oil. “He works tirelessly to make a difference for the better and do what he can to ensure that the country is a harmonious and civilized place in which to live.”MOST estimates of the private wealth of Queen Elizabeth II place her among the five richest monarchs in the world. She is poorer than the oil-rich kings of Saudi Arabia and Brunei, but is roughly as wealthy as other moneyed royals of Europe, including Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, according to Philip Dröge, author of a book on the Dutch royal family.The Dutch royal family does not disclose its net worth. The family, however, has stakes in Royal Dutch/Shell and the Dutch bank ABN Amro, according to Mr. Dröge. A few years ago, the family disputed reports that it was worth $2.5 billion, suggesting instead that the figure was probably a couple of hundred million dollars. Liechtenstein’s royal family has a trust that manages its assets; it owns the LGT banking group and RiceTec, a Texas company that develops hybrid rice.A precise valuation of Queen Elizabeth’s assets is difficult because she is secretive about her personal holdings. It is also complicated by a blurring of lines between her personal wealth and assets — including her palaces, paintings and jewels — that are held in trust for the British public.If only the queen’s personal assets are taken into account, she is worth several hundred million dollars, according to the Sunday Times Rich List and people familiar with her finances who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. But if all royal possessions are added to the mix, her wealth runs into the billions. Yet even then, hurdles remain: What is the value of the Crown Jewels, for example? Or the many Leonardo da Vinci drawings she holds in trust in the Royal Collection? The queen’s private property primarily includes two homes and estates, Balmoral in Scotland (50,000 acres) and Sandringham in eastern England (21,000 acres), and, on a smaller scale, such things as her prized stamp collection. She also has a private investment portfolio of undisclosed size.At the other end of the spectrum is a collection of assets called the Crown Estate. This includes farms, a racetrack and property in London, like the Israeli embassy, and is valued at more than $14.2 billion, according to its annual accounts. Those properties originally belonged to the monarchy, but King George III, who took the throne in 1760, handed over management to the state, with all income from the properties flowing into public coffers. In return, he and all of his successors have received an annual payment from the government; the Crown Estate is now run from offices just off Regent Street, one of central London’s prime shopping boulevards (a street that the Crown Estate also owns).The queen and Prince Charles also own lands and properties traditionally passed down to the monarch and heir to finance private expenditures: the Duchy of Lancaster belongs to the queen, and the Duchy of Cornwall to the prince.The Duchy of Lancaster has a value of $693 million, according to its accounts for the fiscal year ended March 2006, up from $449 million in fiscal 2002, and generated a net operating income of $22 million. It includes land in northern England, and the Savoy Estate, a patch of offices and shops between the Strand and the Thames in London. The Duchy of Cornwall, 135,000 acres located mainly in southwest England, was valued in March 2007 at about $1.2 billion, up from $835 million in 2003. Britain’s government also pays an annual allowance to the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, for their public work. In the year ended in March 2007, they received $26 million, according to the queen’s most recent annual review of income and expenditures. The royals also receive public subsidies for palace maintenance, public relations and travel costs, which together amounted to about $42 million in the year ended in March. Other government agencies directly paid them about $8 million over the same period for other costs.All these figures began getting more public attention as pressure for a more open monarchy increased from the 1960s to the 1980s. Media scrutiny, particularly from aggressive tabloids, opened a window onto what critics described as lives of unearned wealth and privilege. The unraveling of several royal marriages in the 1990s — particularly that of Prince Charles and Princess Diana — further dulled the aura of respect surrounding the Windsors.“The monarchy was part of the set of institutions of privilege at a time when there was a general appetite for opening up,” said Peter Kellner, president of YouGov, a British polling organization. “They were revealed as people that seemed to deserve being less deferential to. As a result they have had to make a number of concessions.”After a fire ravaged Windsor Castle in 1992 — and the government announced that it would pay tens of millions of pounds to repair rooms closed to the public — there was an uproar. The queen responded by opening Buckingham Palace for the first time to the public and charging entrance fees there and at Windsor to help pay for the repairs.In 1993, the queen and Prince Charles ended another anomaly when they said they would pay tax for the first time. In 2001, in a major step toward transparency, the queen began to publish annual accounts of her official expenditures. The prince followed in 2003. In the report for the year through March 2006, the prince disclosed for the first time the tax he paid: about $6.7 million. In the next year, he paid $6.9 million in taxes. The queen refuses to publish the amount she pays, citing privacy — though providing ammunition to critics who contend that the Windsors have still not disclosed enough about their finances.Speaking recently to reporters in the Breakfast Room in Buckingham Palace, Mr. Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, answered questions about whether the Windsors were spending excessively on train travel. The family has a special royal train for journeys within Britain, but a January train trip between Philadelphia and New York by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, had cost the country $7,863.Nonetheless, Mr. Reid said, the British people were still getting a bargain. “The total cost of the monarchy is now 7 percent lower in real terms than it was in 2001,” he said. “The reduction in the amount of head-of-state expenditure reflects the continuous attention the royal household pays to obtaining the best value for money in all areas of expenditure. ”THE queen has agreed in recent years to downsize the network of royals that receive annual state handouts — now, only she and Prince Philip are subsidized. To bridge the funding gap, the queen makes contributions from her own funds to support other royals, including her daughter, Princess Anne, and two of her three sons, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward.There is, of course, another way for the royals to get income: work. But, beyond charity work, the Windsors have found the job market tough going. Prince Andrew has a government role as a special trade ambassador, while Prince Edward’s wife, Sophie, ran a public relations company until accusations that she was exploiting royal contacts for private gain forced her to retire.OF all the royals, Prince Charles has probably fared worst in terms of public opinion since Princess Diana’s death in 1997. But he has fought back, partly by trying to focus public attention on his philanthropic work. He has 18 well-regarded charities and he calls himself a “charitable entrepreneur.”He has modernized the Duchy of Cornwall estate, a once sleepy organization that relied on rental income from farms, by turning to property development. He built a new town, Poundbury, on duchy land, where he has tested his ideas about architecture, the environment and town planning. The prince earned about $31 million in the last financial year, before taxes, from the duchy, up from about $20 million four years earlier.In 1992, Prince Charles started an organic food business called Duchy Originals that uses some ingredients grown on his land. Duchy Originals earned a profit of more than $2 million on revenue of $108 million in the year ended in March 2007, according to the prince’s annual report. The funds support such charitable works as the Prince’s Trust, an organization that helps underprivileged teenagers and young adults.The prince says a large part of his profits finances his charities and his official work, but he also uses the profits to support Prince William and Prince Harry, who also earn salaries as officers in the British army. (The two young princes are due to inherit money from their mother’s estate; before her death, Princess Diana won a divorce settlement that would be worth about $35 million at the current exchange rate.) Even the entrepreneurial activities of Prince Charles have managed to inflame his critics, largely because of burgeoning profits from the ventures. Two years ago, a Parliament committee investigated for the first time the running of the duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster. A subsequent report said the prince and the queen should submit to more precise outside auditing and raised questions about why they did not pay corporate or capital gains taxes. The Windsors have declined to comply with those recommendations; their representatives say that the duchies are private trusts and that the Windsors already pay income tax on them.Supporters of Prince Charles dispute the notion that the Windsors are still under siege. Julia Hobsbawm, a public relations expert and trustee of one of Prince Charles’s charities, says that anti-monarchy opinion may be strong among some commentators in the British media but that it is not widely shared. She says that Prince William and Prince Harry have grown up to become strong assets for the royals, role models with whom younger Britons identify. “They liked the fact that Harry wanted to serve his country in Iraq,” she said. (Because of heightened security threats to Prince Harry and members of his unit, the British military decided not to send the prince to Iraq.)Still, taxes remain a sore point between the monarchy and its critics. When the queen dies, for example, the next monarch will pay no inheritance tax on her private wealth, as long as she leaves it to that heir. And some critics wonder what Prince Charles plans to do with the royal assets if he becomes king.Although the Crown Estate, which surpasses $14 billion, has virtually passed into government hands, it retains links to the monarchy, and every new monarch must agree again to George III’s deal with the state.“Charles has made remarks about wanting to take it back,” said Kevin Cahill, the author of “Who Owns Britain,” a survey of land ownership. But he and others close to the palace say that any attempt by the prince to reclaim the Crown Estate would probably prompt overwhelming public opposition.And until the British decide that they want someone other than a monarch as head of state, the Windsors will retain access to the public purse — even to fix their leaky roofs.“There is no push now for a president as head of state; people have looked at the alternative and they think that too much is controlled by party politics,” said Vernon Bogdanor, a professor of government at Oxford University. “They don’t want that. The role is to represent the country to itself, and this is becoming particularly important” now that “we have become a multicultural society.”Indeed, a television poll taken in Britain this past spring suggested that Queen Elizabeth remains as popular as ever in her home country. But while anti-monarchy sentiment appears to have waned, it still exists in some quarters — particularly when it comes to financial matters. Outside the gates of Buckingham Palace on the day of the publication of the queen’s accounts, 20 people waved placards declaring “A Right Royal Rip Off.”“They cost much more than they say, and they don’t actually do anything,” said Graham Smith, one of the activists, as he stared up at the palace walls. “People keep pushing for more from the royals, but they give it only grudgingly. We ought to be a republic.”'"

"'07-07-15,'0','Re “On the Wrong Side of 5 to 4, Liberals Talk Tactics” (Week in Review, July 8):While liberals surely need to develop a long-term plan for responding to the conservative takeover of the Supreme Court, there are also important steps that can and should be taken in the short run.First, liberals and moderates should, at long last, turn the composition of the Supreme Court — and the entire federal judiciary — into a serious campaign issue. For far too long, this issue has been ceded to the Republican Party, which has gotten away with railing against liberal “activist” judges, even as federal courts at all levels have shifted decidedly to the right on a wide range of issues.Democrats and concerned independents need to do a much better job of explaining to the voting public how conservative judicial activism is now affecting public interests, not only by chipping away at civil rights and liberties, but also by weakening concrete consumer, environmental and labor protections.Second, many of the Supreme Court’s recent retreats from longstanding precedents can and should be reversed by Congress. While Congress has limited latitude with respect to constitutionally based judicial decisions, many of the rulings that split 5 to 4 along ideological lines reflect extremely narrow — if not counterintuitive — constructions of anti-discrimination, conservation and other federal statutes.Congress should be pressed to systematically review and respond promptly to these rulings so that important statutory purposes are not subverted by five unelected members of the judiciary.The writer is an attorney who argued one of the 5-4 cases in the Supreme Court.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','Behind its green Teflon shield, the Lexus proved to be just another overstuffed sedan that can barely top 20 miles a gallon — less, if you actually tap into all that power. If that’s saving the planet, Jor-El had better prepare the escape pod before it’s too late.Before the enviro-brigade readies the guillotine, I hasten to add that this isn’t about hating hybrids. Electric propulsion is looking more and more like a winning technology. Companies from Toyota to General Motors are working to develop affordable lithium-ion batteries, which could deliver clean, efficient, renewable power in plug-in hybrids or purely electric vehicles.I can’t believe that adding a cupful of electric juice to a fat barrel of V-8 muscle is what environmentalists have in mind.On the performance front, forget about the Lexus hanging with V-12 sedans like the Mercedes S600. Turns out that the Lexus can’t even outrun its own nonhybrid version, the LS 460 L. Nor is it appreciably quicker than V-8 competitors that cost $20,000 to $30,000 less, like the Mercedes S550, the Audi A8 and the BMW 7 Series, or the similarly priced Maserati Quattroporte.It must be noted that such decadent sedans are about more than straight-line speed. Park those high-wattage rivals beside the Lexus, and the modestly styled LS virtually disappears; challenge them on a twisty road and they all disappear from the Lexus by virtue of their sportier handling.Spurred from a stop to 60 miles an hour, the LS 600h L clocks a swift 5.5 seconds, according to Lexus’s own testing. Yet the gas-only LS 460 L, with a mere 380 horsepower from a smaller V-8, reaches 60 in 5.4 seconds, nosing out the more powerful hybrid.How is that possible? Check the scales, where the Lexus hybrid weighs in like Jared before his Subway diet.The hybrid does add all-wheel drive, not available on the LS 460 L. But together, the heavy batteries and all-wheel-drive system burden the hybrid with more than 700 additional pounds, for a total of 5,049. Forced to motivate the added weight, the hybrid’s larger 5-liter V-8 — another environmental oxymoron — and dual electric motors makes acceleration a wash. (One motor drives the four wheels. The other starts the gas engine and recharges the batteries.)Excess weight takes its toll on mileage as well. The hybrid got 21 m.p.g. — amazingly, 1 m.p.g. less than the nonhybrid version that I tested on the same urban roads and highways in and around New York City. That perfectly wonderful LS 460 L is blessed with one of the most fuel-efficient V-8s I’ve driven, a 4.6-liter smoothie.But the Lexus hybrid’s biggest jolt comes from sticker shock: the LS 600h L starts at $104,715, about $32,000 above the LS 460 L. Laden with options for $121,000, the hybrid costs about $30,000 more than the comparable gas-only version.Driven gently, the Lexus will indeed beat the mileage of its apples-to-apples V-8 rivals, but only by 1 m.p.g. to 3 m.p.g. A Mercedes S550 isn’t an egregious guzzler at an E.P.A.-rated 16/24 m.p.g., and I managed 19 m.p.g. during a recent test. And when I drove the Lexus in mildly spirited fashion, its mileage dropped to 19 m.p.g. It’s hard to see why such minuscule mileage gains would dazzle the type of person who’s ready to drop $100,000 on a car.The E.P.A. rates the hybrid’s mileage at 20 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway. The nonhybrid is rated 16/24 under the same revised formula, which takes effect for 2008 and is intended to present lower, more realistic mileage estimates for most cars.In its defense, the hybrid should save you a few bucks if you do a lot of city driving. But on the highway, the gas-only model was decidedly more efficient, and thus ended up doing 1 m.p.g. better over all. And in bumper-to-bumper traffic, where you expect a hybrid to excel, the LS 600h L mustered only 14 m.p.g., certainly nothing to marvel at.The uneasy comparisons don’t end there. The gas-only version handled better and drove more smoothly.The nonhybrid benefits from the world’s first eight-speed automatic transmission, which lifts mileage and operates with hushed aplomb. The hybrid’s continuously variable transmission, in contrast, has to busily calculate and divvy power from the gas and electric sources. It’s among the most seamless of its kind, but not as smooth or transparent as the Lexus eight-speed. And its manual-shift function is nearly useless. In trying to mimic the feel of sporty downshifts, it ladles on ever-higher levels of regenerative hybrid braking. To the driver, the sludgy effect feels like throwing anchors of various sizes out the window.Lexus’s hybrid double-talk extends to emissions arguments. When the company says the Lexus hybrid is cleaner than average cars, people will assume that has something to do with global warming. But in this instance, that is not the case.To its credit, the car’s super-ultra-low emissions vehicle rating (SULEV, if you will) is indeed cleaner than other V-8 models, but only if you are measuring the pollutants that form smog. (Even on the smog index, many gasoline models also achieve SULEV ratings or better).But the critical earth issue today is conserving fuel and cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Those greenhouse gas levels are almost entirely a function of fuel economy: if you use more gas, you spew more carbon dioxide. So on that score, the 21 m.p.g. hybrid actually emits far more carbon dioxide than, say, a Mercedes-Benz diesel E-Class that can attain 30 m.p.g.The LS 600h L also emits more greenhouse gases than the average new car that currently achieves 27.5 m.p.g. So a common Toyota Camry, among dozens of models, leaves a smaller carbon footprint than this hybrid land yacht.One final ignominy: given the hybrid batteries and a separate air-conditioner for the back seat, the hybrid’s trunk measures a meager 11.7 cubic feet, smaller than that of a Kia Rio or other compact sedan. (Skip the rear air-conditioning in a Lexus LS 460 L, and you’ll enjoy a 50 percent larger trunk, at 18 cubic feet).Jim Farley, general manager of Lexus, defended the car’s performance and green credentials. “If Lexus had to have a flagship, this is how it should be,” he said. “It’s the progressive person’s alternative. Hybrids are a huge platform for us at Lexus, and they’re only going to get bigger.”Certainly, this hybrid Lexus is one of the quietest, most comfortable, best-built sedans around. It has every imaginable safety system and creature comfort. The navigation system is first-rate. The Mark Levinson audio system is amazing. And the optional ($12,675) Executive Package is the hands-down — or feet-up? — coolest feature. It includes rear seats that recline, heat and cool, along with a right-hand chair with a steeper recline, massage functions and a powered ottoman for the full mini-Maybach effect.Yet every compliment you can lavish on this impressive ride, minus the all-wheel drive, applies equally to the nonhybrid version.So why would anyone spend an extra $30,000 for this car? Certainly, the performance gains of 12-cylinder sedans aren’t always justified by their enormous premiums. Many people buy them for that V-12 badge on the fender, the exclusive message it sends. Ditto for the Lexus, but the roughly 2,000 people who’ll line up for the hybrid won’t be broadcasting their superior power, but their superior morals, however illusory.If that’s not you, stick with the Lexus LS 460 L. Enjoy a back-seat massage and relax. You’ll know that you’ve got the better car — one that’s equally fast and frugal, but also weighs less and handles better.You can actually park that terrific gas-only Lexus in the garage and have $30,000 to buy a Prius hybrid, with cash left over. Save the LS for special occasions and run errands in the Toyota at more than double the mileage. While Lexus plays the hybrid game, it’s the Prius that takes care of business.'"

"'07-07-15,'0','“Why nick paintings when you could afford to buy them?”“Sometimes the ones you want never come to market.” Mike carried two mugs, and saw that Chib had been busy snooping. The gangster was smiling as he gestured behind one of the room’s sofas.“Not much of a hiding place, Michael. Anyone would think you want to be caught.”“I didn’t have much time: they were on the sofa when you rang the bell.”“Mind if I take a peek?” Chib hadn’t waited for assent; he was already lifting the paintings. “Four?” he said.“Two are Allan’s. I’m keeping them for him.”“He’s got a girlfriend,” Mike said, raising the coffee to his mouth as he spoke.“Doesn’t want her seeing them.” Hoping Chib would accept the lie.“So which two are yours?”“Nice.” Chib nodded slowly. “Worth the same as mine?”“Except that I only got one, and here you’ve got four little beauties.”“One was all you wanted.”Chib kept nodding, still appearing to be studying the paintings. “Portrait looks a bit like that bird from the auctioneer’s.”“Reason I’m here,” the gangster said, “is that I was thinking about that dirtbag detective.”“That’s the one — you heard anything more from the Prof?”“Is that good or bad, do you think?”Mike offered a shrug. “Professor Gissing says it’s an inspector called Hendricks who’s in charge of the case.”“Hendricks is a lightweight; it’s Ransome we need to watch for.” Chib had taken a step toward Mike. “Say he takes your friend Allan in for questioning?”Mike didn’t want Calloway coming any closer, so he made a show of wandering over toward the window. Looking down on to the communal parking lot, he saw Chib’s BMW parked there, and two men resting against it as they smoked their cigarettes. “You brought your boys,” Mike commented.“Don’t worry: they don’t know it’s you I’m visiting.”Chib gave a shrug. “Not sure who to trust these days. Nice to keep a few secrets, isn’t it?”“I mean, it’s all right for you, Mike. You’ve got your money in the bank, art on your penthouse walls and behind the sofa.” Chib gave a humorless chuckle. “Some of us still have to work for a living. This coffee’s champion, by the way. Any more of it going?”Mike took the empty mug and retreated to the kitchen. He didn’t like it that Chib knew where he lived; liked it even less that his goons were stationed outside and that Chib now knew there were four masterpieces in the apartment — not forgetting the lesser pieces exhibited on the walls. He heard a bleep from the living room and figured Chib was making a call. He just hoped it wasn’t an invitation for the goons to join the party.When he returned with the replenished mug, however, Chib was pointing toward the desk, on top of which sat Mike’s cellphone.“Sounds like you’ve got a message,” the gangster said.“Thanks,” Mike replied, handing over the coffee. He walked over to the desk, but then hesitated. Hadn’t his cellphone been sitting on the chair next to the desk rather than the desk itself? He glanced toward Chib, who was studying Allan’s two canvases, then picked up the phone and studied its screen: two text messages. The first was from Laura at the auction house. Need to see you was all it said. Under normal circumstances, this would have gladdened Mike’s heart, but these were far from normal circumstances, as the second text demonstrated.Westie feels short-changed. Another painting or 20K cash, you choose. Alice.“Not really.” Mike tried to establish eye contact, but Chib was concentrating on the paintings.“Not sure about your mate Allan,” the gangster mused.Mike could feel the blood pounding in his ears. “How do you mean?”“His taste in art.” Chib turned toward him, eyes glinting. “What did you think I meant?”Feeling further words might betray him, Mike just shook his head. Chib was surveying the room again, hands behind his back, as if he were considering its purchase.“Very nice,” he commented. “Bet it cost a few bob.”“Didn’t think so, man of your talents. What’s that word they use about businessmen when they know what they’re doing? Ecumen?”“That’s it!” Chib clapped his hands together. “Now do us all a favor, Mike, and use some of that acumen of yours to sort out Mr. Allan Cruikshank. Don’t want any weak links in this particular chain, do we?”Mike noted with relief that Calloway seemed to be heading for the door. The mug, still three-quarters full, was placed on a shelf. Chib himself was in the hallway now, Mike following.“Maybe next time I’ll get the full tour, eh?”“And like I say, there’s an open invite to mine. Not half as snazzy as yours, of course, but then it’s been through the wars — a bit like its owner.”The door was open, Chib making his exit with a laugh and a wave of the hand. Mike closed the door after him and leaned against it, as if to repel any further intruders. He punched Gissing’s number into his cellphone.“I know.” The reception was bad, Gissing’s voice breaking up. “D.I. Ransome’s been pushing me. Best thing we can do is lay low, keep ourselves to ourselves except in the direst straits.”“These are the direst straits,” Mike said, but the connection was broken.s Chib stalked toward the car, Johnno and Glenn stubbed out their cigarettes, Glenn holding open the rear door for his boss.“Never you mind,” Chib growled, getting into the BMW. He chewed on a thumbnail while he considered potential courses of action. Of course, in a sense it wasn’t for him to decide. The demand had been made to Mike — 20 grand or one of the paintings. Alice had to be Westie’s girlfriend. Westie was the student they’d persuaded to create the fakes. Now the pair of them were getting greedy. Chib found himself tutting, while at the same time admiring their barefaced cheek. What were they going to do — run to the cops? Not likely, with the two of them being every bit as guilty as anyone else. They were testing Mike’s nerve, that was all, same as Chib himself had just been doing. Problem wasn’t really Mike, though — it was that pal of his, Allan. Losing his bottle, starting to unravel. Mike’s lie about the new girlfriend might have worked if he had had time to refine it. Over the course of his professional life, Chib reckoned he had probably heard about 10,000 lies, the majority of them honed to near-perfection. Mike’s attempt hadn’t been in the same league.“Where to, Boss?” Glenn asked from the driver’s seat.“Home,” Chib said. His cellphone was trilling. He recognized the number and considered not answering, then took a deep breath and flipped the case open.“Hiya, Edvard.” The only name Chib had for him: Edvard, who ran a Hells Angels chapter in the wilds of Norway and ran drugs all over: Denmark to Sweden; Russia to Finland; Norway to the U.K. “Happy with the collateral?”“Well, that’s why I wanted to speak with you.” The voice was cultured, never threatening. Chib had been told early on in the relationship that he would never meet its owner.“I hope there’s not a problem.” Chib staring from the window at the passing scenery.“Not as yet. In fact, perhaps the opposite. You know that works of art make for a pretty reliable currency?”“The one you’ve got isn’t even posted as missing.” Chib’s attention had turned to Glenn and Johnno. They were listening — of course they were. Chib knew he had to keep from saying anything meaningful.“That’s good — that’s very good,” the voice was lullabying. “Maybe more of our business could be transacted in similar fashion?”Chib doubted it but agreed enthusiastically all the same and heard Edvard say that he would be in touch. With the call finished — Edvard never stayed on too long, just in case — Chib snapped the phone shut and tapped it against his teeth. He thought about Edvard and the people Edvard did business with, hundreds and thousands of miles away. How much did they know about art? If paintings were just collateral to them, just something to hold onto while deals were being done. . . .Professor Gissing reckoned this guy Westie was a master forger, and Chib began to wonder about that, too.There was a restaurant next to the auction house. It had been a bank at one time, and still boasted a rococo interior of vast, fluted columns and intricate ceiling work. In the morning, the tables were kept empty, but breakfast could be had at one of the booths by the window. Laura was stirring a foamy cappuccino when Mike arrived. He pecked her on both cheeks and ordered water — frizzante — from the waiter before sliding onto the bench across from her.“I haven’t seen you since the auction,” he told her. “How did it go?”“Not quite record-breaking.” She scooped up foam with her spoon and slipped it into her mouth. “Did you hear about the warehouse?” She seemed to be studying him as he adjusted his shirt cuffs.“And lucky they didn’t get away with it.”“Lucky, yes.” Her voice drifted away, though her eyes stayed locked on him.“Don’t tell me,” Mike said with a laugh, “shaving cream on my ear-lobe?” He made a show of checking, but she wasn’t about to reward him with a smile.“One of the paintings was that portrait by Monboddo of his wife. I remember it from the exhibition and how you couldn’t take your eyes off it. . . . ” She waited for him to speak, then gave a twitch of her mouth. “Do you know a detective called Ransome?” she asked.“The day of the auction, he came to see me afterward. He said he was interested in a local villain called Chib Calloway who’d been sitting in the front row with two henchmen close by.”“I was at the back, cozying up to the dealers.”“You didn’t see him?” She watched as he shook his head. “But you know who he is?”“I know the name,” Mike conceded, straining his neck to see if the waiter was on his way. “What’s any of this got to do with me?”“Ransome thought maybe you’d brought Calloway to the auction.”“Me?” Mike raised both eyebrows. “Why would he think that?”“He didn’t say, but he managed to describe you.” She paused, her stare intensifying. “And Allan and the professor, too. He asked for your names.”“Where’s my water got to?” Mike muttered, craning his neck again. Ransome had Allan’s name!“And then,” Laura continued, “after the robbery, Ransome called me. It was late on Saturday night, so it had to be important to him, even though he made the inquiry sound casual.”Mike didn’t want to ask, but couldn’t help himself. “What inquiry?”“He was asking about the professor.” She sat back, as if finished talking but ready and willing to hear anything Mike might have to say.“I’m still not sure what you’re getting at,” he obliged.Laura folded her arms, concentrating so hard on her cappuccino that she might have been inviting it to levitate.“I mean . . . ” he blustered on, “well, I’m not sure what I mean.” The water was arriving on a silver salver, ice and lime in the tall glass. The waiter began to pour, then asked if they needed anything else. Laura shook her head and watched him leave, unfolding her arms and resting her fingertips against the rim of the table.“I went to college with Ransome,” she stated quietly. “He was a determined little beggar even then.” She screwed shut her eyes. Mike reached across the table and took her hands in his.“It’s all right, Laura. It’s probably this guy Calloway he’s after. He saw us all at the same auction and started seeing conspiracies. Nothing to worry about — Ransome’s not even part of the team looking at the heist.”“But then how could you possibly know?”He was genuinely puzzled. “Know what?” he asked.“That Ransome’s not part of the team.”Glenn Hollis had been working for Chib Calloway these past four and a half years and was certain of only one thing: he could do a better job. Chib, no offense, had terrible people skills, lacked vision and bounced from crisis to crisis. Glenn knew this because he had been studying business textbooks in his spare time. One lesson he learned was Always Sleep With the Enemy. Not that he’d actually climbed into bed with Ransome, but he’d whispered sweet info into the detective’s ear, hoping Chib’s decline and fall would prove both swift and bloodless. So far it hadn’t panned out, yet here he was, meeting Ransome again, and this time the man had photos to show him.“Yeah, I know them,” Glenn admitted. “I mean, I don’t really know them, but Chib put the frighteners on them one time in a bar. Then he insisted on going to an auction, and they were there, too. We went back to the same bar and they were seated in the selfsame booth as before. This one. . . . ” Glenn tapped a photo. “He came over and had a chat with Chib.”“What about?” Ransome was gazing at something on the other side of his windshield. They were parked atop Calton Hill, just to the east of the city center. Great views of Edinburgh, if you could be bothered to look. So far, all Glenn had done was climb out of his own car and into the detective’s.“Michael Mackenzie. Made a fortune from computers and now lives in Murrayfield.”“That’s a coincidence . . . we were out there just a few hours ago. Some fancy block called Henderland Heights. Chib wouldn’t say why.” Glenn broke off talking, stunned into silence by something he’d never seen before.Detective Inspector Ransome was trying to grin and whistle at the same time.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','Q My boyfriend has had a lease on a rent-stabilized apartment in New York City for the last 10 years. I moved in with him three years ago. I am worried that if anything happens to him I will be forced to leave the apartment because I am not on the lease. Could this happen?A Daphna Zekaria, a Manhattan tenant lawyer, said that the letter writer should have nothing to worry about if he and his boyfriend have established themselves as a nontraditional couple for purposes of getting succession rights under the rent laws.Ms. Zekaria explained that the law allows a family member, a term that can include one partner in a nontraditional relationship, to remain in a regulated apartment after the named tenant dies or moves out if the family member has lived there for two years. (The time is reduced to one year when the tenant seeking succession rights is 62 or older or is disabled.)Ms. Zekaria noted, however, that to qualify as a member of a nontraditional couple entitled to succession rights, the letter writer would have to demonstrate an emotional and financial relationship and commitment.As New York City residents, the couple can register as domestic partners. They could also show that they share finances and bank accounts, spend holidays and vacations together, attend each other’s family functions and are named in each other’s wills as beneficiaries.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','At a cost of $10 for one dog and an average-size yard, Mr. Coniglione said the service has helped bring many a family argument to a halt.“The kids never want to do it; the parents are too busy,” Mr. Coniglione said. “Or the kids want to go out and play in the yard and the wife is yelling at the husband, ‘You didn’t scoop, they can’t play.’ ”Another of his Glen Cove customers is Helene Suozzi, who works in the office of a camp management company and is married to the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi. She said she has one less chore to worry about now that Mr. Coniglione cleans up after the family’s black Labrador, Garnet. With three children, ages 4, 9 and 12, there is “a lot of outdoor activity,” she said.“It’s always a fear that you have that someone is going to step in it,” Mrs. Suozzi said. “Guess whose job it would be to clean it up?”A number of dog waste removal services have sprung up on the Island in the past few years, part of a boom among pet-related service businesses. Since the national Association of Professional Animal Waste Specialists was founded in 2002 with a dozen members, 175 more companies have joined.Nicole Guzman and Dar Finlayson, owners of the 2-year-old company Happy Paws in Kings Park, pick up after other people’s pets in addition to dog walking and pet-sitting.“During our regular pooper scooper route, we will incorporate our dog walk into it,” Ms. Guzman said.According to the animal waste association, dog feces are not simply a nuisance; they also pose a health hazard. Left on the ground, the waste can contaminate water supplies. It can also transmit parasites, Ms. Guzman said.Ron Vecchio, owner of Minesweepers, a dog waste pickup service based in Wantagh, said he cleans up after 300 dogs a week. His clients include Buddy, a golden Labrador that belongs to Melissa Benkin, 41, of Garden City, an office technician for Verizon.“I don’t have the stomach for it,” Ms. Benkin said.She wants to keep the yard clean so that her 4-year-old daughter, Ashley, will not “step in the land mines” when she walks through the grass to her swing set.Mr. Vecchio said that while most owners pick up after their dogs while walking them on other people’s lawns, “when it comes to their own yard, things get a little harder to keep after.” He disposes of the waste in a Dumpster, he said.Since they started A Dog’s Business a little more than a year ago, Britta and Dennis Micic of Westbury have been signing up one or two new clients a week.“It’s becoming the new landscaping service,” said Ms. Micic, a former teacher.However, it has not resolved the Micics’ own problem: Who is going to pick up after Max, their 100-pound German shepherd?“My husband and I are still arguing about that,” Ms. Micic said.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','The closest thing to a trial by fire in chess in this country is the World Open in Pennsylvania. The tournament has become the nation’s pre-eminent event, living up to its grandiose name.This year’s Open, which ran from June 28 to July 4, attracted 35 grandmasters and 10 international masters. In all the sections, more than 1,000 players took part. Why do so many people play? Money. This year, prizes were substantial.The top section ended in a tie for first place among nine (yes, nine!) grandmasters. On tiebreaks, Varuzhan Akobian of California was awarded the victory.How did nine players tie for first? When they faced lower-ranked players, they usually won, but when they faced one another, most games ended in draws. While many of those draws were competitive (a 69-move game between Hikaru Nakamura and Sandipan Chanda; a 31-move battle in which Alexander Stripunsky forced a perpetual check against Nakamura by sacrificing a rook and a knight), others were not (12 moves between Leonid Yudasin and Akobian; 17 moves between Nakamura and Akobian).Were the short draws a conspiracy? Probably not. More likely, they were a byproduct of economic reality. All the grandmasters who tied for first earn their living from chess. While all certainly wanted to win the tournament outright, drawing so often assured them of ending up “in the money” — a little more than $5,000 each, before expenses.Still, some blood was shed among the top players. In Round 5, Akobian took down Stripunsky, who was leading with a perfect 4-0. Stripunsky recovered to tie for first.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','“And I got a lamp for $20,” a regular caller says on this afternoon.Programs like Tradio — the Swap Shop, for example, or Tell It and Sell It — appear on small stations around the country. They usually prohibit the sale of bedding, firearms and animal husbandry, and often hint of curious interior lives. Not long ago, a car radio casting for a signal in West Virginia snagged a program in which a female caller was looking to sell a house, 16 acres, a bowling ball and a sequin dress slit up the side.Here in Sylva, where WRGC’s power drops to 250 watts at sunset, Tradio may well be the most popular program on the air. “We get anything and everything,” says Will Candler, the station’s 26-year-old operations manager. “Matter of fact, I bought a lawn mower off of it. Use it to this day.”Mr. Candler is also the morning show host and an ad salesman, which is the way things are at small stations: many tasks being handled by a few, all for the thrill of achieving that almost spiritual state of being called “on the air.” The other half-dozen employees at WRGC include the hosts, Dennis the Menace and Frank “The Byrdman” Byrd, with Charlie Bauder on the news and Brandon Stephens, “the Voice of the Mustangs,” on sports.From Mr. Candler’s modest office in the modest station headquarters, you can see a horse named Kitty grazing in a nearby field and feel the tremble as another freight train grinds its way past to a local paper mill. “It comes about three times a day,” he says. “We try not to have the mike on when it comes through.”Back to Tradio, sponsored by Savannah Farms Nursery and the Rusty Lizard bar. Down the steps, past shelved rows of thousands of black discs that haven’t spun on a turntable in years — from the Gospel Melody Singers singing about the Lord to Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty singing “You Done Lost Your Baby” — and into the wall-carpeted control room. There, the white-bearded Mr. Nelson sips a Mountain Dew and leans in again as if to share endearments with that microphone.“Tradio, whether you’re lookin’ to buy, sell, trade or give away,” he says. “Perhaps a stray pet has wandered into your area. Well, maybe you want to try to find the owner. Or, heaven forbid, you’ve lost a pet. Well, we’ll try to help you.”Mr. Nelson, 58, has worked at so many stations over so many years that their call letters seem to run together into one alphabetical jumble. He used to resist his nickname but has since come to embrace minor celebrity; “Dennis the Menace” appears on the shirt he’s wearing and on the front license plate of his pickup truck parked near the railroad tracks.He lives with five cats in “the last house in the holler” and sees Tradio as a conversation with a community of both the rich and the poor. “We’ll have someone selling antiques,” he says during a break. “And the very next call is someone wanting to sell their chickens.”Eighty-four degrees in Sylva, skies are bright and “it’s your turn on Tradio.” Someone has a refrigerator for sale, with ice maker. Someone has a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am, in good condition. Someone has 650 concrete blocks but leaves unclear the small matter of delivery.Dennis the Menace returns after a commercial break. And with that deep, almost unreal voice of his, he invites another of us to join him on the air.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','My boss would send out a memo and copy everyone, and I’d write back and tell him he didn’t know what he was talking about. I’d copy everyone, too. I’d counter him point by point and say that his idea was the stupidest thing I’d ever heard. Someone took me aside and said I couldn’t do that. I finally understood that a corporation has niceties and you don’t publicly humiliate anyone.When I got married my father sat me down and said: “Flowers are an expense, but you know what’s really expensive? Divorce.” I’ve remembered that. Not only has it helped me stay married, it has been helpful to me as a C.E.O.There are always a million little things to worry about, but if you don’t focus on what’s really expensive, you can get caught up in small issues and forget the big things. At work I’m always saying, “You know what’s really expensive? Divorce.” People look at me and have no idea what I’m talking about.I like building an organization. I was an executive at AOL, Lotus and Netscape. A good company is a great place for everyone, not just the C.E.O. It’s fun, you learn a lot, and people are better off for it. That was always important to me.Tony Robbins, the motivational speaker, said, “If you don’t know what you want, chances are very low that you’ll get it.” That’s another thing I keep in mind.If you want a steady paycheck and stability, starting a company is probably a bad idea. I learned, in founding Opsware and Loudcloud, its predecessor, that everything is a risk.It’s the key to my father’s flowers story. There’s always a risk in going public or in acquiring another company, for instance, but the real question is whether it’s more expensive to not go public or not buy that company. People rarely weigh the cost of not taking a risk. Those are the ones that get you.I learned another lesson when I started Loudcloud in 1999. We were a services business hosting companies’ Web sites and e-commerce stores on our servers. Our clients were dot-coms. The challenge in the high-tech industry back then was to build a good team fast enough. The market and the money were there. I thought I had built the best team ever, but we were definitely going to fail and go bankrupt. For the life of me I couldn’t understand why, when we had this great team.Andy Rachleff, a venture capitalist who had invested in us, said that what was important was the size of the opportunity and the quality of the team. But, he said, a bad market always beats a good team. The truth hit me with a jolt — it was absolutely that dramatic.We were in a bad market. That’s when I knew we had to change into a software company. That’s something else I’ve never forgotten: One of the biggest jobs of a C.E.O. is to find a good market.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','The C.B.O.’s most recent calculations of federal tax rates show a highly progressive system. (The numbers are based on 2004 data, but the tax code has not changed much since then.) The poorest fifth of the population, with average annual income of $15,400, pays only 4.5 percent of its income in federal taxes. The middle fifth, with income of $56,200, pays 13.9 percent. And the top fifth, with income of $207,200, pays 25.1 percent.At the very top of the income distribution, the C.B.O. reports even higher tax rates. The richest 1 percent has average income of $1,259,700 and forks over 31.1 percent of its income to the federal government.One might wonder how Mr. Buffett gets away with a tax rate of only 17.7 percent, while a typical millionaire is paying so much more. Most likely, part of the answer is that Mr. Buffett’s income is made up largely of dividends and capital gains, which are taxed at only 15 percent. By contrast, many other top earners pay the maximum ordinary income tax rate of 35 percent on their salaries, bonuses and business income.The distinction is crucial for understanding how much the rich pay. Indeed, the share of top incomes coming from capital is much lower now than it has been historically. According to Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, for the richest Americans — those in the top 0.01 percent of the distribution — the percentage of income derived from capital fell to 25 percent in 2004 from 70 percent in 1929.If your image of the typical rich person is someone who collects interest and dividend checks and spends long afternoons relaxing on his yacht, you are decades out of date. The leisure class has been replaced by the working rich.Another piece of the puzzle is that Mr. Buffett’s tax burden is larger than it first appears, because he is a major shareholder in Berkshire Hathaway.When the C.B.O. studies the tax burden, it includes all federal taxes, including individual income taxes, payroll taxes and corporate income taxes. In its analysis, payroll taxes are borne by workers, and corporate taxes by the owners of capital. For the richest 1 percent of the population, 9.3 percentage points of their 31.1 percent tax rate comes from the taxes that corporations have paid on their behalf. The corporate tax would undoubtedly loom large if the C.B.O. were to calculate Mr. Buffett’s effective tax rate.None of these calculations, however, say whether the rich are paying their fair share. Fairness is not an economic concept. If you want to talk fairness, you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy.The quintessential political philosopher of modern liberalism is John Rawls, the author of the 1971 classic “A Theory of Justice.” Professor Rawls concluded that the primary goal of public policy should be to redistribute resources to help those at the very bottom of the economic ladder. If Professor Rawls were alive today, he would most likely want to raise the top income tax rate of 35 percent in order to finance a more generous safety net. And for much the same reason, he would probably raise taxes on the middle class as well.Professor Rawls would get a vigorous debate from his Harvard colleague, the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick. In his 1974 book, “Anarchy, State, and Utopia,” Professor Nozick wrote: “We are not in the position of children who have been given portions of pie by someone who now makes last-minute adjustments to rectify careless cutting. There is no central distribution, no person or group entitled to control all the resources, jointly deciding how they are to be doled out. What each person gets, he gets from others who give to him in exchange for something, or as a gift. In a free society, diverse persons control different resources, and new holdings arise out of the voluntary exchanges and actions of persons.”To libertarians like Professor Nozick, requiring the rich to pay more just because they are rich is little more than officially sanctioned theft.There is no easy way to bridge this philosophical divide, but the political process will, inevitably, try to forge a practical compromise among those with wildly divergent views. At the 2000 Republican National Convention, the candidate George W. Bush made clear where he stood: “On principle, no one in America should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government.” As judged by the C.B.O. data, he has accomplished his goal.A question for any political candidate today is whether he or she agrees with the Bush tax ceiling. If not, how high above a third is he or she willing to go?'"
"'07-07-15,'0','The first Yotel, a low-cost Japanese-style “capsule hotel,” opened June 30 at Gatwick Airport, and many of its first guests were travelers in need of a place to stay in London because of security delays following the attack on the Glasgow airport that day.According to Elizabeth Williams, a spokeswoman for Yotel (www.yotel.com), that first day the hotel had “a few stranded guests due to security delays.” The next day, customers called to reserve some of the 46 “cabins” for only a few hours before early-morning flights, concerned about security lines and traffic — exactly the marketing niche, along with unexpected flight delays and cancellations, Yotel hopes to fill.Yotel offers two types of cabins, premium and standard (75 square feet, shown at right), each of which Yotel asserts can sleep two. Both have bathrooms, room to store small bags and suitcases and hang a suit, Wi-Fi, flat screen TVs with 60 stations, radios and even 24-hour room service for light meals and drinks, including beer and wine.The biggest amenity in the eight premium cabins is space (an extra 30 square feet), as well as a couch that, with the flick of a switch, becomes a double bed.A standard cabin costs £25 for four hours ($50 at $2 to the pound) and £55 overnight. A premium cabin costs £40 for four hours and £80 overnight.An economy class is also planned at future Yotels; those cabins will not have private bathrooms. The next Yotel is scheduled to open within the year at Heathrow airport.'"
"'07-07-15,'0','Even without the book, for example, you might catch a glimpse of the colorful onion domes of the Central Synagogue, a Reform temple built on Lexington Avenue in the 1870s, following a Moorish-style synagogue-building trend that started in Germany and arrived in New York via Cincinnati. But you'd miss the two landmarked buildings that are the synagogue's neighbors on otherwise nondescript East 55th Street.At No. 116-118, there's a neo-Georgian house from 1927 that has Flemish-bond brickwork, elegant shutters and two carved eagles guarding the entrance. And at No. 124, the Mary Hale Cunningham House, renovated with a neo-Tudor facade in 1909, has perplexing signs attached to the second-story railing that read “Eleanor's Building” and “She Who Must Be Obeyed.” Turns out those were put up there in 1983 (before the house was landmarked) as a fanciful tribute to the wife of the owner of a television production company based in the building.The West Village is thick with landmarks, especially since a huge chunk of it is part of the Greenwich Village Historic District. The book picks out several can't-miss (but easy to miss) buildings. There is, for example, the spare but elegant Federal-style triangular building stuck in the middle of an intersection of Waverly Place and Christopher Street with the battered signs that read “Northern Dispensary, Founded 1827.”It looks like the kind of place where Ben Franklin or Sam Adams might have hung out, but it was a clinic for the poor. The book says that it was built in two stories, but a third story was added in 1855; if it didn't, you'd never notice that the third-story bricks are just a bit different from those of the second.Also in the Village, you might never go down East 10th Street from Fifth Avenue to check out the Lockwood de Forest House, which is now part of New York University, at No. 7. But its intricately detailed teak on the second-floor facade, brought in from Ahmadabad, India, in the late 19th century, is amazing. And you'd never end up at the far western end of cobblestoned Jane Street to check out the American Seamen's Friend Society Sailors' Home and Institute, a hotel for indigent sailors that was host to crew members who survived the sinking of the Titanic. There's another reason to visit these days; the building is home to Socialista, a new upscale Cuban lounge that has a downstairs restaurant.If you're near Macy's or the Empire State Building, the East 30s have a nice batch of landmarks, including the town houses of the Murray Hill Historic District. But on 36th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, a block you would be strolling down only by blind luck, is hidden Sniffen Court, a quaint private alley of former horse stables built starting in 1863 and now inhabited by well-off humans.Or the supercool wooden doors at the James F. D. and Harriet Lanier House at 123 East 35th Street, built between 1901 and 1903 in the Beaux-Arts style. Gaze at it from across the street, where your view will only be slightly corrupted by the significantly more contemporary Muni-Meter parking ticket machine. (The sidewalk is apparently not protected by the landmarks law.)As you wander past these buildings, the question that will gnaw at you is: “Who the heck lives there?” But surprisingly often, you'll catch real people (not dressed in period attire) coming in and out of the buildings. Who are they? How did they end up in the house? Perhaps they won't appreciate your stopping them to ask about the house, but that's one way to find out.Guide to New York City Landmarks, Third Edition (Wiley, 2004, $26.95).

"'07-07-16,'1','This is the face of battle in a new war and a new century — a 46-year-old Pakistani-American woman, sent to the war zone as part of a rented army of 130,000 civilians supporting 150,000 United States soldiers and marines. Taking the place of junior enlisted troops in every American army before this one, these contract employees cook meals, wash clothes, deliver fuel, maintain weapons and guard bases. And they suffer and die alongside their brothers and sisters in uniform. About 1,000 contractors have been killed in Iraq since the war began; nearly 13,000 have been injured.The consequences of the war will be lasting for many of them and their families, ordeals that are largely invisible to most Americans. And they will be costly. The most grievously injured, like Mrs. Khan, are initially treated at military hospitals in Iraq and Europe, but then sent home and left to the mercies of their employer’s insurance carrier. The less critically hurt, and those with psychic wounds, must fend for themselves to get care.Nobody makes the private workers go to Iraq or forces them to stay, of course; the high salaries some collect lead critics to dismiss them as mercenaries and their employers as profiteers. But many more contractors, like Mrs. Khan, earn relatively modest wages — far less than the $100,000 the Army says an enlisted soldier costs annually in pay, benefits and training — and some foreign workers who perform some of the most dangerous tasks are paid just dollars a day. After a decade of downsizing and outsourcing, the American military cannot wage war without them.“Everything about this is unprecedented,” said Peter W. Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who has written about contractors on the battlefield. “The scope, the numbers, the roles people are performing. This is all new ground.”In addition to escaping her troubles, Mrs. Khan, who became an American citizen in 2001, thought going to Iraq would give her a chance to repay the country that granted her fulfillment she could never have had in Pakistan, a close friend said.“She is totally trapped now — only her mind and her soul remain her own,” Betty Linder, Mrs. Khan’s former boss wrote in an e-mail interview. “Her quest for freedom, literally and symbolically, put her in an eternal prison. The sadness of this could almost symbolize the sadness of the whole Iraq situation.”The Decision to GoLife was promising for Shaheen Abdul as a young girl in Karachi, where her father was a lawyer. But the family’s fortunes turned after her father died when Shaheen was seven, and she and her older sister, Mumtaz, eventually struck out on their own. Her sister married an India-born American citizen and moved to Houston in 1980. Mrs. Khan attended the University of Karachi, where she was a top student and earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology.In 1986, at age 26, she followed her sister to Houston and began working in her dry cleaning shop. She returned to Karachi seven years later to marry Abdul Waheed Khan, a welder , a union arranged by their families. When her husband got work papers in 1998, the couple came to the United States.Mrs. Khan began teaching at Mrs. Linder’s pre-school, the Linder Learning Land. “Shaheen does not have children of her own, and she gives all of her love to those that she teaches,” Mrs. Linder wrote.But as happy as she was at school, things were tense at home, a small apartment in Houston. Her husband, then working for Halliburton, was often away on jobs and sporadically unemployed. The couple was struggling with credit card debt and car loans that by 2004 totaled more than $35,000, Mrs. Khan said. KBR, which until earlier this year was a subsidiary of Halliburton, was hiring for all manner of work in Iraq. Mrs. Khan signed up for a laundry job with a base salary of $48,000 a year and the chance to make as much as $80,000 with overtime, much of it tax-free. She and her husband planned to work a year in Iraq, return to Houston, clear their debts and start anew.She signed the 13-page employment agreement with KBR on Aug. 12, 2004, without reading it. The contract notes that she would be working in a “potentially hazardous environment” and that her only compensation if she were hurt or killed would be that provided under the Defense Base Act, a World War II-era law that provides death and disability insurance for workers employed at United States military facilities overseas.Mrs. Khan said that she underwent several days of briefings and training in safety procedures by KBR, and acknowledged that company officials were forthcoming about the dangers. Heather Browne, a KBR spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message that during training, “most of the time is spent on discouraging recruits from taking the job.”After the contracts were signed, the Khans were told it was company policy not to send spouses to the same war zone, as they had hoped. On Aug. 15, Abdul Khan boarded a plane to work as a welder at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Thirteen days later, Shaheen left Houston for Baghdad.She was assigned a sandbag-ringed trailer in a KBR residential compound known as D2 inside the Green Zone. At 6 a.m. each day, a van would pick up Mrs. Khan and other laundry workers and take them to Camp Warrior at the other end of the Green Zone, where Mrs. Khan worked in a trailer logging in bags of laundry for soldiers and civilian workers.She found the war zone overwhelming. She had to wear a helmet and a flak vest, and jumped every time she heard a mortar land or a roadside bomb explode. Her husband, with whom she talked every few days by satellite phone, urged her to go home.On Oct. 3, 2004, she and four other workers at Camp Warrior were preparing to return to D2 for the night. Anice Holmes, a no-nonsense grandmother who lives on a small horse farm outside Livingston, Tex., usually took the wheel. She had been in Iraq for six months to try to accumulate some cash after her husband became disabled.That day, however, Fitim Konjuvca, a young worker from Kosovo, begged to do the driving. Mrs. Holmes gave him the keys.Mrs. Holmes and her sister, Kathy Elliott, and Mrs. Khan climbed in the back seat. Another KBR laundry worker they knew only as Mayo took the front passenger seat.Mr. Konjuvca sped off onto a boulevard near the famous crossed-sabers memorial and began climbing past 70 miles per hour, Mrs. Holmes recalled. “My sister began to yell, ‘Fitim!’ to tell him to slow down and then we saw the box in the road. I figured he was going to slow down and go around it and then he was throwing on the brakes and we’re rolling over. I thought we were gone.”As the car was tumbling, Mrs. Holmes recalled praying, “Jesus forgive me of my sins.” Mrs. Khan said she recited verses from the Koran before blacking out.Mrs. Khan and Mrs. Holmes were the most badly hurt. They were treated at an Army field hospital in Baghdad and then flown to the Army’s Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany for surgery.Mrs. Khan’s husband, alerted to the accident by KBR officials in Afghanistan, took a military plane to be by her side. “I am crying and shouting and weeping and asking what is wrong,” Mr. Khan said. “They told me it was her back. I knew right away she would never walk again.”After five days at Landstuhl, Mrs. Khan was flown to Houston, where she endured weeks of surgery and rehabilitation at two hospitals. She eventually ended up in the Willowbrook nursing home near her old neighborhood, sharing a small room with a dying old woman.KBR dismissed her, as it does all employees unable to work. Her case was turned over to its insurer, the American International Group, which handles about 80 percent of claims for contract workers in Iraq and Afghanistan.A.I.G. paid Mrs. Khan’s hospital charges and is covering her nursing home costs. The company calculated her disability payments at $208.88 a week, based on her salary as a teacher and the five weeks she worked in Iraq. On the advice of an A.I.G. adjuster, she hired Gary B. Pitts, a Houston lawyer who represents dozens of contractors hurt in Iraq, and sued the insurer for a higher payment, based on her real and anticipated earnings at KBR. A year and a half after her injury, an administrative law judge awarded her $30,500 a year until she is deemed fit to return to work.She has also disputed her medical benefits with A.I.G. The company rejected a claim for treatment of an infected foot, finally relenting after months of wrangling. But the company has refused to pay for in-home care so that she can leave the nursing home. An A.I.G. official, Chris Winans, said he could not comment on Mrs. Khan’s case for privacy reasons.Some Americans shrug about the casualties among contractors, saying they made their money and they took their chances. Others, though, think the nation owes them something more.“We should honor their sacrifices and those of their families,” said Frank Camm, an economist at the Rand Corporation who has studied battlefield contractors and is the son of a retired Army lieutenant general. “They’re not in uniform, and there is something special about being in uniform. But they deserve a hell of a lot more than we’re giving them.”Shaheen Khan does not dwell on such questions, or if she does, she does not talk about it. She looks back with regret on her decision to go to Iraq, the product, she now believes, of desperation and self-delusion.“I made a big mistake going over there,” she said. “I fooled myself.”'"
"'07-07-16,'1','WASHINGTON, July 16 — In the face of fierce Russian opposition to the Bush administration’s plans to install an antimissile system in Eastern Europe, the visiting Polish president insisted today that the program was “really a defense instrument” that would in no way threaten Russia.“It is aimed at defense of our democracies against the countries who might have or already do have nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction,” President Lech Kaczynski said in brief remarks after a meeting with President Bush.Mr. Bush in turn said that the program, which calls for installation of 10 interceptors in Poland and radar operations in the Czech Republic — would protect not just the United States but much of Europe from potential threats “from parts of the world where leaders don’t particularly care for our way of life and are in the process of trying to develop serious weapons of mass destruction,” presumably meaning Iran.The meeting came only two days after Russia announced that it was suspending participation in an important treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe in what was seen as a clear demonstration of anger over the American antimissile plans.Today, the two leaders did not mention Russia’s treaty suspension in their public comments, but Polish news reports said earlier that the Kaczynski delegation planned to seek greater security guarantees from Washington, reflecting heightened concerns about Russia’s angry reaction to the antimissile plan.'"
"'07-07-16,'1','There has been a lot of criticism of Senator John McCain and his campaign advisers for the touchstone strategic assumption they made in planning his presidential campaign. With Vice President Cheney having long ago ruled out running, Mr. McCain built his approach on the belief that he would be viewed as the Republican heir apparent. That meant rustling up big name consultants and then awaiting the deluge of campaign contributions needed to finance a Rolls Royce campaign.As has become painfully evident now, that was not such a good bet. Mr. McCain’s aides kept their side of the bargain when it came to spending --high salaries for consultants, private planes for the candidate, multiple offices and Blackberries for all – but not when it came to fund-raising. Mr. McCain’s campaign is broke and his hopes of winning the nomination are, shall we say, diminished.But was that fundamental assumption by Mr. McCain – that he would be the heir apparent for the nomination – really that misguided? The fact of the matter is that speaking historically at least (and with the caveat that one must today more than ever be careful in using political history to predict what might happen in these extraordinarily unsettled political times) Mr. McCain’s decision was certainly defensible.Indeed, should he fail to win the nomination, one of the legacies of this election is not only what it says about Mr. McCain, but what it says about the typically well-ordered Republican Party: a departure from at least 40 years of history in which, for all the hustle and bustle of nominating contest, the party tends to anoint its successor early and stick with him. With rare exceptions, the Republican nomination goes to the vice president (George H. W. Bush), the candidate who came in second last time (Ronald Reagan) or someone who is for whatever reason clearly entitled to the nomination, because of stature or family lineage (President Bush).Mr. McCain fell into the second category. He ran in 2000 and lost to Mr. Bush.“We have always been royalists,” said Nelson Warfield, who was press secretary to Bob Dole when he won the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 after, naturally enough, losing to George H. W. Bush in 1988. “Reagan ran against Ford and Reagan got the nomination next time. Bush ran against Reagan and became the vice president. Dole had been running forever, he was obviously the Crown Prince. Bush was the son of Bush.”'"
"'07-07-16,'1','Williams, fresh from her Wimbledon victory last week, gave the United States its other point, with a three-set victory over Petrova on Saturday. But Vania King, ranked 84th, lost easily to Petrova.King and Tu, ranked 43rd, were playing because Serena Williams pulled out last week with an injury.Although the Russians were missing Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova because of injuries, they had Chakvetadze and Petrova — ranked eighth and ninth in the world.The United States had beaten Russia four of five times in Cup play, but Russia has won the title twice in three years. The United States has not reached the finals since winning for the 17th time in 2000.In the other semifinal, Francesca Schiavone helped host Italy win all of its points in a 3-2 victory over France.Schiavone, who beat Amélie Mauresmo on Saturday, rallied from 5-2 in the third set to defeat Tatiana Golovin, 6-4, 2-6, 7-5, in the last singles match yesterday. She then teamed with Roberta Vinci to defeat Nathalie Dechy and Séverine Brémond, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, in doubles.In the first singles match yesterday, Mauresmo rallied through oppressive heat to beat Mara Santangelo, 6-7 (5), 6-0, 6-4.At midday, the court temperature in Castellaneta Marina, in southern Italy, was 111 degrees. Players were allowed a 10-minute heat break before the start of the third set during the singles matches.Schiavone has had a disappointing season, with her singles ranking falling to No. 31 from 15.SANTORO WINS HALL OF FAME TITLE Fabrice Santoro, seeded fourth, made the most of his two-handed style yesterday in Newport, R.I., to win the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships title, beating the fifth-seeded Nicolas Mahut, 6-4, 6-4. It was the first all-French final in the tournament’s 31-year history.Santoro, 34, won his fifth career ATP title and his first since 2002. He is the oldest player to win a tournament since Andre Agassi won at Los Angeles in 2005, when he was 35.“Every time you play a tournament you want to win,” said Santoro, who entered the week ranked 68th. “But when you haven’t won a tournament in five years, you think that’s it for a career.”Santoro showed why Pete Sampras, one of the Hall of Fame inductees Saturday, nicknamed him The Magician five years ago because of his two-handed forehand and backhand slices, cuts and lobs.“It was one of the biggest compliments I’ve ever had,” Santoro said of Sampras’s comments. “Coming from him was huge for me.”Santoro closed out the match with a two-handed backhand winner along the sideline.MATHIEU TAKES SWISS OPEN Paul-Henri Mathieu became the second Frenchman to win the Swiss Open title, defeating Andreas Seppi of Italy yesterday in Gstaad, 6-7 (1), 6-4, 7-5. Richard Gasquet was the first, winning this clay-court tournament last year.The temperature reached 104 degrees during the final. Seppi broke Mathieu’s serve to take a 5-3 lead in the third set, but Mathieu then broke Seppi twice before winning.Mathieu improved to 3-0 against Seppi, who was playing in his first ATP Tour singles final.FERRER WINS SWEDISH OPEN In an all-Spanish final, David Ferrer, the second seed, defeated the unseeded Nicolás Almagro, 6-1, 6-2, in the Swedish Open yesterday in Bastad to win his fourth ATP title.“I’m very happy for this win; I played well all week,” said Ferrer, who lost only one set in his five matches at the tournament.'"
"'07-07-16,'1','“We came to rescue the self-esteem of the Brazilian worker, who wakes up in the morning and returns home late at night, whose only satisfaction in life is seeing Brazil win a football match,” Dunga said.Argentina has a record 14 Copa titles but none since 1993. It was the 10th meeting between the teams in the final, but Brazil won for only the second time.Baptista put Brazil ahead on its first foray forward, picking up a bouncing ball just inside the penalty area and spinning it into the far side of the goal past goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri, who had no chance.Argentina had an opportunity to tie five minutes later when Juan Sebastian Verón redirected a cross from Lionel Messi to an unmarked Juan Román Riquelme, but he slammed the ball off a post from 12 yards.Argentina defender Roberto Ayala put Brazil ahead by 2-0 when he slid in an attempt to clear a cross into the 6-yard box from Alves, who had replaced the injured Elano in the 33rd minute. The cross was headed toward Abbondanzieri but Ayala poked the ball into his own goal. Alves’s second-half goal came on an angled shot from about 15 yards off a pass from Vagner Love, who led a counter.“We’re totally ruined,” Argentina midfielder Esteban Cambiasso said. “Losing like this hurts your soul.”Mexico defeated Uruguay, 3-1, on Saturday to finish third.CHILE AND ARGENTINA ADVANCE Chile got two goals from Mauricio Isla and one each from Jaime Grondona and Mathias Vidangossy to defeat Nigeria, 4-0, yesterday in a FIFA Under-20 World Cup quarterfinal in Montreal. Chile will face Argentina, a 1-0 winner against Mexico in a quarterfinal in Ottawa, on Thursday in Toronto.Maximiliano Morales scored the winner for Argentina right before the break with a drive that deflected off Julio Cesar Dominguez of Mexico. CHELSEA STARTS WELL Manager José Mourinho got exactly what he wanted out of Chelsea’s preseason opener. Thanks to a bold debut by Florent Malouda, he got a victory as well.John Terry and Malouda scored late second-half goals, leading Chelsea to a 2-1 victory against Mexico’s Club América in the Disney Friendship Cup on Saturday night in Stanford, Calif.Malouda, who joined Chelsea in a $27 million transfer from the French champion Lyon on Tuesday, was the unlikely catalyst. He scored the tying goal in the 76th minute, then Terry headed home Malouda’s free kick for the winner with seven minutes remaining.But Mourinho has no interest in results during Chelsea’s West Coast tour, which includes a game against David Beckham and the Los Angeles Galaxy next weekend. Chelsea is instead using its fourth annual United States training camp to build teamwork and fitness for the start of the English Premier League schedule next month.“I’m pleased totally,” Mourinho said. “I think it was a very good training session. Club América, they gave us exactly what we need: competition, but competition with quality.”Chelsea will face Samsung Bluewings of South Korea tomorrow in its second Friendship Cup game before next Saturday’s much-anticipated meeting with the Galaxy, when Beckham is expected to make his debut.'"
"'07-07-16,'1','The national reconciliation conference was supposed to bring the warring factions back together. The plan was to invite 1,325 elders from Somalia’s dozens of clans and sub-clans and have them meet for at least 45 days to discuss clan differences, disarmament and radical Islam, a growing issue since an Islamic government briefly took power last year.“Our hope is that the tribes will forget all their wars from before,” said Abdi Haji Gobdon, a transitional government spokesman, before the conference.But the Islamists and hard-core members of opposing clans, who are thought to be the backbone of the growing insurgency — are boycotting.“The government doesn’t have a political vision for the country, they are not following a just process for the distribution of resources, and the president is using his militia as a clan militia,” said Mohammed Uluso, a former agricultural minister and leader of the Ayr clan, which remains mostly hostile to the government. “So, no, we don’t feel there’s any reason to attend this conference and lend it legitimacy.”Ibrahim Hassan Addou, the former foreign minister of the Islamist movement that briefly controlled the country for part of past year, said that until the Ethiopian troops that returned power to the transitional government left Somalia, the Islamist leadership had no interest in attending a conference.“Somalia is under occupation right now, and people are not free to express their views,” he said by telephone from Dubai. “So what’s the point?”Ethiopia invaded in December, with covert American help, and ousted the Islamic movement, which had managed to pacify much of the country. Ethiopian and American officials had accused the Islamists of harboring terrorists.Since then, the Ethiopian forces occupying Somalia have been struggling with an Iraq-style insurgency that has quickly progressed from drive-by shootings to suicide attacks and cellphone-detonated bombs. Mogadishu is so dangerous again that other nations hesitate to send peacekeepers. Despite pledges from African countries to send 8,000 soldiers, only 1,600 Ugandans have showed up so far.Meanwhile, the transitional federal government, a United Nations creation that has never had much grass-roots support, seems stuck in a rut. Its job is to shepherd the country toward elections in 2009. But it has yet to register voters or even organize a census. Piracy off Somalia’s 1,880-mile coastline is a serious issue again, threatening to cut off crucial food deliveries to a population that is often just a few handfuls of grain away from famine.Part of the problem is that the transitional government does not act like the multiclan outfit envisioned by the United Nations. Instead, many Somalis, especially in Mogadishu, see it as Darod clan revenge against the Hawiye for what happened in the early 1990s, when Hawiye warlords ran Darod clan members out of Mogadishu. Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, the transitional president, is a former Darod warlord. Tensions between the Darod and Hawiye, two of Somalia’s biggest clans, have dominated modern Somali political history.“Elders used to solve the problems among the tribes long ago,” said Bile Mohamoud Qabowsade, a Darod delegate. “So this conference may pave the way for a lasting solution among Somalis.”But the conference cannot succeed if representatives of major groups do not attend. Another possible reason that they stayed away is that the conference was to be limited mostly to clan issues, and not political ones. Had the government opened the possibility of picking a new prime minister or discussing more equitable ways of sharing revenues from Mogadishu’s port, about the only source of tax income right now, more opposition members might have come.While the transitional government is billing the conference as a historic, one-of-a-kind meeting, it is not much different from the transitional Parliament, which is made up of representatives of all major clans in a formula that reflects Somalia’s demographics. The Parliament has been essentially neutered, though, and recently more than 50 members made a formal statement demanding that they be consulted on important decisions, not ignored.Most foreign diplomats assigned to help piece Somalia back together seem worn out — and pessimistic. European diplomats who had promised to attend the conference canceled their flight at the last minute because the pilots refused to fly into Mogadishu.“I don’t think this could be opening in any worse conditions,” another Western diplomat said, also speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic protocol.One of the most radical ideas about governing Somalia came from a recent letter to the editor of a Nairobi newspaper: split the country into clan-based fiefs and rotate the president every few years.“The status quo can’t go on,” the first diplomat said. “Something’s going to change. For better or worse, I don’t know.”'"
"'07-07-16,'1','The third European Open Championships were held in Antalya, Turkey, June 15 to 30, with a much smaller American attendance this year because of tournament conflicts. The only medalists from the United States were Amos Kaminski and Sam Lev (winners of the Senior Teams with Yeshayahu Levit, Pinhas Romik, Adrian Schwartz and Rami Sheinman from Israel) and Victor Markowicz and Victor Melman (equal third in the Senior Teams with Shalom Zeligman from Israel and Aleksander Jezioro, Julian Klukowski and Jerzy Zaremba from Poland).The diagramed deal featured an instructive piece of declarer play by Christian Mari, a former world champion from France. He was playing in the final of the Senior Pairs.Some players holding that South hand would respond one no-trump, trying to get into diamonds and not willing to risk partner’s raising one spade to two spades with only three-card support. Also, if South bids one spade and North rebids two clubs, South would have to continue with two no-trump, an overbid. But getting into minors instead of majors or no-trump is not the way to win a pair event.Stanley Walter from Switzerland (North), on the second round of the auction, deciding that a slam was unlikely facing a passed partner, jumped straight to four spades. He did not rebid four diamonds, which would have been a splinter showing game values with four-card spade support and a singleton (or void) in diamonds.Mike Tedd from Wales (West) led a low diamond. Declarer won with his ace, discarding a club from the board, and cashed his heart queen.'"
"'07-07-16,'1','In a move that recalls the golden age of gossip reporting, OK! Magazine may have guaranteed its access to a celebrity couple by purchasing, but not publishing, photos of them in a sex act.Reports surfaced last week in The New York Daily News and various Web sites that OK! had paid $400,000 for photographs and a video of the singer Nick Lachey and his girlfriend Vanessa Minnillo in a hot tub. Mr. Lachey is no stranger to living his domestic life in the public eye, given his experience as a star of the reality television series “Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica” with his then-wife, Jessica Simpson. And Ms. Minnillo, a former MTV host and Entertainment Tonight reporter, is also a familiar face on the celebrity gossip circuit. But the photos, some of which had already been published, were a little more explicit than basic cable fare.A spokesman for OK! said that the magazine had not confirmed that the photos were purchased, and declined to comment further.OK!, which is the American version of a British magazine, has acknowledged that it occasionally pays for cover stories, mostly in efforts to build relationships with the celebrities it covers. But while paying for the rights to exclusive stories and photos has become increasingly common among OK!’s American competitors, buying photos to protect them from being published is more unusual and ethically dubious.If OK! did pay for the images in order to repress them, then the magazine now holds compromising photos of two celebrities it will want to cover in the future. The situation raises questions about what sort of access to the celebrities the magazine may have negotiated in return for the favor.One answer was quickly apparent: the couple appeared (clothed) on the cover of the July 16 issue of OK! and answered questions about the photos in an exclusive interview. “Where’s the scandal? I was in Mexico with my girlfriend of a year, celebrating our anniversary on a private vacation,” Mr. Lachey said. “Unfortunately, as a celebrity, you’re a target.”'"
"'07-07-16,'1','Occasional discounts are useful to manufacturers, since they spur people to snap up their products. But discounts have a harmful side-effect: they can permanently condition consumers to expect the product for less, hurting sales when it bounces back to full price.A recent paper in The Journal of Marketing described a series of studies that compared two styles of discount, with an eye to determining which one did better at keeping consumers’ future price expectations high. The studies found that discounts expressed as a percentage — for example, 45 percent off $20 shirts — worked better than equivalent discounts that stated the amount taken off — in this example, $9. The two types were equally effective at inducing people to buy.The reason was apparently that percentage discounts were less easily remembered than cash discounts, meaning they did not readily enter consumers’ memories as a new price. For similar reasons, hard-to-calculate discounts like 43 percent or 24 percent did not drive down consumers’ price expectations as much as simple discounts like 50 percent or 20 percent.“Simple isn’t good, because you’re able to figure out that new price and you have that number in your head,” said Devon DelVecchio, the paper’s lead author and an assistant professor of marketing at Miami University. “So let’s say I’m used to seeing Green Giant frozen broccoli at $2.20. It’s discounted 20 percent and I can quickly figure out, ‘That’s 44 cents.’ Next time I go to shop, well, ‘Green Giant frozen broccoli, that’s a $1.80 product.’ ” ALEX MINDLIN'"
"'07-07-16,'1','Between her busy touring schedule and the newborn son she adopted in May — not to mention her work battling global warming, among other things — the musician Sheryl Crow still manages to fit in a good deal of reading, if her product endorsements are to be believed.Since February, Ms. Crow has appeared in advertisements for The Wall Street Journal, a juxtaposition that seemed somewhat dissonant given the singer’s trademark song lyrics (like “all I want to do is have some fun” and “gonna tell everyone to lighten up”).More recently — and, perhaps, believably — Ms. Crow appeared in a spot for Self magazine, published by Condé Nast. The new ad, which started appearing in trade publications like Advertising Age and Automotive News last month, describes Ms. Crow as a “Singer, survivor, reader,” and shows her sitting in a garden, her legs crossed yoga-style and her arms wrapped around a copy of Self.Ms. Crow was selected “because she is representative of the magazine’s editorial direction,” Richard D. Beckman, president of the Condé Nast Media Group and chief marketing officer of Condé Nast, wrote in an e-mail message. While The Journal’s ads are meant to attract new readers, Mr. Beckman made the distinction that the Condé Nast ads are aimed more at potential advertisers.While Ms. Crow may have grown up reading her grandmother’s subscription copies of The Wall Street Journal, according to Dow Jones, there is reason to believe that she occasionally manages to skim Self as well: she appeared on the cover of the magazine’s March 2007 issue and attended an climate change fund-raiser that Self sponsored in December.'"
"'07-07-16,'1','WASHINGTON, July 15 — A top Bush administration official urged Congress on Sunday to drop its efforts to limit the American troop mission in Iraq, at least until a more definitive progress report comes in September, and he appeared to try to set lower expectations for what the report would show.Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, gently rebuffed a proposal from two leading Republicans who favor a changed policy on Iraq, Senators Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and John W. Warner of Virginia. Their proposal would give President Bush until October to submit a plan to begin limiting the involvement of American forces in Iraq.“They’ve done a useful service in indicating the kinds of things that we should be thinking about,” Mr. Hadley said on ABC’s “This Week,” “but the time to begin that process is September.”Appearing on four Sunday morning news programs, he said that the administration’s troop-increase plan, fully in place only since mid-June, deserved breathing room. He pointed to the September deadline for a progress report to be submitted by the top United States military commander in Iraq, Gen. David H. Petraeus, and the senior civilian official, Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker.An interim report issued Thursday showed mixed progress, with advances in eight “benchmark” areas, especially in military areas, but inadequate progress in eight others, particularly on political matters. But with September looming, Mr. Hadley appeared to try to reset the standard for success.'"

"'07-07-17,'1','Plans to coordinate with state and local government about when to close schools are also still in the works, they said.These updates were delivered Tuesday during a White House briefing on the government’s progress in preparing the nation for an outbreak of a deadly infectious disease. Top officials emphasized that significant planning and investment decisions had already been made, including a $1 billion investment in finding new ways to manufacture flu vaccines.But, said Dr. Venkayya, “there is much work that remains to be done.”Also Tuesday, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it has released $897 million to states for emergency preparedness efforts. The money includes $175 million for pandemic flu preparedness. A nationwide surveillance system to track the progress of an outbreak as it moves around the world and across the country still needs considerable work, officials said.“Just to be brutally honest, we have a lot of trouble determining when we have an outbreak of disease in a community here in the U.S.,” Dr. Venkayya said. “We need to have uniform biosurveillance capability to prepare not only for a pandemic but any outbreak of infectious disease.”The nation also has very little extra capacity in its hospitals and other health care facilities to deal with the surge of demand that would accompany a mass disease outbreak, Dr. Venkayya said. And the government has little ability to ensure that, during an outbreak when many workers would stay home, that limited Internet capacity goes to essential work and not to children playing video games, officials said.Eighty-six percent of the tasks that were due to be completed this year under the president’s flu plan have been finished, officials said. The remaining 14 percent of those tasks should be done by the end of the year, Dr. Venkayya said.A significant remaining challenge, officials said, was that the country had grown tired of pandemic flu warnings. They emphasized that their planning would help prepare for any disease outbreak, whether from a terrorist attack or natural causes.Jeff Levi, executive director of Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit organization dedicated to disease prevention, praised the administration’s flu preparations.“This report demonstrates that the federal government has made major strides in preparedness for a pandemic, but as the administration also recognizes, there is still a long way to go before all levels of government and all sectors of society are fully prepared,” Mr. Levi said.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Intel, a closely watched indicator of the overall health of the technology industry, reported net income of $1.3 billion, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $8.7 billion in the second quarter, besting analysts’ predictions.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast earnings of 19 cents per share on $8.54 billion in revenue, up from 15 cents per share on revenue of $8 billion in the second quarter last year. In April, Intel said it expected to report second-quarter revenue of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion.The company said net income include tax items that increased earning per share by approximately 3 cents, along with restructuring charges of $82 million.Financial results were issued after the close of regular trading. Shares of Intel closed at $26.33, up 38 cents, before the report was released. But shortly after the announcement, the shares were down more than $1, or 4 percent, in extended trading.Analysts generally think Intel benefited in the second quarter from strong computer sales and higher-margins on chips. Intel continues to benefit from a vast overhaul of its product line as well as a corporate restructuring that has sharply reduced employment and cut expenses.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Shaking up the highest ranks of the video game business, Electronic Arts, the No. 1 game publisher, said today that it had lured Peter Moore, head of Microsoft’s games business, to run its large but sluggish sports division.Microsoft said that Don Mattrick, a longtime game executive, would take over that company’s game operations, which under Mr. Moore has made its Xbox 360 a strong contender to dominate the high end of the game console market. In a twist of musical chairs, Mr. Mattrick had been considered a leading candidate to become chief executive of Electronic Arts before leaving the company last year. He has been an adviser to Microsoft’s game unit since February.For Electronic Arts, which has had little revenue growth over the last three years, Mr. Moore’s arrival is meant to reinvigorate a sports division that has enjoyed the largesse of its fantastically popular Madden NFL series but at the apparent cost of a bit of complacency.E.A.’s sports games cater almost exclusively to the same young male demographic that the game industry has focused on for decades. More recently, however, the growth in the games business — underlined by the success of casual systems like Nintendo’s Wii — has been in appealing to women, children and older people who had not considered themselves gamers. Mr. Moore’s main challenge will be to reorient Electronic Arts’ sports unit to capture more casual players without alienating the company’s hardcore base customers.John Riccitiello, a former Electronic Arts executive who had left to become a private equity investor, returned to the company as chief executive in April. He has since reorganized the company into four main divisions: casual games, action-oriented games, the Sims franchise and sports.“Peter’s somebody I’ve been trying to recruit for the better part of a decade,” Mr. Riccitiello said in a telephone interview. “He’s one of the true talents in the industry. He knows sports better than almost anyone I’ve ever met. He was the toughest competitor we ever had on the sports side when he was at Sega. He’s done a great job at Microsoft and we’re thrilled to have him.”'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Flash flood warnings were issued today for Chicago and nearby areas by the National Weather Service as a series of severe thunderstorms moved across the Upper Midwest.The storms come packing heavy rainfall that the service could be as much as 5 inches in some locations. These storm drenched eastern Iowa and northwestern Missouri early in the day.“This is a potentially dangerous situation with very high rain,” the service warned. It said today’s storm are in addition to the 1 to 4 inches that had already fallen over eastern Iowa.The storms are expected to continue during the day and into Wednesday morning and contain wind gusts of up to 40 miles an hour.Forecaster warned of localized flooding in low-lying areas and of water on roadways that could cause drivers to lose control of their vehicles. Because a series of storms is expected in the same locations, the threat of flooding is increased, forecasters said.The storms are expected to cause flight delays, particularly for those going through Chicago, as pilots seek to avoid turbulence by flying around the thunder heads.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','The state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, and his staff said yesterday that more than a hundred pages of internal records were discovered to be missing after the resignation in the spring of David Loglisci, a former top official in their office. Mr. Loglisci was deputy comptroller for pension investment and cash management under Mr. DiNapoli’s predecessor, Alan G. Hevesi. The documents were related to investment decisions made by the state pension fund. All but two or three pages of the records have been recovered from other sources, members of Mr. DiNapoli’s staff said. The issue of the missing records has emerged as Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo and the Albany County district attorney, P. David Soares, are investigating ethical and management lapses during Mr. Hevesi’s four-year tenure. Mr. Hevesi pleaded guilty to a felony and resigned in December after being accused of ordering state workers to chauffeur his ailing wife. Mr. DiNapoli said that the documents’ absence was noticed soon after Mr. Loglisci resigned and that the Albany County district attorney’s office was notified at once. The missing documents were reported on Monday by The New York Post. Efforts to reach Mr. Loglisci for comment last night were unsuccessful.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','One of the voices chronicling the resurgence of high tech may soon be silenced.Business 2.0 magazine, a seven-year-old Time Inc. publication that covers start-ups, technology trends and changes in the new economy, might publish its final issue in September, according to people briefed on discussions about the fate of the magazine.Though a reprieve is still possible, according to these people, executives at Time Inc., the nation’s largest magazine group, are threatening to shut down Business 2.0 in the midst of a sharp drop in advertising at the San Francisco-based magazine.Advertising revenue at Business 2.0 was down 38 percent through July 9 of this year, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. The most recent issue on newsstands ran a scant 102 pages, although summer months are traditionally lean for magazines.At the same time, readers are still showing interest in the publication: in 2006 its paid circulation — 623,000, including newsstand sales — was roughly the same as 2005.So why the threat of the ax for the business and technology magazine during such heated times for the field?Aside from the overall downturn in the magazine business, current and former Time Inc. employees point to what appears to have been an ill-advised move this year to combine the advertising sales teams of Time Inc.’s finance and business publications, which include Fortune, Money, CNNMoney.com, Fortune Small Business and Business 2.0.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Rags to Riches, the filly who won the Belmont Stakes last month, will miss her scheduled start in the Coaching Club American Oaks on Saturday after her temperature spiked, her trainer, Todd Pletcher, said yesterday.She was scheduled for a workout yesterday at Belmont Park, but Pletcher scrapped it after detecting that Rags to Riches had an elevated temperature. Instead, she merely galloped.“Her temperature was 101 degrees, which is not high, but a little beyond the normal range,” Pletcher said. “We galloped her this morning. We are going to take the conservative approach. She hasn’t quite seemed herself the last couple of days. We won’t breeze her without her being 100 percent.”The Coaching Club, a $300,000 race run at Belmont, was to be Rags to Riches’ first start since June 9, when she became the first filly to win the Belmont Stakes in 102 years. She will now be pointed to a race restricted to fillies, the Alabama Stakes on Aug. 18 at Saratoga. In announcing his plans, Pletcher ruled out a start Aug. 25 in the Travers Stakes, a race where Rags to Riches could have met the Kentucky Derby winner Street Sense and the Preakness Stakes winner Curlin.“Our plan is now to point for the Alabama and the Breeders’ Cup,” Pletcher said. “There are too many big races out there. If we were going to miss one race, this is the one to miss. But I am disappointed that we didn’t get to run her back because a lot of people were looking forward to seeing her again at Belmont Park.”In her last workout, on July 8, Rags to Riches worked five furlongs in an uncharacteristically slow 1:04.01, perhaps a sign that she was not at her best.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Until last month, ACA’s assurances had satisfied investors, although the stock suffered briefly on May 10, when it reported first-quarter earnings. Under normal accounting rules, those results showed that profits were down sharply, and that book value had plunged because of declines in market value of some assets.But the stock quickly recovered to above $14 a share after the company pointed to its own adjusted measures of earnings, which showed rapid increases in both profits and book value.In June, the shares began to slide again after the company said that insiders, primarily private equity firms that owned the company before it went public last November, wanted to sell 3.9 million shares, more than a tenth of the shares outstanding.The proposed offering by insiders was quickly withdrawn after the stock came under pressure, but the selling intensified last week.Yesterday, the company refused to answer any questions and told the stock exchange that it would not comment on its plunging price. That served to intensify the selling pressure. Including the 3.1 million shares that traded yesterday, 4.7 million shares — about two-thirds of the 6.9 million shares in public hands — have traded in the last two sessions.The company’s largest shareholder, with a 27.6 percent stake, is a fund managed by Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, an affiliate of the Bear Stearns Companies, whose own shares fell $2.58 yesterday, to $140.31. Last month, Bear Stearns was forced to bail out a hedge fund it managed that had suffered losses in subprime mortgage securities.In a statement, John D. Howard, the chief executive of Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, said, “We have great confidence in ACA’s management team.”After ACA disclosed the extent of its subprime exposure last week, Craig Siegenthaler, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said the disclosure increased the risk profile for ACA, and reduced his price target on the stock to $12, from $17.ACA was forced to reduce both the price and the size of its offering before it went public last year at $13 a share. The share price fell below $13 for a couple of days after the offering, but stabilized and rose above $16 by February, before the subprime problems surfaced.ACA is exposed to the mortgage market in two ways. The company manages and partly owns C.D.O.’s. and also insures investors in other C.D.O.’s.In a report yesterday morning, Geoffrey Dunn, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, reduced his earnings forecast, saying that ACA’s price had fallen because it “has no real comparable peers in the publicly traded markets, is very complex and seems to operate in areas that are at the heart of the market’s current concerns.”But, Mr. Dunn said in an interview, “in our worst-case scenario, we think the stock has a double-digit valuation.” He said the price decline was not caused by “fundamentally legitimate concerns.”The difficulties in assessing ACA’s profitability was shown when it released its first-quarter financial statements in May.Under generally accepted accounting principles, ACA was required to take a loss for the fall in value of some derivative securities it owned, and to reduce its book value for the decline in other securities. A result was that profits were down 17 percent from a year earlier, although the company still reported profits of $11.4 million, or 31 cents a share. Its book value fell to $11.62 a share, from $13.96 at the end of 2006.But ACA told investors that those numbers were misleading, and its chief executive, Alan S. Roseman, said the results “underscore our ability to produce significant growth throughout changing market conditions.”Mr. Roseman said that ACA’s preferred measurements of income, called net economic income and base economic income, were each up 41 percent from a year earlier. That was largely because those measurements ignored losses in derivative securities owned by the company. Assuming, as the company does, that those derivatives return to original value, there will be no long-term losses, the company explained.In computing its adjusted book value, the company not only excludes those derivative losses but also adds in the value of future fees it will collect for managing C.D.O. portfolios. By that measure, adjusted book value rose to $24.91 a share, from $22.93.ACA’s competitors in insuring C.D.O. values generally have AAA ratings from the rating agencies. But ACA has only an A rating, indicating a financial position that is less solid, although still good. In affirming that rating in June, Standard & Poor’s said ACA had insured $10.3 billion in C.D.O.’s that invested heavily in subprime mortgage bonds. While that made up nearly a quarter of all bonds insured by the company, S.& P. said that the bonds ACA insured were themselves rated AAA.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','The work of the unit’s investigators — who are not part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the branch identified with raids, detention and deportation of illegal immigrants — is a new approach to detecting trends in fraud among the six million applications made nationally each year. But the investigators are so few, and so far down the bureaucratic chain, that the payoff from their efforts can be hard to see.On a recent visit behind the unmarked steel doors of the fraud unit’s office at 26 Federal Plaza, one wall was stacked high with suspect files — part of the flow of some 150,000 applications annually in New York alone. The unit supervisor, Joseph T. Knipper, cast a quizzical look from the stacked files to his investigators — all six of them.“We used to have a saying: ‘The fraud never sleeps,’ ” he said, exaggerating his gravelly voice and hangdog expression for comic effect. “And after a while we said, ‘We don’t either.’ ”Still, Mr. Knipper, 60, a Brooklyn-born Navy veteran, ex-cop and longtime refugee asylum officer, said he saw his work as a boon to legitimate applicants. “By going after fraud,” he said, “you’re helping the good people.”At any given time, the unit has more than 500 open cases, some involving multiple files flagged during processing, some chosen through random sampling.Since October, the unit has referred 187 cases to Immigration and Customs Enforcement for possible criminal investigation. Very few ever move on to prosecution by the United States attorney’s office, however. More typically, after a 60-day review, the cases bounce back to the fraud unit. Suspect applications can be denied and the holder of a fraudulent visa can face deportation.The operation is a work in progress, cautioned Andrea J. Quarantillo, director of the New York district office of Citizenship and Immigration Services, who keeps her Sicilian grandfather’s Ellis Island certificate on her office wall. Nationwide, the fraud detection division has a staff of only 375, scattered in more than 70 offices around the country.“The work they do is work we wanted to do for years,” she said, especially systematic sample audits that measure fraud in various visa categories, allowing administrators to spot patterns and close loopholes. “We’re not there yet.”So far, the mother lode of fraud has turned up in visa petitions for religious workers, made by organizations of every size and denomination. In reviewing a representative sampling, the agency found that one in three approved petitions were phony in New York and nationwide. In contrast, the rate of fraud found in petitions to replace a lost green card was less than 1 percent.This year, rules were changed to require visits by an agent in all petitions for religious workers. One result is a ballooning workload that outpaces the shoestring budget.While computer databases are often used in fraud detection, spot inspections are just as important. The territory of the six investigators in Mr. Knipper’s office ranges from the city’s roughest neighborhoods to upstate villages like Walden, where Ms. Gray recently paid an unannounced visit to a Buddhist temple. She was glad to find it bona fide after a chat over chai tea and cookies, she said.Ms. Gray, 31, who joined the fraud unit in October, is herself an immigrant. She still remembers her first whiff of cold New York air when she arrived from Jamaica at 6, she said. Her first job, in 1997, was as an airport immigration inspector. Now, having shed gun and uniform, she said, “I use all my good mornings, all my how-are-yous.”Sweet talk, not a search warrant, is the officers’ passport into polyglot neighborhoods where they must ask strangers for information about, say, the shuttered Hempstead restaurant that had sponsored an immigrant accountant full time, or the seedy Queens apartment house that had been listed in visa paperwork as the headquarters of a multinational corporation.In a city where 60 percent of residents are either foreign-born or the children of immigrants, just showing up as an immigration officer takes nerve, said one of the unit’s charter members, who asked that only his first name, Mel, be used, to spare his teenage daughter possible harassment. Several other team members declined to be interviewed.“It seems overwhelming sometimes, the size of the work that we’ve got to do,” said Mel, 57, who became an immigration officer in the 1980s and describes himself as Jewish, Brooklyn-educated and a devotee of Nathan’s hot dogs.But the satisfactions can be overwhelming, too, he added, citing the unit’s role in the prosecution of a Long Island woman who had defrauded a dozen unsophisticated immigrants desperate to become legal. The woman, Clementina McDermott, had boldly called a news conference to denounce her prosecution.“Brazen!” he said. “Not only was she not a citizen, she was an out-of-status alien who had a 30-year criminal record.” Investigating her case required retrieving her misplaced file from what immigration officers call “the cave” — a former limestone mine in Missouri that serves as storage. She was sentenced to three years in prison and is to be deported to Colombia. Sometimes finding fraud is all too easy, Mel added, saying, “You’re looking for a religious temple and you’re finding a candy store, a Laundromat or a hole in the ground.”“Hole in the ground” was not just a figure of speech. Mel led Mr. Knipper and a reporter back to the address of a Jewish organization that had petitioned for an immigrant to be trained as a mashgiach, or supervisor of kosher food production. Where the religious building should have been, a vast foundation was being dug for condos. “You pull up and see this. Hey, maybe this ain’t right. It ain’t here!” Mr. Knipper exclaimed, surveying the scene, in Borough Park, Brooklyn.Ukrainian construction workers stopped for a smoke beside the excavation; nearby, men in Hasidic dress passed women in hijabs. Asked about the likelihood that some of the workers might be illegal immigrants, Mr. Knipper shrugged. Not his job.“There’s a lot of illegals in New York,” he noted, describing day laborers outside the 7-Eleven store that he passes daily on his commute from Suffolk County. “I don’t drive by and say, ‘Maybe I should get a bigger car and load them up.’ ”Mr. Knipper said site checks even in cases that prove legitimate help fight fraud, too. “This is a neighborhood where people think, ‘Immigration, shmimmigration, nobody checks,’ ” he explained over sesame chicken in a local deli. “Then a guy comes around and knocks on the door. Word goes around. Rather than ‘Immigration never checks nothing,’ word is: ‘They’re checking.’ ”At Metro Ministries, based in Bushwick, reaction to a recent visit by Ms. Gray supported that view. Penny Hollenbeck, the executive director, said she was a bit intimidated, but impressed, when two officers showed up to verify the organization’s sponsorship of a German religious worker. “Firm but gentle,” she concluded. “A great representation of our government.”As for Ms. Gray, she finds special rewards in checking religious groups, where petitioners often take her hands and pray.“I don’t mind,” she said. “I let them pray for me no matter what religion. You can never have enough coverage driving around these streets.”'"
"'07-07-17,'1','The franchise restaurant chain IHOP said yesterday that it planned to buy Applebee’s International for $25.50 a share to expand beyond its pancake houses, sending IHOP shares up nearly 9 percent.The all-cash deal, which represents a 4.6 percent premium to Applebee’s closing price on Friday, is worth about $1.9 billion, excluding debt, based on the company’s 75,072,000 shares outstanding as of April 1.IHOP said it expected the transaction to add to earnings, excluding one-time charges, starting in 2008.With a market capitalization of $980.6 million, IHOP is using securitized debt backed mostly by Applebee’s assets to finance the purchase of Applebee’s, which has a market value of $1.82 billion.IHOP said it planned to sell, and then lease back, the real estate of Applebee’s 508 company-owned restaurants, at a rate of about 40 stores each quarter, to raise cash to help reduce the debt.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday as a report of a potential big telecom deal involving Verizon pushed the Dow Jones industrials to a record close and put the index closer to 14,000. Over all, stocks were mixed as investors digested the market’s huge gains of last week.While broader market indexes showed slight declines, the notion of a Verizon deal appeared to inject Wall Street with fresh optimism and helped stocks mostly hold last week’s sizable gains.Although Vodafone denied a report by The Financial Times that it was weighing whether to make a $160 billion bid for Verizon Communications, investors appeared undeterred. The report cautioned that Vodafone had yet to approach Verizon; a deal could give Vodafone full ownership of Verizon Wireless, which Vodafone and Verizon now own jointly.“I think just the idea of the number floated — $160 billion — gets the juices running in the market again even after this big move,” said Gregory A. Church, chief investment officer of Church Capital Management in Yardley, Pa., referring to last week’s gains. “It would be the biggest deal ever. People want to be at the party, and they don’t want to miss it.”Verizon rose $1, or 2.4 percent, to $42.76. Vodafone fell 37 cents to $33.15.The Dow rose 43.73 points, or 0.31 percent, to 13,950.98 — its 30th record close since the start of the year. The benchmark index again set an intraday record high, reaching 13,989.11. The previous high of 13,932.29 came in Friday’s session, which also had a record close.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','With no rider entering as a clear favorite, many teams have shown up at the Tour this year with two or more team leaders, to give themselves more options during the race. That has the effect, however, of diffusing the effort through the race, making it harder for one team to take control of the peloton.Armstrong himself is a factor as well. A seven-time winner of the Tour, he dictated a certain style of riding, one that required opponents to stay with him in the hope that they could capitalize on a rare moment of his weakness.Without a central figure demanding such attention, some riders seem at a loss for what they are supposed to do.“I think people are scared to assert themselves, because they’ve never won it and they don’t know how to go about it,” said David Zabriskie, a support rider for CSC, adding that the subject had been a topic of conversation among some riders.Levi Leipheimer, the team leader of Discovery Channel and the highest-ranked American rider, said that when Armstrong was riding, “the tactics were easy.”“The only thing I tried to do was to stay with Lance as long as possible,” he said. “Nowadays, you really have to pay attention and be careful. You need a strong team to neutralize any dangerous breakaways, and get to know the moment when it’s your turn.”Tactics are not the only aspects of the Tour that have commanded riders’ attention. Crashes have damaged the hopes of several teams and at least two Tour contenders. The hardest-hit team has been T-Mobile, which lost three riders Sunday. Mark Cavendish, the British sprinter whose fall in the first road stage ruined his chance of winning on British soil, never seemed to fully recover his finishing sprint. His withdrawal Sunday was mostly planned; the team did not want him to burn himself out in his fist Tour.Two other withdrawals were harder to take, however. Michael Rogers, the team leader, crashed on a descent while four minutes ahead of the peloton in a breakaway, and stopped racing before the end of the stage. Patrik Sinkewitz, a German rider, collided with a fan while descending the Tignes mountain after the stage to go to the team hotel.Sinkewitz sustained a broken cheekbone. The fan was airlifted to a hospital with a major head injury; he was reported to have emerged from a coma Monday.Stuart O’Grady, a CSC sprinter, also crashed heavily on the same descent as Rogers, the Cormet de Roselend. O’Grady sustained multiple rib fractures, a shoulder fracture and a punctured lung. It was O’Grady’s second fall of the Tour, the first coming during the prologue.Two other potential Tour winners have also had bad falls — Andreas Klöden and Alexander Vinokourov of Astana. Vinokourov required 15 stitches after the fifth stage: eight in his right knee, five in his left and two in an elbow.“I still have the hope to win the Tour,” Vinokourov said Sunday after the eighth stage, in which he and Klöden — who in the fifth stage fractured his tailbone in a separate fall — climbed together to Tignes, staying with the other favorites for most of the way.With cyclists seeming to be taking plenty of chances on the road, and with so many contenders within striking distance of the leader, Rasmussen, many riders have a chance to win.Rasmussen, widely regarded as the Tour’s top climber, acknowledged that his time-trialing deficiencies made him vulnerable.But Leipheimer also noted that the riders probably had not seen Rasmussen give his all during a time trial yet — and certainly not with the yellow jersey on his back.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Certain kinds of carbohydrates may play a role in the development of age-related macular degeneration, an incurable degenerative eye disease that is a leading cause of blindness in older adults. A new study has found that eating carbohydrate-rich food with a high glycemic index — a measure of a food’s potential to raise blood glucose levels — is associated with the development of the disorder.The glycemic index is a measure of how fast carbohydrates are metabolized — the faster they are broken down into glucose, the higher the glycemic index. Simple carbohydrates, like those in cakes and cookies, cheese pizza, white bread or other foods sweetened with sugar or corn syrup, are quickly metabolized by the cells, while the complex carbohydrates in brown rice, barley and many other vegetables are broken down more slowly.Heavy consumption of foods with a high glycemic index has been implicated in the development of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers, according to background information in the paper, which appears in the July issue of The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.The researchers examined 4,099 people ages 55 to 80 enrolled in a larger long-term study of eye health. Each participant had 20/32 vision in at least one eye, and the lens of the eye had to be clear enough to allow good photographs that could be used to diagnose macular degeneration.None of the participants had diabetes. Using these criteria, the scientists had 8,125 eyes to analyze. They graded the severity of macular degeneration on a scale of one to five, administered food frequency questionnaires and calculated the dietary glycemic index, a number indicating the quantity of high-glycemic foods consumed, for each participant.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','And our trip was challenging. The longest hill was 15 miles, the steepest had a 15 percent grade, the longest one-day ride was 90 miles, and the terrain was never, ever flat. It is hard to imagine that a group of middle-age adults could have handled an equivalently difficult 10 days of running. What, I wondered, made bicycling different?It turns out that others, too, have been struck by the paradox of bicycling fitness.“When I first got into cycling, I would see cyclists and say, ‘O.K., that’s not what I perceive a cyclist to be,’ ” said Michael Berry, an exercise physiologist at Wake Forest University. Dr. Berry had been a competitive runner, and he thought good cyclists would look like good runners — rail-thin and young.But, Dr. Berry added, “I quickly learned that when I was riding with someone with a 36-inch waist, I could be looking at the back of their waist when they rode away from me.”He came to realize, he said, that cycling is a lot more forgiving of body type and age than running. The best cyclists going up hills are those with the best weight-to-strength ratio, which generally means being thin and strong. But heavier cyclists go faster downhill. And being light does not help much on flat roads.James Hagberg, a kinesiology professor at the University of Maryland, explains that the difference between running on a flat road and cycling on a flat road has to do with the movement of the athlete’s center of gravity.“In running, when you see someone who is obviously overweight, they will be in trouble,” Dr. Hagberg said. “The more you weigh, the more the center of gravity moves and the more energy it costs. But in cycling, there are different aerodynamics — your center of gravity is not moving up and down.”The difference between cycling and running is like the difference between moving forward on a pogo stick and rolling along on wheels. And that is why Robert Fitts, an exercise physiologist at Marquette University who was a competitive runner, once said good runners run so smoothly they can almost balance an apple on their heads.Even Mr. Hampsten has been surprised by the cycling paradox. He recalls a woman from San Diego who went on one of his trips. “She was quite overweight,” he said, and even though she claimed to be an experienced cyclist, he worried that she would have trouble keeping up with the group. He was wrong.“She rode so well,” Mr. Hampsten said. “Her cadence was very efficient. I was just amazed and delighted.”As for the effects of aging, serious recreational cyclists do slow down, but they are not penalized as much as runners by the passing of years, Dr. Hagberg said. It’s because cycling, while grueling, is not as demanding as running.“The best example of that, in a bizarre way, is the Tour de France,” Dr. Hagberg said. “What runner could go out six hours a day for three weeks and not be totally trashed after a day or two? That’s a microcosm of the aging issue.”Still, even the best serious recreational cyclist is almost a different species from a professional rider. How much faster, our touring group asked Mr. Hampsten, would a professional rider go up that 15 percent grade during a race? About twice as fast as the fastest in our group, he replied.And how about recovery after racing? Mr. Hampsten used to compete in 100 races a year, including the Tour de France, and he would recover by going for a long, relaxed ride. It sometimes took him three hours of cycling to warm up after a hard race. Then he’d continue for another two hours.But recovery does become a limiting factor for professional cyclists, Mr. Hampsten said. It’s why most professional riders can no longer win long, multiday races after age 32.“It’s almost eerie that at 32 years, you stop winning,” Mr. Hampsten said. “The endurance seems to stay, but recuperation doesn’t come around.”When Mr. Hampsten retired, he was 34, “and I hadn’t won a race in two years.”Now, he estimates, he is 80 percent as fit as he used to be.But 80 percent for Andy Hampsten is still impressive. As soon as our cycling tour ended, he headed out on a fast ride that included a long hill to the town of Suvereto, taking a road with 187 switchback turns.“It is my favorite road to ride,” he said.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Well yes, they are. Very bad. But as Derek P. Manzello, a University of Miami researcher, and colleagues report, in one way at least they can be a force for good. They can benefit bleached coral reefs.Bleaching, the loss of symbiotic algae from the coral animals, occurs when a reef is stressed, most commonly by warmer-than-normal water. Because algae provide most of the corals’ food, bleaching can lead to the death of a reef, unless the water temperature returns to normal and algae can repopulate the coral.That’s where hurricanes come in. Their intense winds act as egg beaters in the ocean, bringing colder water up from the deep with the result that surface waters get cooler.Of course, a direct hit by a hurricane wouldn’t be good for a reef. But Mr. Manzello, a doctoral student at the university’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, wondered whether a reef that was close, but not too close, to a storm might be helped by this cooling effect.He and his colleagues used data from a long-term monitoring project at reefs off the Florida Keys. They found that all hurricanes and tropical storms that passed within about 450 miles of the reefs caused surface-water cooling, with the greatest effect — a drop in average temperatures of as much as 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit — from storms that passed within 250 miles.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Another half-hour passed. I checked the US Airways Web site, which, like all airline sites, has a box for entering the flight number and checking its status. It said the flight had departed.Another message arrived from La Guardia, where delayed flights were piling up all afternoon and would continue doing so well into the evening.“Flight attendant says she can’t talk to the pilot because he’s in ‘sterile flight,’ a phrase I haven’t heard before,” Mr. Khadavi tapped out.Sterile flight? The plane clearly was stuck on a ramp, along with dozens of other flights. I wasn’t sure how sterile it was, but it sure wasn’t in flight.At 5 p.m., another message from Mr. Khadavi, a lawyer in Manhattan: “They just canceled the flight.”A half-hour later I reached him on his cellphone. “I’m taking my family to Quebec next week,” he said. “We’re going to drive.”It’s not a happy summer in the skies, to put it mildly. It’s a summer of cancellations, missed connections and delays, including delays when passengers sit on parked planes for hours under deteriorating conditions.Still, passengers have been remarkably composed.Luckily for the parent of that crying baby on Flight 4385, nobody in charge was nervous, unlike the experience of a woman from suburban Atlanta who was recently taken off a Continental Express flight because her toddler kept saying “Bye-bye plane!” as the aircraft taxied to the runway in Houston.As initially reported by WSB-TV in Atlanta, the flight attendant told the mother, “You need to shut your baby up,” and suggested a dose of Benadryl, an allergy medicine that often causes drowsiness.The mother informed the flight attendant that she was not going to drug her child to prevent his saying “Bye-bye plane.” The flight attendant walked up to the cockpit to report that the mother had threatened her. The plane turned back. Mother and child were removed.The other passengers backed up the mother’s story. Continental Express said it was investigating.I first read about this on the Web site of Eileen Ogintz, who writes a nationally syndicated column about traveling with children (www.takingthekids.com).Ms. Ogintz, a former national correspondent for The Chicago Tribune, recently had an adventure herself. She was with a 21-year-old son, his girlfriend and a 13-year-old niece on a flight from Paris to Kennedy International Airport, where the plane sat for five hours before a gate was found and passengers could get off.Like her, I’ve noticed that passengers comport themselves remarkably well on stranded planes, even amid appalling conditions like backed-up toilets and a lack of food.“Because things are so bad right now with the delays and missed connections, I really feel it’s become an ‘us against them’ attitude.” Ms. Ogintz said. “I think people actually tend to be nicer to each other than they used to be.”Like many passengers on stranded planes, she saw how people looked out for one another. “Five hours was a long time to be sitting there, and I noticed people tried to help each other. If somebody had an extra snack, they would give it to somebody with a kid,” she said.Lots of business travelers take children along on business trips, especially in the summer. It’s gotten to the point, for example, where convention planners know that organizing sideline events for children is as important as organizing them for spouses.Ms. Ogintz said that business travelers on their own, and especially women, tend to be empathetic and helpful toward travelers with children.“It may be partly because many business travelers have been in the same position with their own kids on planes,” she said. “The line has really become blurred between business and leisure travelers.”So keep looking out for one another out there. And, kids, don’t drink the Benadryl.'"
"'07-07-17,'1','Whitey Ford, who really should be introduced as the incomparable Whitey Ford, wore a somewhat quizzical look yesterday as the books were spread across a table where he sat in a Midtown restaurant.On second thought, calling them books endows them with an ill-deserved loftiness. They were binders, 29 of them, filled with more than 2,400 pages of jottings by one of the most magnificent players ever to fill a baseball uniform, Joe DiMaggio of the New York Yankees. Steiner Sports, a Westchester company that trades in sports memorabilia, has bought these jottings and now plans to sell them.Call them diaries or journals, if you wish. But those words, too, might be lofty.Page after page, they are DiMaggio’s summaries of his daily activities from 1982 to 1993. Judging from the samples that Steiner Sports made available, there seems little likelihood of anyone’s stumbling upon Proustian insights. These notes lean heavily toward the humdrum: “Monday, December 12, 1983. Up at 7 a.m. Had breakfast in coffee shop at 8 a.m.” At the bottom of many pages, he itemized his expenses for the day — $87 that Dec. 12, most of it for taxis.DiMaggio began tracking his spending for tax purposes but came over time to use the summaries to “convey his feelings and emotions,” Steiner Sports said. Typically, he wrote on stationery cadged from hotels or airlines. He was notoriously — how to put it kindly? — frugal. The man tossed quarters around as if they were manhole covers.We’re willing to bet that on Dec. 12, 1983, millions of people woke up at 7 in the morning and had breakfast at 8. But millions of people were not Joe DiMaggio, who died in 1999 at 84. Steiner Sports is betting that enough potential buyers are out there to bring in at least $1.5 million at auction, and maybe $3 million or more.'"

"'07-07-18,'0','Like Beaujolais, which with its fruit and lively acidity was practically drawn up to go with the heavy, garlic- and fat-laden cuisine of Lyon, lambrusco pairs perfectly with the rich, flavorful food of Emilia. Few things are better on a warm evening than a glass of chilled lambrusco with a plate of Emilian cured meats like mortadella and cotechino, and a chunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano, unless, of course, you are sitting in a trattoria in Modena, the spiritual home not only of balsamic vinegar but of lambrusco as well.“Modena people, they like lambrusco more than anything else,” said William Mattiello, the chef and owner of Via Emilia, a restaurant in the Flatiron district of New York dedicated to the foods and wines of Emilia.Mr. Mattiello’s restaurant has become something of a destination to lambrusco lovers. He currently offers 11 different lambruscos on his wine list, including reds, rosés, even an unusual lambrusco refermented in the bottle like Champagne, which the restaurant sells for $42.In truth, compared with the other, more traditional lambruscos, this one, the Bellei lambrusco di sorbara brut, is almost too light and dry. Unlike most lambruscos, which are softly sparkling, or frizzante, this one is fully sparkling, or spumante. You cannot taste the earth in it. Indeed, Mr. Mattiello serves it in wine glasses rather than the juice glasses he uses for his other lambruscos.“That is high-end lambrusco,” Mr. Mattiello said. “I don’t know how high-end you can go with lambrusco.”At base, lambrusco is a humble, everyday wine, joyous rather than complex. Historically, it was made by farmers, and even today, a fair amount of lambrusco in Emilia is purchased directly from farms rather than from commercial sources.“All my friends in Modena, they go to the farmers, get three or four demijohns and put it in bottles themselves,” Mr. Mattiello said.Although more than 60 strains of the lambrusco grape can be used, the best wines generally come from three clones of the grape: sorbara, salamino (so-called because the elongated bunches of grapes resemble salamis) and grasparossa.Confusingly, three of the four official lambrusco zones share their names with the grape clones: Lambrusco di Sorbara, Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro and Lambrusco Salamino di Santa Croce. The fourth is Lambrusco Reggiano, which is the source of much of the sweet, familiar lambrusco.Typically, people will argue over which strains and which regions make the best lambruscos. While true lambrusco is becoming easier to find in good wine shops around New York, it probably still requires a trip to the homeland to get the true picture of the beverage Emilians hold dear.“In Emilia it’s all they drink,” said Jeremy Parzen, who spent time studying in Modena and is now the marketing director for Olcam Management, which runs the restaurants I Trulli and Centovini, and Vino, a shop specializing in Italian wines, all in New York. “I brought some friends in Emilia some Brunello di Montalcino thinking it would be a great gift, but they looked at me like I was nuts.”Vino now sells lambruscos from Lini, a small producer in Corregio, which produces four different kinds, including an unusual, wonderfully refreshing white lambrusco, which Mr. Parzen said is a nod to the wines obtained directly from farmers.“They don’t macerate the skins with the grapes because they want to avoid any kind of bacteria on the skins,” Mr. Parzen said.Lini also makes a ruby-colored rosé lambrusco, which counterintuitively is the firmest, most tannic lambrusco I’ve tasted, with delicious, lingering berry flavors. There’s also a foamy dry red and another Champagne-style lambrusco, which, like the Bellei at Via Emilia, feels a little highfalutin.While Italian Wine Merchants near Union Square sells a fine Lambrusco Grasparossa di Castelvetro from Tenuta Pederzana, and De-Vino on the Lower East Side sells both an excellent lambrusco from Vittorio Graziano and a fine lambrusco from Francesco Vezzelli, nobody in New York can match the selection at Via Emilia.Some of them are highly unusual. While some bitterness is welcome and expected in a lambrusco, a lambrusco Zemian from Serramazzoni was overwhelmingly bitter. It seemed to take far more than it gave.But other bottles, like the Graziano or a Salamino di Santa Croce from Saetti, go brilliantly with Via Emilia’s puffy gnocco fritto, light yet meaty lasagna or rich tortellini in cream sauce with pork and prosciutto. It made me want to taste lambrusco with other rich or spicy cuisines, which Mr. Mattiello allowed was beyond his experience.“Modena is not the kind of place where people say today we’ll have Indian food and tomorrow Chinese food,” he said. “It’s Italian food all the time.”So confident is Mr. Mattiello in the future of lambrusco that his wife, Tomoe Nakamura, has started an import company called, naturally, Lambrusco Imports, which brings in wines solely from Emilia-Romagna. Even so, it’s not always easy to count on getting a particular bottle because the best lambruscos are exported in minute quantities.For example, Ms. Nakamura could only get 25 cases of the Graziano lambrusco. “He said, ‘This is what I can give you,’ ” Mr. Mattiello recalled. “ ‘I don’t want to leave my neighbors without wine.’ ”Despite the bad name attached to the cloying lambruscos, sweetness does have a place. Last year the wine writer Matt Kramer sent me a bottle that he was particularly enthusiastic about, a dolce from Villa di Carlo. Like most lambruscos it was dark red bordering on purple and churning with froth. But though lightly sweet it had a welcome acidity that made it delightfully refreshing. In Modena, it no doubt goes well with cheese. In New York, it went great with cherries.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Warner Music Group has declined to bid against a British private investor for the EMI Group, a decision that would at least suspend further consolidation of the global music industry even as album sales plummet.EMI, the British music giant that had for years pursued discussions of a tie-up with Warner, agreed two months ago to a takeover offer of £2.4 billion ($4.9 billion) or 265 pence a share, from Terra Firma Capital Partners, a private equity investor. But as of last Thursday, the bid had received approval from shareholders representing just 3.8 percent of EMI’s shares, with many waiting to see if Warner would swoop in with a richer offer.Terra Firma has extended the deadline for acceptance to this Thursday. If the bid is approved, Terra Firma, led by the financier Guy Hands, would take control of EMI, the world’s third-biggest music corporation, whose catalogs include those of the Beatles and the Band, and those of current artists like Norah Jones.Warner, whose roster of artists includes the Red Hot Chili Peppers and James Blunt, had been seen as able to offer a heftier price because of the money it would save in an integration of the two companies. EMI had indicated that Warner would also have to bid enough for shareholders to take the risk that regulators would block the deal.Representatives for Warner had been seeking outside investors to agree upfront to buy EMI’s music publishing unit, which would almost certainly be sold as a condition of securing regulatory approval, according to executives briefed on the company’s plans who spoke on condition of anonymity. But they were unable to find investors who would commit to buying EMI’s publishing division at a big enough price, these executives said.Warner was also said to be wary of overpaying for EMI amid the industry’s continuing weakness. EMI itself issued two profit warnings earlier this year and overhauled its senior management.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Johnson & Johnson posted a 9 percent increase in second-quarter profit yesterday, as the acquisition of Pfizer’s consumer health products line offset a continuing decline in sales of its stents and a top drug.The company, which makes contraceptives, contact lenses, prescription drugs and baby products, reported net income of $3.08 billion, or $1.05 a share, up from $2.82 billion, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier.Sales totaled $15.13 billion, up from $13.36 billion a year earlier. Excluding the acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare in December, sales were up 3.6 percent, and favorable currency exchange rates increased revenue by 2.4 percent.“This is not an encouraging story,” said Steve Brozak, an analyst with WBB Securities, citing the latest sales declines for Johnson & Johnson’s anemia drug and for Cypher, its drug-coated stent.Stents, tiny mesh scaffolds that prop open heart arteries and slowly release a drug to keep them from reclogging, had become hugely popular in recent years, revolutionizing heart treatment.'"

"'07-07-18,'0','If white voters go Republican in these districts, so too, will white candidates and office-holders, ending a persistent anomaly in a state that easily went twice for President Bush but where hundreds of local officeholders remain Democrats. As elsewhere in the South, grass-roots leaders tend to be moderate Democrats with roots in the New Deal.The governor is a Republican, and Republicans narrowly control the Senate. But the House is heavily Democratic, and in races this year for local offices like sheriff, supervisor and circuit clerk, about 2,500 of 3,000 candidates were Democrats, said W. Martin Wiseman, director of the John C. Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University.The Democrats’ dominance at the local level may now be threatened by Judge Pepper’s ruling.“If they are required to re-register, the Democratic Party will be a shell of its former self because I just don’t think you’ll see those conservative whites re-register as Democratic,” said Jere Nash, who is white and a veteran consultant and onetime chief of staff to former Gov. Ray Mabus, a Democrat.R. Andrew Taggart, a white lawyer who succeeded Mr. Nash when Kirk Fordice, a Republican, was elected governor, agreed. The ruling was “very far-reaching,” Mr. Taggart said. “He has essentially ruled our entire primary structure must be changed.”“If forced to make a decision,” Mr. Taggart added, “a plurality of Mississippi voters will identify themselves as Republican.”Black Democrats who pushed the lawsuit that led to the ruling seemed to view the potential hemorrhaging of white voters with equanimity. One of their leaders is Ike Brown, a state Democratic executive committee member who was recently found by another federal judge to have systematically violated voting rights of whites, through intimidation and other means, as party boss in his home county, Noxubee, in the eastern part of the state.Welcoming Judge Pepper’s ruling, Mr. Brown said in an interview: “We are tired of being abused by the white Democrats in Mississippi. We have just had enough. We want the Republicans out of our party.”Democrats here have recently made other efforts to rid their party of Republican leanings, trying, for instance, to force the state’s conservative insurance commissioner, George Dale, off their primary ballot because he voted for Mr. Bush. A judge put Mr. Dale back on.But none of these efforts have much chance at being as successful as the lawsuit. Ellis Turnage, the lawyer who filed it, said he was not worried about whites’ quitting the party. “If they want to leave, let them leave,” Mr. Turnage said. “When they integrated the schools, look what happened. That’s not for me to deal with.”Yet if that happens, the racial polarization of politics here could be complete. Until now, an important bridge across the race divide in Mississippi has occurred, for instance, in the Legislature, where for three decades blacks and centrist white Democrats have formed coalitions to finance public education, or to push back against conservative Republican governors who sought cuts in social programs.“The beauty of what I’ve witnessed over the last 28 years is we’ve worked together,” said Thomas U. Reynolds, who is white and the state representative from the quiet courthouse town of Charleston in the north Mississippi hills.Mr. Brown, by contrast, said Mr. Reynolds’s district — and others like it — would be more properly represented by a black, another motive cited for pursuing closed primaries.A stooped country lawyer with a populist bent, Mr. Reynolds has traversed much of Mississippi’s four-decade emergence from segregation in the state Legislature, preoccupied with what he sees as Democratic causes like better education and health care. To get past the ruling, Mr. Reynolds said he was counting on the voters he greets by first name in the courthouse square to support him, regardless of party or race.“These folks, black and white, are my friends,” he said.Such support, however, cannot be taken for granted in a state where 85 percent of whites voted for Mr. Bush in 2004.Calling Judge Pepper’s ruling a “tragedy,” Mr. Reynolds said voters should be allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice, regardless of party. “Of all the things that could have happened, this doesn’t help us,” he said. “It would further racially polarize Mississippi, and that’s one thing we don’t want.”Judge Pepper ordered the Legislature to put a new system in place by Aug. 31, 2008. He also said photo identification for voters should be instituted, a requirement that is meeting resistance from some who welcome his other findings. Among those opponents is Mr. Turnage, the plaintiffs’ lawyer.Others — old-line white Democrats — are hoping against hope that the ruling will simply prove a fleeting nightmare if it is muddied by the Legislature or overturned on appeal — though none have been announced.“If this thing comes to pass, it’s the end of the Democratic Party in the state of Mississippi,” said Hob Bryan, a longtime centrist state senator from the northeastern part of the state.“I don’t want to exclude anyone from the Democratic Party,” Mr. Bryan said. “I want to include more people.”'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Investors tried to get out of the funds, but in May, Bear Stearns halted redemptions. Shortly after that, several banks and brokerage firms that had provided loans began demanding more cash as collateral. On June 26, Bear Stearns said it would offer a $1.6 billion loan to shore up the more conservative fund and unwind its positions.In yesterday’s letter to clients, Bear Stearns said that some $1.4 billion of the loan remains untapped.While risky mortgages are thought to have been central to the funds’ misfortunes, Bear’s letter said that “unprecedented declines in the valuations of a number of highly rated (AA and AAA) securities” contributed to June’s woeful performance.The more conservative of the two Bear Stearns funds was the older; established three years ago, it generated monthly gains of roughly 1 percent to 1.5 percent until March. Bear Stearns started the more leveraged fund last summer, just as the mania for mortgage securities was topping out. At their peak, the funds were valued at $16 billion, including the leverage that they used.The announcement that the funds are now almost worthless came as a surprise to many on Wall Street. “How did you go from reporting very high returns to suddenly now saying the collateral is worth nothing?” asked Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a research firm in Chicago.The Bear Stearns funds, like so many others, bought collateralized debt obligations, investment pools consisting of hundred of loans and other financial instruments. Wall Street divides the pools up in slices based on their credit quality and sells them to investors.Mark H. Adelson, head of structured finance research at Nomura Securities, said that the Bear Stearns funds steep decline had broad implications for investors in these bonds. “It’s going to provide an additional item that argues for lower valuations on these positions,” he said.Ms. Tavakoli said other hedge funds would face a tougher time justifying to both investors and regulators the value they have assigned to mortgage-backed securities they hold. “Depending on how aggressive the S.E.C. wants to be, this could get ugly,” she said.In after-market trading, Bear Stearns shares fell 3.6 percent, to $134.90. The stock is down about 14 percent for the year.Even before Bear Stearns made its disturbing disclosures, the ABX index, which tracks the price of insuring losses in subprime bonds, hit fresh lows. The part of the index that tracks A-rated segments of mortgage securities issued in late 2006 and early 2007 fell to 68.5 cents on the dollar, down from 72.36 cents Friday.“There are a bunch of unanswered questions here,” said Joshua Rosner, a managing director at Graham & Fisher, an investment firm. “For me, one of the big unanswered questions is, do the prime brokers and others who have extended lines of credit to the hedge funds really have a good handle” on how those borrowings have been invested.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Michael Vick has been indicted on federal felony charges alleging that he has sponsored dogfighting since 2001, has frequently gambled on dogfighting, and has authorized acts of cruelty against animals on property that he owned.Vick, the Atlanta Falcons’ starting quarterback, and three other men were indicted in United States District Court in Richmond, Va.The indictment of Vick, one of the National Football League’s star players, is troubling not only for the Falcons, but for a league that has taken a harder stance against players involved in off-field transgressions under policies laid out by the new commissioner, Roger Goodell.Vick has said that he had no idea the property might have been used in criminal activities, but in recent weeks he has declined to talk about the investigation.If convicted, the four men could face six years in prison and $350,000 in fines. Vick may escape punishment from the league if he is cleared of the charges, but the league will punish him if he is convicted. A statement yesterday reaffirmed that the N.F.L. intends to watch the situation closely.“We are disappointed that Michael Vick has put himself in a position where a federal grand jury has returned an indictment against him,” Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman, said in the statement. “We will continue to closely monitor developments in this case and to cooperate with law-enforcement authorities. The activities alleged are cruel, degrading and illegal. Michael Vick’s guilt has not yet been proven, and we believe that all concerned should allow the legal process to determine the facts. The matter will be reviewed under the league’s personal conduct policy.”'"

By protecting the inmates, the states would also protect the all-too-vulnerable wives and lovers to whom they inevitably return when their sentences are completed.The California State Legislature tried to take the C.D.C.’s advice last year, passing a landmark bill that would have allowed public health agencies to enter prisons and distribute condoms to inmates who wanted them. The bill had the overwhelming support of the voting public. But Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed it, using the familiar know-nothing excuse that handing out condoms would justify illegal sexual activity. The experience of jurisdictions that allow condoms does not support this view.At the same time, public health officials now recognize that condom-distribution programs are integral to any meaningful AIDS prevention program. These programs are already running in prisons in Canada and in much of the European Union and in jails in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington.The California Legislature has taken up the condom bill again, this time spearheaded by Assemblyman Sandré Swanson, Democrat of Oakland. The bill deserves to pass the Legislature, just as it did last year. But this time, Governor Schwarzenegger should sign the bill. It would give California’s public health community a powerful tool to fight the spread of a deadly disease.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Intel’s gross margin for the second quarter was 46.9 percent; the forecast was for about 48 percent. Mr. Otellini said the margins were also dragged down by lower-than-expected demand for flash memory chips known as NOR, the kind of flash memory that Intel plans to spin off into a new joint venture in the second half of the year.Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported that revenue rose 8 percent, to $8.7 billion, during the second quarter, from $8 billion in the period last year. Earnings were up 44 percent, to 22 cents a share, from 15 cents a share a year earlier, helped by a one-time tax item that increased earnings by 3 cents a share. Net income was $1.3 billion, up from $885 million.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast earnings of 19 cents a share on $8.54 billion in revenue.Mr. Otellini predicted improvements in Intel’s performance in the next two quarters, pointing to new manufacturing efficiencies as contributing factors. “One of the reasons we’re optimistic about the third quarter is the expansion we expect in notebooks and servers,” he said.The company predicted its gross margin would improve during the third quarter, to 52 percent, and maintained its margin forecast for 2007 at 51 percent. Intel forecast revenue of $9 billion to $9.6 billion; in line with analysts’ expectations.Wall Street analysts did not appear to share investors’ disappointment with Intel’s performance, or their concerns that a long-running price war with Advanced Micro Devices would continue to hurt Intel’s profits.“The results are pretty much as expected,” said Cody Acree, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. “Pricing continues to be a struggle, but it does look like PC shipments are strong.”After several quarters of losing market share to its smaller rival A.M.D., Intel appears to be gaining back much of the share it lost.Last year, the company began a revamping of its chip product lineup as well as a corporate restructuring that has sharply reduced its labor force and cut expenses.A.M.D., however, continues to struggle with the aftereffects of the price war. In its quarterly earnings report on Thursday, analysts expect A.M.D. to announce a loss of 85 cents a share on revenue of $1.26 billion for the quarter, according to Thomson Financial.That follows a dismal first quarter in which A.M.D.’s earnings were hurt by slower sales and price cuts. The company is pinning its hopes for a turnaround on a series of new products that will start appearing in the third quarter.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','WASHINGTON, July 17 — In a rousing indictment of the Bush administration and the Supreme Court it created, Senator Barack Obama told a Planned Parenthood convention here on Tuesday that the next election would decide a fundamental question: “What kind of America will our daughters grow up in?”The speech by Mr. Obama, of Illinois, came on a day when the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination expressed their commitment to reversing the Bush administration’s approach to abortion rights, judicial appointments, sex education and contraception.Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton declared that President Bush had consistently “played politics with women’s health.” She added, “He has chipped away at reproductive rights, and he has worked to turn Washington, D.C., into an evidence-free zone where facts are subordinate to ideology.”Mrs. Clinton, of New York, argued that the Bush administration and its conservative allies had undermined and underfinanced longstanding education and family planning programs while heavily favoring abstinence education. She added, to cheers, “I want you to know that when I’m president, I will devote my very first days in office to reversing these ideological, antiscience, antiprevention policies that this administration has put into place.”Mr. Obama, who was repeatedly interrupted by applause, said the recent Supreme Court decision upholding a federal ban on a type of abortion was the beginning of a profound retreat on women’s rights, and should be presented that way to the voters.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Shaking up the highest ranks of the video game industry, Electronic Arts, the world’s largest publisher of video games, said yesterday that it had hired Peter Moore, head of interactive entertainment at Microsoft, to run its large but sluggish sports division.Microsoft said that Don Mattrick, a longtime game executive who had served as an adviser to the company since February, would take over game operations at Microsoft. Mr. Mattrick had been considered a leading candidate to become chief executive of Electronic Arts before leaving the company last year.Under Mr. Moore, the Xbox 360 game console became a strong contender in a competitive market, in part because of the popularity of the games made for it. While the console has been plagued by widespread failures, Microsoft has not held Mr. Moore responsible for the engineering problem. The company has said it will spend up to $1.15 billion to repair defective consoles.At Electronic Arts, which is the largest video game publisher in the world by sales but has had little revenue growth over the last three years, Mr. Moore’s main task is to reinvigorate a sports division that has enjoyed the success of its popular Madden NFL series, but which has also grown complacent.E A’s sports games cater almost exclusively to the same young male demographic group that the game industry has focused on for decades. More recently, however, the growth in the video game business — underlined by the success of casual systems like the Wii from Nintendo — has come from appealing to women, children and older people who had not considered themselves game players. Mr. Moore’s challenge will be to reorient Electronic Arts’ sports unit to capture more casual players without alienating the company’s base of hard-core game players.“Peter’s somebody I’ve been trying to recruit for the better part of a decade,” John Riccitiello, the chief executive of Electronic Arts, said in a telephone interview. “He’s one of the true talents in the industry. He knows sports better than almost anyone I’ve ever met. He was the toughest competitor we ever had on the sports side when he was at Sega.”Before joining Microsoft, Mr. Moore was a senior executive at the Sega Corporation, a game maker based in Japan.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Merrill Lynch, the nation’s largest retail brokerage firm, said yesterday that second-quarter profit increased 30.2 percent from the period a year earlier on stronger investment banking results and fees from stock transactions.Profit after paying preferred dividends rose to $2.07 billion, or $2.24 a share, from $1.59 billion, or $1.63 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 19 percent, to $9.73 billion, from $8.17 billion.Robust performance from investment banking fees and sharp overseas growth pushed results above Wall Street projections that earnings would be $2.02 a share on revenue of $9.25 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial.Investment banks have been grappling with the mortgage market fallout that led to the near collapse of two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns. Despite this, it appears that the chief executive, E. Stanley O’Neal, will produce the company’s fourth consecutive year of record earnings.Revenue from investment banking rose 41 percent, to $1.4 billion. Merrill Lynch advised on deals like the buyout of the British pharmacy chain Alliance Boots by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','The changes, according to Mr. Palmisano, amount to “a huge reinvention” of the company.Its experience offers a textbook case of a company successfully navigating the twin challenges of globalization and rapid technological change, at least for a two-year stretch.So far, it seems to be working. Profit margins at I.B.M. have risen steadily and it reported record earnings and cash flow in 2006. Wall Street expects the trend to continue when I.B.M. reports its quarterly figures today. The consensus estimate of analysts has earnings increasing 13 percent from the year-earlier quarter, to about $2.15 billion, or $1.47 a share, on a 5 percent rise in revenue, to nearly $23.1 billion.Despite the recent improvement, I.B.M. still faces daunting long-term challenges — particularly in its services business, which contributed 52 percent of the company’s revenue and 37 percent of pretax income last year.The Indian insurgents in the technology services business continue to enjoy a sizable cost advantage. The leading Indian outsourcing companies, like Infosys, Tata Consulting Services and Wipro, have average operating profit margins of more than 20 percent, according to a recent analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. The margins at I.B.M., according to Bernstein, are less than half that — though a bit higher than the average for the next six largest American technology services companies including E.D.S., Accenture, BearingPoint and Computer Sciences.The leading Indian companies are gaining ground at an impressive pace. Last week, for example, Infosys reported that its quarterly revenue rose more than 40 percent. I.B.M., the world’s largest technology services company, dwarfs any of the Indian outsourcers and offers a much wider range of services. But the Indian companies see themselves as the wave of the future in services, and they say their Western rivals, who are hiring by the thousands in India, are struggling to cope with the situation.“We are leading, and the old-line players like I.B.M. are forced to copy our model,” said Nandan M. Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys.In his view, the American companies are much like the Detroit automakers years ago and the leading Indian services suppliers are similar to the Japanese car producers. The Japanese upstarts, Mr. Nilekani noted, began by supplying lower-cost models, but retained a continuing cost and quality advantage as they moved into the mainstream and luxury car markets.I.B.M. bristles at the Detroit analogy, and it does seem to be adapting quickly to the global competition instead of being blindsided by it. In fact, the poor performance in early 2005 was an alarm bell — not so much a call to alter the company’s strategy but to accelerate one that was already being put in place.The financial performance of the services business has been improved partly with old-fashioned cost-cutting. After the bad quarter in 2005, I.B.M. eliminated nearly 15,000 jobs, with the biggest cuts from the services business in Europe. In the second quarter of this year, 3,500 I.B.M. workers were told their jobs were being eliminated, with sharp cuts in the services business in America. A third of the displaced employees typically find jobs elsewhere in the company.After he became chief executive in 2003, Mr. Palmisano began a campaign to change the profile of I.B.M. toward businesses requiring specialized skills and advanced technology, thus commanding higher profit margins. I.B.M. has sold hardware businesses with lackluster profits including disk drives, personal computers and printers.After the stumble in 2005, Mr. Palmisano decided to push the shift in services faster — to try to get more of the new global model in place. If services revenue was going to flatten for a while, I.B.M. needed to find a way to increase profits elsewhere. The answer was to step up the buying spree in the high-margin software business.“Software had to play a bigger role,” Mr. Palmisano explained. “Then we could offset the transition in services.”In software, I.B.M. started to build up that high-margin business mainly with acquisitions of small companies in fields like security, data management and Web commerce. Since 2003, I.B.M. has spent $11.8 billion on 54 acquisitions: 36 software and 18 services companies.The transition into services has been the most ambitious and difficult, involving a wholesale reorganization and a change in the culture of a business that now has 200,000 employees worldwide.The traditional multinational company, Mr. Palmisano explained during an interview at I.B.M’s headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., was a collection of local fiefs, while networked teams will be the hallmark of the global corporation of the future.I.B.M. has set up global centers for tasks like software development and maintenance, which is a reason I.B.M. employs 53,000 workers in India today. It has also created global and regional teams of skilled experts in particular industries, from airlines to utilities, who travel as needed on projects.The only way for I.B.M.’s services business to grow without continually adding more people is to automate more data center maintenance and other computing chores with software. “The goal is to replace a lot of labor but do it with software, not replace labor with lower-cost labor,” said Virginia M. Rometty, senior vice president for global business services.Profits have also been helped by moving into high-end services projects that tap I.B.M. expertise in research to apply computer science and advanced mathematics to fields like utility grid optimization and energy conservation, genetics-based personalized medicine, fraud detection and prediction, and traffic management using sensors and congestion-pricing models.A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, says the unanswered question about I.B.M. is, Can the new, higher-margin business grow fast enough to offset the maturing of its traditional services business and rising competition from the Indian outsourcers?For his part, Mr. Palmisano is not declaring victory, but things certainly look better than they did two years ago. “The encouraging thing is that we’ve made progress,” he said. “We’re making progress, but there’s still a lot to be done.”'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Played on windswept courses that are linked to the sea, the British Open is usually an exercise in hitting low, running shots, while the rest of the PGA Tour calendar calls for high shots that land softly.Golfers cram for this once-a-year challenge in different ways. Hunter Mahan, playing in his third British Open and his first at Carnoustie, has checked the Internet several times to gauge a volatile forecast.The official event forecast calls for temperatures from 52 to 70, spells of sunshine and the chance of rain, and it says that the weather predictions are made with “medium to high confidence.”“There is no way you’re going to figure it out before you get here,” Mahan said. “You have to get a feel for the course, feel how it’s playing. The wind is so important here. Yesterday, we played in a totally different type of wind, so it’s nice to actually have two different types of wind that we’ve already seen. The more you play, the more you’re used to it, the more comfortable you are going to be.”Woods, who is trying to become the first golfer since Peter Thomson from 1954-56 to win three claret jugs in a row, did not always look comfortable in his early years at the British Open. He did not win one in his first five attempts before breaking through with an eight-stroke victory at St. Andrews in 2000.To better adjust to the skills required at a British Open, Woods and O’Meara began flying to Ireland a week before the tournament to play links golf, go fly-fishing and allow their bodies to adjust to the time difference.“Coming over to Ireland and playing links courses was a plus,” O’Meara said. “You’ve already gotten over the jet lag. You’ve already been acclimated to the climate, and you’ve played some similar course setups. I thought it was advantageous to do that.”Woods, whose wife, Elin, gave birth to a daughter last month, practiced this year at home in Windermere, Fla., instead of traveling to Ireland. Still, he remained on top of the weather developments at Carnoustie, including the heavy rainfall in recent weeks.Asked two weeks ago at the AT&T National if he could employ the same strategy of hitting irons off the tee at Carnoustie as he did last year at Royal Liverpool, Woods said Carnoustie may be too soft and long to do so.“I know it’s been raining over there, so it will be green, and the rough will be lush and thick,” he said. “Hoylake was not that way at all. It was burnt out and dry.”During his week of practice at home, Woods said his primary focus was sharpening his mechanics so that he could maneuver his ball in either direction and at various heights.O’Meara guessed that Woods’s lack of a reconnaissance trip to Ireland would not hurt him.“Even though it wouldn’t have been windy necessarily in Florida last week, he’s played enough links golf and has had enough success playing links golf that he thrives on it,” O’Meara said. “He’s practicing shots in his mind that he has to use here, he’s practicing technique.”While Woods remained in the United States two weeks ago, Phil Mickelson, after missing the cut at the AT&T National, flew early to Scotland and practiced for three days at Carnoustie before competing in the Scottish Open. He said the repetitions were vital and valuable.“I was able to come up with a game plan I feel comfortable with,” said Mickelson, who is seeking his first claret jug. “The difference here is the game plan changes with the wind. Each hole goes from a birdie hole to just trying to make par based on the wind. You have to come up with three or four different ways to play it based on the three or four different winds that we see.”Zach Johnson, the Masters champion, is among a number of players still learning about conquering a British Open course. He has yet to make a cut in three attempts and has issues beyond how high or low to hit the ball.“Everybody says, ‘The British Open, bring your long sleeves and your rain gear,’ ” Johnson said. “Last year, we had 90-degree days Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. The only preparation you can have is, prepare for everything.”'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Mr. Bush’s speech was also a challenge to moderate Arab states like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt to act forcefully to support Palestinian moderates, by deeds as well as by attendance at this fall’s American-sponsored conference on the Middle East. But it is doubtful that the Saudis share Mr. Bush’s analysis, since they have been urging Hamas and Fatah to get back together again under the agreement they negotiated in their holy city of Mecca.Those same Arab moderates are bound to be concerned that an isolated Hamas will be thrown even more into the orbit of Shiite Iran and Syria, a point made on Tuesday by Foreign Minister Massimo D’Alema of Italy, who said, “Not recognizing the government elected democratically is not exactly a lesson in democracy, and pushing such a group into the hands of Al Qaeda is not in the international community’s interest.”Daoud Kuttab, a Palestinian journalist and professor, said, “I was hoping Bush would differentiate between the political and military wings of Hamas as a way out of this dilemma.” The real choice for Palestinians, he said, is how best to achieve a state and a stable life, and “most Palestinians now understand that this won’t be solved militarily, that one more suicide bombing won’t make Israel crumble.”Faced with Hamas, Israel and Washington are throwing support behind the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, who personally embraces nonviolence, and the prime minister, Salam Fayyad, an independent economist. Mr. Fayyad has no troops and no electoral mandate, but with Mr. Abbas’s support he promises to create a Palestinian administration in the West Bank that can deliver what Hamas won the election promising: change and reform, security and order.But if Mr. Fayyad succeeds, it will be without democratic legitimacy. And a putative Palestine divided between the West Bank and Gaza only perpetuates a deep Palestinian political division, leaving out Hamas and the sizable minority who support it. That will undermine the credibility of whatever deal Mr. Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, and Mr. Fayyad might be able to reach with a skeptical Israel, where the rightist Likud Party leads the polls.Yuval Steinitz, a Likud legislator, says Mr. Bush’s “new approach to Abu Mazen and the Palestinian Authority will not contribute to peace and stability.” Mr. Abbas cannot deliver, Mr. Steinitz said.Hamas itself, understanding that many Palestinians were shocked by the ferocity in Gaza, has made some gestures toward reconciliation with Fatah.On Monday, for example, the exiled Hamas political director, Khaled Meshal, called for dialogue with Mr. Abbas and apologized to Palestinians for mistakes made during the violent takeover.“What happened, I swear to God and God is a witness, was loathsome for us,” Mr. Meshal said. “It is like a medicine pill that we were forced to swallow.” He said that “marginal mistakes” were made “by individuals who do not represent our policies.” He added, “We apologize to God before apologizing to the people for them.”For the moment, said Miri Eisin, a spokeswoman for the Israeli government, Israel and the United States agree about the need to support Fatah in the West Bank and isolate Hamas in Gaza.Israel is prepared to take “considered risks” to help Mr. Abbas, Ms. Eisin said, by releasing prisoners, giving amnesty to wanted fighters, lifting roadblocks and removing illegal Israeli outposts on Palestinian land. Still, Israel and Ms. Eisin are less clear about how to isolate Hamas without punishing Gazans.“While Israel is trying to pressure Hamas, you have a lot of angry people getting angrier,” Mr. Kuttab said. “I don’t believe punishing people produces results. Hamas has maybe blinked a little, but it hasn’t raised the white flag.”Ms. Eisin said: “Hamas is there in Gaza, but that doesn’t mean we have to help them or can’t oppose them. We see Hamas as a terrorist organization, and right now the Palestinian president agrees. Great. It’s Tuesday. Let’s see what happens Friday.”Mr. Bush may have the same concerns. When he announced the international conference for this autumn, without a date, location or list of attendees, he made it clear that it would be his secretary of state, not he, who would lead it.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Days after losing a bid for one American chemical company, Access Industries agreed yesterday to buy another, Lyondell Chemical, for $12.1 billion in cash, providing a long-sought victory for the financier Leonard Blavatnik.Basell, a Dutch company owned by Access, will pay $48 a share for Lyondell, based in Houston, a 20 percent premium to Lyondell’s closing price on Monday. Including debt, the offer is worth about $19 billion.The deal would combine Basell, the world’s largest maker of polypropylene, which is used in bottle caps, grocery bags and packaging, with Lyondell, which makes chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Combined, the two had revenue of $34 billion and 15 employees worldwide last year.The deal is expected to close within the next several months and is subject to shareholder approval.For Access, the conglomerate owned by Mr. Blavatnik, the third attempt to broaden its chemical portfolio was the charm. Last week, the Huntsman Corporation terminated its $9.6 billion deal with Basell in favor of an offer from Hexion Specialty Chemical, a company owned by Apollo Management.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','On receiving an award from the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases for his work, Dr. Comstock said he suspected he was the first person to be so honored for persuading people not to use a vaccine.Dr. Comstock attributed the discrepancies among the trials to variations in different strains of the BCG vaccine and a lack of standard manufacturing techniques. Later, genetics studies documented that there was no uniformity among BCG vaccines, said Dr. Richard E. Chaisson, a tuberculosis researcher at Johns Hopkins.In 1957, the United States Public Health Service sought a doctor to study tuberculosis patterns in Alaska, where one of every 30 natives was in a tuberculosis hospital. Dr. Comstock volunteered, saying he saw an opportunity to study preventive treatment.He conducted a controlled trial in 29 villages near Bethel, Alaska, where tuberculosis was rampant. Members of each household were given the drug INH or a placebo for a year, Dr. Chaisson said.The study showed the effectiveness of INH in preventing tuberculosis: after a year, INH produced a 70 percent decline in cases of the disease; a follow-up study five years later showed the drug’s benefit had been sustained.In the trial, Dr. Comstock and his family took INH themselves to convince the participants of his belief in the therapy’s safety, Dr. Chaisson said. After the trial, Dr. Comstock returned and gave INH to those who had received the placebo.The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest guidelines on INH therapy use Dr. Comstock’s data to this day.George Wills Comstock was born in Niagara Falls, N.Y., on Jan. 7, 1915, the son of George Frederick Comstock, a metallurgical engineer, and Ella Gardner Wills Comstock. He entered Antioch College planning to become a metallurgist.While working eventually on the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra, for the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, he developed an interest in nutritional diseases. He went on to earn a medical degree from Harvard Medical School in 1941 and a master’s degree and a doctorate in public health from the University of Michigan and Johns Hopkins, respectively.In medical school, Dr. Comstock, a thin, considerate man who stood about 6 feet 6 inches, rejected his parents’ wish that he study piano and instead bought a recorder, using money he had made by selling his blood for transfusions, a customary means of income for medical students in those days. Later, he took up the bassoon and played in symphony orchestras.He interned with the Public Health Service and later became chief of its tuberculosis epidemiologic studies. After he retired from the agency in 1962, he moved to Johns Hopkins. He was editor of the American Journal of Epidemiology from 1979 to 1988.Dr. Comstock founded the Johns Hopkins Training Center for Public Health Research and Prevention in Hagerstown, Md., where for 30 years he oversaw community-based research studies on cancer, heart disease and an eye disease known as histoplasmosis. The center was renamed for Dr. Comstock in 2005.He was a lifelong advocate of public health efforts and expressed disappointment in later years that more doctors were not devoting their services to it. In an interview in 2003, Dr. Comstock said that members of medical school faculties had little contact with public health departments.Dr. Comstock was preceded in death by his first wife, of 60 years, Margaret Karr Comstock, and his sister, Ruth Comstock Dunlap. He is survived by his wife, the former Emma Lou Davis; two sons, Dr. Gordon Frederick Comstock of Arcade, N.Y., and Dr. Lloyd Karr Comstock of Chapel Hill, N.C.; a daughter, Martha Wills Comstock Williams of Marietta, Ga.; five grandchildren; one great-granddaughter; two stepchildren, Jonathan Davis and Anna Davis; and two step-grandchildren.'"
"'07-07-18,'0','Excellent fine dining establishments are not new to the Midwest — or, for that matter, the rest of America. In recent years, however, smaller cities such as Kansas City, Minneapolis, Milwaukee and St. Louis have sustained not just good individual restaurants but packs of them, along with wine shops and stores selling the latest variety of sea salt.This year the James Beard Foundation acknowledged the nation’s bounty of noteworthy restaurants by giving awards for best chef in 10 regions of the United States, instead of the 8 it had recognized for many years. (The Midwest was split into two new regions, as was the Southeast.)“The Midwest had like 16 states and was absurdly large,” said Rick Nelson, a member of the foundation’s restaurant and chef awards subcommittee, and the restaurant critic at The Minneapolis Star-Tribune. “There was a feeling we weren’t recognizing the depth of restaurants in St. Louis, Cleveland, Indianapolis and across the region.”Mr. Garrelts was nominated for best chef in the Midwest this year. The award was won by another Kansas City chef, Celina Tio of the American Restaurant.“There has always been great food outside New York and California but now it’s getting recognized,” said Ruth Reichl, editor of Gourmet. “Food has become part of our popular culture, and you have a whole generation that was raised to think food is interesting and exciting. We’ve become more confident eaters. We’ve become more interesting eaters.”Television, especially the Food Network, has made stars of chefs, as well as how-to instructors, which has created a more knowledgeable consumer. Food is no longer a pursuit of snobs but rather a pursuit of cool kids, which means everyone.“The way people travel now, they see interesting food in other cities and expect it at home,” Mr. Nelson said.As a result of this and other changes in the way people eat, some of the nation’s most celebrated chef’s have recognized opportunity in the lands formerly known as flyover country. Lidia Bastianich has Lidia’s here in Kansas City, and Wolfgang Puck and Jean-Georges Vongerichten have opened restaurants in Minneapolis.“You know you’re being taken seriously on the national level when those guys come to town,” Tim McKee, 40, chef-owner of La Belle Vie in Minneapolis. “They can open up anywhere. They do the research. They’re choosing Minneapolis, which means it’s a viable market.”Dean & DeLuca, based in New York, reached a similar conclusion about Kansas City a decade ago when it opened a store in Leawood, Kan., which is on the Missouri border and is part of Kansas City’s metropolitan area. It sits in Johnson County — one of the 75 most affluent counties in the nation according to 2005 Census Bureau estimates based on per capita income — and is the headquarters of several corporations, most notably Sprint Nextel.The bulk of Dean & DeLuca’s sales here is in prepared food like lasagna Bolognese. In fact, the store sells more prepared food than the company’s five other retail stores, said the general manager, Josh Hodapp.“It’s a sophisticated market that understands that there is not just white sugar or brown sugar but all kinds of sugar,” Mr. Hodapp said. “They want to experience new things.”Whether it is steak or barbecue or fried chicken, people here have always been passionate about their food, Mr. Garrelts said, adding: “Now tastes are evolving and becoming more refined.” His menu ranges from caviar with truffled egg and crème fraîche foam to hen accented with chard, grits and scallions.Across the street from Dean & DeLuca at 40 Sardines, Debbie Gold, 43, has transplanted her classical training to a suburban strip mall to create one of the area’s most popular restaurants. She is a Chicago native who studied in France before working in some of her hometown’s top restaurants, including Everest and Charlie Trotter’s.She came here in 1994 with Michael Smith, then her husband, to rejuvenate the American Restaurant, for more than 30 years a local institution and nationally regarded restaurant founded by Donald Hall Sr., the chairman of Hallmark.While at the American, the couple saw the market research concluding that much of the restaurant’s clientele were the highly educated and upwardly mobile residents of Johnson County. So in 2002, Ms. Gold and Mr. Smith opened 40 Sardines in what amounted to their customers’ backyard. They also created a comfortable ambience for the dining room, setting 40 Sardines apart from the dress-up, special-occasion feel of the American.Between the casual setting and a menu accenting hearty Midwest food (short ribs with shiitake mushrooms and snow peas on wasabi noodles), Ms. Gold aims to attract the widest demographic possible: families from the neighborhood, out-of-town executives doing business at Sprint Nextel and couples celebrating anniversaries.“When I decided to go to the American I thought I would be here for only a few years,” said Ms. Gold, who is divorced from Mr. Smith and owns 40 Sardines solely. “But I’m as busy here as I’ve ever been, but the stress level is not the same. I like the quality of life here. And the bar for what is expected of a restaurant has been raised, so it is very fulfilling.”The restaurant business is challenging, and a knowledgeable and enthusiastic customer base combined with a talented chef is hardly a foolproof recipe for success.In 1989, when Sanford D’Amato turned a family grocery store in his native Milwaukee into a modern dining room with a small business loan and his own and his wife’s life savings, he did not know what to expect. Nearly 20 years later, with reams of accolades, he still does not know. In the past six months, he said, he has watched as three upscale restaurants have closed.“There is better food and a more passionate community,” Mr. D’Amato said. “But this is a tough business. When you do not have the density in population of New York or Chicago — where 40 percent or more of your business can be local — and you do not have steady tourist or convention trade, it’s really tough.”The new parents, Colby and Megan Garrelts, are careful not to celebrate too heartily what has been a honeymoon as restaurateurs. They have expanded into adjacent space and added a lounge and a menu for its 45 seats. It has helped increase revenues from $800,000 in 2003 to $1.2 million last year.Mr. Garrelts knows they will never do a fraction of the business restaurants similar to theirs do in New York or Chicago or any big city. Yet, he sees the potential for market growth.

"'07-07-18,'0','BRIANÇON, France, July 17 — At 7 o’clock Tuesday morning, more than five hours before the start of the toughest stage of the Tour de France so far, Michael Rasmussen, the race leader, received a knock at his door.His visitors were antidoping inspectors from the International Cycling Union, who were demanding a blood sample from Rasmussen and his entire team.The Rabobank team was one of the three visited by inspectors Tuesday morning, a regular occurrence at major races like the Tour de France. Every team is likely to get at least one such visit during the race, and 15 of the 21 teams have already had one. Every rider was also tested before the start of the race in London.But it is also possible that Rabobank was tested because of Rasmussen’s stunning ride in the eighth stage Sunday, when he put in a 62-mile solo attack that lifted him into the race leader’s yellow jersey and left all of the major contenders more than two minutes behind.The medical inspectors of the cycling union, known by its French initials U.C.I., reported that “no unfit cases” were found among the 25 riders of Rabobank and the two other teams tested Tuesday, Crédit Agricole and Lampre-Fondital.'"

"'07-07-19,'1','Posting a note on an Internet forum is simple. Uploading a video to YouTube isn’t. Matching a video you have shot to YouTube’s requirements for file size, running time, resolution and file format often takes some fiddling with video editing software. And loading most camcorder videos into that computer takes as long as playing them.Two still cameras from Casio may help change that. The Exilim EX-S880 and EX-Z77 shoot YouTube-compatible videos that can be uploaded quickly, without even pausing to load them onto your computer’s hard drive. This is accomplished by using the included YouTube Uploader software, which also lets you add tags and other information to each video.Both cameras also have an eBay mode that shoots 2-megapixel stills, just the right size for eBay sellers. Maximum resolution is 8.1 megapixels for the EX-S880 ($299.95) and 7.2 megapixels for the EX-Z77 ($229.95).Both models have 3X zoom lenses, face detection and electronic antishake systems that work even in video mode.But don’t dump your video editing program yet — you may want it for deleting those frames you wish you hadn’t shot.

"'07-07-19,'1','The Sprint service can also be used to track adult family members, but the adult can control who tracks them.Verizon’s child locater, called Chaperone, adds a “geofencing” service that allows a parents to define an area — such as a school or baby sitter’s house — where the child is permitted. The parents receive an alert on their handset when the child’s cellphone enters or leaves the zone.The G.P.S. phones have adult applications, too. Wherify Wireless offers a line of G.P.S.-enabled phones to track elderly relatives or employees. People doing the tracking can locate the trackees through a Web or cellphone interface or by calling the company’s toll-free number and providing the operator with a password.Helio, a boutique cellphone company aimed at young adults, offers Buddy Beacon, which enables its customers to beam their location to 25 other Helio users. Helio plots directions on Google Maps and searches for nearby businesses.Loopt, whose service runs only on the Boost prepaid network (it will soon add Sprint), takes this process a step further by allowing its users to continually report their location to friends who are also Loopt customers. Once configured, the phone tracks the user and issues an alert when another Loopt user comes within a certain distance. You have to tell the service who can track you, and you can make yourself invisible to that person at any time.TeleNav offers a service that turns phones from Sprint, AT&T, T-Mobile and others into a full-fledged G.P.S. navigation device by using the phone’s speaker and color screen. Like most G.P.S. systems, it has a “points of interest” database, but because it is connected to the cellular network, it receives updates in real time. That enables a “gas by price” service that finds nearby stations with the lowest prices. TeleNav’s “share address” feature is similar to Helio’s Buddy Beacon. If you beam your address to other TeleNav users, they can plot you on a map and get directions to your location.Verizon’s VZ Navigator service also has turn-by-turn voice and onscreen directions and a local search function to help you find nearby businesses.The drawback to turning a cellphone into a G.P.S. device is that cellphone screens are generally smaller than stand-alone G.P.S. units and a regular cellphone keypad is not ideal for typing in a destination address. On some phones, you can get knocked out of G.P.S. mode if a call comes in. That can be annoying, especially if you need to take the call to confirm where you’re going or when you’ll get there.Even if your phone does not have G.P.S., you may be able to use some of these services. GlobalSat and other companies offer external Bluetooth receivers that work with some smartphones.A G.P.S. phone enables many other services. Certain phones using the Sprint/Nextel and Verizon networks can use Bones in Motion’s BiM Active application to track your speed, location, elevation and calories burned while walking, running or cycling. You can view your statistics and a map of your route on the phone or a Web page.Skyhook Wireless offers a service that uses Wi-Fi to locate laptops and other devices, including some Wi-Fi Internet phones, and with the user’s permission reports that position to others.Smarter Agent is an apartment finder that combines G.P.S. with local classified ads to find nearby vacant apartments. Slifter lets you see price and availability of products at nearby retailers. And there are all sorts of G.P.S. applications for weather fanatics, including one from the Weather Channel that saves you the trouble of having to enter your ZIP code to find local weather information.Trimble Outdoors offers a program for Sprint customers that allows them to plot an off-road adventure. It provides topographic and satellite maps even in areas where there no paths. Some phones do require a network connection, which is not always available in areas where there are no paths.Where.com, a service of uLocate, offers numerous location widgets you can download to your cellphone. One widget works with Eventful.com to locate nearby concerts, plays, sporting events and other activities. The company offers tools to encourage developer to create even more widgets.Most G.P.S. navigation systems for cars only receive location information, but Dash Navigation, a Silicon Valley start-up, is now testing its Dash Express, which instead of adding G.P.S. to a cellphone adds a cellphone signal to a G.P.S. unit. The cellular radio transmits information both ways between the car and Dash’s servers. Every Dash unit continuously transmits its location and speed so, once there are a sufficient number of systems deployed to create a network effect, the company can determine the traffic flow on any road where Dash users are driving, including surface streets.In a test drive on U.S. 101 through Silicon Valley, the road color on the map changed from green to yellow just as traffic began to slow. The device displays alternate routes. Although it cannot be used to browse the Web, the Dash Express does have an Internet connection that enables users to look up points of interest and, through an arrangement with Yahoo, can even find stores that carry specific products.David H. Williams, publisher of LBS Globe, an online newsletter that covers location-based services, envisions G.P.S. navigation becoming more personalized. “Someday it will take the work of planning a trip out of your hands by having the system do it for you,” he said.Navigation systems will not only route you around traffic, but take you to restaurants it thinks you will like. The technology for this already exists, but, says, Mr. Williams, “most people won’t use it until they’re confident that it will work properly almost all the time.”'"

"'07-07-19,'1','The measure also establishes the first limit on contributions to soft money accounts used for political party-building expenses. The limit will be set at $300,000 in January 2009 and gradually decline to $150,000 in January 2013. Donations directly to party committees will also be reduced, to $50,000 from $94,200.The agreement creates a new enforcement unit within the Board of Elections and increases civil penalties for violations. And it requires disclosure of the practice of bundling, by which fund-raisers gather up money from multiple donors.“This is not some antiseptic notion that, ‘Gee, we care about it because academics write about it,’ ” Mr. Spitzer said at a news conference this afternoon. “I care about it because it goes to the very capacity of our government to function properly.”“We believe we are closing many of the loopholes and shutting down much of the access of money to government in a way that will bring back integrity and restore the public’s confidence,” added Mr. Spitzer, who had campaigned last fall on a pledge to overhaul the campaign finance laws.The plan requires approval from the Republican-led Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly, but the support of legislative leaders in Albany typically means passage of a bill is assured. The Legislature could return as soon as next week to vote.Senate Republicans had initially resisted any campaign finance measure. Many Republican legislators expect the governor and the Democratic Party to aggressively back challengers against them next fall and had argued against any plan that would make it difficult for them to raise money against a wealthy candidate.But the plan unveiled today leaves intact the ability of the real estate developers — steadfast supporters of the Republican Party — to give vast sums to candidates through their limited liability companies.“This is a very good beginning and moves us back into the ballpark of campaign finance reform,” said Barbara Bartoletti, legislative director of the League of Conservation Voters in New York State.Russ Haven, legislative counsel for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said: “Considering where we’ve been stuck at for a generation, it’s a move in the right direction. But clearly there’s an unfinished agenda.”Mr. Spitzer personally negotiated the compromise with the mayor, aides to Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver. After four days of closed-door talks, a compromise was announced that tied together seemingly unrelated issues, in classic Albany style.After announcing the deal this afternoon, Mr. Spitzer suggested that he would back a pay increase for lawmakers, although he did not explicitly link the raise to the legislators’ support for campaign finance changes.Lawmakers have not received a raise in eight years, although they are among the best-paid legislators in the nation, with base salaries of $79,500 that can increase to six figures with a variety of payments for committee or leadership positions.“I have said we really should not consider legislative pay until this reform agenda has moved in a very significant way, and as I said, I think we’ve moved the reform agenda very significantly, and that is important.” the governor said.What pay proposal is enacted remains to be seen. Senate Republicans have proposed a new commission to review pay going forward, while Mr. Silver and other Assembly Democrats quietly introduced legislation earlier this year that would give lawmakers a 21 percent pay raise by 2009.The agreement will also establish a commission to study Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s proposal to charge a fee to motorists who drive into the busiest parts of Manhattan, as well as other ways to reduce New York City traffic. The 17-member commission will come up with a final plan, which will be subject to approval by the City Council and the Legislature, by next March.Although the compromise on reducing congestion appeared very similar to a plan that the mayor decried earlier this week, Mr. Bloomberg in a statement today called the plan “a victory.” But the final measure is fairly modest. Among other provisions, it would require that any program expire in 2012, effectively turning any congestion pricing plan into a kind of pilot programStill, the mayor said he would seek as much as $500 million from the United States Department of Transportation to pay for the plan. The department has announced it will make $1.2 billion available to cities that undertake traffic reduction programs.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','WASHINGTON, July 19 — A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a civil suit brought by Valerie Plame Wilson and her husband, Joseph C. Wilson IV, that sought damages against Vice President Dick Cheney, his former chief of staff and two other people for their roles in disclosing Ms. Wilson’s identity as a C.I.A. operative.Judge John D. Bates of Federal District Court said that while the lawsuit raised “important questions relating to the propriety of actions taken by our highest government officials” there was no legal or constitutional way for them to obtain damages.In a 40-page opinion, Judge Bates carefully recounted the events behind the lawsuit, which included discussions about Mrs. Wilson’s identity by the four officials named in the suit: Mr. Cheney; I. Lewis Libby Jr., his former chief of staff; Richard Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state, and Karl Rove, a top White House official and President Bush’s senior political adviser.The Wilsons asserted that the disclosure of her role as a C.I.A. operative was in retaliation for Mr. Wilson’s public assertions that the Bush administration justified the invasion of Iraq by willfully distorting intelligence about Iraq’s efforts to acquire unconventional weapons. The leak of Mrs. Wilson’s identity, the lawsuit said, prematurely ended her career with the agency and put the entire Wilson family in danger.In granting a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Judge Bates said that the laws enacted by Congress to deal with such behavior, like the Privacy Act, explicitly omitted the possibility of civil lawsuits for violations.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','""You put too much pressure on yourself to make the perfect pitch,"" Smith said.The Padres scored two first-inning runs off John Maine and added two more off him before the Mets' offense, which looked potent again in scoring seven runs in Tuesday's victory, finally came to life. Their rally began when Delgado led off the seventh with a home run off the former Met Royce Ring, took a five-batter hiatus and resumed with two outs in the eighth. With two outs and no one on, Scott Linebrink walked Jose Valentin, who stole second base, and Carlos Beltrán to bring up Wright. On Linebrink's first pitch, Wright belted the 93 mile an hour fastball on a line, sailing into the left-field stands to tie the score at 4-4.""I was just looking for a pitch to drive but I got under it a little bit,"" said Wright.The home run took Maine off the hook from notching his second consecutive loss. In the first half, Maine went 10-4 with a 2.71 earned run average. Those statistics, judged against his National League peers, warranted a hard look for selection to the All-Star Game. He was squeezed out and returned from the break looking a little out of sorts. The extra time off affected his routine, causing him to feel too strong last Friday against Cincinnati, and back on normal rest Wednesday he looked slightly less discombobulated, allowing four runs and seven hits in six innings.""I felt good except for a couple pitches here and there,"" Maine said.He needed 36 pitches to wade through a first inning in which he walked the leadoff hitter, gave up three hits and two runs. With one out, Adrian Gonzalez ripped a sharp grounder a few inches to the left of Delgado. He stuck his glove down to about his knee or so, and the ball zipped past him and into the right-field corner to score Brian Giles.""That ball stayed down,"" Delgado said. ""It's a play I should have made. I could have stayed down longer on it.""Maine struck out Mike Cameron, but Greene blooped a single to right, scoring Gonzalez to extend the Padres' lead to 2-0. The Padres scored their next two runs on home runs by Milton Bradley and Gonzalez, with Bradley's 427-foot shot sailing beyond the fence in cavernous right-center field. Both homers came on the first pitch. Asked if that was a sign that the hitters were expecting a fastball, Maine said that he threw the right pitch in the wrong location.His counterpart, Greg Maddux, has set up hitters better than just about anyone during his 22 major-league seasons. He needed 11 pitches to reassert his dominance. That was all he needed to strike out the side in the first inning. The final six strikes were called, and he caught Valentin and Beltrán looking at the same pitch – a two-seam fastball that snuck over the inside corner of the plate.Of the 19 batters Maddux faced, only three drew two-ball counts and one worked a three-ball count. He allowed four hits – all singles – in five scoreless innings before departing having thrown a scant 65 pitches. It may have seemed a curious time to remove Maddux, but he is not as durable as he used to be. He has thrown fewer than 84 pitches in his last three starts, and his season trends indicate that he is a far less effective pitcher when his pitch count creeps past 75. According to Stats LLC, after his 75th pitch, opponents are batting .400 against him.Still, no pitcher tortures the Mets like he does. His 35 victories are his most against a single opponent and also the most by any pitcher against the Mets, and he was in line for No. 36 until Wright's home run.Those heroics were as short-lived as the Mets' bus ride up Interstate 5 to Los Angeles, where they will open a big four-game series today against the Dodgers.""I take defeats personally,"" Manager Willie Randolph said of the Dodgers, who swept three games from the Mets last month. ""Let's hope the players feel the same way, and they should.""The Mets recalled Marlon Anderson from Class AAA New Orleans and sent down David Newhan…Dave Williams, designated for assignment on Saturday, cleared waivers and has been assigned to New Orleans. … The Mets' rookie league team in Port St. Lucie, Fla., had Wednesday off, so Moises Alou will resume his rehabilitation assignment today.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','Goldman’s first tower in Jersey City, at 30 Hudson Street, is only 60 percent full today and could accommodate 3,000 more workers.“Goldman has perfected the art of grabbing subsidies on both sides of the river,” said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, a group that conducts research on economic development. “We can only hope that elected officials can get equally good at ensuring that Goldman lives up to its job promises. Too often, taxpayers get stuck with the tab and don’t get the jobs that were promised.”Peter Rose, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, said the company was planning for the future and had made a substantial investment in both Lower Manhattan and Jersey City. The property tax abatement that Goldman Sachs just received in Jersey City, he said, is available to any company moving there.“We have to look at the economics of where we put a building,” Mr. Rose said. “We may be a profitable firm. But that doesn’t mean we don’t watch our expenses. This is a win-win for Jersey City and Goldman Sachs.”The firm says it has 9,000 to 10,000 employees in New York and 3,662 in Jersey City.New York City officials expressed mixed opinions. “The great news is that Goldman Sachs is continuing to grow,” said Robert C. Lieber, president of New York City’s Economic Development Corporation. But, he said, the commitments Goldman made in New York “have consequences if they’re not upheld.”The tax break for Goldman provoked a lively debate yesterday at the Municipal Council’s meeting.It was generally acknowledged that Goldman was a model corporate citizen. But the Rev. Kevin Agee, pastor of the Calvary C.M.E. Church, said it was “morally reprehensible to allocate tax abatements to folks who are billionaires and millionaires while the poor, and even the middle class, gets shafted.”Elnora Watson, president of the Urban League of Hudson County, said she was grateful that Goldman Sachs donated $7,500 to her group last year, but she opposed the abatement. She said the Council should work harder to ensure that jobs go to local residents, a sentiment also expressed by other speakers.Raj Patel, who owns a travel agency in Jersey City, said that he pays full property taxes and an additional $960 a year for a special improvement district. “These people are getting freebies,” Mr. Patel said. “It doesn’t make sense.”But the president of the Municipal Council, Mariano Vega Jr., said that Goldman Sachs had done a lot for Jersey City since it opened its first tower about four years ago. Aside from the jobs and tax revenues, he said, the company has contributed to programs for affordable housing, recreation and education. And he said that Jersey City needed to provide incentives for companies if it wanted to compete with Lower Manhattan, Brooklyn and other locations.The Council ultimately voted 6 to 1 in favor of the deal.Viola Richardson, the sole council member to oppose it, said that she was not against Goldman Sachs, but that it was no longer necessary to provide incentives to get companies to move to the waterfront.Goldman Sachs has long been a downtown stalwart. In 1999, the company bought three development sites at the former Colgate toothpaste factory in Jersey City. Five years later, it built 30 Hudson, at 42 stories the tallest building in the state, after bargaining for tax breaks worth more than $160 million.Goldman Sachs initially planned to move equity sales and trading operations to the tower from Manhattan. But executives rebelled against the plan, and the company has been slow to fill the tower, which cost $1.3 billion to build.A short time later, Goldman announced plans to build a 42-story headquarters on a site in Battery Park City, which would have a view of its Jersey City operations.Grateful for the commitment downtown after the attack on the World Trade Center, state and city officials offered the company $1 billion in tax-free bonds and about $30 million in tax breaks.But after snags in the negotiations, state and city officials enhanced their offer by providing $1.65 billion in bonds and $140 million in tax breaks and cash, as well as a sharp reduction, worth an estimated $9 million a year, in Goldman’s payments in lieu of taxes.'"

The Bank of Thailand reduced its one-day bond repurchase rate to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent. Lower interest rates may help the baht retreat from a 10-year high against the dollar, making exporters more competitive. “Consumption and investment remain weak,” said Usara Wilaipich, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Bangkok. “Inflation is not a concern now because a slump in spending has curbed price increases.”'"

"'07-07-19,'1','Pfizer reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings yesterday on competition with generics and a surprisingly big 13 percent decline in sales of its best-selling Lipitor cholesterol fighter.Pfizer, the world’s biggest drug maker, said it earned $1.27 billion, or 18 cents a share, in the second quarter. That compares with $2.42 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Pfizer, based in New York, earned 42 cents a share. Analysts on average expected 50 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.The company affirmed its 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts, but investors and industry analysts remained skeptical. An HSBC analyst, Kevin Scotcher, cut his rating on Pfizer to neutral, saying the results called into question whether Pfizer could meet its earnings targets.Pfizer, hurt by the recent loss of patent protection on its anti-depressant Zoloft and the blood pressure treatment Norvasc, said global company revenue fell 6 percent, to $11.08 billion. That was shy of Wall Street expectations of $11.44 billion.The disappointing results compound a bumpy start to the second-quarter reporting season for drug makers. On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis cut their sales forecasts. Abbott Laboratories, however, encouraged investors yesterday with its strong quarterly results and forecasts.'"

He has become the focus of a growing popular movement to restore civilian rule even as General Musharraf also comes under increasing pressure from radical Islamists.That popular outpouring has given momentum to Defense of Human Rights, a group founded by Mrs. Janjua, and the nongovernmental Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, who are trying to locate and free the missing men.Every two weeks in crowded sessions of the Supreme Court here, judges listen to the pleadings of women demanding to know the whereabouts of their husbands and sons and brothers, who they believe are locked up in government jails and safe houses.Security officers, dressed in pressed khakis and black berets, are regularly dragged before the bench and asked to explain where the men — known here as the “disappeared” — are being held.“At least tell me whether my husband is alive,” Mrs. Janjua pleaded at a recent Supreme Court hearing here in Islamabad.The officers professed to have no inkling of the whereabouts of Masood Ahmed Janjua, 45, whose slightly smiling portrait Mrs. Janjua has held aloft outside government buildings for nearly two years.One mother, Syeda Nargis, a diminutive woman swathed in black, travels four hours by bus from Lahore to the capital to attend the court hearings. It is a year since she waited at the Islamabad airport to greet her son upon his arrival from Dubai.“He landed at 7 p.m.; I stayed until 1 a.m.,” she recalled, a color poster of her son Syed Imran Naqvi, 31, dressed in a tartan shirt, blazer and trim beard, clutched in her hands. “They said, ‘Maybe he will come after two or three hours.’ Now it is 12 months, and nothing has happened.”Her son, a software engineer, was her main source of income, she said. “We spent so much money for him to be an engineer, not to go to jail,” she said. “Musharraf should tell us the reason, what is the problem?”Asked specifically about the cases of the 400, a senior Pakistani government official said many of the people on the list had “religious links” with Afghanistan and had joined “militant organizations” there.The official, Javed Iqbal Cheema, the director general of the National Crisis Management cell at the Ministry of Interior, said, specifically, that Mr. Janjua was close to Al Qaeda and the Taliban and was not in the Pakistani government’s custody.Mrs. Janjua denies that assertion, saying that her husband was close to Tablighi Jamaat, a large Muslim organization involved in proselytizing whose membership includes former government officials. That group is also active in Britain, where some authorities contend that it serves as a conveyor belt for extremists.Some of those who have been released by the government have been tortured, and their experiences have been sparingly reported. But for the most part they remain too afraid to describe publicly what was done to them, the leaders of the groups say.About 60 of the detained have been released but as they have been freed others have been jailed, keeping the number of the missing at a fairly constant 400 since the beginning of the year, said Mrs. Janjua and the secretary general of the Human Rights Commission, Iqbal Haider.The list of 400 does not include many more people, “perhaps thousands,” who have been arrested in Baluchistan and kept secretly for supporting the separatist movement in that province, said Mr. Haider, a former minister of justice in the government of Benazir Bhutto.The most recent United States State Department human rights report on Pakistan said its human rights record “remained poor,” though that has not diminished the Bush administration’s support for the Musharraf government.Among the methods of abuse used against people in custody, the report said, were “beating, burning with cigarettes, whipping the soles of the feet, prolonged isolation, electric shock, denial of food or sleep, hanging upside down, use of electric shocks and forced spreading of the legs with bar fetters.”A former officer in the Pakistani Air Force, Khalid Khawaja, 56, who is well known for his good relations with a number of Islamic radical groups, was released from the Rawilipindi jail in late June after six months in custody.Mr. Khawaja, a force behind Defense of Human Rights, said he was arrested and blindfolded in January, then shuffled around several prisons, including a new maximum-security one in Faisalbad. He was held in solitary confinement for long periods and denied medicine, he said.His wife, Shamama Malik, turned up at every demonstration, and his son worked the phones to win his father’s freedom. “The Americans are getting all the people with religious motivation and taking them away,” Mr. Khawaja said angrily in an interview at his home the morning after his release.Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the lawyer who has led the effort in the Supreme Court for the Defense of Human Rights, said the government had three laws, including the Security of Pakistan Act, under which it could detain people for specific periods. But none of them had been applied in the cases he was handling, he said.“Even if some of the missing persons have some link with Osama bin Laden,” Mr. Siddiqui said, “they have to be treated in accordance with the law.”So far, the Supreme Court seems to agree. Even with the chief justice’s suspension, the other justices have not shied away from hearing the cases, though Mrs. Janjua says she is convinced that Mr. Chaudhry’s determination to do so led to General Musharraf’s attempt to oust him.“He was very fatherly,” she said, recalling a hearing on March 8 before Mr. Chaudhry. “I was insisting hard. I was in tears. He said: ‘Be comforted. We are using every channel, and every person is going to be released, and we are going to continue the hearings until the last person is released.’ ”She added: “On March 8, he was speaking like this. The very next day, he was not in his chair.”'"
"'07-07-19,'1','The “green cleaning” movement — using household cleansers made from environmentally friendly, nonpolluting ingredients — has been gaining momentum and revenue recently. The granddaddy of the category, Seventh Generation, which sells both household cleaners and personal care products, is 15 years old. Companies that make conventional cleaning products, like Clorox and S. C. Johnson, are offering similar product lines.Last year, according to Kline & Company, a market research firm, Method Products had sales of $85 million. The private company was the fastest-growing cleaning products concern of the 18 that Kline profiled, posting a 140 percent increase in sales in 2006. Kline also estimated that the green category of the household cleaning products industry represents $300 million in sales, or 2 percent of the total market.S. C. Johnson, the maker of Windex, Pledge and Fantastik, began an initiative six years ago called Greenlist in which it rates all the raw materials used in its products for environmental safety.Scott Johnson, vice president for global environmental safety at S. C. Johnson, said that the company did not have a separate category for green products, but had been trying continuously to upgrade its existing products to be as sustainable and eco-friendly as possible. In January, Clorox plans to introduce a line of eco-friendly products to be sold alongside its existing bleaches and cleansers. Clorox expects the Green Works line to cost about 20 percent to 25 percent more than its current products.Stephen P. Ashkin, president of a green-cleaning consultancy called the Ashkin Group and a former director of product development for Seventh Generation, said he foresaw big companies like Clorox and S. C. Johnson becoming sources of major innovations in the green cleaning industry. “They will invest their technical resources into products,” Mr. Ashkin said. “And as they sell more, they will buy more green raw materials, which will drive further innovation among their suppliers.”Ms. Schuler of Method Products said she was not daunted by the larger rivals. “We are excited about the competition,” she said. “It means people want to live a greener lifestyle, and we are all for that.”The new campaign for Method Products was meant to reflect the “style and substance” of the products as well as the “personal” and “very human” attitude of the company, said Carisa Bianchi, president of TBWA/Chiat/Day in Los Angeles, which is part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.“The brand itself has a personality that is very fun. They really wanted to preserve that personality,” Ms. Bianchi said. “It’s written from a human perspective, it’s very conversational, from someone you might know well.”Some of the ads are a bit provocative. One shows the entwined legs of two nude people lying on the ground, the rest of their bodies hidden by a wall; a mop is propped against the wall. The slogan reads, “Make floor love, not floor war.”Another visual shows a spray cleaner bottle wrapped in a crumpled brown paper bag, with the slogan “lay off the hard stuff.”Given that Method Products is known for its package design, part of the hook is that the products, like Ylang-Ylang shower spray and Cut Grass aroma sticks, are “counter-worthy,” as Ms. Schuler put it. “If you want to leave them out, they look fine,” she said.At the same time, the look of the new campaign, which Ms. Schuler would only say had a budget of “several million dollars,” is geared toward creating new “advocates” — people whom the rest of us might call “customers.” Advocates, said Ms. Schuler, “want a healthier lifestyle and appreciate good design.”'"
"'07-07-19,'1','HARTFORD, July 18 (AP) — Strength in the airline industry and commercial construction helped raise second-quarter profit more than 4 percent at the United Technologies Corporation, to nearly $1.15 billion, the company reported Wednesday.United Technologies, the parent company of the jet engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney, the airline power systems maker Hamilton Sundstrand, Otis Elevator and other industrial companies, also raised its revenue and earnings outlook for the year.Earnings per share for the quarter that ended June 30 were $1.16, beating estimates of $1.15 by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.Excluding restructuring and gains in the second quarters of this year and 2006, earnings per share grew 16 percent compared with the period a year ago. United Technologies officials told analysts in a conference call that a strong second quarter in 2006 made for a tough comparison with this year’s results.Revenue for the quarter was $13.9 billion, up 13.4 percent from the second quarter of 2006.United Technologies, based in Hartford, credited strong international markets in commercial aviation and commercial construction, “and we see these conditions continuing over the balance of the year and into 2008,” George David, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.United Technologies raised its revenue guidance for the year to $53 billion, from $51 billion, and its earnings per share guidance to $4.15 to $4.25, from $4.05 to $4.20.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','Her Gaza director, John Ging, said, “If present closures continue, we anticipate that Gaza will become nearly a totally aid-dependent society, a society robbed of the possibility of self-sufficiency and the dignity of work.”While Israel is processing needed imports of food, fuel and medicine, the smaller crossings that are open require that containers be unloaded on one side of the border and reloaded on the other, adding $300 a ton to costs and restricting the flow.Some commercial goods for grocery stores are being imported through deals between Israeli suppliers and Gazan merchants. But imports of building materials like concrete for construction and raw materials for factories have been held up, throwing Gazans out of work.More than 68,000 workers have lost their jobs since mid-June, more than 80 percent of the private sector employment, said Nasser al-Hilou, a prominent Gazan businessman. The refugee agency halted $93 million worth of construction projects for lack of building materials, and put workers on leave.And even if factories can produce, they cannot export. Gaza is full of vegetables and flowers grown for export markets that are being sold cheaply or are rotting.“There is no starvation in Gaza, but there is no prosperity or life in Gaza either,” Mr. Hilou said. “Gaza needs trade, not aid.”Mr. Ging appealed to the so-called quartet of the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations, which work for Middle East peace and plan to meet on Thursday in Portugal to help open Karni.If Gaza’s private sector goes bankrupt, he said, his agency will be unable to meet the demand.In security terms, bringing items into Gaza is not a big problem for Israel. Exports are a different matter. Without Karni, with its sophisticated scanners, every item would have to be gone over carefully, if not by hand then with smaller scanners, to ensure that no explosives or weapons are being smuggled.Having no Palestinians on the Gaza side of Karni whom Israel trusts has so far been an insurmountable problem for exports. Israel refuses to have any relationship with Hamas. Hamas has offered to bring Fatah back to Karni or to hire a Turkish company to operate the Palestinian side, but Israel says the Palestinians must resolve that issue.For now political considerations seem most important, with Mr. Abbas trying to consolidate the West Bank with the help of Israel and the United States. Asked if Israel and Egypt were keeping Karni and the Rafah crossing from Egypt shut in part because Mr. Abbas asked them to, Miri Eisin, the spokeswoman for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel, said: “Our clear-cut policy is to do it in coordination with President Abbas. We’re not doing anything Abbas opposes, and we’ve opposed nothing he’s asked us to do. We both agree on the complete sidelining of Hamas.” In Ramallah, meeting with the European Union foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, Mr. Abbas suggested on Wednesday that he was considering calling for early presidential and legislative elections through the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Central Council. Mr. Abbas has called a rare meeting of the group for Wednesday evening and Thursday as a replacement for the elected legislature. Under the Palestinian basic law, only the legislature can mandate early elections.It is hard to imagine how Mr. Abbas could hold an election without the agreement of Hamas, which controls Gaza and could also disrupt voting in the West Bank.Qadura Fares, a politician close to the jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti, said that Mr. Abbas was describing “an idea.” He added: “It’s a decision, but it doesn’t mean the decision will be implemented. Any election has to be agreed upon by Hamas.”If Hamas feels further isolated in a declining, impoverished Gaza, the thinking goes, it may be more willing to allow new elections, so long as Mr. Abbas also puts the presidency at stake.In Israel, the comptroller-general issued a stinging report, charging that Mr. Olmert and the army had failed to protect the civilian population during last summer’s war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. More than 40 Israeli civilians died in Hezbollah rocket attacks. The country’s leadership, the report said, “failed severely in the decision-making process, preparedness and implementation of their treatment and care of the civilian population.”Mr. Olmert responded, “It is impossible to promise complete protection to every citizen” in a war of rockets and missiles.He and his government are already unpopular because of the war but got what may be another reprieve on Wednesday when the Winograd commission, looking into the larger question of war management, said it might postpone its final report to allow people to respond first to accusations made against them.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','“It’s been a struggle for Julia this year,” he said, “but she’s got the perseverance and the ability to do it. I know it’s been disappointing for Julia, and I know it’s been disappointing for her family, but we’re not worried about it. She’s doing quite well.”Landauer has big plans: to continue her career in Europe, perhaps even before she graduates from high school, then to surge through the ranks to Formula One. Her favorite driver is not Danica Patrick, but Michael Schumacher, the seven-time world Formula One champion.“As good as American drivers are, European drivers are better, more competitive,” Julia said.She has been bitten by the bug, as have her 13-year-old sister, Emma, and their 10-year-old brother, Aidan, both go-kart racers. Already this year, Julia has raced in Montreal and at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, where she hit 137 miles an hour.Six years after racing a go-kart for the first time at Oakland Valley Race Park in Cuddebackville, N.Y., and a year after rolling to the prestigious Skip Barber Eastern Regional Series Sportsman championship, Landauer is tackling a much tougher learning curve.Landauer, who has her own Web site, julialandauer.com, must keep up with a pack of talented young drivers from all over North America as she learns how to market herself to potential corporate sponsors. The foyer of her home is a way station for her suitcases, and she frowns when she says she missed 47 days of school at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan last year.Landauer, whose family also has a home on the Upper West Side, sandwiched three final exams at Stuyvesant last month around a testing session. When she is not driving in the Formula BMW USA Series, she is racing go-karts with her siblings.“It’s a very rewarding sport, in that littlest bit of improvement can help your times,” said her father, who set aside his racing aspirations as a young man, in part, to become an anesthesiologist.Julia is planning to return next year to the Formula BMW USA Series, continuing to race an open-wheel car that looks like a Formula One car.She is already hard-boiled by the grim side of racing. In June, she stood outside the turn at the Formula One race in Montreal, where Robert Kubica, a BMW driver from Poland, wrecked spectacularly but somehow escaped serious injury.“I was glad I didn’t have to get on the track after that,” she said. “But you won’t drive as well if you’re thinking about that. You have to accept that it might happen, and I don’t think about it.”Landauer was also at the Champ Car World Series race last year in Elkhart Lake, Wis., where Katherine Legge, a 27-year-old driver, hit a wall but walked away.That Legge was unhurt was a testament, at least to Julia, that the drivers were as safe as they could be. After winning all 12 races in the Skip Barber series last year, she contacted Team KMA Racing last fall and tried out for its Formula BMW USA team.She made it, and there have been fringe benefits besides a seat in a fast car. She recently flew with other drivers in the series to BMW headquarters in Germany for tours of the racing museum and the famous automobile plant.“One of the benefits of the whole program is that these kids learn as much about life off the track as they do about racing on the track,” said Wayne Schulte, the program manager for Formula BMW USA. “When you take kids who have been racing go-karts, you can’t expect to put them right into the Indy Racing League or the Champ Car series tomorrow.”Some of the program’s graduates have moved on, most notably Graham Rahal, the 18-year-old son of the 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion, Bobby Rahal. Graham Rahal raced a Formula BMW in 2004 and is now a rookie in the Champ Car series.For someone who will not celebrate her 16th birthday until November (when she will be eligible to drive a passenger car), Landauer knows she has a dream ride. But that only goes so far. She wants better results, and soon.“I have to prove more that I’m worth paying attention to,” she said.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','Federal prosecutors have appealed a judge’s dismissal of tax fraud charges against 13 defendants from the KPMG accounting firm, but prosecutors may face a higher hurdle as they fight to get the faltering case back on track.The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan filed the appeal late Monday, shortly after Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court dismissed the charges, saying prosecutors violated the constitutional rights of the defendants to a fair trial and legal representation.The dismissal left five other defendants, including three formerly with KPMG, facing charges of conspiracy, tax evasion and fraud in connection with their work involving tax shelters.Judge Kaplan’s ruling came weeks after prosecutors told him that although they disagreed with his findings of prosecutorial misconduct, he should dismiss charges against certain defendants.Prosecutors had feared that any guilty verdict at a trial would be tossed out on appeal because of the judge’s findings. With Monday’s dismissal, the prosecution now has a pretrial decision it can appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.'"
"'07-07-19,'1','Yesterday in Washington, the McCain movie was the one where the old soldier is stuck with a feckless commander who messes everything up and then orders his men to take the hill anyway. “The verdict of the people will arrive long before history’s. The public’s judgment of me I will know soon enough,” the senator from Arizona said with an interesting mixture of passion and gloom.This is not the worst possible outcome for John McCain. His presidential campaign is falling apart and everyone is debating whether it’s due to his principled stand on Iraq or his principled stand on immigration. But the alternate plotline was the one in which the stalwart maverick senator sells out to everybody from the irrational religious right to the irresponsible tax-cut crowd, and then loses the nomination anyway.McCain campaigns have a history of misjudging the public. His advisers firmly believed his heroism as a prisoner of war would win him piles of votes. While that sounds perfectly rational, the fact is that with the exception of a few generals who actually ran a war, voters haven’t awarded points for military valor since we stopped having Whigs.They also thought voters wanted a president who had the gumption to stick to his convictions. We like to imagine that’s true, but in fact we only love politicians who stick to our convictions. There’s actually nothing we hate more than a leader who insists on doing something we don’t like and tells us it’s a matter of principle. We’ve got one of those now, and look how well things are turning out.During yesterday’s debate, a 6 a.m. traffic jam around the microphone forced some of the other presidential candidates to content themselves with submitting remarks for the record. Hillary Clinton, however, managed to get 20 minutes at 4:15 a.m. It was a measured recitation of Bush failures, the virtues of the Democratic proposal and the impossibility of knowing what would happen in Iraq if we left.The most notable thing, really, was her staying power. When you consider that Mrs. Clinton may well be the most famous woman in the world, it’s amazing how much punishment she’s willing to undertake.Last weekend she voted in the Senate, then flew to New Hampshire and did six events around the state before dark, not including massive doses of handshaking and interview-giving. She looked absolutely exhausted backstage; you’d think she’d have bailed out somewhere around the third “Ready for Change, Ready to Lead” rally. But no, there she was.If success really is 90 percent about showing up, she is the next president of the United States. But the constant complaint about Mrs. Clinton is that she never takes an unpopular principled stand.And now you know why.'"

"'07-07-20,'0','But the real problem, according to small business advocates, boils down to bureaucratic indifference, with roots that can be traced to the White House. For long-suffering small business contractors, a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report comes as no surprise. It found that the administration has selectively chosen not to enforce laws it doesn't like, even though the president has signed them into law.Legal scholars have begun debating whether the president has the right to do so, or is thumbing his nose at the Constitution, but the administration's bureaucratic insolence is already well known in small business circles. Magdalah Silva, president and chief executive of a management and technology consulting firm in Washington, cited a program to assist women-owned businesses. It has been on the books for seven years, yet the Small Business Administration (SBA) has never implemented it.The law is supposed to help the government set aside 5 percent of federal contracts for women-owned businesses, another goal that Congress established and federal bureaucrats have never met. ""For seven long years, the SBA has studied and restudied this issue. We have waited long enough,"" she said.Silva testified on behalf of a bipartisan, nonprofit Washington group known as Women Impacting Public Policy. The group claims another program to assist women has also been set up to fail because the government hasn't updated it since 1989.The president, of course, is not beyond paying lip service to small business concerns. In 2002, he pledged to reduce ""contract bundling,"" a process that prevents small businesses from competing for billions of dollars in federal procurements every year, or worse, puts them at the mercy of abusive prime contractors. The president's promise came after the Office of Management and Budget discovered that every $100 awarded on a bundled contract resulted in a $33 decrease in awards to small businesses.In 1984, Congress passed a law that prevented the government from bundling contracts that restrained competition, and three years later the Comptroller General issued an advisory prohibiting bundling for reasons of ""bureaucratic convenience.""""Unfortunately, federal agencies have routinely ignored this, and [the law] does not set clear standards on the issue,"" said Todd McCracken, president of the National Small Business Association, a leading trade group.Paul Hsu, the SBA associate administrator for government contracting and business development, told the committee that small business prime contracts had increased by $30.6 billion in FY 2005 over FY 2000's amount, supporting an estimated 235,000 jobs. But, in fact, the government doesn't really know how many small business contracts it awards every year.The SBA claimed the government had awarded 25.4 percent of its contracts to small businesses, exceeding the congressionally mandated goal of 23 percent. But one independent group that tracks government contracts claimed the figure was closer to 19 percent.As it turns out, the SBA's own government watchdog agency, the Office of Advocacy, found that 44 of the government's top thousand small businesses in FY 2005 were actually major corporations. Combined they received $2 billion in contracts earmarked for small firms. Other critics, such as Lloyd Chapman, president and founder of the American Small Business League (ASBL), charge that the problem is far worse. The ASBL has sued the SBA on several occasions to find out the names of large corporations with small business contracts.Of course, since 1988 it's been a felony for corporations to willfully misrepresent their status as small businesses to win government contracts. Violators can face up to 10 years in prison, fines of up to $500,000, and debarment from the program. But the government has never prosecuted or debarred any company.Hsu told the committee that the SBA recognizes the need to improve government contracting programs, and SBA Administrator Steven Preston recently unveiled two new initiatives. One, announced earlier this month, asks the top thousand prime contractors to voluntarily disclose the small business contracts they hold; another sets new size standards and disclosure rules requiring businesses to report when they outgrow the program or are bought by a large corporation. Critics claim the latter is fraught with loopholes.Whether this latest government effort to clean up problems amounts to more paper shuffling or real reform remains to be seen. But Democrats have a real chance to show they mean business, not by passing another law, but by insisting the government enforce and implement laws already on the books.'"

"'07-07-20,'0','So a bank heist is the oft-told tale, a classic, the male version of the June wedding on Lifetime. Each variation on the genre packs in clichés with mild deviations — the caterer is the one who catches the bouquet; one of the hostages is in on the plot — but at story’s end, only one thing matters: Does the star-crossed couple make it down the aisle, and do the robbers make it out alive?John Leguizamo plays Wolf, a veteran of three tours in Iraq, who leads members of his former platoon into a new kind of battle: storm a Pittsburgh bank and secure the perimeter. Throughout the robbery, he uses military terms but refers to himself as Mr. Wolf, and uses other animal names, Cat, Rabbit, for his accomplices, another steal from “Reservoir Dogs,” where the robbers were known by colors, like Mr. Green and Mr. Pink. (It’s hard to pinpoint when a filmmaker’s homage turns into plagiarism — maybe a term like homagerism would cover it.)When the robbery goes bloodily awry, and the robbers retreat into the bank with more than a dozen employees and customers, an experienced, street-smart hostage negotiator, Horst Cali, played by Donnie Wahlberg, moves in to run the police operation.At first blush, it’s a little hard to watch Mr. Wahlberg play a serious role with a straight face. He is the brother of Mark Wahlberg, one of the creators of HBO’s “Entourage” and the model for the lead character, a hot young star named Vinnie; Donnie is often viewed as the model for Vinnie’s more self-serious, sexually frustrated and less successful brother, Johnny Drama. Mr. Wahlberg isn’t helped by his first scene on camera, complaining to the head of the S.W.A.T. team that he can’t persuade his pregnant wife to have sex with him.As the stand-off unfolds, Wolf and Cali find that they are well-matched adversaries, but, as could be expected, Cali’s decisions are second-guessed and sometimes overruled by a pompous, needling, and rashly inept deputy chief of police. When it turns out that one hostage, a sexy, feisty young woman named Ashley, is the daughter of a billionaire crony of the mayor, Cali finds himself second-guessed by all the Pittsburgh powers that be.Cali is street-smart, but he is also a bit eccentric, a stickler for correct grammar and syntax who grows more doctrinaire under pressure. When a subordinate asks: “How do you want me to prioritize that? Is that important or not?” Cali snarls, “There are so many things wrong with the construction of that sentence, I can’t even stand to look at you.”Cali and his team slowly gather information about Wolf’s military record, which includes a court-martial. And that disclosure prompts Wolf to leave the bank and challenge Cali face-to-face, surrounded by a vast, riveted audience of S.W.A.T. team snipers, cops, television reporters and bystanders. He strips down to his undershorts to reveal the scars he acquired in Falluja and Baghdad, and delivers an Al Pacinoesque rant. “Go ahead, shoot me,” he says, “like they did in Falluja, man.”When he demands a flak jacket for every soldier in Iraq and also that “the son of every senator who voted yes for this war sign up for active duty,” a few police officers nod, many bystanders applaud, and some of his former soldiers, following the action live on television, pack up to join the fight.James DeMonaco, the creator of “The Kill Point,” was also a writer of a 1998 robbery-hostage movie, “The Negotiator.” So it’s hardly surprising that this series resembles that film.

"'07-07-20,'0','This is the end, Danny Boyle sings in his spooky and spookily beautiful science-fiction thriller, “Sunshine.” Mr. Boyle, the sly-boots British director of movies as seemingly different as “Trainspotting” and “Millions,” has a knack for turning dire setups and very bad things into visually arresting, tingly experiences, whether his characters are doing one another in by hook or by crook or through some robust chomping, as in his exemplary zombie flick, “28 Days Later.” The end may be nigh in “Sunshine” — the Sun is dying, as is, alas, poor Earth — but Mr. Boyle is having a grand old time.Old is an operative word here. Like a lot of science fiction, “Sunshine” owes as much of a debt to the past as to the speculative future, including some of the usual suspects, notably Stanley Kubrick’s classic head-scratcher, “2001: A Space Odyssey,” with flashy bits and pieces borrowed from “Alien” and “Blade Runner,” Ridley Scott’s back-to-back masterworks. Like the globe-trotters in Olaf Stapledon’s 1930 science-fiction novel, “Last and First Men,” who jump planets to keep the race going, humankind in “Sunshine” has been forced to extremes to survive the Sun’s collapse. The latest extreme is a manned spaceship with a nuclear payload that, when dropped on the dying star, will trigger a big bang to thaw our global freezing.That’s the bright idea, or at least the most vivid one, in “Sunshine,” which also flirts with questions about scientific progress, ethics and the limits of rationality. For the young, overly pretty crew of white and Asian astronauts, the mission initially entails watching monitors, twiddling dials and counting miles. There are hints of discord, as when a fight breaks out between two crewmen, the pacific Capa (Cillian Murphy) and the macho Mace (Chris Evans), a tussle wearily described by one of the ship’s two women, Cassie (Rose Byrne), as “an excess of manliness.” More alarmingly, the resident shrink, Searle (Cliff Curtis), has developed a fondness for staring into the Sun, bathing in its increasingly dangerous light.As the hubristically named ship, Icarus II, races toward its fiery destination, the crew picks up an eerie distress beacon beeping from someplace out in the great black beyond. In the face of this unsettling unknown, the captain, Kaneda (Hiroyuki Sanada), keeps his cool, while the streamlined crew — including Michelle Yeoh as Corazon, Benedict Wong as Trey and Troy Garity as Harvey — more or less keeps it together. But, like the Icarus of myth, these all-too-human voyagers who make like gods also risk punishment. Alarms sound, nerves shred, light flares, hope dims, and at one point and without much surprise, life ebbs, pooling picturesquely over the immaculate production design.A first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer, Mr. Boyle always sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears. He’s wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in “Sunshine,” but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion. With the exception of “Millions,” about a motherless boy, Mr. Boyle’s movies are more likely to make you whimper than choke up or feel deeply. That’s to be expected because keeping the audience amused and distracted comes a little too easily to him. Like Steven Soderbergh, another cool, crafty dissembler, Mr. Boyle is awfully clever, which can be a great strength as well as a weakness.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','AUBURN HILLS, Mich., July 20 — The United Automobile Workers union formally began what is expected to be an intense season of contract negotiations this morning, with a handshake between the union’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, and Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda.Despite the gravity that these talks carry, the two spent a moment trading jokes before Mr. LaSorda said simply, “We want a settlement,” according to photographers that Chrysler allowed to witness the ceremony.Mr. Gettelfinger will take part in similar rituals Monday with the leaders of General Motors and Ford. The union’s current contract with Detroit’s automakers, signed in 2003, expires Sept. 14.When negotiators actually sit down to discuss business, health care is certain to take up much of their attention. Medical expenses cost the automakers $12 billion annually, or about $1,500 for every vehicle sold.Much of that money goes toward the carmakers’ retirees, who outnumber active workers for the first time ever, after widespread buyout programs dramatically thinned the company’s payrolls in the last year.The car companies’ ability, or willingness, to continue paying generous benefits, including negligible co-payments for drugs and doctor visits, will be a crucial sticking point.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','He also said the U.A.W. remains committed to the principle of pattern bargaining, which involves striking a deal with one company, then persuading its competitors to accept identical terms. The union broke from that tradition with the health-care deals by refusing to help Chrysler, citing that company’s healthier finances.But Chrysler’s chief negotiator, John S. Franciosi, said pattern bargaining no longer works as it did years ago, before Detroit was challenged Japanese carmakers with lower labor costs. The Detroit automakers originally agreed to pattern bargaining “so that labor costs would always be neutral among us,” he said.“What wasn’t anticipated then was the Japanese transplants, and whether we like it or not, they set the baseline,” Mr. Franciosi said. “Being non-union operators, they set the labor cost floor.”Neither Mr. Gettelfinger nor Chrysler officials would discuss whether they favor creating a health care trust, called a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, which could take over the responsibility for worker and retiree benefits. The idea of a trust, which would free the three carmakers from long-term health care liabilities totaling roughly $100 billion, has come up in several months of informal pre-negotiations.The U.A.W. recently agreed to such an arrangement at the Dana Corporation, a parts supplier. Mr. Gettelfinger said the Dana agreement “is not a precursor for any other settelement negotiations,” adding, “We were dealing with a specific situation at a bankrupt company.”A health care trust, known as a V.E.B.A., is one example of the type of unorthodox solution that analysts say could help the automakers better control their labor costs.While some union members might see such a deal as one more concession they must make, Mr. Franciosi disagrees. “Creativity and innovation are not concessionary,” he said. “It’s coming up with creative approaches to the issues that drive costs.”Mr. Gettelfinger, who will take part in opening rituals Monday with the leaders of General Motors and Ford, sees health care as a national problem and not one that his members should be asked to fix. The U.A.W. made that clear in a booklet distributed to reporters this morning.“Can the problem of rising health care costs be solved at the bargaining table?” it asked. “No. America’s health care crisis is a national problem that requires a national solution. It cannot be resolved with any one industry or employer through labor negotiations.”'"
"'07-07-20,'0','Rasmussen said on Thursday night that had mailed the required forms to the U.C.I. from Mexico, where he was training near the home of his mother-in-law.Tom Boonen of Belgium won Friday’s stage , his second stage victory this year, and Rasmussen retained the yellow jersey with a lead of more than two and a half minutes over two Spanish riders, Alejandro Valverde and Iban Mayo.Christian Prudhomme, the director of the Tour de France, expressed dissatisfaction that the U.C.I. and the Danish Cycling Union would release the information now, while Rasmussen was in the yellow jersey at the world’s biggest cycling race.“Why not talk about it before the start of the Tour?,” he said in remarks to reporters. Mr. Prudhomme, who displayed clear anger at the timing of the disclosure, said that Rasmussen, who has been in the race lead for several days, had been subjected to multiple blood and urine tests since the beginning of the Tour, and that the organization was awaiting the results of those tests.But he noted that the Danish Cycling Union also tested Rasmussen shortly before the Tour at the Danish national championships and had reported no adverse results. That test came two days after the second of Rasmussen’s two missed tests.The Amaury Sports Organization, which owns and manages the tour de France, and the U.C.I. have been at odds in recent years over the structure and governing responsibility for the sport.The Danish Cycling Union announced on Thursday that Rasmussen was being excluded from the Danish national team for the cycling world championship races in September and for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.The events surrounding Rasmussen come as the Tour de France and the sport of cycling are desperately fighting an image that the sport is severely tainted with performance-enhancing drugs.Last year’s winner, Floyd Landis, an American, failed a drug test during last year’s race, and he is awaiting the results of an arbitration in which he argued that the testing was flawed. As a result, no defending champion is present at the Tour.Another former Tour winner, Bjarne Riis, admitted last month that he used performance-enhancing drugs during the year he won the Tour de France, in 1996. The Tour de France revoked his title and asked him to stay away from this year’s race, despite the fact that he is the manager of the CSC team, which is competing here.Several German riders, most of the current or former members of the German T-Mobile team, formerly known as Telekom, admitted recently that they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for the team. And earlier this week, it became known that a current T-Mobile rider, Patrik Sinkewitz, tested positive for elevated testosterone levels in a drug test just prior to the Tour. Sinkewitz had already withdrawn from the race following a collision with a spectator.'"

"'07-07-20,'0','“They wanted to ignore the problem,” Mr. Waxman said, referring to headquarters officials. “What we have is indifference to the suffering of people who are already suffering because of Hurricane Katrina, and this is from an agency that’s supposed to serve the public.”Mr. Waxman said that after news reports in March 2006 about formaldehyde in the trailers, members of the field staff urged immediate action. He quoted a response in an e-mail message from a FEMA lawyer who said: “Do not initiate any testing until we give the O.K. Once you get results, the clock is running on our duty to respond to them.”The documents include an e-mail exchange among agency staff members dated June 27, 2006, relating the news that one person had been found dead in a trailer in St. Tammany Parish, La.Referring to the use of air-conditioning, one e-mail message said: “We do not have autopsy results yet, but he had apparently told his neighbor in the past that he was afraid to use his A.C. because he thought it would make the formaldehyde worse.”The staff member who wrote it recommended further investigation and said that the agency’s office of general counsel had told a different employee that it “has not wanted FEMA to test to determine if formaldehyde levels are in fact unsafe.”Mary DeVany, an industrial hygienist with her own practice, testified that it is not rare to find formaldehyde in homes, because it is used in pressed wood products like particleboard and plywood, and in glues and certain insulation materials. Ms. DeVany said several agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, had classified the chemical as a probable or known human carcinogen.Paul Stewart of Bay St. Louis, Miss., who lived in a FEMA travel trailer from December 2005 to March 2006, said the agency was unresponsive to calls about his suspicion that the trailer was making him ill, so he ordered a test kit and determined that formaldehyde levels were high.When Mr. Stewart reported the results to the agency and asked for a new trailer, he said, “The way FEMA treated us was as if we were charity cases.” He added, “To them, it was like you were asking for something better.”Lindsay Huckabee of Kiln, Miss., said that after moving into a FEMA mobile home in December 2005, she, her husband and four children began to experience symptoms that she now believes were related to formaldehyde exposure. Visits to doctors became a common occurrence. Ms. Huckabee, who was pregnant when she moved in, said she experienced preterm labor for three weeks that had to be stopped with medication. Even then, her son was born four weeks early.Mr. Paulison said the agency received its first complaint of formaldehyde fumes in March 2006, six months after the trailers were first delivered. He said that “after a prompt review,” officials replaced the trailer listed in the complaint on March 19. He said 58 of the 66,800 travel trailer and mobile homes now in use had been replaced because of formaldehyde concerns and that as a result of five other complaints, residents were moved to rental housing.On the eve of the hearing, the agency announced it that it had asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to test air quality in occupied trailers. The study will begin next week.Mr. Paulison said FEMA had updated its trailer purchase specifications, improved training of the agency and medical staff members who must respond to complaints and increased efforts to move residents into other long-term housing.Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana, which is home to many mobile home manufacturers, expressed concern that the hearing was portraying the industry unfairly.“What we have are terrible personal stories,” Mr. Souder said. “To just uniformly, without research, make the assertions that I’ve been hearing today about an industry is irresponsible.”'"
"'07-07-20,'0','Verizon Wireless will pay the Broadcom Corporation as much as $200 million to bypass a possible ban on some handsets that use Qualcomm chips.The agreement will give Verizon Wireless the right to use a patent found to have been infringed by Qualcomm, the companies said in a statement yesterday. Verizon Communications and the Vodafone Group jointly own Verizon Wireless.Broadcom won a trade ruling last month against Qualcomm in its bid to prevent phone companies from using the chips, which allow phones to surf the Internet and download video, without paying royalties. The agreement allows Verizon to introduce the latest mobile phones and hands Qualcomm another setback in its two-year dispute over the technology.Verizon is paying $6 a handset, to a maximum of $200 million. Broadcom offered similar terms to Qualcomm last month to settle their dispute. Qualcomm rejected the offer.“It’s a great strategic move for Broadcom,” said Michael Cohen, an analyst at Pacific American Securities, who owns Qualcomm shares. “It gets them up to $200 million and at the same time strips away a powerful political ally from Qualcomm.”Shares of Broadcom rose $1.63, to $33.99, on Nasdaq. Qualcomm shares dropped $1.75, to $43.35.Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, is scheduled to decide by Aug. 6 whether to ban handsets that have Qualcomm’s newest chips because of the patent violation. The federal International Trade Commission approved the ban in June.Verizon Wireless will cease its efforts to overturn the ban and will withdraw its motion for a stay from the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, according to the statement.'"

"'07-07-20,'0','“Customers paid for ‘full service,’ as in a full tank of home heating oil,” said Mark J. Mershon, assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.’s New York office. “What they got was ‘self-service,’ as in the defendants’ self-dealing that skimmed gallons off each delivery and netted them a multimillion-dollar windfall. Theft is theft, whether it’s done by burglarizing your home or shortchanging your oil delivery.”The four businessmen accused of organizing the theft — Mr. Baldari and Michael David Hiller of Mystic Tank Lines, and Tonino Solimine and Eston Clare of T & S — all pleaded not guilty in federal court in Central Islip. They were ordered held pending a Monday hearing.Kenneth J. Kaplan, Mr. Baldari’s lawyer, said his client “has denied all of the allegations and he expects to be exonerated.” He said Mystic Tank lines is the largest fuel carrier in the Northeast, and that if it should cease operating, that could “affect the ability of airplanes to run.”“The government has indicated to us their concern about the continued efficacy of the company,” Mr. Kaplan said. Mr. Hiller, who is the company’s treasurer, also expects to be released and exonerated, said his lawyer, Michael S. Ross.As a rule, heating oil wholesalers buy their product from oil refineries, then store them in large facilities known as “racks,” which in New York are mostly in Brooklyn, according to the indictment. They then sell the oil to retailers, who sell to individual customers. Companies like Mystic and T & S, known as transporters, deliver oil and collect payment; they are not authorized to buy oil or sell it to individual customers.In this case, drivers’ meters were programmed to shortchange customers by 3 percent on every delivery, said an official close to the investigation. Their largest customers were big housing complexes like Starrett City, in Brooklyn, the official said.Investigators videotaped and recorded Mr. Hiller and Mr. Baldari “on dozens of occasions” discussing the scheme, according to a letter from Ms. Mauskopf’s office requesting that the two men be held without bail. The letter itemizes 60 payments the two received in the form of checks from 1998 to 2006, totaling $7,944,972.32.Mystic Tank Lines, which advertises itself has “the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic’s premier bulk carrier,” has a fleet of 300 vehicles, according to its Web page. The Web site says that its drivers undergo random drug and alcohol screening, and face a “ ‘zero tolerance’ policy for the slightest infraction.”“Perhaps the feature of this business of which I am most proud is our ‘human touch,’ ” reads a message to customers from Mr. Baldari.The company operated under voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from June 2004 to December 2006, declaring $22 million in debt and $12 million in assets.It is unclear what relationship the two oil companies — or the two cases — have to each other. The indictment in the case against the T & S Trucking Corporation lists Mr. Solimine as the company’s chief executive and sole shareholder; Mr. Clare acted as his office manager. They are charged with embezzling heating oil beginning in 2000 and reselling it for $25 million.“Mr. Solimine intends to fight these charges because he is innocent,” said Joel Winograd, his defense lawyer. “He is a person who came here from Italy at a young age. He worked hard to make the American dream, building the company from one truck and three employees to 40 trucks and 140 employees.”Mr. Winograd said his client had $500,000 in cash — which was seized by investigators on Thursday — because people in Italy do not trust banks.The inspector general of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority investigated Mystic Bulk Carriers, a related company, in the early 1990s after receiving allegations of a similar scheme, according to documents and a former high-ranking official in the office who oversaw the inquiry.According to the allegations, the company had trucks with secret internal tanks that enabled them to pump fuel from the truck into the secret tank, with the tank’s meter showing the fuel was being pumped into the customer’s tank, the official said at the time.The authority’s investigators were never able to substantiate the allegations.Mystic’s name was not new to the F.B.I, according to documents and several law enforcement officials. Since the early 1990s, three high-ranking Luchese crime family turncoats have said that the company made monthly payments of $2,000 a month to the crime family’s hierarchy, according to the documents.One law enforcement official said it was unclear whether the payments were because Mystic was being extorted or was paying tribute, in essence, working under the auspices of the crime family, but no charges were ever leveled against the company or any of its officers for any crimes involving Luchese crime family figures.One document, an F.B.I. debriefing report of a former underboss, Anthony Casso, said the relationship between the Luchese family and a company official dated to about 1980, when the report said he was involved in an oil scheme with members of the Gambino crime family that netted the mobsters a total of $100,000.The report said that after a meeting between the two families, it was resolved that after the deal with the Gambinos, the company would remain under the auspices of the Luchese family. Mr. Casso has never testified as a witness because federal prosecutors tore up his cooperation deal after they concluded he was an unreliable witness.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','WASHINGTON, July 19 — A federal district judge on Thursday dismissed a civil suit brought by Valerie Wilson and her husband seeking damages from Vice President Dick Cheney, his former chief of staff and two others for the disclosure of Ms. Wilson’s role as an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency.The judge, John D. Bates, said that while the suit raised “important questions relating to the propriety of actions taken by our highest government officials,” there was no statutory or constitutional way for the plaintiffs to obtain damages.Ms. Wilson and her husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, maintained that the disclosure was punishment for Mr. Wilson’s public assertions, based largely on a trip he took to Africa for the C.I.A., that the Bush administration had justified the invasion of Iraq by distorting intelligence about Iraqi efforts to acquire unconventional weapons. The leak, the suit said, prematurely ended Ms. Wilson’s career with the agency and put the entire Wilson family in danger.Defenders of the administration have said it had a legitimate interest in rebutting Mr. Wilson’s criticism, partly by raising with reporters the question of whether it was his wife, as an employee of the C.I.A., who had gotten him the Africa assignment.Judge Bates’s opinion carefully recounted the events behind the case, including discussions of Ms. Wilson’s identity by the four defendants: Mr. Cheney; I. Lewis Libby Jr., then the vice president’s chief of staff; Richard L. Armitage, then deputy secretary of state; and Karl Rove, President Bush’s senior political adviser.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','For the first half of the year, China said its economy grew at a pace of 11.5 percent, far outpacing analysts’ and government projections after two years of double-digit growth. The government had forecast that the economy would grow about 8 percent this year and had promised moves that would help ease the country’s widening trade surplus.But economic growth is stronger than ever, and the trade surplus surpassed $112 billion in the first half of 2007, up about 85 percent from the period a year earlier.In Washington, members of Congress are trying to put greater pressure on China to revalue its currency and import more American goods to reduce the two countries’ trade gap.China has been reluctant to move too quickly to lift the value of the currency, fearing the effect on businesses, and the government has not succeeded in reducing its trade surplus, particularly with the United States.Another concern was underlined Thursday when Beijing announced that inflation had reached its highest level in years. Consumer prices jumped at a 4.4 percent rate in June, almost entirely from rising food prices.The prices of eggs and pork have increased more than 20 percent in the last year, largely because of tighter grain supplies and the outbreak of a swine ailment called blue-ear pig disease, the government said. The disease is also known as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome.Many analysts say that inflationary pressure may be even greater when measured by a broader range of goods, and that this could signal real problems for the country, particularly if food prices continue to rise.“This is not benign,” said Hong Liang, an economist at Goldman Sachs. “In a developing country, this gets back to wages very quickly.”The problem remains how to tame China’s growth, a boom that began at less steep rates 20 years ago.No major economy in the last century has grown at the pace now under way in China. The 11.9 percent growth in the second quarter was the fastest since 1995, when China said its output increased 12.5 percent. China is on pace to overtake Germany this year as the world’s third-largest economy, behind the United States and Japan.“Even if we are very bullish on China,” Ms. Hong at Goldman Sachs said, “if they grow above 10 percent, there’s going to be a problem.”The government has tried dozens of measures in the last few years, including interest rate increases to slow the economy, moderate export growth and tame a wild stock market. But most have either failed or succeeded only moderately.Mr. Gong at JPMorgan said China was already signaling that it would allow the yuan to appreciate more quickly in the second half. He said China should import more agricultural products from the United States, which could help ease the trade deficit and also help slow rising food prices.Ms. Hong, however, expressed worries about an economy growing at an ever-faster pace when measured month to month. “The government needs to tighten policy and slow the economy,” she said. “Hopefully they can find some new tricks.”'"
"'07-07-20,'0','A South Korean businessman living in Manhattan has been charged with lying repeatedly to the F.B.I. during a secret four-year counterintelligence investigation into Korean spies operating in New York.As presented in a 28-page affidavit filed on Tuesday and released yesterday, the case against the businessman, Park Il Woo, is a rare glimpse into the covert world of foreign spies and the agents who pursue them. The often cryptic affidavit said that Mr. Park, also known as Steve Park, met and spoke several times in the last two years with officials of the South Korean consulate and United Nations mission in New York, gave them information in exchange for money, then denied knowing the officials when questioned by the F.B.I.Mr. Park, 58, is a legal resident of the United States whose ostensible business, the affidavit said, is the importation of a Korean rice liquor known as soju. He has been living in the country 20 years. He was arrested Wednesday and released yesterday on $155,000 bail after a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan.If convicted, he faces a maximum of 15 years in prison.Deirdre Von Dornum, Mr. Park’s lawyer, said he had not been charged with espionage. But Edward O’Callaghan, chief of the Terrorism and National Security Bureau of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan, said the government may yet charge Mr. Park with being a spy.Since 2003, the counterintelligence division of the F.B.I. has been investigating what the affidavit called “certain individuals acting as agents of South Korea without having notified or registered with the proper authorities.” Under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, anyone in the United States acting on behalf of a foreign government in a political or semi-political capacity must inform the Department of Justice.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','The results were announced after the stock market’s close. Shares declined 2 percent in after-hours trading, after rising 59 cents, to close at $31.51 in the regular session.“It was a pretty robust quarter,” said Charles Di Bona, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. “There were no surprises and they cleared the air on all the near-term issues.”Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research, said the stock was most likely down because some investors were still looking for Microsoft to continue the heady growth of its early days. “The company did well despite being a mature company in a mature market with falling prices,” he said.For the fiscal year, Microsoft posted revenue of $51.12 billion, a 15 percent increase over the prior year. Earnings for the year were $1.42 a share, or $1.49 excluding one-time items.“Our results this quarter cap off an extremely strong fiscal year for the company,” said Christopher P. Liddell, Microsoft’s chief financial officer. “We have healthy core businesses and are strategically investing in growth opportunities.”For fiscal year 2008, Microsoft raised its forecast for earnings by a penny a share, to a range of $1.69 to $1.73, and for revenue by about $300 million, to $56.8 million to $57.8 million.Microsoft executives said the company expected to earn 38 cents to 40 cents a share on $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion in sales during the first quarter, on the high end of Wall Street’s forecast of 38 cents a share on revenue of $12.51 billion.Strong momentum in Microsoft’s core products continued through the fourth quarter. Revenue in the Client unit, which includes Windows, increased 14 percent, to $3.81 billion. Sales of Microsoft Office 2007 increased 20 percent in the fourth quarter to add $600 million to Microsoft’s revenue.Much of the growth was driven by large-volume business customers, the company said. Colleen Healy, senior director of investor relations, said in an interview that renewals of long-term contracts were up 25 percent, a sign of continued growth.The company incurred a charge of $1.06 billion for the anticipated cost of repairing a hardware defect in some of its Xbox 360 game consoles, a problem that may have affected as many as a third of the 11.6 million units sold.Earlier this week, Microsoft announced that its top gaming executive, Peter Moore, was leaving Microsoft to run the sports division of Electronic Arts, the independent video game publisher, though company executives denied that his departure was related to the Xbox’s engineering problems. Don Mattrick, a former Electronic Arts studio chief, will take Mr. Moore’s job at Microsoft.Microsoft’s online business reported an increase in sales but a widening loss, as it continued to battle Google and Yahoo.The division’s loss in the fourth quarter grew to $239 million from $187 million in the period last year.Ms. Healy said the revenue in the division had met Microsoft’s goal, as the company recorded a 33 percent increase in advertising.Microsoft’s server and tools division posted sales of $3.08 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $2.69 billion a year ago.'"

Excluding expenses like stock-based compensation, profits were $1.12 billion, or $3.56 a share, below the $3.59 a share that analysts expected.Google’s executives said they were satisfied with the company’s performance.“We were very pleased with how Google did this quarter, especially with revenue growth in a seasonally weak quarter, and with what appears to be an increase in rates of user traffic growth,” Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, said in an interview.Mr. Schmidt said that a larger-than-expected hiring spree, as well as a change in the way the company accounts for bonuses, had contributed to the higher expenses. Google added 1,548 workers in the quarter, or about the same as in the first quarter, to end the period with nearly 13,800 employees.“We will watch this area very closely in the future,” Mr. Schmidt said.Google, which is now larger than any of its rivals, is growing about seven times faster than Yahoo and twice as fast as eBay.Still, as the company has continued to grow, its rate of growth has decreased. Second quarter year-over-year revenue growth, for instance, was 125 percent in 2004, 98 percent in 2005, 77 percent in 2006 and 58 percent in the most recent quarter. But that is not what worries analysts, for now. Mr. Rohan called it the “smoothest deceleration I have seen.”Google has to spend on new businesses to keep the growth rate aloft. But if it spends too much, Wall Street punishes the stock.“Eventually, yes, you can’t keep growing at the same pace,” said Christa Quarles, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners. “That’s why the ‘what’s next’ question gets asked.”Google still earns the overwhelming majority of its revenue from text ads that appear next to search results and on many sites across the Web. But Google has been spending heavily in variety of areas including online video, with its purchase of YouTube; software applications that compete with Microsoft’s; radio, television and newspaper advertising; mobile phone technology; and a vast network of data centers that could become a platform for delivering the next generation of computing applications. But these efforts have yet to contribute to Google’s bottom line.During a conference call between company executives and Wall Street analysts Thursday, the “what’s next” question inevitably came up.Omid Kordestani, Google’s senior vice president for global sales and business development, responded that it was too early to see any material affect from any of those initiatives. “Hopefully, in the next few quarters, we can shed more light on this,” Mr. Kordestani said.For now, the focus of investors has shifted to whether Google’s higher expenses are a temporary or longer-lasting issue.“What everyone is trying to get a handle of what we can expect for the subsequent quarters,” Ms. Quarles said. “The question was asked in nine different ways.” True to its no-financial-guidance policy, Google executives declined to answer.Some analysts took Thursday’s sell-off of Google shares in stride. “The stock has had a tremendous run over the last few weeks and months,” said Derek Brown, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald. “When you take a step back and consider what this business is doing, in absolute terms and relative to other leaders in the Internet sector, this business continues to shine.”'"
"'07-07-20,'0','Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, one of four Republicans to side with Democrats this week on the high-profile Iraq vote, agreed. “We can’t ignore it,” she said. “There’s tremendous dissatisfaction with the direction of the war – Republicans included.”And Senator Judd Gregg, a Republican of New Hampshire, the state that holds the first primary election of the 2008 presidential race, said the candidates will soon have to address concern over the war among Republican voters. “There’s a lot of frustration,” he sighed.The only Republican in the race vigorously opposed to the war, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, has drawn a surprising response from contributors and now has more money to spend than Senator John McCain of Arizona, who pleaded for more time in Iraq.So with the Republican presidential field turned upside down, and a wide-open battle for the party’s nomination unfolding over the next six months, could there suddenly be room for a candidate who opposes the administration’s war policy?That’s what Senator Chuck Hagel is trying to conclude.Mr. Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, has long been among the loudest Iraq critics in his party, a position that he said was “very, very lonely over the last four years.” His conservative voting record has been overshadowed, in the eyes of many faithful Republicans, by his forceful criticism of how Mr. Bush has handled the war.These days, Mr. Hagel is no longer feeling so alone.As he walked across the Capitol, one day after the latest chapter of the Senate war debate ended, he said he is receiving fresh encouragement to consider a presidential candidacy. He intends to study the landscape and disclose his intentions “in the next few weeks.”“There is no Republican presidential candidate with this point of view. There might be an opening for me on this,” Mr. Hagel said. “I’ve had three very significant Republican fundraisers come to me this week, all of whom said I should look at running.”He declined to name the fundraisers, only saying: “They are three Bush people, not committed to any candidate yet. You would recognize two of the names, clearly.” With a smile, he added, “Of course I’d need more than three.”Mr. Hagel conceded being stung by the negative reaction to a March 12 news conference in Omaha, when he announced – after significant fanfare – that he had made no decisions about his future. Since then, even during the war debate, he has maintained a decidedly lower profile as he contemplates whether to seek re-election, run for president or step away from public office.“I think people have enough regard for me to know that I’m not a flake, that I’m a serious leader,” Mr. Hagel said. “Whether you agree with me or not – or whether you think I’d have a chance or not, that’s a different thing. But I don’t think anyone would doubt my sincerity to do a good job and do it right.”His fierce criticisms of the Bush administration have not always rested well with Nebraska Republicans. (He already has a primary opponent for his Senate seat, should he decide to seek re-election.) But Mr. Hagel said the mood of the country has clearly changed on the Iraq war, a palatable shift he could detect while marching in three Fourth of July parades this month.“I just assumed that I would be booed and called names,” Mr. Hagel said. “In those three parades, with tens of thousands of people, I had one guy scream at me, but he was drunk and it was about amnesty.”One day earlier, the senator called a town meeting in Nebraska to share his views on Iraq. A crowd of 300 people gathered. “I expected I was going to get roughed up pretty good,” he said. “But there was an overwhelming response toward me.”That doesn’t mean, of course, that the hate mail to his Senate office has entirely stopped. (It hasn’t.) And it doesn’t mean that Republican primary voters are ready for a candidate like him. (Even if he could raise the money, he concedes, it may not be.)But it does provide him enough of a reason to not foreclose the idea entirely.“It’s not a no. I have not said no,” Mr. Hagel said, standing on the grounds of the Capitol, where one day earlier war protestors had stood vigil. “I don’t want to make a decision in the flurry of all this, the intensity of all this. Next month when we get a little break, I’ve got to sort it out. I’ve got to make a decision and I will.”'"
"'07-07-20,'0','Mr. Bloomberg encouraged people who were showered with the grime on Wednesday to bag their clothes and take them to a Con Ed collection truck for disposal. Con Ed said it would reimburse people for contaminated clothes.By midday yesterday, about 20 bags had been dropped off at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue, along with a weathered brown leather handbag and a wooden-handled black umbrella.“There was a little mud on my clothes, and I didn’t want to risk it,” said Jordan Lieu, 30, who had been inside a travel agency he manages at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue when the pipe exploded. He dropped off a shirt, pants, a belt, a briefcase and a pair of shoes, and made a claim of $650.The mayor said the cleanup would last through early next week. Fire Department crews were scheduled to start hosing down building exteriors in the “frozen zone” around Grand Central Terminal. And the United States Environmental Protection Agency said special street sweepers with high-efficiency filters were set last night to begin roaming the area vacuuming debris.The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene will order the owners of any buildings they believe have been contaminated to hire qualified inspectors to check their ventilation systems and interior spaces for asbestos. If contamination is found, the owners will have to hire a certified contractor to clean it before the building can be reoccupied.Kevin Burke, the chairman of Con Edison, said the company would reimburse building owners for any cleanup costs.Asbestos, typically used as an insulator or fire retardant, was linked in the 1960s to unusually high incidences of lung cancer and other life-threatening diseases in asbestos workers. In the 1970s, the government restricted its use.Still, much of the material remains in place in walls and ceilings and around underground pipes. Experts say it is not a danger as long as it is undisturbed and adequately contained.As the city moved quickly to clean up the area around Grand Central, there were some questions about whether enough was being done to protect people. Joel R. Kupferman, director of the New York Environmental Law and Justice Project, said the city should have explained whether the debris samples were analyzed using traditional methods or with sensitive electron microscopes, which would have given a more accurate reading.David M. Newman, an industrial hygienist with the New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health, a labor organization, said that while the health risk from asbestos exposure appeared to be low, “the people most at risk are the cleanup workers.”Inside the frozen zone, the presence of asbestos meant all workers should have been wearing respirators under city health department regulations. But not everyone did. As the day grew hotter, dozens of police officers, red-faced and sweaty, began pulling off their masks. Dozens of contract workers laying cable gave in to the midday heat and also pulled off their respirators.“It doesn’t seem necessary to wear them, they’re getting tests back and they’re negative, so it’s clear,” said a contractor who worked for Empire City Subway, a subsidiary of Verizon.Enforcing respirator rules is a touchy issue for the city. More than 8,000 cleanup and recovery workers from ground zero are suing the city for negligence, claiming they were not given the proper protective equipment or accurate information about risk at ground zero.'"
"'07-07-20,'0','AS newspapers suffer from falling advertising revenue, the McClatchy Company and Dow Jones & Company yesterday became the latest companies in the industry to report sharply lower second-quarter earnings.McClatchy reported earnings of $39.9 million, or 49 cents a share, compared with $44.1 million, or 94 cents, in the quarter a year earlier, when it was a much smaller company. The company more than doubled in size last year with the acquisition of Knight Ridder, whose papers have performed worse this year than those McClatchy held a year ago.Total second-quarter revenue was $580 million, up from $212 million.The company has a large presence in California and Florida, with The Sacramento Bee and The Miami Herald, where the real estate market has slumped badly. That caused a 19 percent drop from last year in revenue from real estate ads, and steep declines from related businesses like home improvement and furniture.“We expect declines in this revenue category to continue because of the difficult comparisons” to a strong 2006, Gary B. Pruitt, McClatchy’s chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. “We expect no substantial improvement in advertising trends before the fourth quarter.”Analysts have warned that newspapers appear to be going through a fundamental change, with advertising shrinking fast despite a growing economy, as readers and advertisers migrate to the Web.'"

"'07-07-21,'0','Selig said that if Bonds’s chase stretched past the weekend, he would decide after Sunday whether he would shadow him. Bonds will most likely not start Sunday; after that, the Giants return home for seven games at AT&T Park.Selig, who held an impromptu press conference in the fourth inning, said it was “common sense” for him to be at Miller Park. He said he did not speak with Bonds and had no plans to meet with him. Selig, who is a friend of Aaron’s, said he had not spoken to Bonds in a long time. He offered no reason for the lack of communication.“Well, it’s just the way it’s worked out,” Selig said.Because Bonds has been suspected of using performance-enhancing substances, Selig was asked if he considered Bonds’s homer total legitimate. Selig dodged the question and said, “I’m not passing judgment on anything.”If Bonds managed to hit No. 755 or No. 756 with Selig in attendance, would he stand up in his suite and cheer, or sneak into the bathroom to avoid having to salute such a polarizing player?“Whatever happens, happens,” Selig said. “My reaction will be, look, he’s closing in on the record. If he hits them here, he hits them here.”Selig offered no details about how Major League Baseball might celebrate Bonds’s achievement, or if it would. Selig said any celebration would be handled by the Giants.Unlike Selig, Bonds was not chatty. When Bonds was approached by a reporter in the visiting clubhouse at Miller Park, he placed a finger over his lips to indicate that he was not speaking. When the reporter tried to speak with him, Bonds repeated his actions. At the time, fewer than 20 reporters were in the room.But the Brewers said they expected 150 reporters, photographers and camera operators for the game Friday, a number that swelled once Bonds hit two homers Thursday against the Chicago Cubs. Bonds had been hitless in 21 at-bats and had not started for three days before that.“You saw a different player,” Giants Manager Bruce Bochy said.In Chicago, Bonds hunkered down and studied videotapes of his recent at-bats, in which he had struggled, and of earlier at-bats when he was swinging well. Bonds split the screen and studied the swings side by side to search for any flaws. He discovered that he was opening his hips too early, which was limiting his power.Once Bonds detected what he was doing wrong, he worked to rectify it during batting practice. Bonds took his remodeled swing into Thursday’s game and produced instant results with two homers and six runs batted in.Bonds left the trainer’s room Friday with his right hand pressed against his lower back. He sat down at his locker and put white tape on three maple bats, laid them on the rug and compared their height and weight.When Bonds carried the three bats to the dugout, in one meaty hand, he said, “These bats are getting heavier by the day.”Bochy noted that he was not alive to see Babe Ruth play and did not play against Aaron, but he compared the electricity when Bonds bats to what it must have been when those Hall of Fame sluggers were crushing homer after homer. He said that fans, even the ones who boo Bonds, understood that they were watching a player who was about to become the new home run king.Other than Bonds’s fly ball to deep center in the seventh, he did not feel much Friday. Selig called it a “beautiful night” for a game and said it was the “right thing” for him to attend. Because Bonds is starting one more game here and needs three homers to make history, Selig will soon have to say if he thinks it is right for him to follow Bonds.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','To help businesses shuttered by the steam explosion, Robert W. Walsh, the commissioner of the city’s Small Business Services Department, said the city would be offering interest-free $10,000 loans. Mr. Walsh said about 125 street-level retail shops were affected by sealing the area near the blast.But the loans from the city and reimbursements from Con Edison may cover only a fraction of the actual economic losses.“They are going to end up denying all of those applications,” said Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, referring to requests for reimbursements. Mr. Gianaris, who represents neighborhoods in Queens affected by last July’s nine-day blackout, said, “We learned that the hard way.”Con Ed paid out $13.8 million on 40,478 claims from that power failure, Mr. Olert said, but Mr. Gianaris contends that those payments were far from sufficient.The city has not yet produced an estimate of the blast’s economic effect, though John Tepper Marlin, a former chief economist for the city comptroller’s office, said the lost business income could be between $10 million and $30 million through Thursday night.Leo Goswami, 50, who owns a news shop, Optimo, at 334 Lexington Avenue, just up from East 39th Street, said he was already racking up losses.“The nutshell is that for small-business owners, this is an economic disaster,” he said as he stood in front of his shop. “Our margins are so small, it takes a month to recover for every business day lost.”Mr. Goswami, who said he has not missed a day’s work since he opened 20 years ago, guessed that he was losing $1,000 a day. Theo, 57, and Stelios Groutas, 54, brothers who own Scotty’s Diner next door at 336 Lexington Avenue, said their daily losses topped $5,000. Raj Najpal, who owns Bombay Grill, at 344 Lexington, said he was losing about $2,500 every day his restaurant was shut.Con Edison said yesterday that it had restored steam service to 13 of the 18 customers who lost steam power in the explosion. It expects to restore steam to the rest over the next few days. Mr. Olert said the company’s crews would start working inside the crater today, once the red tow truck that fell in it is removed. City officials said they were uncertain when the area closest to the crater would return to normal.The driver of the tow truck, Gregory McCullough, remained in critical condition at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital yesterday.A woman who was believed to have been with him in the truck cab, Judith Bailey, 31, suffered less serious injuries and was in far better condition but also remained hospitalized at NewYork-Presbyterian. They apparently were returning from the Bronx, where they dropped her car off, and were heading to Brooklyn, where she lives.Shortly after 3 p.m. yesterday, Ms. Bailey was seen walking down a corridor of the eighth-floor burn unit accompanied by an female friend or relative. She seemed to move without pain, and politely declined to comment.Once Mr. McCullough’s truck is removed, Con Ed plans to stabilize the gas and power lines around the site and then replace the damaged parts of the ruptured steam main. Afterward, the company will begin analyzing the damaged parts to learn what caused the explosion, Mr. Olert said.Engineers from the state Department of Public Service, which oversees utilities, have begun a preliminary investigation into the explosion, said Mr. Denn, adding that they would go into the crater as soon as possible. The engineers will report their findings to the Public Service Commission. “They are very qualified to review and make determinations to try to reconstruct what happened,” he said.For business owners on the Midtown blocks now sealed off by police tape, the wait for answers and reimbursement continues.Mr. Goswami managed to open his shop yesterday, even though it is in the restricted zone. He sold newspapers or bottles of water by fetching the goods and then handing them to customers over the police tape. He said he was desperate to make even a few dollars to offset his losses.Mr. Goswami’s monthly rent for the shop is $3,000, the Groutases’ is $16,000, and Mr. Najpal’s $9,700. They all live in different neighborhoods in Queens, but have formed a tight friendship over the years by working on the same Midtown block.Theo Groutas was especially worried about being closed over the weekend, usually his most lucrative time. He and his brother have been fielding calls from their 25 workers.“Savings? I have no savings, I’ve been using my Visa,” Mr. Groutas said. “To have money, I have to work.”'"
"'07-07-21,'0','“But the game has changed,” Mr. Franciosi told reporters after Chrysler and union leaders participated in the customary handshake ceremony to open contract talks. “What wasn’t anticipated then was the Japanese transplants, and whether we like it or not, they set the baseline. Being nonunion operators, they set the labor cost floor.”Chrysler, which fell behind the Japanese carmaker Toyota last year to rank as the fourth-largest seller of vehicles in the United States, says it pays nearly $30 an hour more for labor than Japanese automakers do. Including pensions, health care and other benefits, each U.A.W. worker is compensated more than $70 an hour.Labor costs for Toyota, Honda and Nissan in the United States are less than $50 an hour.The Detroit carmakers have been trying to eliminate pattern bargaining for years, arguing that their circumstances should be considered separately. But the union has resisted, saying that its members deserve equal treatment.“Pattern bargaining is part of the history of our union, and we intend to have a pattern agreement,” the U.A.W.’s president, Ron Gettelfinger, said Friday.This time around, though, the companies are in vastly different positions, not only in comparison with the last contract negotiations in 2003 but also relative to each other.Ford lost $12.6 billion last year, the worst performance in its 103-year history, and has mortgaged most of its assets to finance its restructuring. G.M., which lost $10.4 billion in 2005 and $2 billion last year, was profitable in the first quarter of 2007. Chrysler lost $1.5 billion in 2006 and is being taken private by the equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, which agreed to buy the division from DaimlerChrysler.“The traditional pattern bargaining that went on in the auto industry, that’s out the window,” said Gary N. Chaison, a labor relations expert at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. “I don’t think identical patterns, or even very close patterns, are really possible anymore. Each of the Big Three is unique now.”In 2003, the union strayed somewhat from its usual operating procedure, choosing to talk simultaneously with all three carmakers rather than selecting one as a target, but the result was three virtually identical pacts.Mr. Gettelfinger declined to say whether he considered any provisions of the current contract, which expires Sept. 14, to be off limits. “You go into negotiations with an open mind,” he said, “but we do have issues that are important to us.”Neither Mr. Gettelfinger nor Chrysler officials would discuss their opinion on creating a health care trust, called a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, that could free the three carmakers of $100 billion in long-term health care liabilities. The idea of a trust came up during prenegotiations, and the U.A.W. recently agreed to such an arrangement at the Dana Corporation, a bankrupt parts supplier. But Mr. Gettelfinger said it was “not a precursor for any other settlement negotiations.”While some union members might see that sort of deal as another in a series of sacrifices, Mr. Franciosi disagrees. “Creativity and innovation are not concessionary,” he said. “It’s coming up with creative approaches to the issues that drive costs.”The U.A.W. sees health care as a national problem, not a burden that its members should have to bear. A booklet the union distributed to reporters Friday posed the question, “Can the problem of rising health care costs be solved at the bargaining table?” with this response: “No. America’s health care crisis is a national problem that requires a national solution. It cannot be resolved with any one industry or employer through labor negotiations.”Mr. Gettelfinger is scheduled to open talks on Monday with General Motors and Ford. The staged handshakes during Friday’s ceremony at Chrysler were re-enacted a second time because so many photographers and television camera operators were on hand, a sign of the enormous importance being placed on these negotiations.Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, and Mr. Gettelfinger, both dressed casually, spent a moment joking together before Mr. LaSorda said simply, “We want a settlement,” according to those who witnessed the ceremony. Chrysler officials barred reporters from attending, limiting them to a question-and-answer session afterward.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','Because these final two operas with their grueling lead roles were performed on successive nights, the production had two different couples playing Brünnhilde and Siegfried. Leonid Zakhozhaev in the title role of “Siegfried” may have a rather grainy and undersized heldentenor voice, and his singing was sometimes rough and approximate. On the other hand, he made it through this absurdly challenging role, singing with unflagging energy and projecting the dense impulsiveness of the godly young hero. The soprano Olga Sergeeva, who sang Brünnhilde in the “Walküre” I attended last Saturday, was in shakier vocal condition for the demanding final scene of “Siegfried.” The gleam in her tone often turned strident, though, as before, there were sensitive and courageous aspects to her performance.Larisa Gogolevskaya took over as Brünnhilde in “Götterdämmerung,” offering a blazing, raw and impassioned account of the role. She seemed so determined to vanquish listeners with the intensity and cutting power of her singing that no one would care about the dicey pitch and hard-edged tone. Through sheer determination she pulled it off, though if she keeps this up she will not be singing the role much longer.There is a leathery quality in the voice of the hardy tenor Victor Lutsuk, who sang Siegfried in the final opera. Still, he gave an ardent, muscular and incisive performance, though he tired noticeably by the death scene.Evgeny Nikitin, a chilling Wanderer in “Siegfried,” was back on Thursday night as Gunther. Other standouts were Zlata Bulycheva as Erda in “Siegfried” and Mikhail Petrenko’s earthy Hagen and Valeria Stenkina’s vulnerable Gutrune in “Götterdämmerung.”For the final two operas the production, jointly conceived by Mr. Gergiev and the set designer George Tsypin, was as baffling as it was in the first two. Still, “Götterdämmerung,” I thought, came the closest of the four stagings to realizing the conception, which strives for a timeless, placeless mythological aura while drawing on imagery from the folklore of the Caucasus Mountains, including Mr. Gergiev’s native Ossetia.In the opening scene of “Götterdämmerung,” the Three Norns have subcontracted the task of spinning the rope of destiny to a roster of limber dancers clothed in reddish, greenish, tattered tights, who hold a long, shiny chain broken up with globular balls, like some mythological rosary. The staging here had primordial allure. Many scenes in this “Ring” production people the story with dancers and mysterious silent figures. Sometimes it can seem fussy and silly. When Siegfried forges the broken pieces of the magic sword, rather than presenting a literal bellows and forge, the flames are depicted by dancing creatures with phosphorescent headdresses. Still, seeing Siegfried lamely waving a towel at the flame dancers to stoke the fire, and then picking up the molten hot sword using only a dishrag was a little ridiculous.Many “Ring” productions have chosen to give a more modern look to the Gibichung family — Gunther, his sister Gutrune, their half-brother Hagen and all their vassals — the first real mortals we meet in the story. This one depicted them as an ancient mythological clan with painted bodies and tribal gowns. Though a novel and potentially rich idea, the actual costumes were hard to take seriously. With his long tribal dress, his tight shirt with jagged stripes and his capped head, the menacing Hagen looked a little like a Navajo princess.And as usual in his work, Mr. Tsypin had an alarming way of asking singers to perform while standing precariously on set pieces, most noticeably here in the final duet of “Siegfried.” The scene is staged atop one of the massive totemic mummylike figures that hover over the production. Poor Mr. Zakhozhaev and Ms. Sergeeva had to sing some of the hardest music in opera while striding across this narrow, lumpy set piece, tilted at a 45-degree angle. You kept worrying that they were going to stumble and fall.What “Ring” production has not provoked debate and divided audiences in recent years? Many aspects of this one, especially the music-making, will linger.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','PEORIA, Ill., July 20 (AP) — Shares of Caterpillar tumbled Friday as the company posted a 21 percent drop in profit, missing Wall Street expectations amid weak North American machinery sales and higher-than-expected operating costs.The company’s shares, which had risen to record highs over the last month, fell $3.78, or 4.35 percent, to $83.20. Shares, which have traded in a 52-week range of $57.98 to $87, dipped to $78.26 before rebounding in late trading.Caterpillar, one of the world’s largest makers of heavy equipment, said net earnings fell even though revenue rose 7 percent, to $11.36 billion — a company record for the second quarter — from $10.61 billion last year.The company cited sluggish housing construction and engine sales in North America, higher-than-expected operating costs and a planned reduction in inventories for the decline.Caterpillar earned $823 million, or $1.24 a share, in the three months ended June 30, down from $1.05 billion, or $1.52 a share, in the period last year, when the company posted its strongest earnings in at least four decades.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','That I thought this during the Mass Effect demo is not a knock on the game. Just the opposite. Mass Effect, which is forthcoming from Microsoft, seems to play a bit like an epic interactive movie where the player controls the combat, but, more important, helps direct the story. And the story, not the fighting, seems to be the heart of the game.As in many games, the basic idea in Mass Effect is that you have to save the galaxy from an all-encompassing evil. Fair enough. But without giving away the plot, the depth comes from the fact that you may have to sacrifice friends and decide just what your values are and what the greater good really means.In Santa Monica the game’s makers showed a scene involving those sorts of choices that literally shut up the whole room. When it was over, a half-dozen normally chatty game writers sat there for a few moments digesting what we had just seen.It was powerful, but it was still no Mahler.Much the same could be said of Fallout 3, another of my favorite games from E3. Like its esteemed predecessors, the third installment of the franchise is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where you, the player, decide how to carve out your place in a horrible new version of America. Put simply, you can be a good guy or a bad guy and there will be plenty of heart-rending, suffering people to either assist or exploit.That is, of course, what makes games distinctive among media: within the confines of the system it is the user who decides what happens next, whether that means turning left or right in Pac-Man or deciding whether to blow up a town for pay or save it in Fallout 3.But merely providing choice is not the same as generating a deep emotional response.Yes, when my spaceship in Eve Online gets blown up, I am upset. Yes, when my guild in World of Warcraft beats the latest demon, I swell with pride. Yes, when I finally slay that mythical beast in God of War I feel both insightful and dexterous.But in all of those situations, I as a player know that the outcome was largely my own doing. And so the emotional connection is more akin to a golfer who shanks a drive or hits a gorgeous approach shot; sure you get happy or sad, but ultimately you can’t be emotionally surprised because you did it to yourself.And that’s what the best linear media do far better than any game: they generate a response through emotional surprise. I can distinctly remember the first time I read “The Sound and the Fury,” and it was precisely the same kind of revelation as the first time I saw a real Turner painting and the first time I saw the Grateful Dead and the first time I heard Mahler at the Concertgebouw.Noninteractive media can produce those sorts of surprises precisely because they are not interactive: Every single note, letter, speck of paint or frame of film has been placed precisely in a specific order to produce a specific effect.

"'07-07-21,'0','“The New Frontier,” an epic comic book story that follows Superman and other heroes of the DC Universe from the end of World War II through the cold war, will soon be seen in a new incarnation: a 70-minute animated film.The saga, which began as a six-issue series in 2004, has been published in one hardcover and two softcover collections and has inspired a line of action figures. Next week those attending the 38th annual Comic-Con International in San Diego will get a preview of “Justice League: The New Frontier,” a direct-to-DVD animated film from Warner Home Video due out in February.“The New Frontier” would be one of the first three adult-oriented DC projects to be given the straight-to-DVD treatment and will sit alongside similar full-length adventures of Superman and Batman; DVD collections of the animated television series “Superfriends,” “Justice League” and “Batman Beyond,” among others, have been popular with fans. “I was kind of floored by the call and the fact that this was being done,” said Darwyn Cooke, 45, the writer and artist behind the comic. The news came from Gregory Noveck, the senior vice president of creative affairs at DC Comics, a unit of Time Warner. The company wanted to produce a series of direct-to-DVD animated films that would, unlike its previous efforts, more closely follow the source material.For Mr. Cooke, who was a storyboard artist on the WB network’s Batman and Superman animated series of the 1990s, working on the film version of “The New Frontier” was like coming home. “Having worked down there in the studio and been involved in similar projects, I couldn’t help being excited and moderately terrified,” he said during a telephone interview. “Experience in the industry informs you of the millions of ways things can go wrong. All of a sudden, it’s your baby.”One of the biggest challenges was paring down the story from just under 400 pages into a 70-minute film. The comic book version has a sprawling cast and multiple subplots, from a nearly 40-page sequence that depicts the fate of the Losers, a squad of soldiers from DC’s war comics, to following Hal Jordan’s path from reluctant fighter pilot in Korea to his discovery of the power ring that will turn him into Green Lantern. In between, Wonder Woman and Superman debate their own involvement in Southeast Asia; the Martian Manhunter arrives on Earth; and John Henry rises in Tennessee to combat the Ku Klux Klan.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','The grind of major championship golf seemed to take its toll on the field, and even players with placid personalities lashed out.Henrik Stenson swiped at a tee marker in anger after a poor drive on No. 8, and Ernie Els let loose some acidic words after missing a birdie putt on No. 9.“Normally, I keep it all in, but I thought, ‘Maybe let me get everything out,’ ” Els said. “I didn’t see too many small kids, so hopefully, they all closed their ears. That’s what a major does to you. Nobody’s made of rock out here.”Woods, the player considered closest to granite, cracked on his first tee shot of the day, when he steered an iron shot left of the fairway and toward the Barry Burn running along the rough. A gaggle of children gave chase, but the ball was soon in the water, leaving Woods with a double bogey.His round included several more poor swings, including a tee shot that flared right on No. 15 and a bogey after a wayward approach shot on No. 18.“It’s not like you don’t make bad swings in major championships,” said Woods, who is seeking his third consecutive British Open title. “That’s part of the deal.”Asked if he believed he could still win, he said, “At one over par, I’m not out of it.”Mickelson, who lost the Scottish Open in a playoff last week, will miss the weekend for the fourth time in his last five tournaments. He made a double-bogey 6 on No. 18 and finished at six-over 148, two shots more than the cut of four-over 146.It was the first time he has missed two cuts in majors in the same season. In May, he withdrew from the first round of the Memorial with an injured wrist and followed with consecutive missed cuts at the United States Open and the AT&T National. At the British Open, which has long been the major he struggles at most, his putter let him down.“I thought I was playing a lot better than this,” said Mickelson, who will next play in the limited-field Bridgestone Invitational starting Aug. 2, one week before the start of the P.G.A. Championship. “I was starting to play some pretty good golf last week. I don’t know why I have putted these greens so poorly.”He later added: “I think my next tournament doesn’t have a cut. That will be nice.”García had no trouble advancing into the weekend, but he is eyeing a bigger prize. He has not won a major in 35 attempts, but a switch to a belly putter this month has invigorated him.After shanking his approach shot into the fans at No. 1, he hit a deft chip shot from the long strands of grass and tapped in a short putt for par. His long putter saved him on the last hole, too, when he rolled in a 10-footer and clenched his fist.“I’m pretty happy the way I’m standing right now,” said García, 27, who admitted to being nervous when the second round began. “Today was a nice day for me. I knew that all eyes were looking at me. It was good to still post a good, solid round and keep myself up there.”Through two rounds, García has appeared comfortable on a course where he needed 172 shots and missed the cut at the British Open in 1999. He stands either two rounds from his greatest triumph or another disappointment.“I’m trying, I can tell you that,” García said. “I’m trying to give myself good options and good looks at winning majors. That’s all I can do.”'"
"'07-07-21,'0','In a case that is reverberating in the art world, the New York Police Department said yesterday that a video-game designer and budding filmmaker committed suicide last week and that her companion, a rising art star, has been missing since Tuesday.The filmmaker, Theresa Duncan, 40, who has also drawn attention for her writings on cultural topics, committed suicide in their East Village apartment on July 10, the police said. Her companion, Jeremy Blake, 35, a well-regarded artist known for digital animation that blurs the line between abstract painting and film, has been missing since his clothes were found on a beach in the Rockaways on Tuesday evening, they added.Found with the clothes was a note that made reference to Ms. Duncan, the police said.Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police department, said that Mr. Blake was last seen taking off his clothes and then walking into the water at Beach 102nd Street on Tuesday. Police scuba teams have searched the waters off the beach since then, Mr. Browne added, but have not found a body.Lance Kinz, a director of the Kinz, Tillou + Feigen gallery, which represented Mr. Blake, said that Mr. Blake and Ms. Duncan had been together for 12 years and were very close. The two collaborated, along with another artist, Karen Kilimnik, on “The History of Glamour,” a 1999 animated film that spoofed the fashion world. The short movie, which Ms. Duncan wrote and directed, was called “gentle” and “very funny” by Stephen Holden of The New York Times in 2001.Mr. Kinz said that Mr. Blake told him he had discovered Ms. Duncan’s body after she committed suicide. He said he had spoken with Mr. Blake after her death and that, while devastated and grieving, “he seemed to be very much in control and to be coping with it.”Mr. Blake, whose work has been shown at three Whitney biennials and at a solo exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2005, is scheduled to have an exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington in late October, partly in collaboration with Malcolm McLaren, the musician and designer.'"
"'07-07-21,'0','And, China acknowledged that several Chinese companies had exported seafood tainted with banned antibiotics to the United States.Regulators said the seafood suppliers were not properly registered with the government’s quality inspectors. China’s announcements came amid a flurry of government activity this month aimed at combating growing criticism of the Made-in-China label, including reports about defective tires, exploding cellphone batteries and toys coated with lead. Friday’s actions, though, took direct aim at the companies implicated in two scandals with particular resonance.“The Chinese government pays great attention to addressing flaws in product quality, especially the quality of food products,” Li Changjiang, a top official at the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine, said at a Beijing news conference on Friday, according to Xinhua.Beijing has adopted a double-barreled response. On the one hand, the government promises sweeping changes in food and drug regulation. It has begun nationwide quality and safety inspections and recently banned the use of diethylene glycol as a thickening agent in toothpaste. Last week, it executed the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, convicted of corruption charges.At the same time, Beijing has disputed claims that Chinese exports are particularly dangerous, insisting that 99 percent of its exports meet quality standards and accusing the foreign media of exaggerating the extent of safety-related issues.The government expressed new interest in the Taixing Glycerine Factory after The New York Times in May traced the Panama poison to the factory, located near the Yangtze delta in eastern China.The company had falsely labeled the poisonous compound as 99.5 percent glycerin, a safe ingredient used in food, medicine and other products, records show. The Times found that the factory was not certified to make glycerin.Afterward, Chinese authorities reopened a dormant investigation of the company, culminating in its decision Friday to close the Taixing Glycerine Factory.“The Food and Drug Administration welcomes any action by Chinese authorities that will help ensure the safety of the products that are made in China,” said Julie Zawisza, a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration.By Friday night, the company’s sign at the factory’s entrance had been taken down. “The factory has gone out of business,” said Ding Yuxi, who worked at the company for 10 years and was guarding the compound.At the news conference in Beijing, Mr. Li, the Chinese regulator, said nothing about any criminal prosecutions involving the factory, nor did he mention the state-owned company, CNSC Fortune Way, that exported the poison with false papers.Although regulators said they would no longer allow products with misleading labels, Chinese officials still blame a Panamanian importer for changing the product’s paperwork to make it appear more suitable for human consumption. The F.D.A. said no one would have died if Chinese companies had properly identified the product’s contents.Dr. Jorge Motta, a prominent Panamanian physician who helped identify the poison that was killing so many patients, said the plant’s shutdown was overdue.“Every day that this factory remained open made me fear that this terrible problem that occurred to us could occur to someone else,” Dr. Motta said. “Knowing that people responsible for all the suffering that we had in Panama continued to function without any questioning was not only painful but also an insult to my country.”With President Bush and Congress now pressing for stricter controls on United States imports, China is not only announcing crackdowns on unsafe products. It is also taking its case to the negotiating table. Next week, European Union officials are expected to meet for high-level talks about the quality and safety of China’s exports. Less than a week later, American officials are expected to arrive in Beijing for meetings aimed at improving quality and safety inspections and to resolve what has begun to look like a trade dispute between the two countries.Late last month, the F.D.A.. blocked the importation of some Chinese seafood. China responded last week by banning some pork and chicken products from American producers, saying they, too, were tainted with banned chemicals.'"

"'07-07-22,'0','One can agree or disagree with the criticism of Clarence Thomas both in Orlando Peterson's review of ""Supreme Discomfort"" (June 17) and in the book itself. However, as a resident of Savannah, I object to the disservice done to the low- income but quite safe and respectable community of Pin Point, Ga., by calling it ""a scene of rural desolation,"" ""black life in the rural South at its bleakest"" and ""this sociological nightmare."" By the way, the crab factory is long gone, but it provided a living for some when few other opportunities were available. The owner kept it operating as long as possible for the sake of the employees, but eventually succumbed to economics. I am sure the good citizens of Pin Point feel fortunate in comparison with residents of the ghettos of large cities, especially in the North.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','Niall Ferguson, with whom I have differed repeatedly over his defense of imperialism, needlessly tries to start a fight between Paul Collier and me in his review of Collier's ""Bottom Billion"" (July 1). I applaud Collier's excellent new book and thank him for including kind references to my own work therein. The very idea of the poverty trap as being critical in Africa, a concept at the core of ""The Bottom Billion,"" has likewise been a core theme of my own writings on Africa, indeed a central theme of my book ""The End of Poverty."" The notion of different factors contributing to the poverty trap is also a theme common to both our research efforts. For my part, I have worked hard to introduce in the academic literature and policy discussions the idea that poverty is involved in vicious circles related to violence, natural resources, landlockedness and other geographic factors, and poor governance.In its prescriptions, ""The Bottom Billion"" argues for major increases in aid to African countries with governments that are making determined efforts to achieve economic development. It emphasizes support for rural development in countries with few other prospects for economic growth, and underscores the overstated nature of ""good governance"" policy prescriptions that ignore underlying economic realities in the poorest countries. It argues for practical measures to boost exports and promote trade. These are just a few of the many issues on which Collier and I have found our work to be mutually reinforcing.While Collier and I might reasonably debate some points of detail, we are in agreement on a vast majority of issues, and I have enormous respect for his continuing contributions. It's unfortunate that Ferguson, for unknown reasons of his own, tries to contort the literature and evidence into a false debate, rather than focusing on the practical issues needed to tackle the scourge of extreme poverty.The writer is the director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','David Zabriskie, a native of Salt Lake City who rides for CSC, was also fined for his actions during the third stage. He said he understood that it was not appropriate to be “hanging out in front of the fans,” but added, “The problem is that in the Tour de France, it’s hard to find a stretch of road with nobody on it.”Bathroom breaks are normally an issue early in a stage. In the Tour de France, daily stages start at noon or 1 p.m., and for close to an hour before the start, riders are involved with signing in or prerace ceremonies, leaving them little time for anything else.“Mostly, the time you need to go is when you’re not going very fast and you’re not sweating, and therefore all the fluid you’ve consumed doesn’t have anywhere else to go,” said Sean Yates, a former rider who won a time-trial stage in the Tour de France in 1988. Yates, an Englishman, is now a sports director for the Discovery Channel team.In cycling, of course, there is a protocol for going to the bathroom. The favored method is to stop along the side of the road. The most important aspect is not to be left behind. A rider who stops can find himself with a long day ahead if the pack rolls away and he is forced to chase the group without any teammates to help him.As a result, riders tend to go in bunches. Many wait for some of the team leaders, or even the overall leader in the yellow jersey, to decide to go first.Riders use that tactic because it is considered bad form to attack — that is, to try to break from the pack — while riders are stopped. In auto racing, an opponent’s pit stop is used as an opportunity to gain ground, but in cycling, that sort of strategy will simply earn a rider the enmity of his peers.“Sometimes,” Yates said, “the yellow jersey can abuse that privilege, if his team is under constant attack,” pulling over to try to slow down the group.Sometimes, riders do attack. Yates and Rodriguez noted that riders on the 11-man breakaway during Wednesday’s stage gained some of their time advantage while the leaders were stopped.“What’s really stressful is when you have to go from the bike” while it is moving, Zabriskie said.That maneuver is performed by hiking up one leg of the bike shorts and pivoting the hips sideways to allow for relief. Sometimes a rider’s teammate will help steady his handlebars during that maneuver, making sure he is upwind.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','The Times has gone through troubles before and come out fine. A 1976 cover story in Business Week questioned the savvy and ability of Arthur Ochs (Punch) Sulzberger, the father of today’s publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and said the family might be forced to sell if profits couldn’t be increased. The Times went on to some of its best years.Today’s Times is caught in unprecedented changes sweeping through an industry whose readers and advertisers are decamping from the printed newspaper to the Internet, where content is mostly free and the advertising rates that support newsrooms are comparatively low. Consider what has happened in a little more than a year: The nation’s second-largest newspaper publisher, Knight Ridder, was sold and partially broken up. The third-largest, the Tribune Company, is taking itself private in a complex transaction that puts a real estate developer in charge and puts most of the risk on the employees. And the Bancroft family, owners for more than 100 years of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, America’s premier business daily, appears likely to sell to Rupert Murdoch, a tabloid king best known for a down-market approach to journalism.Amid all this turmoil, aggressively reported and analyzed in The Times, there has been a comparative silence in the paper about its own owners, their challenges and their strategy. From Arthur Sulzberger Jr. to Landon Thomas Jr., a business reporter who has been assigned stories about The Times, everyone acknowledges a fundamental truth: It’s hard to write about yourself.If you say something positive, some readers think you’re “kissing up to your bosses,” said Bill Keller, the executive editor. If you write something negative, he said, some readers think “the end is nigh, because it must be worse.”When Hassan Elmasry, a London-based portfolio manager for Morgan Stanley, was urging outside shareholders of the New York Times Company earlier this year to withhold their votes for board members in protest against management, The Wall Street Journal published a 3,200-word front-page article on the controversy. It captured the drama of a test of wills between Elmasry and Sulzberger and reported that Elmasry’s campaign had forced the board of the Times Company “to embark on some difficult discussions,” including a brief consideration of taking the company private.A month later, on the eve of an annual meeting at which a majority of outside shareholders withheld their votes for the company’s slate of directors, The Times published its own dutiful 1,500-word look at the Elmasry-led uprising. The article touched the proper bases without the flair, drama and probing quality of The Journal’s piece.Thomas, the reporter, said, “It’s not as if we pulled any punches.” But, he added, writing about The Times and its owners was “not the easiest thing to do.”“I wouldn’t hold that story as one of the best I’ve ever written,” he said. “It’s not.”Sulzberger said, “The Journal can be a little more speculative about us than we can.” The Times has to be doubly careful because everything in an article about itself is interpreted by readers as inside knowledge, he said.You might say it was easy for The Journal to do its story because it would be all too happy to report about troubles at a competitor. But The Journal article was solid and revealing. You could also say that, while The Journal has been aggressive in its coverage of the bid for its parent company by Murdoch — a veritable barbarian at the gates of the newsroom — the newspaper was not equally diligent in reporting on the financial performance and management issues that made Dow Jones vulnerable in the first place.Here is an article about itself that The Times should write: The Bancrofts, like the Sulzbergers, were proud through generations to own a company that produced lower profits than other newspapers but great journalism. But, with their stock price depressed and the younger generation uninvolved in the business and dissatisfied with shrinking returns, the family appears to have broken apart.How united are the Sulzbergers, and what holds them together? Who is the next generation, and how committed are they to the family’s long practice of investing heavily in quality journalism, even in rocky financial times? There are 27 members of the fifth generation. How much room is there for them in the business, and how are they being prepared to assume leadership?A conversation with Sulzberger indicates how interesting the story would be — and how sensitive and difficult to get.Sulzberger said there are two huge differences between his family and the Bancrofts. The voting control of the New York Times Company is held in a single Ochs-Sulzberger trust administered by eight family members, six of whom must approve major decisions. The single trust helps keep a close family united, Sulzberger said. The Bancrofts’ Dow Jones holdings are divided among a complicated web of separate and sometimes overlapping trusts, potentially making it easier for family members to go in different directions.Sulzberger wouldn’t talk about his family’s trust in any detail, like how the family divides the income. The trustees include Sulzberger, his cousin Michael Golden, who is vice chairman of the New York Times Company and publisher of The International Herald Tribune, and at least one member of the fifth generation.The Bancrofts aren’t involved in the operations of Dow Jones. A member of the Ochs-Sulzberger family has been publisher of The Times since Adolph Ochs bought it, and other family members, like Golden, have been involved in the business at many levels.Of the fifth generation, two work at the company now, one as a manager in information technology and the other in strategic planning, a job he started just last Monday after working in sales at The Boston Globe, a Times-owned newspaper. Others are elsewhere in journalism, including Sulzberger’s son, Arthur, a reporter at The Oregonian in Portland. One is a reporter for The Associated Press, and a third is on the business side of the agency that runs the operations of Denver’s two daily newspapers.“Over a half-dozen members of my generation worked at The New York Times,” Sulzberger said. “We were all trained in different ways, whether it was in ad sales, whether it was in production or whether it was in the newsroom, as in my case.” Family members were told, “You need to make your mistakes and grow,” he said, “and that’s the same thing we’re doing with the next generation, both inside The Times and outside of it.”Even as he is reluctant to reveal much more about the dynamics of his family, Sulzberger recognizes that it’s a legitimate story. “People rightly want to know, will the center hold,” he said. “It will.”Keller said, “This is a story we could do.” I hope he does.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','With Nascar’s Nextel Cup drivers enjoying their last weekend off this season, it is a good time to take a look at some numbers.If it was not obvious from the capacity crowds, the solid television ratings (although they are down a bit) and the popularity of the stars, Nascar’s new statistical analysis shows just how much competition has improved during the sport’s modern era.In 1970, 22 of the 48 races had only one car on the lead lap at the end of the race.From 1970 to 1979, one car finished on the lead lap 110 times. In the ’80s, it happened 16 times. In the ’90s, only twice. And since 1994, when Geoffrey Bodine was the lone car on the lead lap at North Wilkesboro, it has not happened at all.It also used to be common for Nascar drivers to win by more than one lap. In 1973 at Darlington, David Pearson finished 13 laps ahead of the runner-up, Benny Parsons. In April 1977, Cale Yarborough won at Bristol by seven laps over the second-place Dick Brooks, and led all but four laps in that race.Since then, margins of victory have steadily decreased. Unimpeded runs to the checkered flag are a fading memory. Not so for close finishes.'"

"'07-07-22,'0','Charles Isherwood is not alone in his dismay with the lack of a recognizable name for the area of Manhattan between East 23rd and East 32nd Streets, from Madison Avenue east to the river. In fact, the area does have a name: Rose Hill. The name is derived from the pre-revolutionary Rose Hill farm that lasted into the 19th century, and essentially occupied the same geographic area discussed in the article.The incorporated Rose Hill Neighborhood Association, of which I am president, has lobbied since the 1990s for the area to be officially designated with the historical name. At a general meeting of Community Board 6 in 1997, C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, supported the move to name the community, and pledged the support of her office behind the effort. Numerous merchants and apartment houses use the Rose Hill name today.So, Mr. Isherwood, our community does have an identity, but we have not yet been able to persuade the Taxi and Limousine Commission to fill in the “brown slab” located on the maps in New York’s taxis with the correct name.In “Think Over the Box” (Op-Ed, July 15), Ted Balaker and Sam Staley state: “Drivers aren’t letting their cars sit in the cross hairs of oncoming traffic out of spite. They don’t relish the cursing, honking and fist shaking aimed at them. Like everyone else in the standstill, they’d prefer to be moving.”This is either far too kind or willfully ignorant.Many, if not most, drivers who block the box are selfish people who just “have” to be the last car through the green light. This is particularly true of cab drivers, delivery trucks and, sadly and most annoyingly, both city and long-distance buses.The reality is that many drivers are simply not patient enough to stop at a green light even if they see that it is unlikely that they will be able to proceed down the next block. Indeed, it is the “cursing, honking and fist shaking” of drivers behind them that “force” otherwise patient drivers to block the box even if they had no intention of doing so.Ted Balaker and Sam Staley argue that “clogged intersections represent a symptom of congestion’s root cause: political neglect.” That is certainly an argument that Robert Moses would embrace. But it continues the same catastrophic assumption that he made throughout his career: that unending increases in automobile traffic are not only acceptable, but also preordained.“Political neglect” is not the root cause of congestion, but certainly contributes to our current inability to resolve it. No matter what you do to speed up traffic, congestion’s “root” cause is still the same: too many cars.In East Harlem During the BlackoutErnesto Quiñonez’s article about the 1977 blackout as he lived it in East Harlem (“The Diaper Caper and the Small-Dog Scam,” July 8) called to mind my own experience of that day in that neighborhood.I was working for the city and had been detailed to go up to East Harlem to investigate the scattered reports that looting was in progress. A black city limo and driver were placed at my disposal, and we arrived on Third Avenue near 116th at about 8 o’clock the morning after the night of looting.In fact, “shoppers” were still going into and out of the stores on the block, although by then most of the merchandise was gone.A bleary-eyed police sergeant approached me, with a detail of four officers, as I got out of this black car with it red light flashing. He thought, wrongly, that I was someone important.“Commissioner,” he said, “we’ve been here since 1 a.m. We arrested a couple of guys pulling down a gate with a car, but most of the time, we’ve just tried to see that no one was hurt. What else could I do? What else could I do?”He was almost in tears.Now, I was a deputy director in the Economic Development Office — nowhere near anyone in his chain of command, but he needed an answer.“Sergeant, you did right,” I replied. I felt a like a priest giving absolution. “I’m calling downtown on the radio, and I’ll tell them you guys need some relief up here.”We walked around for a while, and talked about the vast difference between this blackout and the one back in 1965. I left with a series of nightmare images, and a renewed respect for the New York City cops.“Air Albany on Your Dime” (editorial, July 15) highlights a glaring problem in Albany.While Congress has taken extensive measures to make the line between government business and non-government business more transparent, Albany has taken no such steps.It is almost as if the part-time Legislature wants to comply with part-time ethics.A bright-line rule requiring a clear publicly declared demarcation between official business and political or private business is essential.Fund-raising should not be done in the Capitol, Legislative Office Building or district offices. Members and staff should reimburse the state for any other use of state resources that are used for anything other than official business. Period.Airfare should be paid for rides on state aircraft when any non-official business is conducted at the destination. Additionally, even state-issued cell phones should be used only for official business.Transparency and accountability are not that difficult to attain. The public deserves no less.The writer is former staff member of the New York State Assembly.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','Before a Mets-Yankees game at Shea Stadium in May, ESPN’s cameras caught a moment that quickly became a YouTube classic. As a groundskeeper unrolled a tarp, a black kitten with white paws that had been hiding inside was flung into the air. Landing spread-eagled but on its feet, the cat froze for a moment, then bolted. Both cat and groundskeeper looked slightly freaked out.The incident represented one of at least three times this year that a cat has made an unscheduled appearance on a Mets broadcast. In April an orange-and-white tabby bolting across the outfield prompted the broadcaster Gary Cohen to ask on the air: “Do you know how many cats there are living in the bowels of Shea Stadium? Where are they all going to go when they take this place apart in a couple of years?”Bryan Kortis, a founder of Neighborhood Cats, a rescue group, estimates that 20 to 40 feral cats live in Shea. And their history goes back a ways. A cat can hardly be seen in Shea without fans’ recalling the famous incident in 1969 when a black cat ran onto the field, mythically dooming the Cubs and clearing the way for the Mets’ first World Series championship.The cats of Shea have even been known to pay visits to the broadcast booth, as one did this season. “It was a little scared, and I think we surprised it,” Mr. Cohen said. “It jumped around a little bit and then disappeared. Where it came from and where it disappeared to, I don’t know.”The team’s scheduled move in 2009 to its new home, to be known as Citi Field, has put a question mark over the cats’ future. But Sandra DeFeo, an executive director of the Humane Society of New York, has a plan that would allow them to be a fixture at the new stadium. The Humane Society advocates spaying or neutering the cats, giving them the appropriate inoculations and then placing them, healthy, at Citi Field when the time comes.Ms. DeFeo said her group had approached the team about managing the feral colony at Shea but had not heard a response. “I think they’ll want us to do it, because they like having the cats around,” she added, “but they don’t have a way of managing them in between homes.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','XtremeMac, Belkin and Griffin Technology are three companies that have been licensed by Apple to introduce stereo audio recorders for video iPods and second-generation Nanos. I tried out three of their devices, all released during 2006, with my video iPod.All three were easy to use, produced clear sound and added only a few ounces to the iPod’s weight.Each of the three recorders has its strong points.The MicroMemo ($59.95), from XtremeMac, has a built-in speaker to preview recordings without using a headset. It comes in two sizes: a small version that fits the Nano, and a slightly larger version that fits neatly at the bottom of the video iPod.The TuneTalk Stereo ($69.95), from Belkin, comes in only one size and has no built-in speaker — you’ll have to use headphones if you want to check the sound. But it does have highly useful accessories: a USB cable that can be plugged into a nearby computer to charge it while it is recording, and a plastic stand to hold the TuneTalk upright during recording. The stand collapses to the size of a thick credit card to tuck into a wallet when not in use. The manual has many useful tips.Like Belkin’s product, the Griffin iTalk Pro ($49.95) has two internal mikes for stereo recording, although it does not have the USB cord for recharging or the collapsible stand.No matter which recorder you choose, you need to keep an eye on storage space and battery capacity, depending on the type of iPod you are using. Space is less likely to be a concern with video iPods, because they store recordings on a commodious hard drive of 30, 60 or 80 gigabytes. But power may be an issue. Recording stereo sound in a stream draws heavily on the battery, just as working with a video stream does, said Chris J. Doran, United States retail merchandising manager at XtremeMac in Weston, Fla.“You’re spinning the hard drive all the time on high-quality setting,” he said, making it likely that users will deplete the battery long before they reach the end of the storage space.Nanos don’t have this problem because they record to flash-memory drive, a more accommodating medium. “You get between 10 and 12 hours of high-quality recording on the Nano,” Mr. Doran said, in contrast to 3.5 to 5 hours on the MicroMemo for video iPod.But storage capacity for a Nano that has, for example, 8 gigabytes of memory, most of it already filled with tunes, is more likely to be a worry.“If you are concerned about storage space, record at lower quality and get about four times as much recording on the same space,” Mr. Doran said.ALL the recording devices let users toggle between high-quality stereo recording and lower-quality, space-saving monaural settings.The hard drive on the video iPod creates a recording issue, too. It makes audible clicks as it goes about its business, and some of these sounds are occasionally picked up by the internal mikes used in some recording devices. If these clicks are bothersome, all the units have a port so that an external mike with a 3.5-millimeter plug can be used instead, reducing hard-drive noise.Voice-recording accessories make up only a small slice of the huge iPod market, but even a small slice can be substantial.“We have sold over 100 million iPods,” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president for worldwide marketing for iPod and iPhone. “Any percentage of the 100 million adds up to a lot of customers.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','For instance, the Bush administration told the base-closing board that it would cost $780 million to close the base and move its resources. And to offset concerns among base-closing commissioners that moving Fort Monmouth’s research and development programs to northern Maryland would result in a “brain drain,” the administration initially said that 75 percent of Fort Monmouth’s work force would transfer to the new site.But on both of these claims, the administration was off — way off.The Defense Department now admits that the cost of moving Fort Monmouth is double what Secretary Rumsfeld claimed. The current cost estimate of $1.5 billion is causing many to question whether this revised monetary cost alone far outweighs any of the supposed benefits of closing the base.In addition, it is now estimated that only 18 percent to 20 percent of the work force — engineers, scientists and others who have invested years of their lives in technology to protect our troops in the field — will choose to make the move to Maryland. That means that more than 80 percent of this military expertise could vanish, setting back critical research and development for years.To make matters worse, it appears that the administration knew the initial numbers were inaccurate back in 2005, but shielded them from the public’s view, and, even worse, from consideration by the base-closing commission.It’s not just research and development that we should be concerned about. Fort Monmouth is the primary intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance center for the Army. It provides immediate intelligence to our troops in the field, protecting their lives and making them more effective in battle.At Fort Monmouth, engineers and scientists are creating the technologies that immediately help our troops survive in the Iraqi civil war and the brutal terrain of Afghanistan. Closing it would compromise the Army’s ability to fulfill its mission in these conflicts and throughout the war on terrorism and would needlessly put our troops in danger.A bipartisan group of members of Congress from New Jersey — Senator Robert Menendez and myself as well as Representatives Rush Holt, Frank Pallone Jr., Jim Saxton and Christopher Smith — have asked both the Government Accountability Office and Defense Department to investigate the administration’s false data and decision to close the base.We all understand the federal government’s need to save money and avoid redundancy. When it comes to how best to use property and resources, we know the Defense Department must make hard choices that balance people’s livelihood, family stability and budget constraints with the needs of our military.Congress supported the base-closing recommendations in 2005 precisely for these reasons. But Congress also believed at the time that the recommendations were based on solid evidence and data.With regard to Fort Monmouth, it is now clear that was not the case.So before we place our troops in the field in harm’s way, put thousands of people out of work, cost our state and our country millions of dollars and risk national and homeland security, let’s think again.The decision to close Fort Monmouth should be reconsidered and reversed.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','Your article “Sisterhood of the Walking Shoe” (July 15) was lovely. I read it early on Sunday after getting home from a, what else, morning walk. I also feel a part of a walking sisterhood, albeit a younger sisterhood — the walking women who are pushing strollers.We walk, alone or in pairs (larger groups are rare; coordinating nap and feeding schedules is no easy feat), with our bright-eyed babies for many of the same reasons you mentioned: a chance to exercise, breathe some fresh air, clarify thoughts, feel connected to our neighborhood, and organize our day.The best kind of walk, however, is one where we meet another like-minded, walking, stroller-pushing mom and become friends. It happened to me five years ago when I was so sleep deprived and itchy for grown-up company I practically accosted a woman I saw walking by with her 4-month-old. It worked: we walked for years and our daughters, now kindergartners, are still great pals, too.I usually find that writers for The Times do their craft well, and a reader benefits from the clarity and sometimes the beauty of their prose. “Sisterhood of the Walking Shoe” is more; it truly needs a hats-off bow. It is so well written, so significantly in tune with its subject matter and so full of Walt Whitmanesque charm that I was carried away. Thank you for the pleasure it gave me.A New York Band by Way of WestchesterFire Flies, the band that “took top honors” in the regional Emergenza Music Festival and will fly to Germany to compete at the festival’s international level, is currently, as you pointed out, “a New York City band.” However, Fire Flies can also be considered a Westchester band.'"

"'07-07-22,'0','Huntington’s housing law, and the Greens development deal, were among the first on Long Island to address the need for less expensive homes in a high-priced market. Many other towns and villages now have such laws, called inclusionary zoning. But the failures in Huntington illustrate the difficulties that developers and communities face.The town has sued the developer and the developer’s bond companies twice each; the developer has filed two lawsuits against the town; and the Fair Housing of Huntington Committee, a multifamily housing advocacy group, filed a motion in federal court last week to force the town to make good on the settlement of an earlier lawsuit.“The whole thing has turned into this big quagmire,” said Susan Lagville, executive director of Housing Help, a nonprofit agency. The town allowed 1,000 homes to be built on 279 acres, she said, “but very few affordable units and no affordable rentals, which we desperately need here.”Housing Help is part of a larger group called the Huntington Township Housing Coalition, which presented a report to the town board in May titled “Broken Promises at the Greens.” The report contends that the town is embroiled in costly legal action because it did not enforce its agreement with the contractor during construction of the Greens.The town passed a resolution in 2000 that required the developer to build the affordable units at the Greens and 200 one-bedroom units along Ruland Road, before officials would grant certificates of occupancy for the more expensive homes. Without the certificates, buyers of the more expensive units at the Greens could not legally move in.But because many early buyers had sold their previous homes to pay for their Greens units and were stuck waiting in hotels or living with adult children, the town decided to grant occupancy certificates even though the affordable homes had not been finished, said Frank Petrone, the Huntington town supervisor.That turns out to have been a mistake, Mr. Petrone added. “What went wrong here was the town, in proceeding and permitting the certificates of occupancy to be given, was dealing in good faith with respect to going forward with the project,” he said.The affordable homes were never finished. And now the developer wants to raise the price of the units, whose outer shells have already been built, by $40,000, to $165,000.Among those most determined to halt construction of the Greens project all along has been the Fair Housing of Huntington Committee, which in 2002 sued the town in federal district court in Islip. The claim was that the town was violating the federal Fair Housing Act by permitting market-rate housing construction, according to Joseph Rich, a lawyer with the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a group based in Washington that handled the Huntington lawsuit. The committee’s request for an injunction on the project was denied twice.The organization refiled an amended lawsuit in 2004 that focused on the one-bedroom homes planned for Ruland Road. It asserted that the plan discriminated against minority families, Mr. Rich said. In a settlement that did not involve the developer, the town agreed that 28 units at Ruland Road would have two bedrooms, making it possible for a small family to live there, Mr. Rich said.But the town has not yet officially approved the settlement, he added, and the group asked the court last week to force the town to do so.Meanwhile, there are still problems with the rest of the Greens development. Last December, the town sued for control of $13 million in bonds posted by the developer to ensure completion of the Greens.John Leo, the Huntington town attorney, said the town had received more than 200 complaints from residents about a lack of dry wells and sumps, causing pools of water in common areas that freeze in winter and pock the roads with potholes. The drainage problems have even prompted some residents to sue the developer on their own, Mr. Leo said. Six months ago the town, too, filed suit on the issue, seeking a court order to force the developer to make repairs, add dry wells and complete the affordable units.In return, the Greens at Half Hollow has sued the town twice, to reduce the numbers of dry wells and force a decision by the court on the price of the affordable units.John Harras, a lawyer for the developer, said SBJ Associates had “done everything we were supposed to do” with respect to roads and drainage, and had offered to work with town engineers to regrade parts of the Greens to address complaints. The Greens affordable units will be completed once a sale price is determined by the courts, Mr. Harras added. The Ruland Road homes would also be built once a plan is approved, he said.But until the lawsuits are resolved, the affordable homes at the Greens and at Ruland Road remain unbuilt.“The sum total of all of this,” said Ellen Schaffer, an assistant town attorney who has worked on the latest actions, “is we have a developer granted zoning to build over 1,000 market-price units who failed to produce any of the public benefits that were to come from the Greens.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','Q How does one check the financials of a co-op or condo building? I assume this is public information, but where does one go to check on the health of a particular building?A Arthur I. Weinstein, a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said the financial records of co-op corporations and condominium associations are not public records. But current owners, as well as those who are considering buying an apartment, can generally get information about the financial condition of a building.Most co-op proprietary leases and condo bylaws, Mr. Weinstein said, require the corporation or association to provide an annual financial statement. “That will give a basic picture of the financial condition of the building,” he said.Those who are considering buying an apartment, he said, should receive copies of any financial statements the seller has, and they should be able to get additional information by performing what is known as due diligence.“The buyer may conduct his or her own due diligence, but real estate lawyers who represent buyers follow established procedures that go a little further,” Mr. Weinstein said. This would include at least two or three years of financial statements and a copy of the original offering plan for the building and all amendments to the plan.The lawyer may also send questionnaires to the managing agent requesting detailed information about the building’s physical condition, owners who are in arrears on their maintenance or common charges, complaints made against or by the owner of the apartment, litigation in the building and pending capital projects, maintenance increases and assessments.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','Many of the ordinances in the region are general prohibitions against excessive whining or barking. In Westchester, the City of New Rochelle ran into trouble with its law in 1997 after a resident challenged a citation. A city judge ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not include details about time of day and duration of barking, and the city changed the law in 1998.“Many of these ordinances go back to the 1800s,” said the New Rochelle corporation counsel, Bernis Shapiro. “They’re just carried forward and they don’t get changed until an issue comes up.”In May 2006, Hillsborough Township in Somerset County passed an ordinance to specifically address barking, but no complaints have been filed since then, said Lt. Bill Geary of the Hillsborough Police Department. Other New Jersey towns, including Bloomsbury in Hunterdon County and Manville in Somerset, considered such ordinances but withdrew them after residents complained that they would be unenforceable.As for those who contend that a barking dog should be a low priority, Councilman Fusco said, “If the dog was next to your house, you’d sing a different song.”Mr. Fusco said he was confident that the ordinance proposed in Clifton would be supported by his fellow council members. At the same time, he knows that some residents may object.But David Axelrod, a groomer at Furrs N Purrs on Valley Road, said he did not think the measure was tough enough.“Thirty minutes is extremely generous,” he said. “There is no reason why a dog should be barking that long.”The ordinance says barking must be sustained to be illegal, and it bans excessive barking only from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m.Under the ordinance, a resident complains to the City Health Department, which sends a warning note. If the barking continues, the resident takes the complaint to municipal court, where fines can start at $250. Before a court date, the city would most likely try to resolve the matter through mediation, said the city attorney, Matthew T. Priore.Last year about a dozen warning letters were sent to residents about their barking dogs, Clifton officials said.Currently, residents can complain about barking under the city’s general noise ordinance, but they have to essentially prosecute the case in municipal court themselves, Mr. Fusco said. Under the proposed ordinance, residents would appear as a witness in a case presented by the municipal prosecutor.“The new ordinance, it — no pun intended — has some bite to it,” Mr. Fusco said.Eric M. Zwerling, director of the Rutgers University Noise Technical Assistance Center, trains police officers on noise complaints and writes municipal noise codes.“One of the things I say to the officers I train is that if people were fundamentally civil to each other, we’d all be out of work,” he said.Mr. Zwerling , the owner of a chocolate Labrador named Bosco, said he had his own appreciation of the barking problem.“A dog is barking for one of two reasons — either it needs attention or it is trying to alert you to something,” he said. “In either case, you should be attending to it.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','“Can I help you?” the student felt obliged to ask.“Course you can, Westie.” The man was holding out a pudgy hand. “I’m Chib Calloway. Thought maybe it was time we met. And judging by the way your jaw’s grazing the floor, I’d say you know my name.”“Then you know why I’m here.”Westie felt his knees trying to buckle. “No, I’ve no idea why you’re here.”Calloway chuckled and patted him on the shoulder. “The four extra guys on the team, Westie, where did you think they came from? The disguises and the shooters and the van. . . . ”“You?” The word was just barely choked out.“Me.” Calloway was studying Westie’s portfolio. Only two of the paintings had been hung; the others rested against a whitewashed wall. “I don’t know much about art,” the gangster said, as if apologizing, “except for the noble art, of course. Know what that is?”“That’s it: boxing. Closely followed by hammering, battering, kicking, gouging and knifing.” He turned and gave a smile. “Not so noble by the time it gets to that stage, of course.”“Look, Mr. Calloway, I just did what I was told. Nobody said you were part of the. . . . I mean, you’ve nothing to worry about, not from me.”Calloway straightened up and brought his face close to the student’s. “You saying it’s all down to your girlfriend?”“Your girlfriend sent a little warning. She says you want 20K on top — either that or another painting. She must’ve got the cellphone number from you, pretty boy.” A finger jabbed Westie’s chest. “Unless you’ve some other explanation. . . . ” Calloway began a circuit of the large room, taking care to step over the various cables. “These are dangerous times, you know. People get a bit greedy, a bit frantic, a bit crazy.”“I didn’t know she’d sent that text!”“But you knew she was thinking about it.” Calloway was strolling toward Westie again. “The pair of you had talked it over, hadn’t you?”“We thought maybe. . . . ” But the words died away as Calloway homed in on the student.“It’s good that we understand one another, because you’re going to do something for me.” The hand landed on Westie’s shoulder again, this time staying there. “We’re going to be a team.”“A team?” Westie’s mouth was so dry, he could hardly get his tongue working. There was juice in a carton on the floor next to him, but he didn’t think now was the right time.“Looks like those forgeries of yours did the business, young Westie. In my books, that means you know what you’re up to. So now you’re going to make me a few more.”Calloway nodded slowly. “Plenty more paintings in that warehouse.”“Don’t fret.” The gangster began to chuckle. “We’re not going to turn the place over again — do I look that thick?”“So you want them for yourself?”Westie started to relax a little. “Sure, I can do that. After all, what’s the difference between hanging a fake on your wall and owning the real thing?”“If the fake’s perfect, no difference at all,” Calloway agreed, lifting his hand from the young man’s shoulder.“Do you have a particular painting in mind? Doesn’t have to be from the warehouse — I can do you the Mona Lisa if you like.”Calloway laughed. “More than one, I’m afraid, and they all have to be locked away from public view.”Westie shrugged anyway. “So how many?” he asked.“Couple of dozen should do it.”Calloway’s face hardened, along with his voice. “You’ve a lot of making up to do, after that stunt your girlfriend tried to pull.”Westie raised his hands in surrender. “No problem,” he said. “Not for you, Mr. Calloway.” Watching the gangster’s features relax a little, he decided to ask a question. “By the way, which painting did you get?”“You mean from the heist? I got the Utterson, ‘Dusk on Rannoch Moor.’ How about you?”“A DeRasse,” Westie was able to say, despite the sudden queasy surge.The Utterson! Why did it have to be the Utterson?Allan Cruikshank was in his office at First Caledonian Bank’s HQ on George Street. The building was becoming cramped, but as it was listed as a historic building there was little way to renovate it to accommodate the 21st century. Allan’s office was half its original size, subdivided with a partition wall, and his only view was of a ghastly 1970s office block to the rear of the building. Along with everyone else at his level, Allan had financial targets to meet. His roster of High Net Worth clients hadn’t been performing of late, and he knew he should be making a few calls, maybe arranging lunches or pre-dinner drinks, the better to talk them into sticking some more of their money the bank’s way. He knew that, if asked, Mike Mackenzie would oblige, but then they would cease to be just friends; the transaction would sit between them, blocking everything.But who was Allan kidding? They were no longer “just friends.” They’d pulled off a heist together, and Allan now had something he’d always wanted — at least theoretically.He owned two paintings that First Caledonian, despite its muscle and its own extensive portfolio of art, could never have.And he hated it. He didn’t think it was simple cowardice that had persuaded him to give the paintings to Mike for “safekeeping.” It was just that they didn’t mean anything to him. He realized he would have been as happy with the reproductions. What was the difference? His fingers drifted over a nick on his chin. He’d been shaving this morning, not really concentrating. Hadn’t slept much either, not since Saturday. He tossed and turned and imagined himself in a police station, a courtroom, a prison.“You were a bloody fool, Allan,” he said out loud, then was jolted upright by an alarm bell ringing.The phone; it was only the phone. He picked it up.“Front desk, Mr. Cruikshank. There’s someone here to see you.” Allan’s appointment diary was open on the desk in front of him, empty till midafternoon. Allan knew what the receptionist was going to say, but still felt galvanized by her next words.“Name of Detective Inspector Ransome — shall I show him up?”“Can you tell him I’m in a meeting?” Allan waited while the message was relayed.“He says he’s happy to wait and he only needs five minutes.”“Then he can stay in the lobby. I’ll only be 15 or 20 minutes.” Allan slammed the phone down then picked it up again and called Mike at home. No answer, so he tried his cellphone. This time Mike picked up.“There’s a D.I. Ransome standing guard outside my office,” Allan blurted out. “Better get yourself over here.”“And what message would that send to the inspector?” Mike’s voice asked after a lengthy pause. “You’ve got to brazen it out, Allan.”“Why the hell is he here? Who’s been talking?”“We won’t know anything until you’ve talked to him. Have you got something you can take to calm you down?”“Maybe if someone whacked me with a hammer. . . . ” As the words left Allan’s mouth, he regretted them. He didn’t want Mike getting ideas, ideas he might share with Chib Calloway. He swallowed hard and took a nice, deep breath. “I’ll be fine, Mike. Sorry if I panicked.”“Call me when you’re done with him.” Mike’s voice was all steel.“Just be yourself, Allan. He’s not even part of the official investigation. Far as we know, he’s sniffing around anyone who knows Chib.”“Not yet, but I’m on his list, you can be sure of that.”Allan ended the call and took five more minutes to compose himself. Eventually, there was a knock at his door and he opened it to find himself face to face with D.I. Ransome.“Nice place to work,” was the detective’s gambit. The two men shook hands, and Allan gestured for Ransome to take a seat before returning to his own side of the desk. “Lot of expensive-looking art on the walls,” Ransome continued. “Down in reception . . . all along the corridors. . . . ”“First Caledonian has its own curator,” Allan informed him. “Our portfolio is worth in excess of 20 million.”Ransome gave a whistle. “Ever let the staff borrow something for a couple of nights?”“Not at the level of management I’m at,” Allan said with an attempt at a self-deprecating smile.“That comes under the heading of privileged information, Inspector.”“But you do know Mr. Mackenzie?”“Mike and I have been friends for a few years.”“And Charles Calloway?” Ransome broke off. “Sorry, you probably know him better as ‘Chib.’ ”“We ran into him at a wine bar.”“The one just along the road from here?”“That’s right.” Allan had been expecting a flipped-open notebook and a pen, maybe a hulking junior colleague standing like a silent sentry. But Ransome just sat there with his fingertips pressed together, one leg crossed over the other.“When you say ‘ran into him’ . . . ?”“I mean just that. He saw us looking at him, came to the table and gave a couple of growls and snarls.”Ransome raised an eyebrow. “I know that name.”“Professor Gissing was called in to identify the paintings found abandoned after that robbery.”Ransome gave a thoughtful nod. “So you didn’t speak to Chib at the auction?”“Just a couple of weeks back . . . and again, just along the road from here.”“I’d no idea Mr. Calloway had an interest in auctions,” Allan said, leaning back in his swivel chair and clasping his hands behind his head. Ransome just smiled and was thoughtful again.“You had a break-in here, now that I think of it,” he eventually said, as if to keep the conversation moving.“Rumor at the time was, Chib Calloway was behind it.”“Then he’s not very clever: we don’t have vaults full of bullion.”“All the same, there was another rumor he had someone on the inside.”“I’m not sure where this is leading, Inspector.”Ransome gave a shrug. “Would it surprise you, Mr. Cruikshank, to hear that your friend Mackenzie knows Chib Calloway?”“Were they?” This was obviously news to the detective. “Might start to explain why they’ve been catching up recently — I saw them at the National Gallery, and at that wine bar, and also at the auction.” Ransome leaned forward. “And Chib’s been to Mr. Mackenzie’s apartment at Henderland Heights. What does that suggest to you?”“Mackenzie collects art, doesn’t he? Someone at the auction house told me as much. Then he takes a known criminal on a tour of the National Gallery, after which they attend an auction together, checking the going rate for various artists. Doesn’t that tell you something, Mr. Cruikshank?”“Nothing.” Allan entwined his hands more tightly, willing himself not to leap from his chair and grab the cop by his throat. That might look suspicious, mightn’t it? Instead, he apologized for not offering Ransome a coffee or some tea. Ransome responded with a twitch of the mouth, then started rising to his feet.“There’d be immunity, you know,” the detective was saying. “I mean, I’m just thinking aloud here, but anyone who helped us grab Chib Calloway would be a hero, pure and simple. Anything that person had been covering up, we’d see the slate wiped clean. Anonymity, too — we’re hot on that these days for people who help take the likes of Calloway off the streets. . . . ” He paused at the door. “Nice meeting you, Mr. Cruikshank.” Then, tapping his wristwatch: “Told you I only needed five minutes.”And with that, he was gone. It was a further minute or two before Allan realized the man had left something on his desk: a business card with a cellphone number scrawled along the bottom.Mike Mackenzie had been staring at his cellphone, willing it to ring. But when it did, it was Laura Stanton rather than Allan.“Laura,” he said, trying to recall how he needed to act with her. “Look, sorry I walked out on you like that. I’ve been meaning to call and explain. . . . ”“Never mind that,” she was saying. “They’ve been doing the inventory at the warehouse.”“Just bloody listen, will you? They’ve found the gaps.”Mike’s brow furrowed. “But the paintings were in the van. . . . ”“Not those paintings! The others — the ones still missing — the ones the gang got away with!”“Got away with?’ he echoed, his head spinning. “How many are missing?”“Half a dozen so far, and they’re not halfway through the stock-check. A Fergusson sketchbook’s gone, too.” Then, imploringly: “If you had anything to do with it, Mike — if there’s anything you know. . . . ” Her voice drifted off.“You’ve got to go to the police. Either that, or make sure they’re returned.”“Easier said than done,” he muttered, but only after he’d ended the call. He tried Professor Gissing’s cell, but still no answer. “Lie low” had been Gissing’s advice; seemed the man was taking it to heart.Last week: Chib showed up unexpectedly at Mike Mackenzie’s apartment and told him to make sure that Allan didn’t crack. Westie’s girlfriend, Alice, demanded greater payment for Westie’s part in the heist. Laura Stanton, the auctioneer, told Mike that Inspector Ransome asked her about him, Allan and the professor. Ransome met with one of Chib’s henchmen and started putting some pieces together. (Photograph by Mary Kocol)Next week: Mike accuses Chib of double-crossing him.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','The yeshiva where I studied considers itself modern Orthodox, not ultra-Orthodox. We followed a rigorous secular curriculum alongside traditional Talmud and Bible study. Our advanced Talmud and Hebrew classes were interspersed with advanced-placement courses in French literature and European political history, all skillfully coordinated to prime us for the Ivy League. To try to be at once a Lithuanian yeshiva and a New England prep school: that was the unspoken motto of the Maimonides School of Brookline, Mass., where I studied for 12 years.That aspiration is not without its difficulties. My own personal lesson in nonrecognition is just one small symptom of the challenge of reconciling the vastly disparate values of tradition and modernity — of Slobodka and St. Paul’s. In premodern Europe, where the state gave the Jewish community the power to enforce its own rules of membership through coercive force, excommunication literally divested its victim of his legal personality, of his rights and standing in the community. The modern liberal state, though, neither polices nor delegates the power to police religious membership; that is now a social matter, not a legal one. Today a religious community that seeks to preserve its traditional structure must maintain its boundaries using whatever independent means it can muster — right down to the selective editing of alumni newsletters.Despite my intimate understanding of the mind-set that requires such careful attention to who is in and who is out, I am still somehow taken by surprise each time I am confronted with my old school’s inability to treat me like any other graduate. I have tried in my own imperfect way to live up to values that the school taught me, expressing my respect and love for the wisdom of the tradition while trying to reconcile Jewish faith with scholarship and engagement in the public sphere. As a result, I have not felt myself to have rejected my upbringing, even when some others imagine me to have done so by virtue of my marriage.Some part of me still expects — against the judgment of experience — that the individual human beings who make up the institution and community where I spent so many years of my life will put our longstanding friendships ahead of the imperative to define boundaries. The school did educate me and influence me deeply. What I learned there informs every part of my inner life. In the sense of shared history and formation, I remain of the community even while no longer fully in the community.If this is dissonance, it is at least dissonance that the modern Orthodox should be able to understand: the desire to inhabit multiple worlds simultaneously and to defy contradiction with coexistence. After all, the school’s attempt to bring the ideals of Orthodox Judaism into dialogue with a certain slice of late-20th-century American life was in many ways fantastically rich and productive. For those of us willing to accept a bit of both worlds, I would say, it almost worked.Since the birth of modern Orthodox Judaism in 19th-century Germany, a central goal of the movement has been to normalize the observance of traditional Jewish law — to make it possible to follow all 613 biblical commandments assiduously while still participating in the reality of the modern world. You must strive to be, as a poet of the time put it, “a Jew in the home and a man in the street.” Even as we students of the Maimonides School spent half of every school day immersed in what was unabashedly a medieval curriculum, our aim was to seem to outsiders — and to ourselves — like reasonable, mainstream people, not fanatics or cult members.This ambition is best exemplified today by Senator Joe Lieberman. His run for the vice presidency in 2000 put the “modern” in modern Orthodox, demonstrating that an Orthodox Jewish candidate could be accepted by America at large as essentially a regular guy. (Some of this, of course, was simply the result of ignorance. As John Breaux, then a senator from Louisiana, so memorably put it with regard to Lieberman during the 2000 campaign, “I don’t think American voters care where a man goes to church on Sunday.”) Whatever concerns Lieberman’s Jewish identity may have raised in the heartland seem to have been moderated, rather than stoked, by the fact that his chosen Jewish denomination was Orthodox — that he seemed to really and truly believe in something. His Orthodoxy elicited none of the half-whispered attacks that Mitt Romney’s Mormonism has already prompted in this electoral cycle, none of the dark hints that it was, in some basic sense, weird.Lieberman’s overt normalcy really is remarkable. Though modern Orthodox Jews do not typically wear the long beards, side curls and black, nostalgic Old World garments favored by the ultra-Orthodox, the men do wear beneath their clothes a small fringed prayer shawl every bit as outré as the sacred undergarments worn by Mormons. Morning prayers are accompanied by the daily donning of phylacteries, which, though painless, resemble in their leather-strappy way the cinched cilice worn by the initiates of Opus Dei and so lasciviously depicted in “The Da Vinci Code.” Food restrictions are tight: a committed modern Orthodox observer would not drink wine with non-Jews and would have trouble finding anything to eat in a nonkosher restaurant other than undressed cold greens (assuming, of course, that the salad was prepared with a kosher knife).The dietary laws of kashrut are designed to differentiate and distance the observant person from the rest of the world. When followed precisely, as I learned growing up, they accomplish exactly that. Every bite requires categorization into permitted and prohibited, milk or meat. To follow these laws, to analyze each ingredient in each food that comes into your purview, is to construct the world in terms of the rules borne by those who keep kosher. The category of the unkosher comes unconsciously to apply not only to foods that fall outside the rules but also to the people who eat that food — which is to say, almost everyone in the world, whether Jewish or not. You cannot easily break bread with them, but that is not all. You cannot, in a deeper sense, participate with them in the common human activity of restoring the body through food.And yet the Maimonides School, by juxtaposing traditional and secular curricula, gave me a feeling of being connected to the broader world. Line by line we burrowed into the old texts in their original Hebrew and Aramaic. The poetry of the Prophets sang in our ears. After years of this, I found I could recite the better part of the Hebrew Bible from memory. Among other things, this meant that when I encountered the writings of the Puritans who founded the Massachusetts Bay Colony, I felt immediate kinship. They read those same exact texts again and again — often in Hebrew — searching for clues about their own errand into the American wilderness.In our literature classes we would glimpse Homer’s wine-dark sea, then move to a different classroom and dive headlong into the sea of the Talmud. Here the pleasure of legal-intellectual argument had no stopping place, no end. A problem in Talmud study is never answered, it is only deepened. The Bible prohibits work on the Sabbath. But what is work? The rabbis began with 39 categories, each of which called for its own classification into as many as 39 further subcategories. Then came the problem of intention: What state of mind is required for “work” to have occurred? You might perform an act of work absent-mindedly, having forgotten that it was the Sabbath, or ignorantly, not knowing that action constituted work. You might perform an action with the goal of achieving some permissible outcome — but that result might inevitably entail some prohibited work’s taking place. Learning this sort of reasoning as a child prepared me well, as it has countless others, for the ways of American law.Beyond the complementarities of Jewish learning and secular knowledge, our remarkable teachers also offered access to a wider world. Even among the rabbis there was a smattering of Ph.D.’s and near-doctorates to give us a taste of a critical-academic approach to knowledge, not just a religious one. And the teachers of the secular subjects were fantastic. One of the best taught me eighth-grade English when he was barely out of college himself, before he became a poet, a professor and an important queer theorist. Given Orthodoxy’s condemnation of homosexuality, he must have made it onto the faculty through the sheer cluelessness of the administration. Lord only knows what teachers like him, visitors from the real world, made of our quirky ways. (In the book of poems about his teaching years, we students are decorously transformed into Italian-Americans.)In allowing us, intentionally or not, to see the world and the Torah as profoundly interconnected, the school was faithful to the doctrines of its eponym, the great medieval Jewish legalist and philosopher Moses Maimonides. Easily the most extraordinary figure in post-biblical Jewish history, Maimonides taught that accurate knowledge of the world — physical and metaphysical — was, alongside studying, obeying and understanding the commandments, the one route to the ultimate summum bonum of knowing God. A life lived by these precepts can be both noble and beautiful, and I believe the best and wisest of my classmates and teachers come very close indeed to achieving it.For many of us, the consilience of faith and modernity that sometimes appears within the reach of modern Orthodoxy is a tantalizing prospect. But it can be undermined by the fragile fault lines between the moral substructures of the two worldviews, which can widen into deep ruptures on important matters of life and love.One time at Maimonides a local physician — a well-known figure in the community who later died tragically young — addressed a school assembly on the topic of the challenges that a modern Orthodox professional may face. The doctor addressed the Talmudic dictum that the saving of a life trumps the Sabbath. He explained that in its purest form, this principle applies only to the life of a Jew. The rabbis of the Talmud, however, were unprepared to allow the life of a non-Jew to be extinguished because of the no-work commandment, and so they ruled that the Sabbath could be violated to save the life of a non-Jew out of concern for maintaining peaceful relations between the Jewish and non-Jewish communities.Depending on how you look at it, this ruling is either an example of outrageously particularist religious thinking, because in principle it values Jewish life more than non-Jewish life, or an instance of laudable universalism, because in practice it treats all lives equally. The physician quite reasonably opted for the latter explanation. And he added that he himself would never distinguish Jewish from non-Jewish patients: a human being was a human being.This appealing sentiment did not go unchallenged. One of my teachers rose to suggest that the doctor’s attitude was putting him in danger of violating the Torah. The teacher reported that he had himself heard from his own rabbi, a leading modern-Orthodox Talmudist associated with Yeshiva University, that in violating the Sabbath to treat a non-Jew, intention was absolutely crucial. If you intended to save the patient’s life so as to facilitate good relations between Jews and non-Jews, your actions were permissible. But if, to the contrary, you intended to save the patient out of universal morality, then you were in fact guilty of violating the Sabbath, because the motive for acting was not the motive on the basis of which the rabbis allowed the Sabbath violation to occur.Later, in class, the teacher apologized to us students for what he said to the doctor. His comments, he said, were inappropriate — not because they were wrongheaded, but because non-Jews were present in the audience when he made them. The double standard of Jews and non-Jews, in other words, was for him truly irreducible: it was not just about noting that only Jewish lives merited violation of the Sabbath, but also about keeping the secret of why non-Jewish lives might be saved. To accept this version of the tradition would be to accept that the modern Orthodox project of engagement with the world could not proceed in good faith.Nothing in the subculture of modern Orthodoxy, however, brought out the tensions between tradition and modernity more vividly for a young man than the question of our relationship to sex. Modernity, and maybe the state-mandated curriculum (I have never checked), called for a day of sex ed in seventh grade. I have the feeling that the content of our sex-ed class was the same as those held in public schools in Massachusetts around the same time, with the notable exception that none of us would have occasion to deploy even the most minimal elements of the lesson plan in the foreseeable future. After the scientific bits of the lesson were over, the rabbi who was head of the school came in to the classroom to follow up with some indication of the Jewish-law perspective on these questions. It amounted to a blanket prohibition on the activities to which we had just been introduced. After marriage, some rather limited subset of them might become permissible — but only in the two weeks of the month that followed the two weeks of ritual abstinence occasioned by menstruation.After that memorable disquisition, the question of relations between the sexes went essentially unmentioned again in our formal education. We were periodically admonished that boys and girls must not touch one another, even accidentally. Several of the most attractive girls were singled out for uncomfortable closed-door sessions in which they were instructed that their manner of dress, which already met the school’s standards for modesty, must be made more modest still so as not to distract the males around them.Whatever their disjuncture with American culture of the 1980s, the erotics of prohibition were real to us. Once, I was called on the carpet after an anonymous informant told the administration that I had been seen holding a girl’s hand somewhere in Brookline one Sunday afternoon. The rabbi insinuated that if the girl and I were holding hands today, premarital sex must surely be right around the corner.My Talmud teacher — the one who took the physician to task — handed me four tightly packed columns of closely reasoned rabbinic Hebrew, a responsum by the pre-eminent Orthodox decisor, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, “in the matter of a young man whose heart lures him to enter into bonds of affection with a young woman not for purposes of marriage.” Rabbi Feinstein’s legal judgment with respect to romantic love among persons too young to marry was definitive. He prohibited it absolutely, in part on the ground that it would inevitably lead to nonprocreative seminal emissions, whether intentional or unintentional.What Feinstein lacked in romantic imagination was more than made up for by Moses Maimonides, who understood the soul pretty well. He once characterized the true love of God as all-consuming — “as though one had contracted the sickness of love.” Feinstein’s opinion directed my attention to a passage in Maimonides’s legal writings prohibiting various sorts of contact with women. The most evocative bit runs as follows: “Even to smell the perfume upon her is prohibited.” I have never been able to escape the feeling that this is a covert love poem enmeshed in the 14-volume web of dos and don’ts that is Maimonides’s Code of Law. Perfume has not smelled the same to me since.I have spent much of my own professional life focusing on the predicament of faith communities that strive to be modern while simultaneously cleaving to tradition. Consider the situation of those Christian evangelicals who want to participate actively in mainstream politics yet are committed to a biblical literalism that leads them to oppose stem-cell research and advocate intelligent design in the classroom. To some secularists, the evangelicals’ predicament seems absurd and their political movement dangerously anti-intellectual. As it happens, I favor financing stem-cell research and oppose the teaching of intelligent design or creationism as a “scientific” doctrine in public schools. Yet I nonetheless feel some sympathy for the evangelicals’ sure-to-fail attempts to stand in the way of the progress of science, and not just because I respect their concern that we consider the ethical implications of our technological prowess.Perhaps I feel sympathy because I can recall the agonies suffered by my head of school when he stopped by our biology class to discuss the problem of creation. Following the best modern Orthodox doctrine, he pointed out that Genesis could be understood allegorically, and that the length of a day might be numbered in billions of years considering that the sun, by which our time is reckoned, was not created until the fourth such “day.” Not for him the embarrassing claim, heard sometimes among the ultra-Orthodox, that dinosaur fossils were embedded by God within the earth at the moment of creation in order to test our faith in biblical inerrancy. Natural selection was for him a scientific fact to be respected like the laws of physics — guided by God but effectuated though the workings of the natural order. Yet even he could not leave the classroom without a final caveat. “The truth is,” he said, “despite what I have just told you, I still have a hard time believing that man could be descended from monkeys.”This same grappling with tension — and the same failure to resolve it perfectly — can be found among the many Muslims who embrace both basic liberal democratic values and orthodox Islamic faith. The literature of democratic Islam, like that of modern Orthodox Judaism, may be read as an embodiment of dialectical struggle, the unwillingness to ignore contemporary reality in constant interplay with the weight of tradition taken by them as authentic and divinely inspired. The imams I have met over the years seem, on the whole, no less sincere than the rabbis who taught me. Their commitment to their faith and to the legal tradition that comes with it seems just as heartfelt. Liberal Muslims may even have their own Joe Lieberman in the Minnesota congressman Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the U.S. Congress.The themes of difference and reconciliation that have preoccupied so much of my own thinking are nowhere more stark than in trying to make sense of the problem of marriage — which is also, for me, the most personal aspect of coming to terms with modern Orthodoxy. Although Jews of many denominations are uncomfortable with marriage between Jews and people of other religions, modern Orthodox condemnation is especially definitive.The reason for the resistance to such marriages derives from Jewish law but also from the challenge of defining the borders of the modern Orthodox community in the liberal modern state. Ultra-Orthodox Judaism addresses the boundary problem with methods like exclusionary group living and deciding business disputes through privately constituted Jewish-law tribunals. For modern Orthodox Jews, who embrace citizenship and participate in the larger political community, the relationship to the liberal state is more ambivalent. The solution adopted has been to insist on the coherence of the religious community as a social community, not a political community. It is defined not so much by what people believe or say they believe (it is much safer not to ask) as by what they do.Marriage is the most obvious public practice about which information is readily available. When combined with the traditional Jewish concern for continuity and self-preservation — itself only intensified by the memory of the Holocaust — marriage becomes the sine qua non of social membership in the modern Orthodox community. Marrying a Jewish but actively nonobservant spouse would in most cases make continued belonging difficult. Gay Orthodox Jews find themselves marginalized not only because of their forbidden sexual orientation but also because within the tradition they cannot marry the partners whom they might otherwise choose. For those who choose to marry spouses of another faith, maintaining membership would become all but impossible.Us and ThemIn a few cases, modern Orthodoxy’s line-drawing has been implicated in some truly horrifying events. Yigal Amir, the assassin of Yitzhak Rabin, was a modern Orthodox Jew who believed that Rabin’s peace efforts put him into the Talmudic category of one who may be freely executed because he is in the act of killing Jews. In 1994, Dr. Baruch Goldstein massacred 29 worshipers in the mosque atop the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron. An American-born physician, Goldstein attended a prominent modern Orthodox Jewish day school in Brooklyn. (In a classic modern Orthodox twist, the same distinguished school has also produced two Nobel Prize winners.)Because of the proximity of Goldstein’s background and mine, the details of his reasoning have haunted me. Goldstein committed his terrorist act on Purim, the holiday commemorating the victory of the Jews over Haman, traditionally said to be a descendant of the Amalekites. The previous Sabbath, he sat in synagogue and heard the special additional Torah portion for the day, which includes the famous injunction in the Book of Deuteronomy to remember what the Amalekites did to the Israelites on their way out of Egypt and to erase the memory of Amalek from beneath the heavens.This commandment was followed by a further reading from the Book of Samuel. It details the first intentional and explicit genocide depicted in the Western canon: God’s directive to King Saul to kill every living Amalekite — man, woman and child, and even the sheep and cattle. Saul fell short. He left the Amalekite king alive and spared the sheep. As a punishment for the incompleteness of the slaughter, God took the kingdom from him and his heirs and gave it to David. I can remember this portion verbatim. That Saturday, like Goldstein, I was in synagogue, too.Of course as a matter of Jewish law, the literal force of the biblical command of genocide does not apply today. The rabbis of the Talmud, in another of their universalizing legal rulings, held that because of the Assyrian King Sennacherib’s policy of population movement at the time of the First Temple, it was no longer possible to ascertain who was by descent an Amalekite. But as a schoolboy I was taught that the story of Amalek was about not just historical occurrence but cyclical recurrence: “In every generation, they rise up against us to destroy us, but the Holy One, blessed be He, saves us from their hands.” The Jews’ enemies today are the Amalekites of old. The inquisitors, the Cossacks — Amalekites. Hitler was an Amalekite, too.To Goldstein, the Palestinians were Amalekites. Like a Puritan seeking the contemporary type of the biblical archetype, he applied Deuteronomy and Samuel to the world before him. Commanded to settle the land, he settled it. Commanded to slaughter the Amalekites without mercy or compassion, he slew them. Goldstein could see difference as well as similarity. According to one newspaper account, when he was serving in the Israeli military, he refused to treat non-Jewish patients. And his actions were not met by universal condemnation: his gravestone describes him as a saint and a martyr of the Jewish people, “Clean of hands and pure of heart.”It would be a mistake to blame messianic modern Orthodoxy for ultranationalist terror. But when the evil comes from within your own midst, the soul searching needs to be especially intense. After the Hebron massacre, my own teacher, the late Israeli scholar and poet Ezra Fleischer — himself a paragon of modern Orthodox commitment — said that the innocent blood of the Palestinian worshipers dripped through the stones and formed tears in the eyes of the Patriarchs buried below.Recently I saw my oldest school friend again, and recalling the tale of the reunion photograph, we shared a laugh over my continuing status as persona non grata. She remarked that she had never even considered sending in her news to our alumni newsletter. “But why not?” I asked. Her answer was illuminating. As someone who never took steps that would have led to her public exclusion, she felt that the school and the community of which it was a part always sought to claim her — a situation that had its own costs for her sense of autonomy.For me, having exercised my choices differently, there is no such risk. With no danger of feeling owned, I haven’t lost the wish to be treated like any other old member. From the standpoint of the religious community, of course, the preservation of collective mores requires sanctioning someone who chooses a different way of living. But I still have my own inward sense of unalienated connection to my past. In synagogue on Purim with my children reading the Book of Esther, the beloved ancient phrases give me a sense of joy that not even Baruch Goldstein can completely take away.It is more than a little strange, feeling fully engaged with a way of seeing the world but also, at the same time, feeling so far from it. I was discussing it just the other day with my best friend — who, naturally, went to Maimonides, too. The topic was whether we would be the same people, in essence, had we remained completely within the bosom of modern Orthodoxy. He didn’t think so. Our life choices are constitutive of who we are, and so different life choices would have made us into different people — not unrecognizably different, but palpably, measurably so.I accepted his point as true — but for some reason I resisted the conclusion. Couldn’t the contradictory world from which we sprang be just as rich and productive as the contradictory life we actually live? Would it really, truly, have made all that much difference? Isn’t everyone’s life a mass of contradictions? My best friend just laughed.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','“For those of us not to the manner born, who don’t have grand country houses to retreat from the noise and demands of cities, colonies provide that,” Ms. Medley said. “One can exercise one’s Bloomsbury fantasies.”The playwright Karen Hartman’s face lights up, remembering the meals at Voice and Vision’s Envision retreat. Envision focuses on women-driven projects and includes students and emerging as well as established artists. Providing writers that “transformative, nurturing experience” was Meir Ribalow’s goal when he founded New River Dramatists in 2000. “I wanted a project that would raise the level of storytelling,” he said. “We don’t produce, we don’t present, and we don’t encumber.”Carl Djerassi, founder of the Djerassi Resident Artists Program, said his multidiciplinary program on 600 rolling acres in Woodside, Calif., near Stanford University, was intended to let visiting artists follow their own creative inclinations. “It’s not a mini-pseudo-Medici affair where you’re commissioning work for your own pleasure and retention,” he said by telephone from London. The program was founded in 1979 to honor the memory of Mr. Djerassi’s daughter Pamela, an artist who had committed suicide the year before.The experience of spending time at such a retreat can be life changing, artists said. Everyday life was a distraction, the playwright Mark Nassar said, before he attended Djerassi in 2006. He had been working as a security guard at Gypsy Tea, a nightclub in Chelsea, describing himself as “the oldest, smallest white bouncer in New York.” In California, wandering among the on-site sculptures and eucalyptus trees, Mr. Nassar, one of the authors of “Tony ’n’ Tina’s Wedding,” completed a draft of a new play in three weeks. And the boost in confidence helped his schmoozing skills, Mr. Nassar said in an interview from Los Angeles, where his screenplay “The Mayor’s Limo” was being filmed.“Nature is where you belong,” Ruth Maleczech, director of the Mabou Mines theater company, said. “It’s a kind of internal coming home.” Like Ms. Medley, she’s a serial residency attendee, and has visited the Sundance Project in White Oak, Fla.; the Ucross Foundation Residency Project in Wyoming; the Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Annaghmakerrig, Ireland; and the Envision Retreat, among others.The playwright Theresa Rebeck just completed an entire draft of a new play in two weeks at the New Harmony Project in Indiana.“I’ve never done that before and don’t want to do it again,” she said, laughing, in an interview from Los Angeles where she’s a writer for “Canterbury’s Law,” a forthcoming Fox television series starring Julianna Margulies. “I got through 40 pages in seven days, and then I got a dare from one of the other writers, Matt Smart. ‘You can do it, you can do it.’ I have to say that the last time I was there, I did the same thing to him.”She wrote the first half of “Mauritius,” opening on Broadway this fall, at New Harmony in 2005. “They kind of unleash you into your own space and allow you to clear out your life. I can just go and focus on what I’m doing,” she said.That’s a big change, Ms. Rebeck said, from being a working mother with plays and television shows in varying levels of development.“I know some writers who can’t write in New York City at all,” Ms. Lee said. The Orchard Project, in its second year, is dedicated to “developing the work and identities of theater companies,” and has invited the Young Jean Lee’s Theater Company for a stay at its home in the Catskills. In October she’ll attend Yaddo, the 107-year old artists’ community in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.Ms. Maleczech insisted that her production “Song for New York,” to debut on Labor Day weekend, would not have been created without the residencies. (“Song” is a site-specific piece to be performed on a barge in all five boroughs.) To be developed properly it needed the outdoors — and space and time — she said.Ms. Hartman said she did have some trouble writing at Bellagio, a program run by the Rockefeller Foundation in the hills around Lake Como, Italy, simply because it was so beautiful.“Artists assume we’ll do without certain luxuries — like money, trips, beautiful surroundings in summer,” she said. The residencies have enabled her to “bypass money” entirely and go “directly to the thing you’d buy.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','When the Keyport Fishery, a local landmark since its opening in 1936, suffered a devastating fire last August that destroyed the building, customers feared the market, with its tin ceiling, was gone forever. But Michael and Barbara Nosti, the owners, quickly rebuilt the site to its former roadside glory, reopening in October.The Fishery, which sells the catch of the day at market prices and offers takeout meals, makes a dozen different fish sandwiches, with choices including calamari, flounder, oysters and soft-shell crabs ($5.99 to $6.54). All the fish is lightly coated in cracker meal and fried to a golden crust. The soft white bread that the sandwiches are served on is satisfying, as are the sides of crispy fries and sweet coleslaw.For a heartier takeout meal, order a fish platter ($5.99 to $13.45). Shrimp cocktail ($5.99) with six shrimp and homemade cocktail sauce, is a classic starter; party trays are also available. Soups include chunky New England clam chowder ($1.95 a cup). If you like heat, the tomato-based New Orleans shrimp and scallop soup, with lots of garlic and peppers, is a spicy choice ($1.95 a cup). The crab cakes ($5.50 for a single, $13.45 for a platter with French fries and coleslaw) are good, as are fish cakes with haddock, potatoes and a hint of horseradish ($1.50 each, $5.99 a platter).John Clancy, the manager, who has worked at the market for five years and has been eating there since 1962, says that the market remains popular with regulars.

"'07-07-22,'0','America’s foes and rivals have long overrated the Central Intelligence Agency. When Henry Kissinger traveled to China in 1971, Prime Minister Chou En-lai asked about C.I.A. subversion. Kissinger told Chou that he “vastly overestimates the competence of the C.I.A.” Chou persisted that “whenever something happens in the world they are always thought of.” Kissinger acknowledged, “That is true, and it flatters them, but they don’t deserve it.”A few years later, in 1979, Iranian revolutionaries seized the American embassy in Tehran. They captured a C.I.A. case officer named William Daugherty and accused him of running the agency’s entire Middle Eastern spy network while plotting to assassinate Ayatollah Khomeini. Daugherty, who had been in the C.I.A. for only nine months, tried to explain that he didn’t even speak the native tongue, Persian. The Iranians seemed offended that the Americans would send such an inexperienced spy. It was “beyond insult,” Daugherty later recalled, “for that officer not to speak the language or know the customs, culture and history of their country.”The C.I.A. never did have much luck operating inside Communist China, and it failed to predict the Iranian revolution of 1979. “We were just plain asleep,” said the former C.I.A. director Adm. Stansfield Turner. The agency also did not foresee the explosion of an atom bomb by the Soviet Union in 1949, the invasion of South Korea in 1950, the popular uprisings in Eastern Europe in the 1950s, the installation of Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962, the Arab-Israeli war of 1973, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990, the explosion of an atom bomb by India in 1998 — the list goes on and on, culminating in the agency’s wrong call on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction in 2002-3.Tim Weiner’s engrossing, comprehensive “Legacy of Ashes” is a litany of failure, from the C.I.A.’s early days, when hundreds of agents were dropped behind the Iron Curtain to be killed or doubled (almost without exception), to more recent humiliations, like George Tenet’s now infamous “slam dunk” line. Over the years, the agency threw around a lot of money and adopted a certain swagger. “We went all over the world and we did what we wanted,” said Al Ulmer, the C.I.A.’s Far East division chief in the 1950s. “God, we had fun.” But even their successes turned out to be failures. In 1963, the C.I.A. backed a coup to install the Baath Party in Iraq. “We came to power on a C.I.A. train,” said Ali Saleh Saadi, the Baath Party interior minister. One of the train’s passengers, Weiner notes, was a young assassin named Saddam Hussein. Weiner quotes Donald Gregg, a former C.I.A. station chief in South Korea, later the national security adviser to Vice President George H. W. Bush: “The record in Europe was bad. The record in Asia was bad. The agency had a terrible record in its early days — a great reputation and a terrible record.”And yet the myth of the C.I.A. as an all-knowing, all-powerful spy agency persisted for years, not just in the minds of America’s enemies but in the imagination of many American television-watchers and moviegoers. Among those fooled, at least initially, were most modern presidents of the United States. The promise of a secret intelligence organization that could not only spy on America’s enemies but also influence events abroad, by sleight of hand and at relatively low cost, was just too alluring.When presidents finally faced the reality that the agency was bumbling, they could be bitter. Reviewing the C.I.A.’s record after his two terms in office, Dwight Eisenhower told the director, Allen Dulles, “I have suffered an eight-year defeat on this.” He would “leave a legacy of ashes” for his successor. A fan of Ian Fleming’s spy stories, John F. Kennedy was shocked to be introduced to the man described by C.I.A. higher-ups as their James Bond — the fat, alcoholic, unstable William Harvey, who ran a botched attempt to eliminate Fidel Castro by hiring the Mafia. Ronald Reagan went along with the desire of his C.I.A. director, William Casey, to bring back the mythical glory days by “unleashing” the agency — and his presidency was badly undermined by the Iran-contra affair.'"
"'07-07-22,'0','As a whole, refining disruptions have been considerably higher than in previous years: they averaged 1.5 million barrels a day in the first quarter, compared with 700,000 to 900,000 barrels a day from 2001 to 2005. In the days after the hurricanes, refiners were forced to briefly halt as many as five million barrels of production.In 2006, when refiners were still reeling from the impact of the hurricanes, disruptions in the first quarter averaged 1.35 million barrels a day.Many factors have led to the rise in gas prices, including disruptions in oil supplies from places like Nigeria and Norway. But analysts say the refining bottleneck in North America has been one of the main drivers of higher energy prices this year.The refining crunch has pushed wholesale gasoline prices up 35 percent this year and has contributed to a 23 percent gain for crude oil prices. Oil futures in New York closed at $75.57 a barrel on Friday.Some critics of the industry have theorized on Internet blogs that the squeeze on gasoline and other refined products points to a deliberate effort among oil companies to bolster profits by keeping supplies tight. But experts point out that the companies have little incentive right now to hold back on fuel supplies.“Every refinery would like to run as much crude as possible but they simply can’t,” said David Greely, senior energy economist at Goldman Sachs, who in a recent report compared the drop in domestic refining with an “invisible hurricane.” “These are more complex systems. There are more chances for things to go wrong. And when things go wrong, they tend to back up the system.”Meanwhile, refiners have been scrambling to meet a raft of environmental regulations, phase out toxic additives, add ethanol to the fuel mix and introduce new ultralow sulfur standards for gasoline and diesel. Industry insiders attribute much of the fragility of refining operations to the difficulty of making these cleaner fuels.Refiners spent $9 billion from 2002 to 2006 to make low sulfur diesel. But producing these cleaner fuels means processing crude oil more intensely through the refining process, at higher pressures and temperatures. This, in turn, leads to more chances for glitches or breakdowns, refiners say.“It’s a marvel we can continue to run refineries the way we do these days given the many requirements and specification changes we have,” said Charles T. Drevna, executive vice president of the refining industry’s main trade group, the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association. “There comes a time when the piper has got to be paid.”This year’s problems have raised alarms about the safety of refining operations, especially after a deadly accident at a BP refinery in Texas two years ago that killed 15 workers. The federal Chemical Safety Board issued a highly critical report blaming a broken safety culture at BP. But the board’s chairwoman, Carolyn W. Merritt, who has spoken out about safety problems at refineries, said there was a pattern in many other refinery incidents that the board had investigated.“There is a lack of investments in modern equipment,” Ms. Merritt said. “The overwhelming preponderance is that if you have inadequate engineering and equipment, poor process safety management, and poor staffing, you’re set up for a catastrophe.”Ms. Merritt, who was appointed by President Bush and will retire after her five-year term ends in August, also said the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does not conduct enough inspections. “There is no enforcement,” she said.OSHA defended its record and said it had inspected almost 500 refineries from 1994 to 2004. The agency also said it would inspect all refineries under its jurisdiction within the next two years. “OSHA inspections of refineries have proven to be effective,” the agency said.Meanwhile, demand has been rising relentlessly, providing little respite to the nation’s aging energy infrastructure. Even as consumers complain loudly about high prices, they show no signs of scaling back. Gasoline consumption reached 9.66 million barrels a day in the first week of July, the second-highest level on record.“The cushion that used to be available five to seven years ago for these unplanned perturbations is no longer there,” said Jeet Bindra, Chevron’s president of global refining. “When a refinery has a hiccup, there are consequences on supplies.”Part of the problem, analysts and refiners said, stems from the hurricanes two years ago. In Louisiana and Mississippi, many refineries were flooded, and about a quarter of the nation’s refining capacity was shut for weeks.“Since refining has become such a wonderful business, refiners have delayed maintenance,” Mr. Robinson said. “But when they do go down, they stay down for longer and they discover all sorts of problems.”In late March, for example, a fire at a large compressor at a BP refinery in Whiting, Ind., caused a hydrogen-treating unit that removes sulfur from some oil products to shut. That meant BP had to turn off a crude oil unit for early maintenance. Two weeks later, a brief power disruption damaged another distillation tower. And in July, a third crude oil tower was shut briefly so operators could fix a small leak. Since the first incident, the 405,000 barrels-a-day refinery has been running at about half its capacity.Not all refining disruptions are the result of similar incidents. Refineries typically schedule yearly maintenance that sometimes requires them to halt production entirely. But even these long-scheduled shutdowns can now take longer to complete.No refineries have been built in the United States in over three decades, because refiners say they are too costly. Instead, they have been expanding their existing refineries.All this is happening as the industry goes through another golden age. After 20 years in the doldrums, the refining business has never been so good for oil companies. Refining margins — the difference between the price of crude oil and the value of refined gasoline made from it — have shot up as much as $25 a barrel for some types of crude oil, compared with about $5 a barrel just a few years ago.But with a third summer of high gasoline prices, lawmakers are debating legislation they claim would punish oil companies for exploiting the tight supply situation and engaging in “price gouging.” At the same time, they are pressing refiners to produce more fuel.“Refiners want to keep running in today’s economic environment,” said Mr. Drevna of the refiners association. “But when they shut down they are accused of gouging the system. When they don’t, they are criticized for overrunning their facilities.”'"
"'07-07-22,'0','What sources can you point me to for group travel for a single man in his 60s who wants to tour with people of all ages (but not little children) without supplemental tour fees?Because tours, cruise lines and even hotels cater mainly to couples, groups or families, singles sometimes find they’re paying surcharges and extra fees because they cannot share a room. And traveling by yourself can make socializing difficult; just because you’re traveling alone doesn’t mean you want to be left alone. There are tour groups that cater to solo travelers but are not restricted to them, limited to teens and adults and designed to be cost effective and more fun than venturing out on your own.One site you may want to check out first is www.solotravel.org, with activity guides, safety and money-saving tips and links to travel companies. Through the site’s blog I found two tour groups worth exploring: IntrepidTravel.com and Solocruiser.com. Sixty percent of IntrepidTravel’s clients are single travelers; the company, long an advocate of socially responsible travel, doesn’t charge single supplements and keeps its average group size to 10 people; children must be over 12 for regular departures. (IntrepidTravel also offers family trips.) Its 15-day Northern Thailand trip costs $675 a person, plus a final payment in baht of about $275 for local expenses. Solocruiser offers bookings without single supplement fees on culinary cruises, a Brazilian eco-cruise, even trans-Atlantic voyages, for all ages, with prices from $600 to $10,000.The Adventure Company is another option (see www.adventurecompany.co.uk/single_traveller.aspx). Over half of its bookings are from single travelers (no single supplements). Trips combining singles and small groups (minimum age 14) include a trek to the Everest Base Camp in Nepal, a kayaking, biking and rafting trip in Turkey and a Botswana safari. Prices range from $408 for an 8-day trek into the Atlas Mountains in Morocco to $13,528 for a 19-day cruise to Antarctica. DAVID G. ALLAN'"

Even if some of their words ring somewhat hollow.The FTC, Congress and the EU are all investigating Google's proposed acquisition of ad network DoubleClick, looking into whether the deal is bad for user privacy and for competition in the online ad industry.Not coincidentally, Google has recently made two changes to its privacy policy. In March it said that 18 months after you search on Google, that search record will be ""anonymized,"" stripped of any identifiable information. And last Monday, it said that cookies, those small files that sit on your hard drive to identify you to Web sites, will expire after two years, but only if you do not use Google during that time. (With the invaluable Google, that seems curiously meaningless.)Now, in what looks like a game of privacy one-upsmanship, Microsoft is answering with changes of its own.In addition to calling for a set of industry-wide privacy standards, it says it will wipe clean its search logs after 18 months too. It also says it will let users opt-out of receiving behaviorally-targeted ads across Microsoft's advertising network, which it expanded in April by buying DoubleClick-rival aQuantive Inc.Behavioral targeting is showing you ads based on your past behavior.

These people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was still under way.Donaghy last worked May 12, in Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals between Phoenix and San Antonio.N.B.A. referees are prohibited from betting on any sport; sufficient evidence of gambling would result in immediate termination.

"'07-07-23,'1','The names of some of the corporate big shots and industry lobbyists who helped shape the deliberations and conclusions of the super-secret Cheney energy task force in 2001 are now beginning to surface, thanks to a former White House aide who provided a list to The Washington Post.It’s interesting to discover that Kenneth Lay, Enron’s chairman, was favored with two audiences. But the rest is sadly familiar. The task force, which developed a national energy policy, had all the time in the world for the big energy producers — some 40 meetings with the oil, gas and coal companies and their trade associations — but barely a moment for environmentalists. It’s hardly surprising that its report favored producers of fossil fuels at the expense of conservation and alternative fuels.What this list really does is remind us how and why this administration has squandered six years that should have been devoted to finding innovative answers to the big questions of oil dependency and global warming.Some energy experts say the Cheney report appears better balanced in retrospect than its critics claimed. But while it clinically assessed a range of energy strategies, including conservation, its actual recommendations were heavily weighted toward finding new sources of supply and removing regulatory impediments to oil and gas exploration and burning coal.The report had immediate influence on Capitol Hill, where both the House and Senate produced alarmingly unbalanced energy bills, with billions in tax breaks and other subsidies for traditional energy producers and only peanuts, relatively speaking, for efficiency and alternative fuels.Fortunately, the energy debate itself has moved beyond the vice president’s framing of it in 2001. The energy bill passed by the Senate last month is much less solicitous of big producers and much more favorable to newer, cleaner fuels. Some of the very companies that appeared before the task force in 2001 are now ahead of the White House, demanding more aggressive steps on climate change and oil dependency. Think how much more quickly we could have reached this point had the task force truly opened itself to new ideas six years ago.'"
"'07-07-23,'1','Donald Michie, a versatile British scientist and early theorist of artificial intelligence who helped develop a “smart” industrial robot and then applied the technology to diverse fields, died on July 7 in Britain. He was 83.Dr. Michie (pronounced MICK-ee) died in a car accident near London along with his former wife, Anne McLaren, a biologist and pioneering researcher in the field of reproduction.In the early 1970s, in work that received international attention and helped make Britain a force in advancing artificial intelligence, Dr. Michie led a team that produced “Freddy,” a computer-directed robotic arm that could choose and assemble parts from a jumbled and potentially confusing array. To demonstrate Freddy’s capabilities, Dr. Michie programmed the machine to put together the parts of a toy truck.Nils J. Nilsson, an emeritus professor of engineering at Stanford University and a former chairman of the department of computer science there, said the machine was “ahead of its time” and impressed researchers at Stanford and elsewhere as “one of the first automatic assembly systems in the world.”Dr. Nilsson added that industry had been slow to see Freddy’s potential, and it was not until the 1980s, after industries in Japan began to use robotic machines in manufacturing, that the work of Dr. Michie and other scientists was fully appreciated.'"
"'07-07-23,'1','But lawmakers taking steps to deal with growing concerns have struggled to ensure public safety without impinging on the privacy and property rights of dog owners. Several of the measures have been overturned in the courts, and many national dog owner and veterinarian associations say the bans are difficult to enforce and ineffective since, they say, if one breed is banned, dog owners seeking aggressive dogs will simply begin fostering fierceness in other breeds.After the indictment of the Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who is accused of running a dog-fighting ring from his property in Virginia, the Humane Society estimated that more than 30 percent of dogs in animal shelters were pit bulls, many of them trained as fighting dogs and later abandoned on the streets. That is up from 2 or 3 percent of the shelter population that were pit bulls 15 years ago, the officials said.“Of course it’s a serious concern when you have more people wanting and training aggressive dogs, and more of those dogs are being abandoned,” said John Goodwin, an expert on animal fighting with the Humane Society.Counties in Florida and New York have also created publicly accessible dangerous dog registries like the one in Virginia, and legislators in Hawaii are considering one. Critics of the registries say that by publicizing the home addresses of dangerous dogs, they invite harassment by neighbors and invade the privacy of dog owners. Seventeen states now have a “one bite rule” protecting dog owners from liability for the first attack.“It seems a little unfair to single out a dog if they haven’t done something in the past,” said Jacqueline Short, 40, who lives in Newport News, Va. She is Bear’s owner and says the bicyclist was her pet’s first biting offense.Now that Bear has been officially designated a dangerous dog, he must be muzzled and walked on a short leash when he is taken in public. But Ms. Short says the toughest requirement has been the $100,000 liability insurance that she now has to carry, which costs about $1,000 a year.“Courts need to look at the dog’s history and the severity of the incident,” Ms. Short said, “and if the dogs haven’t shown aggression in the past then that should be taken into account before they are considered dangerous.”Even with stiffer penalties, animal control departments are often understaffed and under-financed and therefore unable to apply the laws.“Leash laws don’t work because they’re not enforced,” said Mary Hill, the sister of Lillian Stiles, who was killed in Texas in November 2005 by a pack of dogs and whose death inspired the state’s law.Ms. Hill, who likes to exercise regularly, said she was often frustrated by dogs left off their leashes that chase and harass runners and walkers.Each year, roughly 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs and about 800,000, half of them children, seek medical attention, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.On average, a dozen people die each year from dog attacks, according to the center. In 2003, 32 people died from dog-related incidents.From 1979 to 1998, more than half of the dog-related fatalities were caused by pit bulls and Rottweilers, according to a study published in 2000 in The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.Randall Lockwood, a senior vice president of the association and one of the authors of that study, said it was a mistake to make policy decisions based on dog-related fatalities, because they are so rare.“In the ’70s, Dobermans were the scary dogs of choice, and they were involved in more fatalities,” Mr. Lockwood said. “And later, German shepherds and St. Bernards used to be the ones involved in attacks, which is probably why Stephen King chose to make Cujo a St. Bernard, not a pit bull.” Fatalities are, above all, a reflection of the type of dog that is popular at a given time among people who want to own an aggressive status symbol, he said.Pit bulls have undoubtedly become that symbol in recent years, and communities that have tried to ban them have run into problems. At least 12 states prohibit local municipalities from passing breed-specific legislation, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Critics say the bans are costly and impractical to enforce since breeds are often difficult to identify and dogs are often of mixed breed.In March 2006, Ohio’s law banning pit bulls was overturned on the grounds that the state could not prove that pit bulls were inherently more dangerous than other breeds.In Virginia, 75 to 100 dogs have been declared dangerous by a judge, and many of them have been euthanized or moved out of state.But victims say the insurance is actually the most important part of Virginia’s new law.Betty Greene’s mother, Dorothy Sullivan, 82, was killed by a neighbor’s three pit bulls that entered her yard. Ms. Greene said she had heard from a number of victims of dog attacks who, more often than not, ended up having to pay for their hospital bills.The three pit bulls were euthanized and the owner was sentenced to three years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, Ms. Greene said.“There is no way to explain the grief,” she said. “It’s even worse when the victim has to pay for the lawyers, the death, the hospital bills.”'"
"'07-07-23,'1','And though the unit has grown in recent years, officials acknowledge they still do not have the resources to put more than two officers on the night shift, answer the cruelty hot line after 6 p.m. or call back every person who reports a case of abuse in a city with 5 million animals.In light of the challenges, some activists say the television show has been a mixed blessing: a call to action, but one that may mask the need for a more robust response by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.“If they are going to profit from the TV show, they should hire more officers,” said Gary Perkinson, a former A.S.P.C.A. manager and one of several people who say officers never responded to reports of abuse they had phoned in.Officials for the A.S.P.C.A., a nonprofit group that does not receive government funding, call the criticism unfair, asserting that the “animal cops” have never been more effective, that the unit’s budget has been increased and that arrests are up significantly over prior years.Dale Riedel, 57, a retired New York police captain who directs the unit, known as the Humane Law Enforcement division, calls it a model for the country. Expectations must be realistic, he said. “We are not a 911 agency,” he said. “We don’t have a radio car that can be there in five minutes’ time.”Given its name and its status as the nation’s oldest animal welfare organization, the A.S.P.C.A. is often mistaken for a national umbrella organization. Actually, the 141-year-old group operates independently of all other S.P.C.A.’s across the country, although it does help many with grants and training and works to spread its message nationally with lobbying and education efforts.“They are dedicated and effective and knowledgeable,” Regina Massaro, founder of the Spay Neuter Intervention Project in New York, an independent group, said of A.S.P.C.A. officials.Increasingly, since the cable series first aired in 2001, the face of the A.S.P.C.A. has been Ms. Lucas, the pretty, assertive animal welfare investigator. She is the host of fund-raising infomercials and has become one of the society’s highest paid employees, earning $141,000 a year, according to its last financial filing. That is more than the amount paid to her boss, Mr. Riedel, and to the veterinarian who is the director of medicine for the society’s animal hospital.Other officers are paid an average of $45,000 a year, plus “a bit extra” for their participation in the television show, Mr. Riedel said. The society would not say what it is paid for “Animal Precinct,” which draws 3.5 million viewers in peak weeks.“We immediately saw Annemarie’s potential,” said Sally Anne Lomas, a producer of the show for Anglia Television of England. “Her feistiness. The little blonde on the streets.”Beyond the klieg lights, though, critics say “Animal Precinct” resembles other reality shows that present overly positive views of police performance.“You get the idea from the show that they are patrolling constantly,” said Amy K. Tanguay, a credit manager for a Manhattan law firm. But when she reported several cases of abuse to the unit, she said, no one pursued them.“Their whole attitude,” she said, “is extremely defensive: ‘We can’t do anything about it. It’s not our problem. Have a nice day.’ ”Last year, the society’s cruelty hot line received more than 50,000 calls and determined that 4,191, fewer than a tenth of them, were bona fide complaints. Of those, officers made arrests in 103 cases, or 2.5 percent. An additional 109 people received summonses.Police agencies typically make arrests in a higher percentage of cases, even for the tough-to-solve crimes like burglary, where officials generally push for clearance rates above 10 percent. But A.S.P.C.A. officials said cruelty cases were particularly difficult because animals cannot testify.“It takes weeks to make these cases,” Ms. Lucas said. “Agents come back again and again on rechecks.”Mr. Riedel said that despite the screening the society does, the cruelty complaints it receives are not as solid as the reports filed with a traditional police agency.“If I was a detective commander and had 4,000 of them, and then I only had 103 arrests, I’d be as skeptical as you are right now,” he said. “But we are actually getting a lot of calls that are not, in fact, crimes. They are disputes, or we have to go and educate people.”Mr. Riedel added, “If you actually look at where there are crimes where we can say an animal was intentionally neglected or maltreated, it’s much, much smaller. It’s not 4,000 to 103, it probably comes down to 300 to 103.”It is difficult to compare animal police units because their responsibilities and jurisdictions vary. Some organizations, for example, collect stray animals, as the A.S.P.C.A. once did. But the society decided to focus on anticruelty efforts, and a city-sponsored nonprofit group took over the dog-catching function in 1995.In Los Angeles, though, S.P.C.A. officers perform nearly identical duties, albeit on a much smaller scale, with 10 agents and an $860,000 budget. They make one arrest for about every eight cruelty investigations, versus one for every 40 in New York.An A.S.P.C.A. spokeswoman questioned whether the comparison was fair because the two agencies are so different in size and have different jurisdictional boundaries.Critics, however, say the A.S.P.C.A. needs to be more energetic.Garo Alexanian, executive director of the Companion Animal Network, an 18-year-old New York City advocacy group, said the officers were not active enough in inspecting the stables used by Central Park carriage horses, or monitoring them on hot and cold days. The society, which has a dedicated officer for those efforts, denies both charges.Patty Adjamine, the director of New Yorkers for Companion Animals, a Manhattan rescue group, said she happened to be on Lexington Avenue one day in March when a man got out of a car and began capturing pigeons with a net. Fearing he meant to use the birds for torture or target practice, she said she called the A.S.P.C.A. to provide the man’s license plate number. Her call, she said, went to voice mail at 3 in the afternoon.“The A.S.P.C.A. never even called me back,” she said.A.S.P.C.A. officials said they could not find a record of Ms. Adjamine’s call.“Please note,” said a spokeswoman, Anita Kelso Edson, “that we don’t call back every person who calls us with a complaint. They’re welcome to contact us again, but we don’t have the resources to return every complaint call.”The police unit, with a budget of $3.6 million, is actually one of the largest of its type in the nation and has peace officer powers under state law. In the past five years it has gained three officers, $1.8 million in financing and a new headquarters in Queens. Though no one covers the overnight shift, or answers the cruelty hot line after 6 p.m., officials said most complaints were assigned to officers within two hours.But with cruelty on a pace to increase again this year, are 18 officers enough?“I don’t believe they are overwhelmed,” Mr. Riedel said. “I believe that we are asking much more from them.”The A.S.P.C.A. responds to cruelty in a variety of ways, and the Humane Law Enforcement division represents just a small part of its approach. Critics, though, say the budget shortchanges a program that is at the heart of the society’s mission.Its Communications Department, for example, which handles advertising campaigns, operates the Web site and creates member publications, received $6.3 million in 2005, nearly twice as much as Humane Law Enforcement, according to the society’s tax return for that year, the latest available. The A.S.P.C.A. said its 2006 return was not ready yet.The rest of the budget goes toward, among other things, financing a respected animal hospital, making grants to other groups, educating people about animal welfare, increasing pet adoptions and lowering euthanasia rates.Stephen Musso, the society’s chief of operations, said that the organization listened to its critics but was satisfied that it had set reasonable priorities.“We wish we were perfect,” he said. “We can’t be all things to all people.”An officer who left the agency several years ago, John Lopez, said one enforcement problem was that efforts are sometimes tailored for the show, whose crews routinely accompany officers in the field.“If it’s not exciting, not a great case, they put it on a back burner,” he said.Mr. Riedel denied that. “The film crew chooses what they want,” he said, adding, “We investigate all the cases, but they pick and choose.”Last month, a judge found that an A.S.P.C.A. officer had played for the cameras in pursuing cruelty charges against two Staten Island men for neglecting their pets. The men, Kevin Lewis, 58, and Barry Leo Delaney, 68, denied the cruelty allegation and offered veterinary records, but they were arrested and some of their dogs and cats were seized at their home in October 2005.Judge Matthew A. Sciarrino Jr. of Criminal Court ruled that the A.S.P.C.A. officer, John De La Torre, “in an effort to play the starring role,” improperly took the animals after going to the door with a camera crew shooting from the sidewalk.The judge said that the officer did not have a warrant and that Mr. Delaney had been improperly urged to come outside his house to benefit the cameras.“He wanted to arrest this defendant, as this would make for ‘better’ television,” said the judge, who dismissed the case.“An officer who may behave one way with no camera present may behave differently with a television crew following him,” he wrote.Discovery Communications, which owns “Animal Precinct,” ultimately decided not to use the segment. A spokeswoman declined to comment on the dispute.The A.S.P.C.A. said it remained convinced its officer acted correctly. A spokesman for the Staten Island district attorney’s office said it was “reviewing our options” in the case.'"

His best chance at a major had slipped away in a maze of missed putts. “I don’t know how I manage to do these things,” said García, now 0 for 36 in majors. “It seems to me like every time I get in this kind of position I have no room for error.”As it did eight years ago, Carnoustie’s 499-yard par-4 18th hole played a central role in the theater. In 1999, Jean Van de Velde made a triple-bogey 7 there by hitting into the murky Barry Burn and losing in a playoff.On Sunday in regulation, Harrington made a double-bogey 6 there by hitting his tee shot with a driver and his third shot with an iron into the burn. From in front of the burn, he hit his fifth shot — a spinning pitch — that stopped 4 feet from the cup and rolled in the putt to fall one stroke behind García.Harrington’s best hope was that García had to play the 18th, too.“To try to win a tournament on that hole, there’s just trouble everywhere,” Harrington said. “I knew Sergio; it was going to be a tough hole for him to make par.”García found the fairway with an iron, but he had to wait several minutes before he could hit his next shot as Paul McGinley and Chris DiMarco finished on the green. After the group was finished, a course worker slowly raked a bunker to the right of the green, where McGinley had been.“It’s not fun standing there when you know you’re hitting the ball well and you know what you have to do,” the 27-year-old García said. “You’re hitting a 3-iron, and you know you need to make par. It’s not very easy.”García pulled his 3-iron into a bunker short and left of the green. He blasted out to 8 feet and read the putt from each side. With the claret jug in his grasp, García tapped his ball and watched it rim out of the left side of the cup.García spoke as if external forces had conspired to keep the ball out.“You know what’s the saddest thing about it?” he said. “It’s not the first time. So, I don’t know, I’m playing against a lot of guys out there, more than the field.”With García’s miss, he joined Harrington for a playoff that began on the first tee and concluded with 16, 17 and 18. The sun, absent for most of the championship, broke through just in time and began casting long shadows across the course.Miguel Ángel Jiménez, a friend of each player, approached Harrington on the tee and reminded him that a European was guaranteed to win.The windows of the Carnoustie Hotel were open as guests and hotel workers looked out to watch the final 45 minutes of the tournament play out.Harrington struck first on the opening hole of the playoff, lacing an iron to 10 feet while García found a front bunker. García blasted out to 12 feet, but his run at par hit the right lip of the cup and scurried past. When Harrington rolled in the birdie putt, he led García by two shots.On the 248-yard par-3 16th hole, García’s tee shot bounced, hit the flagstick and rolled 20 feet away. He made par — which was matched by Harrington — and called it more bad luck.“It’s funny how some guys hit the pin and go to a foot,” García said. “Mine hits the pin and goes 20 feet away.”After both players made par on 17, Harrington walked to the 18th with a two-shot lead. He laid up with a hybrid club, hit an iron down the fairway, and a third iron shot to 25 feet from cup. García, playing more aggressively, hit a driver into the left rough and an iron shot that settled 18 feet from the hole.When Harrington slid his par putt 3 feet past, García had his chance to pounce. Instead, using the belly putter that had been so good to him for three days, García’s putt rolled over the left edge of the hole, and he tapped in for par. Harrington, facing a short right-to-left putt for the victory, hit it in the middle of the hole.“Just to see it rolling in there, I couldn’t believe it,” Harrington said. “I’m thinking: ‘Am I the Open champion? What does it mean?’ ”It meant that Europe’s long drought in the majors was over, but it meant even more to Harrington.Two years ago, he withdrew from the British Open at St. Andrews to bury his father, Paddy, who died of cancer of the esophagus.Harrington choked up Sunday when he mentioned him in his victory speech, but he brightened at the sight of another Paddy, his 3-year-old son, frolicking in the gloaming.The grueling championship over, a priceless trophy won, Harrington asked Paddy what he wanted to do with the claret jug.“My son wants to collect ladybugs and keep them there,” Harrington said.'"
"'07-07-23,'1','In March, Wolters Kluwer sold its educational business to Bridgepoint Capital, a private equity firm, for $1 billion. A month later Pearson agreed to buy Reed Elsevier’s educational testing and international education publishing business for $950 million.In May, Thomson agreed to sell its educational unit to Apax Partners, the private equity firm, and an arm of the Ontario municipal employees’ pension system for $7.7 billion.Analysts say private equity has been attracted to the educational business by steady cash flows, a relative lack of competition and expectations that spending will increase in the coming years as states like California step up textbook replacement programs.Yet companies like Reed Elsevier, Thomson and Wolters Kluwer have been willing to leave the business because educational publishing has lagged behind areas like medical, legal and scientific publishing in the shift to digital distribution, analysts say.That is where Mr. O’Callaghan comes in. In the spirit of other Irish entrepreneurs, including Tony Ryan, founder of the low-cost airline Ryanair, and Michael O’Leary, its chief executive, Mr. O’Callaghan sees an opportunity to bring into the future an industry long dominated by a handful of big players, analysts and executives say.“The idea of marrying content with technology holds strategic appeal,” said Drew Crum, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus in Cleveland.Because Houghton Mifflin Riverdeep brings together expertise in textbooks and software, it will be able to accelerate the development and adoption of new educational tools and technologies, Jeremy Dickens, the company’s president, said in an e-mail response to questions.Riverdeep was established in 1995. Mr. O’Callaghan joined it as chief executive in 1999, leaving Credit Suisse First Boston, where he was an investment banker.The company went public with an offering on the Nasdaq Stock Market in March 2000, as technology stocks were peaking. After a slump in the stock price, Mr. O’Callaghan led a management buyout in 2003.Associates of Mr. O’Callaghan say he is up to the task of managing the growing company. Barry Dixon, an analyst at Davy Stockbrokers in Dublin, said, “He has an extraordinary ability to handle detail on a whole range of topics, from financial engineering to operational to legal issues.”'"
"'07-07-23,'1','“The idea of creating an association to focus on this is great,” said Brian Haven, an analyst with Forrester Research. “It’s going to help companies monetize all this content.”According to a recent Forrester survey, slightly more than 10 percent of all Internet users have listened to a podcast. Emarketer, another online research firm, said that advertising on podcasts reached just $80 million last year. Mr. Haven said a lot of growth is possible.“It’s just a matter of getting the right content to people at the right time,” he said, “and helping people overcome some obstacles like, ‘What the hell is a podcast?’ ”Mr. Haven said publishers are “dying to get more involved with advertising and podcasting, especially if you include video, but they just don’t know how.”Susan Bratton, who helped form the Association for Downloadable Media, said her experience as the chief executive of Personal Life Media, which produces audio podcasts on a range of subjects, helped convince her that more industry cooperation was needed to make podcasting a viable business.Among other things, Ms. Bratton said that technology companies, marketers and publishers need to agree on standard methods for packaging and delivering advertisements, and tracking the number of times an advertisement is heard. Also, there is no consensus on how best to design an advertisement within a podcast. As a result, marketers, advertising agencies and publishers cannot efficiently implement big campaigns across multiple sites.Ms. Bratton, who is an online advertising industry veteran, said she believes she has found at least one good format for running advertisements within podcasts. In addition to placing a sponsor’s advertisements at both ends of a show, she also inserts an advertisement in the middle.“Say you’re listening,” Ms. Bratton said. “You’ll hear an ad about sponsoring the show from the Omega Institute at the start. Then you get into the show, and halfway through there’s a commercial break, where you have more detail on Omega’s summer programs. Then at the end of the show the final commercial says, ‘Find out more at eomega.org.’ ”Ms. Bratton added, “I have the ability to not just have a single ad in front and end, but a series of them that’ll tell the story.”Advertising agencies are also tinkering with formats. David Herscott, president of MEA Digital, an Internet marketing agency based in San Diego, said he agrees with the logic of including three advertisements in a longer podcast. But the advertisements, he said, should build in length as the show develops, and as the listener is more deeply invested in the show.Technology companies are improving in the meantime. Vendors like Podbridge, Podtrac and Kiptronic have in recent months rolled out new podcasting-related services. Podbridge, for instance, recently introduced a service that allows video podcast producers to insert advertisements into various parts of their shows.Murgesh Navar, chief executive of Podbridge, based in Mountain View, Calif., said producers can change advertisements once a marketer’s campaign has finished, without the user knowing that Podbridge has essentially visited his computer. The only potential snag is that users must download an application that allows Podbridge’s technology to work.“It’ll take some time for consumers to adopt it on a broad scale,” Mr. Navar said.More than 85 percent of the people who recently clicked on a show about professional wrestling on Sports Byline USA (sportsbyline.com), he said, downloaded the application.Advertisers are interested in testing the podcast waters. Dakota Sullivan, chief marketing officer of BlueLithium, an online advertising network, said the company had recently started to design an advertising campaign around audio podcasts, to generate interest among prospective business clients, and to understand how such advertisements could help those clients in their own marketing campaigns.“It’s a nice opportunity to use ourselves as a guinea pig,” Mr. Sullivan said.And even if video content has stolen much of the spotlight from downloadable audio files, Mr. Sullivan said he sees no signs of a slowdown in audio downloads.“There are more iPods and other MP3 devices in more places today than there have ever been,” he said. “It seems this notion of personally programmed media, whether video or audio, is the way of the future, and if podcasts are part of that, it makes a lot of sense for us to be there.”'"
"'07-07-23,'1','But they combined to deliver serious damage to the other contenders on the ride to Plateau de Beille, a high-altitude ski area that is best known for its cross-country skiing. The climb to the plateau from the town of Les Cabannes is 9.9 miles with an average slope of 7.8 — longer and about as steep as the legendary climb of Alpe d’Huez, which measures 8.6 miles at 7.9 percent. A stage of the Tour has finished on the plateau only twice before, and both times the winner went on to capture the Tour: Marco Pantani in 1998 and Lance Armstrong in 2002.After 112 miles of racing Sunday, a group of about 25 riders, including most of the race favorites and their top lieutenants, reached Les Cabannes about 2:45 behind a breakaway of six riders. Neither of the groups stayed together very long, however. The breakaway group was quickly reduced to three, then one, as Antonio Colom, a Spanish climbing specialist for Astana, attacked.In the larger group, Rabobank riders increased the speed considerably, trying to control the pace for Rasmussen. Within three miles, the group was down to 10 riders, but three were from Discovery Channel. Yaroslav Popovych then took over much of the work at the front of the pack, as Contador slid up and down the ranks trying to assess the strength of the other contenders.Two riders, including Klöden, soon fell off the pace. Then, the attacks began in earnest. With about five miles remaining, Contador attacked, and the acceleration dropped Andrey Kashechkin of Astana. A quarter-mile later, Rasmussen attacked, and only Contador and Evans of Predictor-Lotto were able to keep up with his pace.With four miles to go, a group of six had re-formed — Rasmussen, Contador, Evans, Leipheimer, Carlos Sastre of CSC and Juan Mauricio Soler Hernández, the Barloworld rider who won the ninth stage into Briançon.Soler then attacked twice in a quarter-mile. The second time, Contador chased him, followed by Rasmussen, Evans and Sastre. As they caught Soler, Rasmussen accelerated again, and only Contador and Evans were able to keep up with him.Slowly, Sastre and Soler clawed their way back to the three riders, then, with three and a half miles to the top, it was Contador’s turn to attack again. This time, no one could react but Rasmussen and Evans, then Evans too was left behind.For the last three miles, Contador and Rasmussen rode one in front of the other, changing places every hundred yards or so, passing the remnants of the breakaway and finally Colom as well. Several times over the remainder of the stage, one motioned for the other to take the lead, or they exchanged a few words, appearing to strike a deal to work together — Contador would win the stage, and Rasmussen would keep the yellow jersey.Such deals are common and usually denied by the riders, as this one was by Rasmussen after the stage.“We had a common interest in taking as much time out of our competitors as possible,” Rasmussen said. “But this is the Tour de France. Plateau de Beille is not something you give away.”With two riders in the top four, Discovery is in a good position to keep the pressure on Rasmussen.“The last week of the Tour is always difficult,” Contador said. “But I will try to attack the yellow jersey.”Monday brings another tough day in the Pyrenees, but not a mountaintop finish. The 121.8-mile stage from Foix to Loudenvielle-Le Louron travels over two Category 2 slopes, two more Category 1 climbs, and the “beyond category” route up the Port de Bales. (Mountain climbs are rated from Category 4, the easiest; to Category 1. “Beyond category” climbs are considered the toughest.) The stage ends with a descent of about seven and a half miles.'"

"'07-07-24,'0','His basic message was that all people are born with a talent “for crooked thinking” — distortions of perception that sabotage their innate desire for happiness. But he recognized that people also had the capacity to change themselves. The role of therapists, Dr. Ellis argued, is to intervene directly, using strategies and homework exercises to help patients first learn to accept themselves as they are (unconditional self-acceptance, he called it) and then to retrain themselves to avoid destructive emotions — to “establish new ways of being and behaving,” as he put it.His methods, along with those of Dr. Aaron Beck, a psychiatrist who was working independently, provided the basis for what is known as cognitive behavior therapy. A form of talk therapy, it has been shown to be at least as effective as drugs for many people in treating anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other conditions.His admirers credited Dr. Ellis with adapting the “talking cure,” the dominant therapy in extended Freudian sessions, to a pragmatic, stop-your-complaining-and-get-on-with-you-life form of guidance later popularized by television personalities like Dr. Phil.Dr. Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 survey, clinical psychologists ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the greatest influence on their field. (They placed him second behind Carl Rogers, the founder of humanistic psychology.) His reputation grew even more in the next two decades.In 1955, however, when Dr. Ellis introduced his approach, most of the psychological and psychiatric establishment scorned it. His critics said he misunderstood the nature and force of emotions. Classical Freudians also took offense at Dr. Ellis’s critical observations about psychoanalysis and its founder. Dr. Ellis contended that Freud “really knew very little about sex” and that his view of the Oedipus complex, as suggesting a universal law of human disturbance, was “foolish.”A sexual liberationist, Dr. Ellis collaborated with Dr. Alfred Kinsey in his taboo-breaking research on sexual behavior, and his writings about sex drew complaints from members of the American Psychological Association.As a base for his work he established the Institute for Rational Living, now the Albert Ellis Institute, in a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan. He lived on its top floor.One day in the spring of 2004, when Dr. Ellis was 90, hard of hearing and recovering from abdominal surgery, he came downstairs to lead one of his Friday sessions, just as he had done for 30 years.“Do you know why your family is trying to control you?” he asked a volunteer who had joined him in front of the audience. “Because they are out of their minds!” he said, inserting an unprintable adjective.Another participant recalled the murder of her sister years ago by a drug dealer. “Why can’t you understand that some people are crazy and violent and do all kinds of terrible things?” Dr. Ellis declared. “Until you accept it, you’re going to be angry, angry, angry.”Some critics complained that his seminars were more stand-up comedy than serious lecture. Still, despite his iconoclasm, or perhaps because of it, rational emotive behavior therapy became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in the 1970’s and 80’s. In 1985, the American Psychological Association presented Dr. Ellis with its award for “distinguished professional contributions.”Dr. Ellis was the author or co-author of more than 60 books, many of them best sellers. Among them were “A Guide to Successful Marriage,” “Overcoming Procrastination,” “How to Live With a Neurotic,” “The Art of Erotic Seduction,” “Sex Without Guilt,” “A New Guide to Rational Living,” and “How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable About Anything — Yes, Anything.”He often went back to his own life experiences to help explain his positive frame of thinking. Albert Ellis was born on Sept. 27, 1913, in Pittsburgh, the oldest of three children. As a child he had a kidney disorder that turned him, he wrote, from sports to books. His parents moved to the Bronx and separated when he was 11. He wrote that he had limited but amiable contacts with his father, a traveling salesman, and that his mother, an amateur actress, was not interested in domestic life.But he maintained that the experience had left no scars. “I took my father’s absence and my mother’s neglect in stride,” he wrote, “and even felt good about being allowed so much autonomy and independence.”He did well in school, skipped grades, won writing contests and, he said, liked himself for his accomplishments.But at 19 he was painfully shy and eager to change his behavior. In one exercise he staked out a bench in a park near his home, determined to talk to every woman who sat there alone. In one month, he said, he approached 130 women.“Thirty walked away immediately,” he said in the Times interview. “I talked with the other 100, for the first time in my life, no matter how anxious I was. Nobody vomited and ran away. Nobody called the cops.”Though he got only one date as a result, his shyness disappeared, he said. He similarly overcame a fear of speaking in public by making himself do just that, over and over. He became an accomplished public speaker.Dr. Ellis studied accounting at City College during the Depression and took up some entrepreneurial schemes after graduating. In one, he paired used men’s jackets and pants of similar colors and sold them as suits. He wrote fiction but found no publishers. He had read a good deal about sex and set up a bureau in which he counseled couples.His own first marriage, to Karyl Corper, an actress, in 1938, ended in annulment. His second, in 1956, to Rhoda Winter, a dancer, ended in divorce. For 37 years, from 1966 to 2003, he lived with a companion Janet L. Wolfe, a psychologist who had been executive director of the institute. More recently he married Debbie Joffe-Ellis, a psychologist and former assistant, who survives him.After receiving a doctorate in clinical psychology from Columbia in 1947, he spent several years undergoing classical psychoanalysis while using its techniques in his job at a state mental hygiene clinic in New Jersey. He quit in 1950 to begin private practice specializing in sex and marriage therapy and soon started drifting from Freudian orthodoxy, finding it, he said, a waste of time.He turned to Greek, Roman and modern philosophers and considered his own experience. Out of this came rational emotive behavioral therapy, which he decided would focus not on excavating childhood but on confronting the irrational thoughts that lead to self-destructive feelings and behavior. He founded his Manhattan institute in 1959.“I was hated by practically all psychologists and psychiatrists,” he recalled. They thought his approach was “superficial and stupid,” he said, and “they resented that I said therapy doesn’t have to take years.”In 2005, Dr. Ellis sued the institution after it removed him from its board and canceled his Friday seminars. He and his supporters claimed that the institute had fallen into the hands of psychologists who were moving it away from his revolutionary therapy techniques.The board said it had acted out of economic necessity, asserting that payouts to Dr. Ellis for medical and other expenses were jeopardizing the institute’s tax-exempt status. Dr. Ellis was by then requiring daily nursing care. Some board members said they were uncomfortable with his confrontational style and eccentricities and saw him as a liability.In January 2006, a state Supreme Court judge ruled that the board had been wrong in ousting Dr. Ellis without proper notice and reinstated him. But Ms. Rosellini, his spokeswoman, said Dr. Ellis’s relations with the board remained strained afterward.Despite his failing health, Dr. Ellis maintained a demanding schedule late into his life.“I’ll retire when I’m dead,” he said at 90. “While I’m alive, I want to keep doing what I want to do. See people. Give workshops. Write and preach the gospel according to St. Albert.”'"
"'07-07-24,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, July 23 (AP) — Netflix, the online DVD rental leader, expects its profit to sag the rest of the year as it absorbs the cost of lowering its prices and upgrading its customer service to ward off an intensifying threat from a rival, Blockbuster.The sobering forecast overshadowed the company’s second-quarter results, which were released on Monday after the stock market closed.The dimmer outlook — foreshadowed on Sunday when management announced the lower prices — weighed on Netflix’s already drooping stock.After plunging $2.36, or 12 percent, to end Monday’s regular session at $17.27, Netflix shares shed another 62 cents in extended trading.“We are in a very competitive, large battle,” Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said in an interview on Monday. “But we feel like we are still in a great position.”Hoping to retain more of its current customers while enticing new subscribers, Netflix, based in Los Gatos, Calif., is lowering monthly fees by $1 on its two most popular plans to match Blockbuster’s prices for comparable Internet-only services. The new rates take effect on Tuesday.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','The minimum wage rises 70 cents to $5.85 an hour today, the first increase in a decade. It ends the longest period without an increase since the federal minimum wage was enacted in 1938. The last previous increase came in September 1997. Legislation signed in May increases the wage 70 cents each summer until 2009, when it will reach $7.25 an hour. Government figures show about 1.7 million people earned $5.15 or less per hour in 2006. A person working 40 hours a week at the current minimum wage of $5.15 makes about $10,700 a year. A raise to $5.85 an hour would increase that to $12,168 a year before taxes. An increase to $7.25 would raise that to just over $15,000 a year.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','American Express said yesterday that record spending had fueled a 12 percent jump in profit.American Express, the card and travel service company based in New York, also said it had increased the amount of money it has reserved for loan losses, as have many other financial services companies, to brace for a continuing deterioration in credit quality.Net income rose to $1.06 billion in the second quarter, or 88 cents a share, from $945 million, or 76 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.Income from continuing operations also totaled 88 cents a share in the latest period, up from 78 cents a share a year ago.The results were helped by a surge in overseas profit, and a $65 million tax benefit related to the treatment of income from card fees in previous years. Total revenue rose to $7.13 billion, from $6.54 billion a year ago.The company’s results beat Wall Street forecasts. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial projected earnings of 86 cents a share on $7.49 billion of revenue.But in after-hours trading, the company’s shares fell about 1 percent.

"'07-07-24,'0','As F.B.I. officials, the news media and fans pore over video footage of games refereed by Tim Donaghy, looking for curious foul calls and other such behavior, several seconds of a game between the Chicago Bulls and the Golden State Warriors in February could attract attention.Donaghy, who resigned recently after completing his 13th season with the N.B.A., is under federal investigation for suspected betting on games in which he officiated and for an association with organized crime.The Bulls-Warriors game of Feb. 9, played at Golden State and broadcast on ESPN, was tied, 112-112, with 23 seconds remaining. While a Bulls guard dribbled between midcourt and the 3-point shot line — clearly working the clock down for an attempt at a final shot — Warriors center Andris Biedrens stood in the lane without guarding anyone for about seven seconds, which is grounds for a defensive three-seconds violation.Donaghy, stationed behind Biedrens on the baseline, clearly stepped forward and tapped Biedrens on the waist with 16 seconds left. Biedrens, by then at the edge of the lane, then immediately moved clear of the paint, and play continued.The penalty for defensive three seconds is the assessment of a technical foul and retention of the ball. Golden State could have faced a 3- or 4-point deficit before getting the ball back.Instead, the Bulls had a shot blocked with six seconds left, and Golden State missed a half-court heave to leave the score tied as regulation time ran out. The Warriors won in overtime, 123-121. According to several gambling Web sites, the odds opened with the Warriors favored by a point and a half.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','Ever since taking office, Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York has made a name for himself as the avenger, the reformer, a political whirlwind who kicks up dust wherever he goes. Albany’s smarmy politics certainly need a reformer and, within reason, an avenger. But now a devastating report from a fellow Democrat, Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, has accused Mr. Spitzer’s administration of abusing its power in the name of reform.The report describes how the governor’s office used the state police to collect damaging information about Mr. Spitzer’s chief opponent, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and then released that information to the press. Rather than a pursuit of possible wrongdoing, this episode has the smell of an old-fashioned dirty trick. If Mr. Spitzer does not make sure he has cleaned up his own house, his ability to clean up the rest of Albany could be severely compromised.This whole seamy business began a few weeks ago with news reports that Mr. Bruno was using state-owned helicopters and cars to attend party fund-raising events. When the governor’s office started talking about an investigation, Mr. Bruno did too. He wanted investigators to determine whether the governor was using the pilots and state police to spy on him and whether the governor’s people were then leaking that information to the news media.Mr. Cuomo’s report cleared the Senate leader of breaking New York’s very loose laws on the use of state transportation for political events. And it concluded that there was no surveillance ordered by the governor’s office. Instead it found that aides in the governor’s office had lied to state police — claiming they had received a Freedom of Information Law request — to get them to compile records of Mr. Bruno’s travel.At a press conference yesterday, a somewhat muted Governor Spitzer kept insisting that there were no laws broken, and that he was unaware of his aides’ actions. But he admitted that his office had conducted a “grossly mishandled” operation. And he apologized to the public, the state police and to Senator Bruno. Mr. Spitzer also announced that he had suspended one top aide indefinitely and transferred the other to a job outside the governor’s office. Mr. Spitzer now needs to make certain that all the dirty laundry has been fully aired and that any other participants are also dismissed.The governor has called for a review of his administration’s procedures for handling requests from the news media under the state’s Freedom of Information Law and for new, clearer rules for the use of state aircraft for political purposes.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','The proposal is tailored to reflect two major policy campaigns that Mr. Martin has led. He has urged cable television and satellite radio services to give consumers greater choices by offering à la carte price plans. And he has repeatedly denounced violent and vulgar programs, while suggesting that à la carte plans could solve that problem.The way the announcement deals with these issues increases the chances that the merger could ultimately be approved, although analysts said they believed it remained a close call.Through an aide, Mr. Martin declined to comment about the pricing plans. The aide said Mr. Martin “looks forward to reviewing the entire record.” The agency is expected to complete its review by the end of the year. The deal is also being examined for antitrust issues by the Justice Department, where it faces fewer obstacles.Consumer groups, which have denounced the deal as anticompetitive, applauded the announcement and said that it demonstrated that subscription services for television and radio could be sold on an à la carte basis.“It clearly shows that the companies are enormously fearful that the merger would otherwise be denied,” said Gene Kimmelman, vice president for federal affairs at the Consumers Union, which has urged the commission to reject the deal. “It doesn’t resolve long-term competition issues, but it is a wonderful step in the right direction. Kevin Martin will read it positively, but whether it is enough for him, I don’t know.”The merger has come under assault by the National Association of Broadcasters, which has considerable clout in Congress.“The history of antitrust law demonstrates that two hotly competitive companies will promise anything to become a monopoly,” said Dennis Wharton, executive vice president of the National Association of Broadcasters. “Policy makers should not be hoodwinked by today’s announcement, since nothing is stopping either XM or Sirius from individually offering consumers a more affordable choice in limited program packages.”The merger’s architect, Mel Karmazin, has responded that the relevant market for the services offered by the two satellite radio companies includes all terrestrial broadcasters, Internet radio and other popular listening devices, including iPods and portable music players.“It’s hard to imagine how two companies with a combined audience of 3.4 percent of the nationwide audience could harm competition,” said Mr. Karmazin, the chief executive of Sirius, at an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington on Monday where he announced the pricing plans. “The market is brimming with competition and would remain robust after a merger.”Mr. Karmazin said that the companies, which have never made a profit, were unable to offer à la carte plans if they did not merge because it would be too expensive. But he said that the merger would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual savings, much of which could be passed on to consumers. And he said that the plans were aimed at significantly increasing the number of subscribers. The companies have 14 million subscribers.In an interview, Mr. Karmazin said he did not know how long the rates would stay in effect and that he did not have “an end date or a predetermined time” in mind.“My hope is we would be able to offer it forever,” he said.He said that the merged company would consider offering some kind of rebate to customers who have to replace their radios to get the à la carte service. The new radios are expected to be in the same price range as those now being sold, he said.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','LOS ANGELES, July 23 (Reuters) — Drew Carey, come on down! You’re the next host of “The Price is Right.”The beefy actor-comedian revealed on a taping of the CBS “Late Show With David Letterman” on Monday that he had just signed on to succeed the recently retired Bob Barker as host of America’s longest-running game show.“It’s a done deal. I’m the new host of ‘The Price Is Right,’ ” Mr. Carey, 49, said during a guest appearance recorded for Mr. Letterman’s program Monday night, according to a transcript released by CBS.Mr. Carey — who starred on his own ABC sitcom, “The Drew Carey Show,” for several years and was host of the improvisational comedy “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” — was recently named host of another CBS game show, “Power of 10,” a weekly prime-time series that has its debut in August.A CBS spokeswoman said Mr. Carey would now star on both series.Mr. Carey acknowledged during a gathering of TV critics in Beverly Hills, Calif., last week that he was in talks with producers of “The Price Is Right” and joked that the show would not require him to work too hard.“All I’m doing is giving away prizes, and it’s not even my money,” he said.Mr. Barker, 83, ended his 35-year tenure as host of “The Price Is Right” when he retired last month from 50 years on national television. His final “Price Is Right” broadcast was shown on June 15, and the show will remain in summer reruns until it starts its new season with Mr. Carey in the fall.“The Price Is Right” features members of the studio audience who are beckoned to the stage when the announcer calls “Come on down!” to compete for prizes by guessing the cost of various items on display.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','WASHINGTON, July 23 — Bush administration officials said Monday that they were trying to help Iraqis working for the American Embassy in Iraq to immigrate to the United States, but they also conceded that a gap remained between American words and actions on the issue.Efforts to assist Iraqis who work for the embassy have vaulted to the top of an informal State Department priority list at a time when the United States is struggling to respond to the ever growing number of refugees seeking to flee sectarian fighting. Many of those employees run the risk of being the targets of various militias because of their association with the American government.As of June 30, the United States had admitted 69 locally employed Iraqis on “special immigrant visa” status this year, with 93 more cases pending, State Department officials said. But that status, as defined by Congress, can be applied only to interpreters and translators, which excludes a range of Iraqis, from drivers to soldiers.State Department officials said they were working with Congress and the Homeland Security Department to accelerate the processing of immigrant visas and grant refugee status to the American Embassy’s local employees in Iraq. As first reported Sunday in The Washington Post, Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador to Iraq, sent a cable to Washington on July 9 pressing the administration to issue immigrant visas to all Iraqis employed by the American government.Administration officials said that Mr. Crocker’s sentiments were widely shared in the State Department, and that the administration had been working with Congress and the Department of Homeland Security to try to work through the backlog of immigration requests. “Everybody has the same concern here,” said Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman. “They want to take care of the people with whom they work on a daily basis — those of whom might feel under threat.”'"
"'07-07-24,'0','Already, a deal the governor, a Democrat, announced last week with legislative leaders that would tighten state campaign finance laws seemed in jeopardy of unraveling, Republican lawmakers said on Monday.Rightly or wrongly, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have tired of Mr. Spitzer’s oratorical volleys are evoking Watergate by asking: What did the governor know and when did he know it?Any comparisons to that 1970s scandal have to be tempered by the fact that the report issued by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, says that no laws were broken.But the report says that the governor’s communications director, Darren Dopp, and his top liaison to the State Police, William F. Howard, orchestrated a campaign to discredit the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, by pressuring the State Police to create — and in some instances recreate — records of the senator’s use of state aircraft and police escorts.It also suggests that the governor’s staff lied when they tried to explain what they had done and pressured the State Police to go far beyond their normal procedures in documenting Mr. Bruno’s whereabouts. The report concluded, however, that the State Police did not conduct an outright surveillance operation of Mr. Bruno, a Republican.The report also says that a Freedom of Information Law request by The Times Union of Albany asking for records relating to Mr. Bruno’s travel was handled personally by Preston L. Felton, the acting superintendent of the State Police — and with unusual speed.Three previous superintendents interviewed in the report “all stated that they had never personally handled a FOIL request and could not imagine doing so,” the report said. Mr. Felton, who was seeking promotion to superintendent, had been asked by the governor’s staff to make sure the request was fulfilled.The governor suspended Mr. Dopp on Monday and reassigned Mr. Howard, and said that he had not been aware that anything improper was done. The claim was met with skepticism from politicians in both parties, since the governor is known to be something of a micromanager.“Did the governor know?” asked Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Long Island Republican and the deputy majority leader. He said the report “leaves many questions open in terms of how far up the chain of command were the acts of — at least the acts of Dopp and Howard — known?”Mr. Skelos added that he believed it would be “totally appropriate” for the Senate Committee on Investigations and Government Operations, which has subpoena power, to review the matter. It is expected that the Senate will do just that. Mr. Skelos is a member of the committee.“You have the makings of a real conspiracy here,” he added.Another Senate committee is considering investigating a multimillion-dollar loan the governor’s father gave him when he ran for attorney general in the 1990s, a loan Mr. Spitzer has acknowledged not being truthful about.Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, a Harlem Democrat who has been one of the governor’s most outspoken critics, said the findings of the report sound “very Nixonian.”“Hopefully that’s now over and we can learn how to govern,” he added. “It’s now time for the cloak and dagger to be over.”A little over six months ago, when Mr. Spitzer took office, everything seemed lined up in his favor.He could rightly claim a mandate after his election by a record margin last November, capturing nearly 70 percent of the vote and winning comfortably in all regions of the state.The Republican Party was in disarray, having been swept out of the state’s four top posts — governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller. Mr. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, had revealed in late December that he was the subject of a federal investigation of his outside business, leaving the effective leader of the Republican Party operating under a cloud.And Mr. Spitzer had even persuaded a rising Republican star, Senator Michael A. L. Balboni, to come work for his administration, narrowing the majority in the last statewide Republican power base to a precarious two seats.Six months later, Mr. Spitzer’s administration has been knocked on its heels.His problems stem in part from the fact that unlike the business executives who often found themselves in his crosshairs when he was attorney general, legislators have far more power to fight back.Moreover, Mr. Spitzer appears to have energized a Republican Party that was listless not long ago.Already, Republicans are having second thoughts on a deal reached last week to tighten the state’s porous campaign finance laws, though lawmakers in the Assembly and the Senate said they planned to return to Albany on Thursday to vote on another part of the deal that would create a commission to study Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s congestion pricing plan.“I have not seen a draft bill,” Mr. Skelos said of the campaign finance proposal. “I think a lot of it is just the governor putting out his wish list in terms of campaign finance.”Speaking of the governor and his staff, Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said, “They need to rethink their direction and they need to figure out if they have any reservoir of good will left.”“It’s very hard to tell if they do,” he said.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','Not surprisingly, the chairman of the Garfield County Commission, D. Maloy Dodds, sees things differently. The county, Mr. Dodds said, was prohibited from helping any individual property owner, including Ruby’s Inn — until Monday, when it had no choice but to recognize Bryce Canyon City as a separate entity.“We got shafted,” Mr. Dodds said. “I think it’s just wrong that a private corporation can incorporate as a town and use taxpayers’ money to enhance their business. It’s an unfair business advantage.”The Syrett family’s efforts to become a town date to the 1970s, although it was not until the last three years that Mr. Syrett pursued it seriously.This year, the Utah Legislature stripped counties of discretion in deciding petitions from property owners seeking to become towns or cities. Bryce Canyon City is the first town formed under the new law.To qualify as a town, Ruby’s Inn had to prove it had at least 100 year-round residents.Since Ruby’s was not counted separately in the 2000 census, a special state committee conducted a person-by-person head count — observed by a company employee and a county official — to ensure that all 138 residents were not seasonal employees, said Mike Mower, the state planning coordinator for the Office of Planning and Budget. The committee also examined voter registration and school enrollment records, Mr. Mower said.“We knew it would have a profound impact on the county’s general fund,” he said, “and we also recognized that it would be a close count.”Mr. Dodds has warned Garfield County residents to prepare for a property tax increase that he said would average about $50 a year, nearly double the current amount they pay to the county. This does not include school taxes, which will not be affected.Ruby’s Inn was founded by Mr. Syrett’s grandfather, Reuben C. Syrett, whom everyone called Ruby. In 1916, Ruby moved to the area to homestead a 160-acre ranch 20 miles east of Panguitch, where his family ran mills. But he found he could earn more by housing and feeding visitors to the colorful and dramatic wind-formed stone formations in Bryce Canyon.“He decided the tourism business was better than ranching,” Mr. Syrett said.His grandfather’s donation of land to Utah for construction of a modern road “was the smartest move because it gave him the exclusive entrance to the park,” he said.The Union Pacific Railroad soon began carrying tourists on a circuit, with stops at Zion National Park, the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon — and Ruby’s Inn.Eight decades later, more than a million tourists visit Bryce Canyon each year. The company employs 600 people during the peak season, making it Garfield County’s largest employer, Mr. Syrett said. On any day from April to October, Ruby’s Inn has more visitors than the entire 4,772-person population of the rural county.On Monday, the County Commission also selected Bryce Canyon City’s five Town Council members, all of whom are members of the Syrett family. The first election will be in 2009.Mr. Syrett, 61, board president of Ruby’s Inn Inc., is the town’s first mayor, a position he said he never sought.“I hate meetings,” he said. “I’m getting old, and I’d like to step out and do some fun things.”'"
"'07-07-24,'0','BRUSSELS, July 23 — A revamped European Union treaty came a step closer to becoming a reality on Monday after Poland seemed to retreat from its previous threats to undermine the agreement.Anna Fotyga, the Polish foreign minister, dropped a demand that countries should be able to delay any disputed decision for up to two years, a move that would have effectively dangled a Polish veto over crucial European Union policies. She said Poland would not insist on opening a discussion on the organization’s voting system, which favors more-populous countries at the expense of medium-size ones like Poland.“We are optimistic,” she said. “Poland does not have a problem with the treaty.”The treaty was one of several topics under discussion on Monday at a meeting of European foreign ministers here.Portugal, which holds the organization’s rotating presidency, said Poland’s new conciliatory spirit would make it easier to transform political agreement on a text into legal reality at a summit meeting in October. “I wouldn’t dare to say there are no more doubts on the text,” said Luís Amado, the Portuguese foreign minister. “But every member state is committed at this point.”The new treaty is considered vital to helping the European Union overcome an institutional impasse that began when France and the Netherlands rejected its constitution in votes two years ago.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','Analysts now forecast that Januvia and Janumet, a related Merck drug, could have combined worldwide sales of nearly $5 billion by 2013, a figure that would make them among the top-selling drugs globally.Meanwhile, Gardasil is likely to have peak sales of $2 billion to $3 billion annually, analysts say. Many doctors have recommended that young girls receive the vaccine as a matter of course, before they become sexually active.“Gardasil has been performing up to expectations, and Januvia has the makings of a very, very significant franchise,” said Robert Hazlett, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.Until last year, analysts expected that Merck and Novartis would split the market for a class of new diabetes medicines known as DPP-IV inhibitors. But safety concerns have delayed Novartis’s drug, Galvus, giving Merck the market to itself.“Merck will have the lion’s share of the marketplace for years to come,” Mr. Hazlett said. “I’m impressed, and I continue to be, by the rate of progress of their pipeline.”Merck’s results were so strong that the company was able to exceed expectations even though it added $210 million to its Vioxx legal defense fund. The company said it now faces 26,000 lawsuits covering a total of 44,000 plaintiffs over the arthritis drug, which it stopped selling in 2004 on evidence that it could cause heart problems.Merck’s gains come in sharp contrast to the problems at Pfizer, the world’s largest drug company. Last week, Pfizer reported profits short of expectations and said that sales of Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering medicine that is its largest and most important drug, had plunged 13 percent compared to 2006.Despite heavy advertising, Pfizer has been unable to stem declines in Lipitor, which faces increasing competition from the generic version of Zocor, a Merck drug that lost its patent protection last year. So far, at least, Merck seems to have weathered the patent expiration on Zocor more easily than Pfizer.“Merck has new products, which are in short supply in big pharma,” said Les Funtleyder, a drug industry analyst at Miller Tabak, and a bull on Merck. “We’ve changed from a Vioxx story to a turnaround story, and now we’re changing from a turnaround story to a growth story.”For the quarter, Merck posted sales of $6.1 billion, a 6 percent increase from the comparable period last year, when sales were $5.8 billion. Including minor one-time charges, profits were $1.7 billion, compared with $1.5 billion a year earlier, and profits were 77 cents a share, compared with 69 cents.Looking ahead Merck said it would earn $3 to $3.10 a share this year, excluding certain minor revamping charges, compared with analysts’ previous estimates of $2.93 a share. Merck also reaffirmed that it expects to post double-digit per share profit growth from 2005 to 2010.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','“Rick & Steve: The Happiest Gay Couple in All the World,” a new comedy on Logo, is like an old salt whose filthy mouth belies a gentle spirit. It speaks raunchily, but it behaves judiciously. The publicity surrounding it billed the show as a gay “South Park,” but the comparison obtains superficially, and even there you might quibble.“Rick & Steve” uses robotic figures and stop-motion animation. And it harbors far less anarchy in its soul, mocking the normative values now favored in gay and lesbian life as wholeheartedly as it endorses them. The series isn’t so much a gay “South Park” as it is a “Honeymooners” for our post-“Will & Grace” age.Based on short films by Q. Allan Brocka, “Rick & Steve” is arguably even more conventional than that. Though set in the middle of the baby boom, “The Honeymooners” did not concern itself with child rearing, a subject so dear to the cultural interest that it is unavoidable even in comedy’s most seemingly subversive pockets. It says something that the grossest joke on “Rick & Steve” thus far hasn’t been about illicit sex but about procreation.Illicit sex scares Rick and Steve, a longtime suburban gay couple who wrestle with a request from their lesbian best friends, Kirsten and Dana, to assist in the production of a baby. Another young friend is paired with an older man who is H.I.V. positive. (“You married me when it was cool to have a boyfriend with AIDS,” he growls at his partner.) Everyone on the show is coupled.Rick and Steve are married too, and they work at their monogamy. One night after they venture to a club, they return home horrified by the idea of guys in leather and the whole promiscuous scene to which they have been momentarily privy. This sends them to a couples therapist, who advises that each engage in the other’s hobby; Rick’s is Men-zuh, an organization of gay geniuses.“Rick & Steve” derives much of its humor from stereotype: lesbians who yearn to get home to grout tubs and ones who seek “nondenominational cleanser.” Some of it is clever, but none of it challenges heterosexual assumptions about what gay life ought to look like. The difference-versus-equality debates that factionalized nearly every social movement of the 20th century seem well over in the gay and lesbian world. “Rick & Steve” is just more proof of how forcefully one side has won.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','Mr. Branson said that Virgin’s research showed a “mood change in the last five years” among business travelers, who “want to sit in an airplane with people who are also working.”Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, said that his airline was also studying routes and fare structures for all-business-class flights.Like Virgin, British Air would outfit smaller aircraft with a modified version of its existing and highly regarded business-class service on new routes between the United States and major European cities beyond London.“This is clearly a real opportunity for us,” Mr. Walsh said.Lufthansa dipped its toe in the all-business-class market in 2002 with a single flight in a partnership with the Swiss charter jet company PrivatAir. Lufthansa said recently that it was expanding its all-business-class service with a flight between Newark and Frankfurt beginning in late October.Dodging the masses to travel on a business-class flight has less to do with snobbery than with practicality for business travelers, said Henry H. Harteveldt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research.“If you tell a business traveler, ‘You can get to the airport 35 or 45 minutes before we close the door, and we guarantee you that you and your luggage will get there,’ that is worth extra money,” Mr. Harteveldt said. Many corporate travel managers, he said, are increasingly inclined to approve higher fares in exchange for improved productivity from traveling employees.Not that the sky is the limit. Walk-up round-trip business-class fares on major trans-Atlantic carriers can be as high as $10,000. While some travelers pay full fare, most do not. Large corporations that guarantee high volume can negotiate discounts of 40 percent or more off walk-up fares.But even walk-up fares on the start-up business-class airlines typically begin below the corporate discount level.The start-ups say that they attract travelers from small companies or entrepreneurs and others who do not have the clout to negotiate volume discounts from major airlines.On Friday, a walk-up round-trip fare to London on Eos (which flies 757s with 44 flat-bed seats) was $5,400.The other start-ups, which offer less luxurious but competitive business-class products, have lower fares. On Silverjet, for example, the walk-up round-trip fare to London was $3,254. MAXjet’s walk-up fare was $2,600. On l’Avion, which flies between Newark and Orly Airport in Paris, the walk-up round-trip fare was $1,650.Even without corporate discounts, advance bookings on Silverjet are as little as $1,600 round trip; Eos charges as little as $2,549.An entry by Virgin and British Air into an all-business-class market dominated by the start-ups would pose new challenges for major United States carriers that offer trans-Atlantic flights like American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, Mr. Harteveldt said.While some of the United States carriers are upgrading their business-class cabins — United announced yesterday that it would upgrade its business-class cabins on overseas flights with lie-flat seats, becoming the first American carrier to offer the seats — the domestic carriers have not yet reacted aggressively to the competition from the all-business-class start-ups.“I’m not surprised that Eos, MAXjet, Silverjet and l’Avion are gaining traction,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “I’m not surprised that Virgin and British Airways have taken notice. But I am surprised that American carriers haven’t tried to nip this in the bud.”One logical response, he said, would be for a domestic carrier to convert smaller planes — perhaps Boeing 737s or Airbus A319s and A320s — to all-business-class service on some trans-Atlantic routes, including some from busy locations like Hartford, Philadelphia or Raleigh, N.C.“Our research shows that 50 percent of business travelers say they are willing to pay an above-average price for a noticeably better quality travel time,” Mr. Harteveldt said. Furthermore, only about a third of business travelers describe themselves as “brand loyal” to a specific airline, he said.Bill Stockbridge, MAXjet’s chief executive, said that his airline had three major markets: entrepreneurs and small-business people who do not have access to big corporate discounts, high-end leisure travelers and international passengers from big companies with travel policies that restrict them to premium economy travel on major airlines.The start-ups are all expanding and looking for new aircraft.In September, Eos will add eight weekly flights, for a total of 40, between Kennedy Airport in New York and Stansted Airport in London. MAXjet, which flies to Stansted from New York, Washington and Las Vegas, is adding a route from Los Angeles next month and recently applied for permission to fly between Seattle and Shanghai in 2009.Silverjet plans to add a third route between Newark and London Luton Airport by the end of the year. L’Avion plans to add a second flight between Paris and Newark next year. Marc Rochet, the airline’s chief executive, said that l’Avion’s plans could include adding routes to Paris and other European cities from other American cities.All the start-ups are burning cash, though all insist they are sufficiently capitalized. Load factors — the percentage of available seats sold — have generally exceeded the airlines’ expectations. MAXjet, for example, said its June load factor was 83.1 percent.Virgin Atlantic and British Air say they need to tread lightly into the market, being careful not to detract from their existing top-tier (and top-dollar) business-class service.“We now have five people working on the fare structure,” Paul Charles, a Virgin spokesman, said. Virgin, whose fleet is dominated by wide-body aircraft like 747s and A340s, has said it would need to spend about $700 million to acquire smaller, narrow-body aircraft for all-business-class use.British Air already has suitable aircraft that it could readily convert, Mr. Walsh said. “We have 21 767s and 13 757s,” he said. “We could use some of those aircraft and move quickly.”Like Virgin, British Air would concentrate on trans-Atlantic routes to cities other than London.Mr. Rochet of l’Avion said that Virgin and British Airways, saddled with cost structures of major airlines, face a problem setting fares that will compete with the all-business-class start-ups.“L’Avion, MAXjet, Eos and Silverjet are not only all-business-class airlines, but they’re also low-fare airlines with lean cost structures,” he said.Naturally, the market will shake out as more competitors enter. “Ultimately, you’re going to see a large number of business-only carriers,” Mr. Charles of Virgin said.That, he said, is the biggest challenge for the start-ups. “They certainly paved the way for the second generation in the market to emerge,” he said. “But what happens to the first generation?”Mr. Rochet said he is betting that most of the first generation will endure.“In my view and in my shareholders’ views, because we are always speaking money at the end of the day, we find that Virgin and B.A. joining this model is really proof that this is a very valuable niche market,” he said. “But we are already in it.”'"
"'07-07-24,'0','DETROIT, July 23 — The United Automobile Workers opened negotiations today on new contracts covering hourly workers at General Motors and the Ford Motor Company, setting the stage for what are being called the most crucial talks in a generation.Union leaders shook hands in the morning with officials at G.M. in Detroit, then traveled to Ford in the afternoon. G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, was on hand for opening ceremonies there, while Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, and the company’s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., participated in the traditional handshakes there. Talks opened Friday with the Chrysler Group, which was the first to sign a deal with the U.A.W. in 2003. Contracts with the three companies expire Sept. 14.The Detroit carmakers, which collectively lost $15 billion last year, say they must drastically cut costs in order to narrow their competitive gap with foreign rivals, particularly Toyota and Honda of Japan. Although G.M. asserts that it is successfully restructuring, its chief negotiator said the company cannot afford another contract as generous as the current agreement.“While we have made significant progress as a company, there’s still a lot more work to do,” said Diana Tremblay, G.M.’s vice president for labor relations for North America. “We need to make some changes to make the business sustainable in the long term.”Ms. Tremblay said health care was one issue that must be addressed, particularly for retirees, which outnumber active workers for the first time in the union’s history. She said retirees accounted for $3 billion of the $4.8 billion that G.M. paid last year for health care.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','The fewer nurses there are on duty in an intensive care unit, the more people on respirators get pneumonia, a new study has found.Swiss researchers followed 936 people from admission to discharge who received mechanically assisted breathing during a four-year period in an intensive care unit of a hospital in Geneva. There were 262 episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia, or V.A.P., during the study. Late onset V.A.P.— infection after six days on ventilation — accounted for 61 percent of all episodes.According to background information in the paper, published July 19 online in Critical Care, ventilator-associated pneumonia causes significant mortality, increases hospital stay by as much as 50 days and leads to substantial extra costs.The average nurse-to-patient ratio in the study period was 1.9 to 1, depending on shift and ward population. After controlling for age, gender, disease and other variables, the researchers found that incidence of pneumonia was associated with an average of .78 nurses per patient two to four days before early onset V.A.P. and .42 nurses per patient two to four days before late-onset V.A.P. The low nurse-to-patient ratio was a significant risk factor for ventilator-associated pneumonia.One reason for increased infections, said Dr. Stéphane Hugonnet, the lead author of the study and an epidemiologist at the University of Geneva Hospitals, is that “nurses have too much work to do and don’t comply with basic hygiene rules.”“But,” he added, “there have been good studies that find a close relationship between work load, job satisfaction, intention to leave and burnout — and all of these were related to increased infection as well.”'"
"'07-07-24,'0','People with many moles may be more susceptible to skin cancer, but a new study suggests that their cells may age more slowly than those of people with fewer moles.As cells age, telomeres, the DNA at the ends of chromosomes, become shorter. Shorter telomere length has been linked to chronic diseases like diabetes and atherosclerosis. The number of moles a person has also decreases with age.The researchers, led by Dr. Véronique Bataille, a consultant dermatologist at King’s College London, measured the number of moles and the telomere length of the white blood cells of more than 1,800 women ages 18 to 79.After adjusting for age, they found that the women with the most moles also had the longest telomeres — the equivalent of a difference of six to seven years less cell aging compared with those who had the fewest moles. The paper appears in the July issue of Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention.“I haven’t found the elixir of youth,” Dr. Bataille said. “The next step is research to find out if this has clinical implications.”The authors acknowledge that moles are influenced by environmental and genetic factors, and that this study does not prove that longer telomeres cause moles to endure.'"
"'07-07-24,'0','In a review of scientific data, the Food and Drug Administration has found almost no evidence that tomatoes or the antioxidant lycopene have any effect in cancer prevention.The review, published online July 10 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, examined 81 studies of lycopene and concluded that none produced any credible evidence to support a relationship between consumption of the antioxidant either in food or dietary supplements, and the risk for prostate, lung, colorectal, gastric, breast, ovarian, endometrial or pancreatic cancer.The authors also examined 64 observational studies of tomato or tomato product consumption and cancer risk. Twenty-five of them were eliminated because they were a republication of old data or because they had deficiencies that prevented drawing scientific conclusions. Of the 39 remaining studies, the authors found no evidence that tomato consumption reduced the risk of lung, breast, colorectal, endometrial or cervical cancer. They concluded that it was at best very unlikely that eating tomatoes had any effect on the risk for pancreatic, prostate, gastric or ovarian cancer.There is no basis, the authors write, for manufacturers to make health claims for lycopene as a food ingredient or a dietary supplement, and they said claims about the effect of tomatoes on prostate, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer should be qualified by noting that such assertions are unlikely, uncertain or lacking in scientific evidence.A separate study, published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found that a low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables had no benefit in preventing the recurrence of breast cancer.'"

"'07-07-25,'1','SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 — Apple reported a 74 percent jump in quarterly profit today, coming in ahead of Wall Street forecasts.The company’s profit for the third quarter was $818 million, or 92 cents a share, up from $472 million, or 54 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street had forecast net income of $645.6 million, or 72 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial.“We’re thrilled to report the highest June quarter revenue and profit in Apple’s history, along with the highest quarterly Mac sales ever,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive.The company shipped 1,764,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 33 percent growth over the year-ago quarter. It sold 9.8 million iPods, for growth of 21 percent.After falling initially, Apple shares were up more than 9 percent in after-hours trading, to nearly $150. They had ended the regular session at $137.12, up $2.23. Investor excitement over the iPhone’s potential has helped drive up Apple shares more than 50 percent since the product was announced in January.Investors were spooked on Tuesday when AT&T revealed it had activated just 146,000 iPhones in the day and a half after its release, far less than the 500,000 or so some analysts had expected. The news sent Apple’s stock down 6 percent.'"
"'07-07-25,'1','Which raises a question: was Mr. Carey that desperate for work?“Well I don’t need the money,” said Mr. Carey, 49, whose two network series — “The Drew Carey Show” and “Whose Line Is It Anyway” — live on in lucrative reruns after ending within the last few years. And yet, while he wouldn’t disclose his new salary, he acknowledged that “I like the fact that I’m getting paid.”But the most important factor in his decision, Mr. Carey said, was that he relished the idea of regularly giving away a new car or a new refrigerator or a vacation to somebody who probably really needed it. He acknowledged, for example, that his minimum tip — even for a hamburger at Denny’s, or a Coke at a Cracker Barrel — is typically $100, and sometimes much more.“I just want to share the wealth,” he said. “And by doing ‘Price Is Right,’ that’s what I’ll be doing every day.”As a long-time stand-up comedian who worked a lot of nights, Mr. Carey said he had become very familiar with “The Price Is Right,” because “it came on right around the time I was waking up.”Asked to size up Mr. Barker’s appeal, Mr. Carey put it this way: “He has good empathy for all the players. He wants them to win. You can hug him. He went from being your dad and your uncle to your grandfather. You know, ‘He’s Bob, he’s on my side.’ ”Mr. Carey said he hoped to bring a similar warmth to his new role, and that while he was confident he could extract plenty of humor from his guests’ anxieties — mainly through his efforts to try to calm them down — he would not seek to mine laughs by making fun of them. He also said he was confident that whatever dirty jokes he still liked to tell, particularly in places like Las Vegas, would stay in Las Vegas.Regular viewers of “The Price Is Right,” he says, can rest assured that beyond getting used to his blond-brown crew cut in place of Mr. Barker’s white mane, little about the show will change. An announcer will still prod contestants from the audience with the signature “Come on down!” And beyond a few touch-ups, the set is also “going to look very familiar.”One change that he and the producers are planning, he said, is periodically to take the show, which is based in Los Angeles, on the road, and broadcast for a week or so from various cities.But beyond that, Mr. Carey said the biggest adjustment would be within his own head, as he adapts not only to his role on “The Price Is Right” but also as host of a new game show, “Power of 10,” which will make its debut on the prime-time schedule at CBS on Aug. 7.“I’m going to be a game-show host the rest of my life,” Mr. Carey said. “I had to come to terms with that.”And then he laughed.'"

"'07-07-25,'1','Nationally, home prices have not fallen in the 35 years or so that the government and private services have tracked them. Some researchers like Robert J. Shiller of Yale have compiled data that goes as far back as 1890 and shows that home prices fell for several years during the 1930s.Mr. Mozilo said that because of a large number of homes on the market, the housing sector would continue to suffer until sometime in 2008 and not begin recovering until 2009.Shares of Countrywide fell 10.5 percent, or $3.56 yesterday, to $30.50. The stock steadily declined during the conference call, falling as far as $29.50 before recovering.Countrywide’s earnings were the latest in a series of shocks that have rattled the markets in the last two months. Recently, Bear Stearns said two of its hedge funds were virtually worthless after brash bets on investments backed by risky mortgages with billions in borrowed money.Last month, the usually optimistic Robert I. Toll, the chairman and chief executive of the luxury home builder Toll Brothers, acknowledged that housing might not rebound before April 2008. In early February, Mr. Toll had told Wall Street analysts the industry was “at the beginning of the comeback trail.”Bond ratings agencies have begun to downgrade and re-evaluate mortgage securities, which has virtually shut down the market for certain debt offerings that specialize in home loans. That, in turn, has made it harder for some private equity firms to finance buyouts.Countrywide, Wells Fargo and other lenders have also stopped offering a popular subprime loan that carried a fixed rate for 2 years and an adjustable rate for 28 years.Investors are demanding more in return for holding junk bonds and yesterday pushed the yields on the securities to 8.4 percent, the highest they have been in nearly two years, according to KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm.What was added to the worries yesterday was the idea that even credit-worthy homeowners would default on mortgages at higher rates as home prices fall — and that even a well-run company like Countrywide could be hit by big losses.At the end of April, home prices were down 2.1 percent from a year ago, according to an index that tracks 20 large metropolitan areas compiled by the research firm Case-Shiller. That compares with an 11.2 percent increase from April 2005 to April 2006.Countrywide said about 5.4 percent of the home equity loans to customers with good credit that it held an interest in were past due at the end of June, up from 2.2 percent at the end of June 2006. By comparison, more than a fifth of subprime loans were past due at the end of June, up from 13.4 percent a year ago.“Where you will see prime borrowers have trouble is where they took the riskiest of adjustable-rate mortgages and put nothing down with a first and second combined,” Thomas Lawler, a housing economist, said.Many of Countrywide’s home equity loans were second mortgages made to people who were financing the full or nearly full cost of their homes. These loans are particularly risky because when house prices are falling and a home is foreclosed and resold, the holder of the first lien is paid off and often there is little left to apply to the second mortgage.“Countrywide is highlighting what is an industrywide problem,” said Christopher C. Brendler, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus, an investment firm in St. Louis. A second mortgage “is really an unsecured loan like a credit card.”Countrywide said its customers who are falling behind on payments appear to have lost jobs, had a divorce or fallen ill. Many are living in homes that are no longer worth what they were when the loan was made and cannot refinance because lenders have become stricter.The company reported second-quarter earnings fell 33 percent, to $485 million, largely because it had to write down the value of loans and other assets by $923 million.Another problem is how Countrywide pays Mr. Mozilo, 68, and one of the company’s two founders. Though he is considered a pioneer in the mortgage business, he has become a target for shareholder activists as more attention has focused on executive pay in general and on the lucrative rewards reaped by mortgage executives in particular during the housing boom.On the conference call yesterday, one investor asked Mr. Mozilo how he could justify selling stock while Countrywide was buying shares, which have fallen.In the last five years, Mr. Mozilo has exercised options and sold shares for a profit of nearly $380 million, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial. Starting last fall, Mr. Mozilo significantly increased the number of shares he was selling on a regular basis for profits of more than $130 million.“The decision to buy back stock is a collective decision that emanates from the financial operation of the company and is based on what is in the best interests for the shareholders,” he said, noting that he has all the shares he received when he started the company nearly 40 years ago. “It’s totally unrelated to the issue of my sale of stocks.”'"

"'07-07-25,'1','Richard G. Lindner, AT&T’s chief financial officer, described demand for the iPhone as strong, and said AT&T expected it to contribute substantially to the company’s future revenue growth.“We were absolutely elated with the launch. It couldn’t have gone better,” Mr. Lindner said in an interview. He conceded there had been problems with activation, and also delays because many business customers had to wait until the Monday after the phone’s debut to get their service started.Mr. Lindner said demand for the device at AT&T’s stores has outstripped supply, and that the company sold out of iPhones within the first two days they were on sale. It wasn’t until last week that the company was able to catch up with demand, he said. Apple officials said they could not comment on iPhone sales ahead of their earnings announcement, citing securities laws.A bright spot for AT&T in the quarter’s iPhone numbers was that roughly 40 percent of the iPhone subscribers were new AT&T customers. Mr. Lindner also pointed out that iPhone subscribers tend to sign up for more expensive service plans than other wireless customers.Eugene Munster, an analyst covering Apple at Piper Jaffray, said iPhone sales were largely in line with analysts’ earliest targets, but as public excitement grew, so did investor expectations. “Our belief all along has been that there is a surge of demand coming for the iPhone, but it is hard to predict when that surge will hit,” he said.Mr. Munster compared the iPhone introduction to that of the iPod, which was viewed as a disappointment in the fourth quarter of 2004. Apple sold 4.6 million iPods in that quarter, while Wall Street had expected sales of 8 million. Mr. Munster said the iPhone would most likely show a similar gradual growth, with a surge in 2009.The iPhone numbers overshadowed an otherwise strong quarter for AT&T in which it largely met or exceeded expectations. AT&T’s revenues from data services, which include text messaging, e-mail and Internet access on smartphones, rose nearly 67 percent to $1.7 billion from a year earlier. Mr. Lindner said that only 60 percent of AT&T’s wireless customers now use data services, indicating big potential for growth.Wireless growth continued, with service revenues up nearly 15 percent year over year, while wireless subscribers rose by 1.5 million to 63.7 million. AT&T’s churn rate, a measure of customer turnover, declined slightly during the quarter.AT&T said its profit rose to $2.9 billion, or 47 cents a share, from $1.81 billion, or 46 cents a share in the quarter last year.Excluding costs for major acquisitions, the company’s profit rose 21 percent to 70 cents a share, up from 58 cents and above the 67 cents forecast by analysts, according to Thomson Financial.AT&T’s revenue was $29.5 billion, up from $15.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. Revenue in the wireless unit grew 13 percent to $10.4 billion.“The quarter was largely in line,” said Christopher King, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. As for iPhone subscriptions, “I think you could make the broad argument that expectations were way out of whack.”Like the bulk of the phone industry, AT&T is seeing a decline in its standard phone business. Last quarter the company lost 193,000 landlines. But revenue in that unit rose during the quarter due largely to the BellSouth merger. AT&T’s landline business had a 25 percent increase in revenue to $17.99 billion, while profits increased 54 percent to $3.11 billion.The company reported steady growth in the subscriber base for its U-verse television service, which is now available in 23 cities. By the end of June, U-verse had 51,000 subscribers, up from 13,000 at the end of the first quarter.'"
"'07-07-25,'1','WASHINGTON, July 24 — The Small Business Administration, which runs the federal government’s largest program to help disaster victims rebuild their houses, improperly canceled thousands of loans it had promised homeowners along the Gulf Coast after the 2005 hurricanes, a government audit has found.The agency canceled nearly 8,000 loans without calling the borrowers or mailing them a notice, according to the audit by the agency’s inspector general. The homeowners did eventually receive a letter contending that they had voluntarily given up their loans, the report says, even though many told auditors that they actually needed the money.The loans were canceled last year, after the agency had come under fire for being slow to give out rebuilding money, according to the audit. Former agency employees have complained that they were pressured to withdraw the loans to cut the number of applicants whose loans had been approved but not paid out.A spokeswoman for the agency declined to comment on the report.The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, which is examining problems with the agency’s disaster loan program, is planning a hearing on the audit on Wednesday.“We all wanted to see the loans processed and disbursed more quickly and the red tape removed,” said Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the committee. “Unfortunately, even with good intentions, some disaster victims are still being left behind, and that’s not acceptable.”'"
"'07-07-25,'1','Patrick Arnold, a chemist who worked with the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative, said in an HBO Sports interview that Barry Bonds and Gary Sheffield took performance-enhancing drugs provided to them by the laboratory.Bonds and Sheffield have denied knowingly using drugs provided by Balco, and told that to a federal grand jury investigating the laboratory, according to leaked testimony. Bonds remains under investigation over concerns about his testimony.Arnold is widely credited with creating “the clear,” a previously undetectable steroid that Balco provided to athletes. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute steroids, and was sentenced to three months in prison and three months of home confinement. He was among five people convicted in the case. As part of his plea agreement, he did not have to name athletes and coaches to whom he supplied drugs.The HBO interview was shown last night on “Costas Now.” Arnold told Bob Costas, the show’s host, that he never met Bonds but often heard Balco’s founder, Victor Conte, raving about Bonds’s performance on “the program.”When asked by Costas if “the program” included steroids, Arnold said: “I have a very strong feeling about it since he was on the program. And like everyone else, the program consisted of the clear.”'"
"'07-07-25,'1','WASHINGTON, July 24 — A businessman accused of stashing $205 million in drug money in the walls and closets of his Mexico City mansion will have the chance to explain how it got there. He was arrested this week near Washington on drug smuggling charges.The suspect, Zhenli Ye Gon, was taken into custody on Monday night as he dined in a popular Chinese restaurant in the Washington suburb of Wheaton, Md.Lawyers for Mr. Ye Gon, a Chinese-Mexican who was wanted in the United States and Mexico on narcotics charges, said he had traveled here in hopes of being tried in the United States rather than in Mexico, which is expected to seek his extradition.Mr. Ye Gon, 44, is accused of being one of the largest methamphetamine traffickers in the Western Hemisphere, a reputation seemingly bolstered by the discovery of the $205 million, most of it in huge bundles of $100 bills, as well as $22 million in other currencies and traveler’s checks, in a raid in March on his home in an affluent neighborhood of Mexico City. The Drug Enforcement Administration has described it as the largest seizure of drug money anywhere in the world.Mr. Ye Gon, who was born in Shanghai, is a naturalized Mexican citizen and owns a Mexican pharmaceutical company that has been linked to drug smuggling. He attracted the attention of the Mexican authorities after they discovered an illicit shipment of pseudoephedrine, a decongestant used to make methamphetamine, on a boat in a Mexican port last December. The chemical was being shipped to Mr. Ye Gon’s company.'"

"'07-07-25,'1','This is Mr. Benjamin’s first opera but not his first attempt at the form. He tried writing one when he was about 13, describing it as an “atrocious” work about the Pied Piper. He later spent more than 20 years searching for a libretto on which to base a new opera before deciding to collaborate with Mr. Crimp. They explored various possibilities before settling on the Pied Piper.Mr. Crimp’s text serves the music with a “rigorous simplicity,” Mr. Benjamin said. “There are only a handful of words with more than three syllables.” The two men hoped, Mr. Benjamin said, to avoid what they perceive as hackneyed 19th-century realism techniques (there are no costumes, for instance, just concert attire for the singers) while retaining an emotional directness. The result, first seen in November in Paris, drew rave reviews from critics like Rupert Christiansen, who called it “brilliantly original” in The Daily Telegraph.Mr. Benjamin said he intended his score to “light up the voices rather than overpowering them, which can happen with symphony orchestras.” The voice is a magnificent instrument, he continued, but “you have to change your technique,” explaining that the harmony that surrounds the voice has to be less elaborate than the harmony surrounding the soloist in an instrumental concerto. There are only two voices in “Into the Little Hill”: a contralto and a soprano, who act as both “cold and detached” narrators and impassioned characters.The work is scored for an unusual lineup of 15 instruments, including two violas, bass flute, two basset horns, contrabass clarinet, the cimbalon and banjo. “It’s a strange palette,” he said, “but quite delicate in the register where the voices sing.”The opera will be preceded by two other Benjamin works: the arresting “Viola, Viola,” a dramatically multitextured piece that sounds as if it were being played by an army of violas, not just two; and “Three Miniatures,” for solo violin. The composer’s small catalog also includes “Antara,” for orchestra and electronic keyboards sampling Peruvian panpipes; “Shadowlines,” a piano piece that experiments with canonic technique; and fascinating orchestral works like “Three Inventions for Chamber Orchestra.”Mr. Benjamin’s idiosyncratic compositions, which can show the influence of Berg, Boulez, Debussy and Webern, also reflect his intense studies with Messiaen. Born into a nonmusical family in London (where he still lives), Mr. Benjamin “fell passionately in love” with classical music after seeing Disney’s “Fantasia” at the age of 6. He started composing and playing the piano soon afterward. At 16, he began attending Messiaen’s composition classes at the Paris Conservatory, describing him as “a man of great sweetness as well as majestic talents.”The young Mr. Benjamin was particularly fascinated by Messiaen’s “fantastically original” harmonies, which established a bond between the two composers against what he calls the “harmonic grayness” of serialism. Messiaen’s imaginative approach to rhythm also inspired Mr. Benjamin, although he turned to the works of Elliott Carter, now a good friend, to learn about structure and form.Mr. Benjamin learned different aspects of composition with the British composer Alexander Goehr, whom he studied with at Cambridge. Mr. Goehr “gently opened doors that would have never occurred to me as a Messiaen disciple,” he said. “He would question me philosophically about the nature of counterpoint, the relationship between the beginning and end of a piece, and why my relationship to continuity was so uninteresting; something which is incredibly important to me now.”Mr. Benjamin has been “cursed with writer’s block” since childhood. For him, composing is “full of confusion, and I get lost and throw away a huge amount,” he said.He was stuck for a few weeks on what sort of music to write for the Pied Piper, but he found inspiration in the libretto as well as his muses, the soprano Anu Komsi and the contralto Hilary Summers, for whom he wrote the score. They sang in the Paris premiere and will do so again this week with the Ensemble Modern, conducted by Franck Ollu.The expressive music conveys the “terrible emotions” of the story, both the loss of the town’s children and the misuse of music, which Mr. Benjamin believes is not valued in contemporary society: “Name a single politician who shows interest in the music of our time,” he said.But recalling his own instant love affair with classical music that began with “Fantasia,” he added, “I can’t believe that won’t happen to thousands of children in the future as well.”'"
"'07-07-25,'1','But for two decades, Taiwan was the only China recognized by the United Nations, the United States (which provided a lot of aid) and most of the West. This changed in the early 1970s, when the reality of the Communist People’s Republic of China could no longer be ignored. Chiang died in 1975, his successors dismantled martial law in 1987 and the first democratic elections took place in 1996. By then globalization was taking a toll. As businesses moved elsewhere in search of cheaper labor, factories closed, pension funds vanished and many workers felt abandoned.Mr. Chen makes his country feel like a lawless place suffused with corruption, paralysis and isolation. How to make art about this without paralyzing the viewer is a challenge.At his best, he does so by evoking the resilience of the individual and by countering reality with different kinds of artistry: with slow-moving images that might almost be mural-size photographs, shots of piles of detritus that resemble installation art and of people moving with the dreamlike pace (and silence) of performance art.These qualities work best in three videos set amid the haunting devastation and architectural grandeur of abandoned factories. In the first, “Factory” (2003), Mr. Chen invited several women to revisit the vast garment factory where they worked as recently as seven years before. As his camera creeps past and circles back, or zooms slowly in and out, the women work at their sewing machines, slump over them or wipe the dust from rows of chairs in the shadow of a mountain of old tables that itself resembles an installation piece. We see close-ups of weathered faces, a hand trying futilely to thread a needle, a sewing-machine foot chugging across the blue fabric of a jacket. Two women stand amid the mountain of tables, holding up one of these jackets as if it were a protest banner.In “On Going” (2006), a lone office worker slumps at his desk in a new, pristine office building and is then seen in an abandoned factory, silk-screening broadsheets in the back of an old truck lined with vintage portraits. The wall label says he is protesting globalization, but he could also be mourning Taiwan’s exclusion from the great experiment in China.The film that I found easiest to sit through is “Bade Area” (2005), shot in Bade, a once-thriving industrial city in northwestern Taiwan. The camera follows a gaunt middle-aged man as he scavenges in an abandoned factory where squatters seem to live on the roof. He joins a bucket brigade extracting secretarial chairs from a pile of office furniture and ultimately finds a thin, dusty mattress that he carries away, past a billboard announcing “The Majestic Town.”In the best scene he wanders across the building’s roof, where barrel vaults form a hilly terrain complete with streams of stagnant water. He passes a sprawling group of drinkers, then a man who has found a microphone and amplifier (he is either singing or giving a speech) and, finally, a woman who sells him a drink of water. He seems, briefly, like a wanderer in a traditional Chinese landscape painting.Mr. Chen’s work is full of echoes of past art and especially films and videos, including those of Chantal Akerman, Ulrike Ottinger, Alan Sekula, Kim Sooja and Zhang Yimou, the Chinese director of “Raise the Red Lantern” and “Ju Dou.” The face of the dying man in the lingchi video monotonously evokes Maria Falconetti in Carl Theodor Dreyer’s 1928 “Passion of Joan of Arc.” The big movie-still, light-box photographs of Jeff Wall, which sometimes take the inequities of labor as their subject, also come to mind. And the drinkers, putterers and wanderers of the roof scene in “Bade Area” can call forth Vittorio de Sica’s poetic films set in the poverty and chaos of Italy just after World War II.In fact, Mr. Chen’s work is so alive with such references that the ease with which cinematic mediums circle the globe, and bend to the purposes of artists in one culture and then another, becomes one of his underlying themes: perhaps the most optimistic one.'"

There was an outdoorsy smokiness on the nose and a slowly unfolding flavor with a fierce black pepper finish ($9.99 a half-pound from the university’s retail store or 979-845-5651).GARY WEST “traditional” flavor beef jerky comes in long, dark, sinewy strands with a handsome lacquered look, and required the least mouth muscle by a measure.

This $100 clock radio has a full-size dock for an iPod and a remote control for scrolling through music tracks.The clock, which comes in black or white, sets itself to the correct Eastern Standard Time when you plug it in, and you can change it to the time zone of your choice. The clock then handles Daylight Time changes automatically. You can wake to buzzing, the radio or music from the iPod.The clock, which has a bright backlighted L.E.D. screen, can handle most iPod types, including the iPod Video and Nano, and an adjustable pad ensures a good fit for your player. It will be available online (www.sonystyle.com) and in stores next month.Sony says it views iPods as a new music format like CDs and DVDs, thus rationalizing its support of the device. The iPod is popular enough that even a giant like Sony has to grudgingly accept its competitor’s products — besides, the word “iPod” doesn’t appear in ICF-C1IP. JOHN BIGGS'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Asian markets fell less, closing before the worst selling began. The plunge came a day after the private equity firm buying Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler said it would complete the transaction despite an inability to borrow the money in credit markets, as had been planned. Banks will hold on to those loans, as they will for a similar deal involving Alliance Boots, a British pharmacy chain. Daimler Chrysler fell $4.11 to $88.91.“There is fear, but not a fear of recession,” said William Gross, the chief investment officer of Pimco, a money-management firm.“The fear is directed toward the question of who will be willing to lend $200 billion to provide takeout financing for previously announced private-equity deals.”The credit difficulties began in the United States with investors growing worried about losses on securities that helped to finance subprime mortgages for borrowers with substandard credit, but now they have spread to highly leveraged companies as well.“The really good times are over,” said Simon Ballard, a global credit strategist at ABN Asset Management in London. “What we have now is a very weak market in terms of credit globally. It will change the environment for higher leverage-type transactions going forward, especially leveraged buyouts.”The credit tightening has come just weeks after the Blackstone Group, one of the largest private equity firms that do leveraged buyouts, went public in a widely anticipated initial public offering. The shares, sold for $31, rose as high as $38 on the first day of trading. Yesterday they traded below $24, but ended the day up 19 cents at $25.70.Even as the stock market has gyrated in recent weeks — with the Dow industrials having alternated rising and falling days over the past eight trading days — financial stocks have been coming under pressure. Citigroup dropped $1.40 to $47.81 yesterday, and is down 9 percent in less than two weeks. Goldman Sachs fell $8.04 to $195.12, and has dropped 12 percent over the same period.The falling stock markets helped turn oil markets lower. After rising above $77 a barrel in early trading — the first time since last summer that level was hit — the nearby crude oil future fell back below $75.Exxon Mobil reported its first earnings decline in years, saying it made $10.3 billion in the second quarter, about $100 million less than in the same period of 2006. Earnings per share were up, due to an aggressive share-repurchase plan, but Exxon stock fell $4.56 to $88.23.American investors were also depressed by a report of slowing sales of new homes, and by reports of losses from homebulders. Beazer fell $1.48 to $15.56, and has now lost two-thirds of its value this year.Beazer faces a criminal investigation for arranging government-guaranteed mortgages for buyers who should not have qualified, but other homebuilders have also plunged. Pulte Homes fell 63 cents to $20.04. and is off about 40 percent this year.Not all stocks were lower. Apple, which lost 8 percent of its value on Tuesday amid fears that its iPhone had not sold as well as expected, has regained all of that loss as it reported strong profits. 3M, which reported record profits, was the only one of the 30 Dow industrials to be up in late trading.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds fell to 4.79 percent from 4.90 percent the day before, as some investors sought safety, but yields rose as prices fell for bonds of lower quality, and some were difficult to sell at all.“We needed to clean house and it’s getting cleaned,” said Kingman Penniman, the president of KDP Investment Advisors, which focuses on high-yield bonds. “It’s the market going from too much liquidity to none. Many of the participants have never seen it.”Standard & Poor’s, in its leveraged commentary report, said the decline in high-yield bond prices this week was the largest since the plunge after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.“It’s pretty clear that this is a big move away from taking risk,"" said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and chief economist for OppenheimerFunds, a mutual fund company. “People have been borrowing unusually cheaply to buy assets,” Mr. Webman said, “and that whole transaction made sense whether it was houses or companies — if the asset was going to appreciate. But if that asset was not going to appreciate, your loan was not going to work.”The fall in Treasury bond rates has also done little for mortgage rates, Freddie Max reported that the average rate for 30-year mortgage loans was 6.69 percent. Since mid-June, Treasury rates have fallen by half a percentage point, but only a tenth of that move has carried over to the mortgage market.In the past, a sudden seize up of lending has sometimes led to sharp market falls. A leveraged buyout boom in the 1980’s came to a halt when a planned buyout of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, could not be financed. The S.&P. 500 fell 6 percent in one day when that was announced, but regained all the lost ground within 12 weeks.In those days, a financial crisis raised fears of failures for large financial firms. Now, policy makers such as Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, have argued, markets can deal with shocks better today than in the past because risks are more dispersed. Securities backed by risky mortgages that have been a top concern, for instance, are held by pension funds, hedge funds and many other investors around the world. So, they argue, even if the market for those bonds collapses, no major firm is likely to be seriously injured.But the big banks now find themselves taking on more loans because they had promised to do so if the loans could not be sold. And the market for some types of securities has all but vanished. Countrywide Credit, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said this week it would no longer try to sell the riskier mortgage securities that it used to routinely unload. Countrywide fell 82 cents to $29.25, trading at a three-year low.“Everybody now recognizes that the elimination of creative finance in housing leaves us with a problem for new homebuyers,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economits of ITG, because their income is not high enough to buy homes with interest rates and home prices at current levels.“You can make the case that we are simply witnessing a reverse of the late 1990’s — Asia collapse, long-term interest rates swoon and U.S. housing booms,” he added. This time, he said, interest rates may not fall much, due to the Asian boom, and that will put more pressure on housing prices.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Michael Vick, the starting quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Richmond, Va., today to charges that he was involved in a dog fighting conspiracy on property he owns in rural Surry County.U.S. Magistrate Dennis W.

The National Football League had barred Mr. Vick from joining the Falcons while the league conducts its own investigation.The 18-page indictment charges that Mr. Vick and three other men arranged dog fights, bet on the fights and mistreated animals that were not sufficiently ferocious. The fights continued until one dog was killed or gave up.Investigators found graves of dogs on the grounds of the Bad Newz Kennels, which Mr. Vick has owned since 2002. The indictment said dogs that lost fights were put to death by drowning, hanging, gunshot, electrocution or being slammed to the ground.Arthur Blank, the owner of the Falcons, said he was “saddened and distressed” by Mr. Vick’s indictment.'"

"'07-07-26,'0','CARACAS, Venezuela, July 25 — Casualties from land mines used by guerrilla organizations in Colombia have climbed sharply in recent years with civilians suffering increasingly from these inexpensive weapons, a leading human rights group said in a report released Wednesday.The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's largest rebel group, which describes land mines as the ""weapon of the poor"" and invokes their low cost as a rationale for deploying them, is largely responsible for their increased use, according to Human Rights Watch, the New York-based nongovernmental organization.Reported casualties from land mines in Colombia did not surpass 148 a year in the 1990s, but at the start of this decade, casualties began surging, from 287 in 2001 to 1,107 in 2006, the report said, citing figures from the government's Antipersonnel Land Mine Observatory.The report, which also documents land mine use by the National Liberation Army, or ELN, another rebel group, sheds light on one of the most brutal features of Colombia's four-decade struggle with guerrilla insurgencies. Colombia has the world's highest number of land mine casualties, according to available statistics, though some countries, including Afghanistan, are believed to lag in their reporting methods.""The escalation of land mine use in Colombia is taking place, while the rest of the world has seen a decline,"" Maria McFarland, the report's author, said in a telephone interview. She said armed groups as varied as Nepal's Maoist insurgency and the PKK, the Kurdish separatists operating in Turkey, had moved to limit use of land mines while Colombia's guerrilla groups had not.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','SAN FRANCISCO, July 25 — Apple on Wednesday reported a 73 percent jump in quarterly profit on strong sales of Macs and iPods, beating Wall Street forecasts. It also alleviated some concerns about early sales of the iPhone.Investors were spooked on Tuesday when AT&T, which provides service for the phone, said it had activated just 146,000 iPhones in the day and a half from its release to the end of the quarter, far fewer than some analysts had expected. That sent Apple’s stock down 6 percent.But Apple executives said on Wednesday that the company had actually sold 270,000 iPhones in that period, a number that seemed to calm investors’ fears. The executives said Apple expects to sell 1 million iPhones this quarter, and reiterated its goal of selling 10 million phones by the end of 2008. The company plans to release the phone in Europe in the fourth quarter.“Our view is the starting gun has been fired and we’re off to a great start,” said Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief operating officer, in a conference call with analysts. “Our primary focus is not on initial sales but on creating a third business for Apple.”By comparison, Apple executives said, it took nearly two years for Apple to sell 1 million iPods.It is not entirely clear why so many early iPhone customers did not activate their phones right away, but Apple executives acknowledged that many customers experienced activation problems during the first week. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, apologized for the problems and said they had been fixed.'"

"'07-07-26,'0','The New York Civil Liberties Union has filed a public records request asking the Police Department to turn over computerized data on stop-and-frisk activities so it can analyze the role that race plays in such street stops. Asked if the department would comply, its spokesman, Paul J. Browne, pointed out that the department had already turned over reports on its raw data to the City Council, as required by law. The reports showed a fivefold increase in the number of stop-and-frisks from 2002 to last year, with more than half of them involving black residents. The civil liberties group wants to analyze each of the 508,540 street stops last year, as well as those from the first half of this year. The department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to conduct an independent assessment of the stops, Mr. Browne said. He added, “In terms of race, the data showed that stops were consistent proportionately with descriptions provided by victims of violent crime.” The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday that the Council expected the police to provide the data to citizens and that if they did not, the Council would “take appropriate action.”'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Other presidential candidates have used planes from a variety of companies and executives. Mitt Romney, the Republican former governor of Massachusetts, has taken flights on corporate jets from eBay and from Lawrence Ellison, the chief executive of Oracle, among others. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democrat, has used planes owned by some companies with business before his state.The savings can be substantial. A chartered Hawker 800, a midsize, twin-engine corporate jet from Washington, D.C., to Manchester, N.H., would cost about $7,000, according to CSI Aviation services, an air charter company. The Hawker seats 8 to 13 passengers. If a candidate were to reimburse a company for the use of a corporate jet at first-class rates, the same flight would cost less than $700 per person.A few candidates, including Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, both Democrats, have decided not to take corporate flights at all, opting instead to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more each year to charter their own jets.And Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, began by eschewing corporate jet travel, but with his campaign in straitened financial circumstances has decided it can no longer afford such scruples — even though Mr. McCain sponsored legislation in the Senate that would have required lawmakers to pay the full value of their trips on private planes.“Senator McCain had hoped that other candidates in the race would follow suit and pay the true cost of chartered planes,” said Jill Hazelbaker, a campaign spokeswoman. “It’s regrettable, but moving forward we cannot continue at such an incredible financial disadvantage.”The McCain campaign spent more than $1.5 million on air travel during the first half of the year, mostly on chartered planes. Direct comparisons to what other candidates spent are difficult, because candidates have different travel schedules and records filed with the Federal Election Commission do not always make it clear exactly how many flights each campaign took. But it appears that Mr. McCain’s air travel bill was hundreds of thousands of dollars higher than some rivals who took corporate flights.The campaigns that take corporate flights are well aware of the benefits. Mr. Romney’s campaign actively solicited corporate jets as a way to save money. “One key way in which we can cut costs is by increasing our pool of private planes,” his campaign wrote in an e-mail message it sent to supporters earlier this year.Critics say the practice allows executives who have already contributed the maximum to candidates to keep providing them valuable help.“It’s a way of gaining access and influence, a bonus on top of campaign contributions,” said Meredith McGehee, the policy director of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that has lobbied against the use of discounted corporate jets. “It is a back-door subsidy that evades campaign contribution limits, but is done legally.”Ed Kammerer, a lawyer who specializes in business aviation, represents a number of clients who have been asked to let candidates use their planes.“There is a lot of solicitation from candidates,” Mr. Kammerer said. “I can tell you from my own experience that there are owners of planes who say that candidate XYZ wants to use my plane, and how can I delicately say no? I’d prefer not to, and I need something to hang my hat on.”Campaigns that take corporate jets say that the Federal Election Commission allows it and that the companies are not seeking special benefits. Maria Comella, a spokeswoman for the Giuliani campaign, said: “We do everything within the rules and regulations of the F.E.C. That’s the bottom line.”A spokesman for the Romney campaign, Kevin Madden, said, “There is no expectation of anything in return.”Mr. Obama, an Illinois Democrat, and Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat from New York, who take only chartered planes now, are also the only candidates who currently get Secret Service protection, which means that they travel with a bigger entourage. An official with the Obama campaign noted that the campaign did not use corporate jets even before Mr. Obama began getting protection. And while the government pays the airfare for the agents, the official said, the campaign must get larger, more expensive planes — which can drive up costs.The biggest expenditure for private jets this year was the more than $430,000 the Edwards campaign paid Mr. Baron, its finance chairman, for the use of his Hawker 800. Mr. Baron, who is known for litigating multimillion dollar asbestos cases, is a past president of the Association of American Trial Lawyers. His political relationship with Mr. Edwards, a fellow trial lawyer, goes back to 2002, when Mr. Baron donated $200,000 to Mr. Edwards’s New American Optimist political committee and Mr. Edwards began to fly around in planes provided by Mr. Baron.Eric Schultz, a spokesman for the Edwards campaign, said Mr. Baron was reimbursed at an amount equivalent to a first-class ticket.Mr. Richardson has paid more than $15,000 this year for flights to Foxtrot partners, which The Albuquerque Journal reported was affiliated with a local developer that had sought highway improvements from the state. Katie Roberts, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said that Mr. Richardson flew commercial when he could, and that when he took corporate jets there were “no expectations” from the companies that provided them.One person who had provided Mr. Romney with a corporate jet, but may not in the future, is J. Richard Blankenship, a Florida investment banker and former ambassador to the Bahamas. He provided air transport for Mr. Romney three times in February and March, but has since switched his support to Mr. Giuliani.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Anheuser-Busch said yesterday that quarterly profit rose, helped by higher prices, increased productivity and strong sales of imported brands like Tsingtao and Corona.Anheuser, the brewer of Budweiser and Bud Light, which also distributes a number of InBev’s European brands in the United States, said net income increased to $677 million, or 88 cents a share, for the second quarter, from $638 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.The latest results included a gain of 1 cent a share on the sale of the company’s remaining equity stake in a Spanish theme park.The company’s United States beer shipments to wholesalers gained 2.3 percent to 27.5 million barrels in the quarter, while sales to retailers increased 0.1 percent.The company said it was on track to deliver accelerating earnings growth in the second half of the year, based in part on an increase in its prices, its broadened United States beer portfolio and improved productivity. The company said those factors would offset raw materials costs.Anheuser shares were up 47 cents, or about 1 percent, at $49.59.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','CHICAGO, July 25 (AP) — The Boeing Company posted its largest quarterly profit in nearly four years on Wednesday, earning $1.1 billion as it continued to build momentum against its European rival, Airbus.The better-than-expected results, the company’s strongest since the fourth quarter of 2003, easily topped Wall Street forecasts and sent Boeing’s stock up 3 percent.Boeing said its profit amounted to $1.35 a share and was up from a loss of $160 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier when the company was bogged down by the legal costs of a government investigation.Revenue in the period, which was Boeing’s second quarter, climbed 14 percent, to $17 billion from $15 billion, easily beating Wall Street expectations.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast earnings of $1.16 a share and revenue of $16.2 billion. Stock in Boeing, which is based in Chicago, rose $3.43, to $107.23 a share.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','“We don’t believe our consumers live in a one-dimensional world,” said Jonah Shacknai, the chairman and chief executive officer of Medicis, which is based in Scottsdale, Ariz. “They are working on the Internet, watching TV, reading beauty magazines.”The contest Medicis has created is called the “Hottest Mom in America.” The company plans to sponsor a reality television show, although it has yet to find a network to carry it. The show will seek to find “a woman who is in tune with her family, involved in her community and in touch with her femininity.”Potential contestants, who do not need to have used Restylane, can submit videos to the contest’s Web site. The woman who is crowned “Hottest Mom in America” will receive a $25,000 college scholarship for a related child, $25,000 in cash, a year of free treatment with Restylane and an interview with a prominent modeling agency, according to the contest’s Web site.The idea is to reach middle-income women — those earning $50,000 to $70,000 a year — who take an interest in their beauty, Medicis executives said. Mr. Shacknai estimates there are more than 25 million women who are curious about wrinkle reduction and have the means to pay $600 a syringe to fill in those lines around the mouth.Since Restylane was introduced in 2004, it has had a near monopoly in the hyaluronic acid wrinkle filler, which is used to treat the smile lines from the nose to the corner of the mouth. In January, Allergan, the maker of Botox, introduced a rival product, Juvéderm, that acts the same way as Restylane but last twice as long. The “Keep the Wisdom, Lose the Lines” campaign from Allergan features the actress Virginia Madsen. Mr. Shacknai said that his company’s latest marketing effort has nothing to do with the arrival of Juvéderm and that his company deliberately chose not to hire a supermodel. That said, the winner of the “Hottest Mom” contest will be eligible to be considered as “The Face of Restylane,” the product’s next spokeswoman.The show will not alter the appearance of contestants or require them get Restylane injections.“This is a far cry from a makeover show,” Mr. Shacknai said. “ Our contestants look terrific already. It’s more about lifestyle than appearance.”Paul Potratz, a partner at Potratz Partners Advertising, a firm that specializes in interactive media, said that Restylane was smart to market to the masses and use new media.“Regardless of income, women just want to feel special,” he said. “Most women don’t relate to the Victoria’s Secret supermodel, but if they see a soccer mom using this product they might be more inclined to try it.”In direct-to-consumer marketing, pharmaceutical companies bypass doctors, with the hope that patients will suggest a product to their doctor instead of the other way around. But Dr. Heidi A. Waldorf, a dermatologist and director of laser and cosmetic dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said that only about 25 percent of her patients actually request products that they see in ads or read about in magazines.“Most people say they need something to rejuvenate their skin,” Dr. Waldorf said. “They don’t know if laser, injection or chemical treatment is the best option for them.”Advertising does help increase the demand for wrinkle fillers, she said, but not for a particular brand. And ads that appeal to the masses make consumers feel more comfortable paying up to $3,000 a year for face rejuvenation, she said.“It’s not just for the rich and the famous,” Dr. Waldorf said. “It is more accessible and acceptable for middle-income level people.”'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Over all, net income at the Times Company rose to $118.4 million, or 82 cents a share, from $59.6 million, or 41 cents a share, largely as a result of a $94.3 million after-tax gain from the sale of nine network-affiliated television stations. A significant portion of the sale proceeds were used to reduce the company’s debt, which fell to $965 million from $1.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2007.The company said that its earnings from continuing operations would have been 34 cents a share but for three special items — a profit from the sale of WQEW-AM radio station in New York, a loss on the sale of its printing plant in Edison, N.J., and accelerated depreciation charges from the scheduled closing of the Edison plant.Operating profit at About.com, meanwhile, rose 16.4 percent, to $8.5 million, helped by ConsumerSearch.com, which the company acquired in May.“Activist investors criticized the About acquisition in 2005 but it’s worked out,” said Frederick Searby, an analyst with JPMorgan Securities. “Internet is beginning to move the needle slightly.”Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of the Times Company, said, “While our second-quarter results reflected the weakness in the print advertising market stemming from both secular and cyclical forces in our business, we continued to move aggressively on new product development, cost reduction and the rebalancing of our portfolio.” She said that $130 million of the cost reduction would come in 2008, with the balance coming the next year. The cost reductions exclude the effects of inflation and one-time charges.Mr. Follo did not provide a detailed breakdown of where the savings would come from. But a portion will come from the consolidation of New York area printing operations at the paper’s College Point plant in Queens, as well as the reduction next month in the width of The Times, The Boston Globe and regional papers, which should save $13 million annually.Other costs cuts will come from the administrative, production, technology, distribution and circulation functions. Mr. Follo said, “Our cost initiatives will be carefully managed so that they do not adversely affect the quality of our journalism, the smooth functioning of our operations or our ability to achieve our long-term goals.”Wall Street was pleased by the cost-cutting initiative.“The savings being talked about are much higher than even the most optimistic estimates,” said Paul Ginocchio, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. “The only negative is what it potentially says about the outlook for revenues over the next two years. If you’re working that hard on the cost side, does it mean the outlook for revenue isn’t good?”Mr. Searby of JPMorgan said: “The big news is the cost cuts over the next two years. They’re finally biting the bullet and adjusting to the reality of an accelerating, secular decline in print.”In a conference call with analysts after the earnings announcement, Ms. Robinson said Internet advertising growth at The Times Media Group slowed in July. But she added The Boston Globe’s ad outlook will most likely improve during the second half of the year as new shopping malls open in Natick and Foxboro, Mass. Other bright spots include advertising by competing banks as well as new branding efforts by telecommunications companies like Verizon and AT&T.Over the last year, Ms. Robinson said, the Times Company sold about $700 million in assets. Those sales, combined with strong cash flow, “gave us the confidence to raise the dividend 31 percent.”Shares of the Times Company rose 1.7 percent, or 39 cents, to $23.61.The earnings report comes as other media giants struggle to adapt to the new landscape. Last week, the board of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, recommended the company accept a buyout bid from Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation. The Bancroft family, which owns a controlling stake in Dow Jones, is evaluating Mr. Murdoch’s $5 billion offer and a final decision is expected within days.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','LONDON, July 25 (AP) — GlaxoSmithKline, whose shares have been weighed down by a negative report on its blockbuster diabetes drug Avandia, reported Wednesday that net profit rose 1.4 percent in the second quarter even as revenue fell.The company’s announcement that it was doubling its stock buyback program to £12 billion ($24.7 billion) through 2009 also helped drive shares higher.Glaxo reported net profit of £1.33 billion ($2.75 billion), up from £1.32 billion a year ago. Revenue dropped 2.4 percent, to £5.67 billion ($11.7 billion). Pretax profit was virtually unchanged at £1.9 billion ($3.9 billion), beating the market consensus for a small drop.Glaxo shares had been hurt earlier in the year after a New England Journal of Medicine article said Avandia raised the risk of heart attack by 43 percent.“Whilst some uncertainty remains around Avandia, we stand firm in our belief that it is an effective and valuable treatment for patients with diabetes,” said the company’s chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','When prosecutors asked repeatedly if Mr. Scerbo had ever touched her inappropriately, she answered that she did not know or could not remember.Then on Wednesday, two girls testified that they had told investigators that Mr. Scerbo had never touched them inappropriately, but that their families had later helped them remember, and that he had abused them.“I wasn’t sure that day,” said a 10-year-old, when asked by the defense attorney, Edward Menkin, why she denied that she had been abused several months ago when testifying before a grand jury. At best, the testimony of the young girls has been peppered with contradictions and inconsistencies, which seem to bolster the contention of Mr. Menkin that his client is the victim of a “scandalous, smearing set of accusations” and that his life is forever ruined.“Is there anything more offensive and repugnant than being called a child molester?” Mr. Menkin asked the jury during his opening statement. “I can think of one thing worse: being called a child molester when you are not one.”According to testimony, the investigation began in December when three girls went to the school nurse and said that Mr. Scerbo, who taught music for the K-8 school, had touched them inappropriately. The Lafayette Central School District — a public school district that includes the small Onondaga Nation School — immediately placed Mr. Scerbo on leave. Within three days of the first accusation, the police arrested him on charges of molesting two girls.By the time the grand jury indicted Mr. Scerbo this spring, the case had ballooned to include 17 girls, stunning residents here and shaking up relations between the 1,500-member tribe and the surrounding community. Mr. Scerbo, who is white, lives in a Syracuse suburb, while many of his accusers and their families live on the impoverished Onondaga reservation on the outskirts of the city. Mr. Scerbo has vehemently denied the charges, and his defense is expected to portray him as a trustworthy member of the community who had never before been charged with a crime.Much of the case hinges on his penchant for showing movies in a slightly darkened classroom. Many of the young witnesses have testified that the girls in his class would take turns sitting on his lap, sometimes one on each leg. Many of them said that he would briefly touch their genitals or legs over their clothing while the movie was playing.“It made me feel disgusted and stuff,” said a 9-year-old witness who testified that Mr. Scerbo touched her inner thigh when she sat on his lap.For its part, the defense is drawing out testimony that suggests the girls, many of them cousins or friends in their tight-knit community, may have been coached into giving their stories.Nearly all of the witnesses have had trouble remembering when the alleged abuse occurred. On Wednesday, one girl testified that she had been victimized in kindergarten, first and second grade. Yet when she testified before the grand jury, she said that she was victimized in the second grade only, leading Judge Walsh to warn prosecutors that they were not meeting their burden of proof in establishing a time frame consistent with the charges.“The problem with this case is the youth,” the judge acknowledged. “These are young girls.”In addition, many of the students who have testified have struggled with their education and have had to repeat grades, further befuddling their memories about when the alleged abuse took place.Since the trial began on Monday, residents of the Onondaga reservation have jammed one side of the courtroom, while Mr. Scerbo’s supporters have crowded into the other side. On Wednesday, Judge Walsh admonished the courtroom and called for tolerance after he heard that some spectators had been rude to the lawyers.“This is a difficult case,” he said, “for everybody.”'"
"'07-07-26,'0','In a corner of Manhattan starved for grass, trees and open space, it has been sorely missed. But on Tuesday, a verdant ribbon of land at the north end of City Hall Park will reopen after being out of use for seven years, city officials said yesterday.The reopening will provide — in addition to open space, towering elms and London plane trees, a statue of Horace Greeley and a row of chess tables — a walkway across the park from Broadway to Centre Street, a welcome shortcut for many pedestrians.“I’d say it’s about time,” said Carl Howard, a Manhattan lawyer who lives on the east side of the park and works on the west side. He said the reopening would brighten his daily walk to the office and provide a play area for his children, Haley, 12, and Ariana, 9.William T. Castro, the Manhattan borough commissioner for the Department of Parks and Recreation, said the section of park, which surrounds the Tweed Courthouse, was closed in the spring of 2000 when renovation began on the courthouse itself, a city landmark that was completed in 1878 and is now the headquarters of the Department of Education. The section remained closed after 9/11 for security concerns which were heightened when a member of the City Council, James E. Davis, was assassinated in the Council chamber in 2003.In addition to questions about security, the reopening has been complicated by competing demands for the space: The Ross Global Academy Charter School shares space in the Tweed building, and its students have been using parts of the surrounding park for playtime activities even while the public was barred.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','The number of West Nile virus cases in the United States is nearly four times what it was a year ago, meaning that a large epidemic may be in store, government researchers are reporting.“It’s certainly a warning sign that we need to be extremely vigilant,” Dr. Lyle Petersen, the director of the division of vector-borne infections at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said yesterday. “The worst is yet to come.”The virus, carried by mosquitoes, causes a mild, flu-like illness in 20 percent of those infected, and no symptoms in about 80 percent. In about 1 percent of cases, the illness progresses to a brain infection that can be fatal.Last year, 4,269 cases were reported in the United States, including 1,495 brain infections, and 177 people died. The risk of severe illnesses increases with age.So far this year, 122 cases have been reported, with the most in California and the Dakotas. At this time last year, there had been only 33.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','Amaranth and Mr. Hunter, who now runs another hedge fund called Solengo Capital Advisors, denied the charges.In a letter sent to Amaranth investors yesterday, Nicholas M. Maounis, the company’s chief executive, said the commission’s accusations “while certain to attract extensive media attention, lack any basis in the evidence or the law.”He said that Amaranth had cooperated with the investigation.Separately, Mr. Hunter said in a statement that he would “combat aggressively” the charges against him. The statement said the commodities commission’s accusations were aimed at finding “a scapegoat to bear the public outrage over ever-increasing energy prices.”Mr. Hunter’s lawyer, Michael S. Kim, said in the statement: “We will not stand idly by as the regulators use Brian for political cover; their action is meritless and we will prove it.”Both Amaranth and Mr. Hunter said the commission had failed to present evidence that Amaranth succeeded in influencing the market.“Without proof of artificial price movements, the C.F.T.C. cannot show that any investors or market participants were harmed by Mr. Hunter’s trading,” Mr. Kim said.In its suit, the commodities regulator says that Amaranth and Mr. Hunter sought to manipulate gas futures contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange on Feb. 24, 2006, the last day of trading for the exchange’s March 2006 gas futures contracts, and on April 26, 2006, the last trading day for the May 2006 contracts.The suit claims that Amaranth bought more than 3,000 gas futures contracts on the Nymex just before the end of trading, and then sold most of those contracts during the closing session. According to the suit, Amaranth intended to lower the prices of the Nymex futures contracts to benefit from gas swaps it held on the electronic market IntercontinentalExchange.That exchange is exempt from federal regulation.The suit, which cites e-mail messages between Mr. Hunter and other traders, also contends that Amaranth tried to cover up its actions after Nymex asked for information about its trading activities. When answering Nymex, Amaranth “made false, fictitious or fraudulent statements,” the suit says.Michael V. Dunn, the agency’s commissioner, said the filing sent “an important message to market participants that such conduct will be met with appropriate sanctions.”Mr. Hunter sued this week to block the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from taking action against him. In his suit, Mr. Hunter disputes the agency’s jurisdiction over futures markets, saying the regulatory commission has authority only over physical commodity markets. The trading commission is the agency charged with oversight of most commodity futures markets.The commission said it would make an announcement today.A Senate investigation this year found that Amaranth, once a star hedge fund, had held as many as 100,000 natural gas contracts in a single month, accounting for 5 percent of the amount of natural gas consumed in the United States last year.In its report, the Senate investigation committee found that Amaranth’s position was so large that it allowed the company to dominate trading in natural gas futures and push up prices. By the end of February 2006, for example, Amaranth held nearly 70 percent of the open interest in the November future contracts on the Nymex and nearly 60 percent in the futures for January.The report found that Amaranth had engaged in “excessive speculation” but did not say that it had manipulated the market.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','They were wearing suits! And hats! No, not the two band members: Jack White was wearing red pants and a red T-shirt, while Meg White was wearing black pants and a red shirt. And besides, plenty of musicians dress up when they play Madison Square Garden. On Tuesday night, though, the White Stripes went one step further: those suits and hats belonged to the guys setting up the amplifiers.Once the show started, the White Stripes were left alone: the two of them spent nearly two hours on a big stage in a big — and full — room. “I don’t believe we’ve played this bar before,” said Mr. White, surveying the Garden. He probably didn’t feel quite that blasé, but he certainly didn’t seem intimidated, or thrilled, or even triumphant. He simply went to work, howling and shrieking and sighing, while inducing his guitars to do the same.The entire set was red, and carefully positioned footlights projected beautiful shadows of the two onto a huge red backdrop. The only special effect was a big disco ball, but that was plenty. In between songs, he paid courtly tribute to “my big sister Meg” (the two are actually a divorced couple), and to his opening act, the Nashville veteran Porter Wagoner, “the best-dressed man in country music.” (The other opening act was Grinderman, led by Nick Cave.)It’s astonishing how much the White Stripes have achieved through pure stubbornness. Over the course of six albums, they have sidled up to the rock ’n’ roll mainstream without softening their approach. They still sound as rude and as unhinged as ever, especially compared with the emo and alternative bands with whom they share the modern-rock radio airwaves.At most rock concerts, there are moments when the machine — the band — briefly comes unhinged: the beat is a split-second late, or the guitar emits a deafening squeal, or a lyric emerges as a formless howl. A White Stripes concert consists of almost nothing but these moments, and that’s the whole point. The two make a fierce, wobbly racket, confident that listeners won’t miss the comfort afforded by steady bass lines and fuller arrangements. Hearing them play is a bit like reading a sentence with no vowels. Wh rlly nds vwls, nywy?A White Stripes concert also underscores the importance of Ms. White, whose drumming is more sophisticated than many fans (and many more non-fans) realize. She refuses to imitate a metronome, refuses to flatten the songs by making them conform to a steady pulse. Instead she seems to hear the music the way Mr. White does: as a series of phrases, each with its own shape and tempo. In “Icky Thump,” the title track from the group’s most recent album, which was released last month, she occasionally warped the rhythm by shortening one of the beats, perfectly in unison with Mr. White’s guitar. If her playing were mathematically precise, it would be less musically precise.Much of the set was devoted to songs from “Icky Thump,” which is a bit more raucous than its excellent and unpredictable predecessor, “Get Behind Me Satan.” Where that album found Mr. White experimenting with marimba and other instruments, “Icky Thump” is a return to guitar-dominated tantrums and pleas. Ear fatigue occasionally sets in (that’s one inevitable effect of the band’s ruthless approach), but more often, it was simply exciting to hear familiar traditions — garage rock, country music, the blues — sounding so strange. And Mr. White’s squiggly solo during “You Don’t Know What Love Is (You Just Do as You’re Told),” from the new album, sounded downright catastrophic, in the best sense.'"
"'07-07-26,'0','FRANKFURT, July 25 — Siemens announced two multibillion-dollar deals on Wednesday as part of its new chief executive’s plan to retool the company, which has been tinged by scandal.Siemens will sell its automotive parts division to another German company, the tire maker Continental, for 11.4 billion euros ($15.6 billion) and acquire Dade Behring Holdings, a maker of medical diagnostic products based in Deerfield, Ill., for $7 billion. The deal for Dade is worth $77 a share, a 38 percent premium over the closing price of its stock on Tuesday.Siemens said the deals would further its goal of recasting its sprawling product portfolio as it focuses on four core areas of energy and environmental technology, public infrastructure equipment, automation technology and health care. Dade Behring’s products are used in testing for heart disease, cancer and blood disorders. Last year, Siemens bought the diagnostics business of Bayer HealthCare for $5.3 billion and Diagnostics Products for $1.86 billion.The acquisition of Dade Behring is the first significant move taken by the new chief executive, Peter Löscher, who took over the company from Klaus Kleinfeld this summer. He has said a prime task will be to simplify the Siemens structure, which contributed to what German authorities investigating the company think was a chronic use of bribes to win contracts.“We will make Siemens more focused, less complex and faster,” Mr. Löscher said in a statement on Wednesday. The company said it would also cooperate with the World Bank, which is investigating accusations that the company charged excessive fees for a power generation project in Pakistan financed by the bank during the 1990s.'"

"'07-07-27,'0','If you’ve seen the commercials and trailers for “No Reservations,” you’re probably anticipating a glossy, goofy romance between a tightly-wound head chef named Kate (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her new sous-chef, Nick (Aaron Eckhart), a rugged blond life force. Faithfully adapted from the German filmmaker Sandra Nettelbeck’s 2001 feature “Mostly Martha,” the movie provides these stock elements and many others, including a wisecracking preteenage girl (Abigail Breslin of “Little Miss Sunshine”), lyrical montages and too-cute therapy scenes (with Bob Balaban as the shrink) that play like unsubtle attempts to fill in the taciturn heroine’s past.What’s unexpected and gratifying, though, is the film’s enlightened attitude toward parenthood and work, which the movie’s publicity campaign conspicuously glosses over, even though it’s the story’s driving force.Ms. Breslin’s character, Zoe, is Kate’s smart, tough, 9-year-old niece, whose mother — Kate’s sister — dies in a car wreck. Kate, who has indefinitely deferred marriage and children to pursue her career and rarely regrets the decision, is torn between the necessity of maintaining her workaholic lifestyle and her obligation to raise Zoe, whose father skedaddled before she was born.Modern Hollywood movies often genuflect toward feminism while implying that a woman isn’t truly a woman until she has gratefully surrendered to motherhood. While watching “No Reservations” you keep waiting for the other high-heeled shoe to drop, but it never really does. The director, Scott Hicks (“Shine”), and the screenwriter, Carol Fuchs, respect Kate’s ambition, skill and drive. Throughout, they imply that Kate’s biggest hurdle isn’t a lack of aptitude for motherhood but her credulous acceptance of society’s one-size-fits-all definition of good parents.It isn’t easy for Kate to process her sister’s death — she returns to work too quickly, and won’t take time off until her boss (Patricia Clarkson) orders it — and the challenge of mothering Zoe is even more daunting. Yet the film dares to present Kate’s stumblebum early efforts — subcontracting child care to a chain-smoking goth babysitter, then to a flirty single-dad neighbor (a charming and woefully underused Brian F. O’Byrne) — as proof not that she needs to quit her job, but that she’s fallen for the false dichotomy of work versus parenting.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','That, according to other market players, is unlikely to happen because of the depth of the problems building in the U.S. economy.""If you believe that water flows uphill and fish have wings, then Asian stocks can keep rallying and ignore the expanding housing and credit problems spreading out from the U.S.,"" said Chua Soon Hock, managing director of Asia Genisis Management in Singapore, Bloomberg News reported.The heavy selling in Asia was sparked by a fall on Wall Street blamed on worries over a worsening housing slump and a crisis in the subprime mortgage market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor’s 500 Index both fell 2.3 percent. It followed the release of figures Thursday showing that sales of new homes were down 6.6 percent in June, the biggest decline since January. Durable goods sales, another important economic indicator, also dropped sharply.These signs of declining consumption are troubling for Asian companies that have geared exports to the U.S. consumer. Companies like Samsung Electronics, Asia’s biggest mobile phone and chip maker, closed 4.8 percent lower in Seoul, falling for the fifth day in a row. In Japan, losers included Nintendo, down 6.6 percent, and Canon, the world’s biggest digital camera maker, down 5.5 percent, the stocks largest slide since October 2003.But analysts said there are indications that Asian companies are growing less vulnerable to fluctuations in U.S. markets, partly because of reduced dependency on U.S. sales.Mr. Lobello, the CLSA analyst, said Asian markets were gradually becoming ""less hostage"" to trends in the U.S.""The truth is that looking back over 10 years of history we are seeing Asia decouple a bit from the U.S.,"" he said.Lobello said companies poised to fare best in the current market uncertainty are those with a bigger proportion of their sales in Asia. He cited food manufacturers in particular.Still, most analysts expect more bad news n Asian markets -- at least for a few days or weeks -- before things get better.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','PHOENIX, July 26 (AP) — The US Airways Group said Thursday that its second-quarter earnings fell 13.6 percent as it continued to struggle with high fuel prices.The chairman and chief executive, W. Douglas Parker, said the carrier also had invested heavily this quarter in improving its operations in response to low customer service ratings and a computer problem that shut down hundreds of self-service kiosks in March.“By no means have we declared victory, but we’re flying as good an airline as anyone else right now,” Mr. Parker said in a conference call.Shares of US Airways fell 27 cents, to $34.57, Thursday.Among other United States carriers posting results Thursday, the Midwest Air Group said its second-quarter earnings fell 45 percent, to $4.9 million. The Alaska Air Group said its income slid 17 percent, to $46.1 million, in the second quarter. AirTran Holdings, which is trying to buy Midwest, said its second-quarter profits jumped 30 percent, to $41.5 million, as nonfuel unit costs dropped for the fourth consecutive quarter.Like AirTran, most airlines have tried to increase profits by scraping away at their nonfuel costs. But this is becoming harder to do, said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. “It’s killing them,” Mr. Neidl said of fuel prices. “It’s amazing that they’re making money where fuel right now is about $77 per barrel.”Despite the slide in profits, US Airways results topped Wall Street’s expectations and the carrier began recalling 225 furloughed flight attendants and 130 furloughed pilots.'"

Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings of $1.05 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.“I like the fact that they came out and beat the number, especially keeping in mind the cost situation,” said an HSBC analyst, Hassan Ahmed, who noted that the market would question the quality of Dow’s earnings given the beneficial tax rate.A JPMorgan analyst, Jeffrey Zekauskas, agreed and said he expected the company’s shares to fall as earnings beat estimates because of a lower tax rate.'"

"'07-07-27,'0','The essay has become such an important part of applying to college that affluent students may turn to $200-an-hour writing coaches to help them produce the 500 perfect words that they hope will separate them from the pack.One staple of the affluent students’ essays is the service trip to Latin America. “It’s the first time they’ve seen this wrenching poverty,” said Lee Coffin, the director of undergraduate admissions at Tufts University. After a while, however, the trips sound the same.“My colleagues nod and say, ‘It’s the typical Costa Rica essay,’ ” Mr. Coffin said.But the lives of Antoine and the other 36 students at the workshop, which is run by College Summit, a nonprofit organization, are defined by struggle.The workshop is intended to help them discover — and prove to college admissions officials — that their life stories can be as powerful as high SAT scores and stellar grades.The essay is where they get to shine.“I will not become a stereotype/statistic because many African/Black Americans proved that we can achieve greater heights,” Antoine wrote. “Richard Wright is a great, black American writer. Have you read his famous book, “Black Boy.” I have, and if you have read it, you should know that he defeated the odds. Same with Martin and his dream.”“Just like these incredible men,” he wrote, “I, too, want to defeat the stereotypes.”Antoine is a B student at struggling Crossland High, in Prince George’s County, Md., where most of the 1,700 students are black and more than a third are living in poverty. He is a youth leader in his church, but he is not an academic star. He is not one of the handful of students from high schools like his whose numbers attract the attention of diversity-minded college admissions officials. The other seniors with him at Howard had B and C averages.But his high school’s selection of him for the College Summit program, which teams up with both high schools and colleges, substantially increases his odds. The workshops, which 1,500 low-income seniors across the country will attend this summer, are part of College Summit’s effort to extend the college-going culture beyond the middle class.The colleges that play host to the workshops and are eager for more low-income applicants get a first look at the portfolios of the students.These are the “better-than-their-numbers students,” said J. B. Schramm, the Harvard Divinity School graduate who founded College Summit 14 years ago. They have talent and academic potential not revealed by their SAT scores and grades, Mr. Schramm said. Seventy-nine percent of students who go through the workshops enroll in college, he said, while nationally fewer than 50 percent of low-income students do.With the application process itself one of the biggest obstacles, he said, many students do not even apply to college. Their parents cannot help them navigate the process because for the most part, like Antoine’s parents, they did not go to college themselves.For Antoine, the first assignment from his writing coach was “Free write for 10 minutes; write about anything you want.” The words, the first of thousands he would write and rewrite over the next few days, seemed to just flow out of him, he said.Later, Antoine read what he had written to the other three members of his writing group, who, as it happened, were all girls. Encouraged by their writing coach, Tony Askew, the group offered feedback about words, phrases and ideas they liked and things they wanted to know more about.Mr. Askew, a former college admissions official now with College Summit, wrote down the key points with a blue marker on a huge sheet of white paper on the ground while the group waited for classroom space to open up: “College is the key. Wants to inspire people by writing. Did not want to be another statistic.”The writing coaches — except Mr. Askew, they are all volunteers — are not there to tell students what to write or to polish their sentences. They are trained to treat the students’ work as if it were the text of a published writer. “To find the themes, the images, the narratives, the conflicts,” explains Keith Frome, the educator who developed College Summit’s writing curriculum.“I do not want to become another African American/Black stereotype,” Antoine wrote as he began his second 10-minute free write. “Most of us men are labeled as thugs, because of our long hair, dreads, dark clothing and the music we listen to. If we are driving a luxurious car most people assume that we either bought it with illegal money or we stole.”In small groups, the other students were beginning to tell their stories. They were writing about being homeless, about their families being “dead broke,” about the deaths of friends, sisters and mothers.They were writing about how much they loved their mothers, about their anger over absent fathers, about a father who drives a cab at all hours of the night and is “the backbone of our family.” They were writing about their aspirations: to become doctors, computer engineers, singers, social workers.As the second full day of writing began, Mr. Askew told the students: “I want you to dig deeper. Tell me more. Show me.” Antoine, slightly exasperated, asked, “You mean I got to write more?” Then he started digging deeper.“I want to enter college showing that young black men from Ward 8 can make it to college,” he wrote.Ward 8 is southeast Washington, the poor neighborhood where Antoine lived with his parents until several years ago, when he moved with his father to nearby Prince George’s County. Antoine’s mother still lives in Ward 8, and he visits frequently.Ward 8 is where 17-year-old William Newman, who was in Antoine’s global history class last year, was shot in the back and killed on June 28. He died five days after he got home from a College Summit workshop in Towson, Md. He had come back telling friends he wanted to go to college.Antoine wrote, “I don’t want to be added to someone’s death statistic.”His writing was great, Mr. Askew told Antoine. But he had to dig deeper still.By Saturday afternoon, with a list of possible colleges in hand — Howard, Penn State, Virginia Tech, Morehouse, among others — Antoine was in the computer lab, typing a final draft of his essay, one and a half pages, single spaced.“My mind races 75 miles per hour and many things explode in my head,” he wrote. “Will I just be another young black male stereotype no matter how hard I try to avoid it?”He went on for several hundred more words, focusing on his drive to prove that he “can be brilliant and hardworking,” to rise above the stereotypes, his feeling that Richard Wright, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Tiger Woods “are rooting me on as my personal fans.”He dreams of becoming a rapper or entrepreneur or children’s book author.“I believe that once I break the statistic hold,” he concluded, “a brighter path will open and my golden bricks will be laid.”'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Seven For All Mankind, the seven-year-old Los Angeles denim company that helped usher in the era of $200 designer jeans, was sold yesterday to the VF Corporation for $775 million. VF, the apparel company that owns brands like North Face and Nautica, also said yesterday that it had acquired Lucy, a women’s activewear company, for $110 million.The two brands are the latest in VF’s spree of acquisitions — it also owns Vans, Reef, Kipling and Napapijri — and will serve as the foundation for a new unit of contemporary brands for the company. The moves may signal that VF plans to make more deals for fast-growing, high-profile apparel makers.The acquisition of Seven For All Mankind will put VF squarely in the ultraluxury denim market, which did not exist a decade ago. VF’s other denim brands, Lee and Wrangler, are positioned farther down the market.The founders of Seven, started near Los Angeles in 2000, predicted that jeans could become a luxury product, much like handbags and shoes, if properly marketed. For the previous two decades, denim — as typified by Levis — had been viewed as functional rather than fashionable. Seven began churning out high-quality, tight-fighting jeans in dozens of washes, finishes and fits and with prices that, at the time, caused sticker shock — $200 or more.The company helped ignite a premium denim bonanza. Since 2000, scores of small denim companies like True Religion, Rock & Republic and Von Dutch Originals have sprung up in Los Angeles, creating a small but fast-growing niche in domestic apparel manufacturing, which for decades had been losing jobs to overseas producers.The sale of Seven is a coup for Bear Stearns Merchant Banking, the investment firm’s private equity arm, which acquired a 50 percent interest in Seven three years ago for slightly more than $100 million. The deal will represent a 60 percent return on its investment. Other Bear Stearns investments in the apparel and retail sector have included Aéropostale, New York & Company, Balducci’s, Stuart Weitzman, Transamerican Auto Parts, Vitamin Shoppe, Harlem Furniture and Everything but Water.'"

Analysts on average were expecting 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.The company, which sells Coca-Cola drinks in Belgium, France, Britain and the Netherlands, said the weak dollar added 2 cents a share to earnings.Quarterly net operating revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $5.67 billion, as price increases offset volume declines.Coca-Cola Enterprises, which bottles, sells and distributes more than three-quarters of the Coca-Cola drinks sold in North America, said it expected to earn $1.27 to $1.32 a share for the full year.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','That was the advice that financial advisers dispensed to jumpy investors worried that yesterday’s stock market plunge threatened to wipe out their nest eggs.“It’s a matter of reassuring them that it’s not the end of the world,” said Scott Duncan, a financial adviser with Wachovia Securities in Las Vegas. “We are going to get some sell-offs.”In a market that is continually setting records, some degree of pullback is inevitable, even healthy, experts said.“Just like with a tree,” said Jon Williams, a financial adviser with A. G. Edwards in Dallas, “you have to prune it to allow it to grow and flourish more.”There is a large degree of truth to statements like these, and professional investors have a good recent track record to back them up. Since the market started recovering in 2003 from the dot-com bust, stock prices have climbed steadily. Every once in a while it would hiccup, and then continue marching upward.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Even Carroll would not touch Harbaugh’s line about the best team in college football history. Harbaugh has not coached a game at Stanford yet, but he has already managed to irritate Carroll, saying earlier this year that he had heard that Carroll would leave U.S.C. for the N.F.L after this season.That earlier comment, combined with his grand prediction Thursday, left Carroll dripping with sarcasm.“Gotta love Jim, don’t you?” Carroll said. “I’m glad that he thinks that.”Harbaugh declined two opportunities to back off his projection of U.S.C.’s status as one of the best teams ever. He insisted that his statement was about this specific U.S.C. team, not the program in general or a recent U.S.C. team.“There’s no question in my mind they’re the best team in the country,” Harbaugh said. “They may be the best team in the history of college football. They are tremendously well coached and they have talent at every position.”The most talent-rich position may be linebacker, where U.S.C. is so deep that a backup last year, Oscar Lua, was selected by New England in the seventh round of the N.F.L. draft. This year’s linebackers include three players in contention for the Bednarik Award, which is given to the top defensive player in college football. In Phil Steele’s positional rankings in his preseason magazine, he has outside linebackers Keith Rivers and Brian Cushing ranked as the No. 1 and No. 2 outside linebackers in the country and Ray Maualuga as the third-best middle linebacker.Booty said: “Coach Carroll has gone out and got the best guys in the country on defense. Especially the linebacking corps, we have three potential first-round picks at linebacker, which not many teams can say.”The secondary is also an embarrassment of riches. The Trojans have three safeties as good as anyone in the country. Josh Pinkard is returning from a torn anterior cruciate ligament to join Kevin Ellison and Taylor Mays in a unit that is fast and explosive.The Trojans also have two defensive linemen — end Lawrence Jackson and interior lineman Sedrick Ellis — who stuck around for their senior seasons after resisting overtures from the N.F.L. Each players is also on the Bednarik list.“I think this defense is very similar to the one that won the championship,” Arizona Coach Mike Stoops said, comparing these Trojans with the undefeated 2004 team.Nebraska Coach Bill Callahan, whose Cornhuskers play host to U.S.C. in the season’s second week, said: “They may be one of the strongest defenses in the country. They’ve got a wealth of experience that comes back. They’ve got pro-caliber players at every position.”Last season, the Trojans ranked No. 1 in the Pac-10 in total defense, yielding 296 yards a game. What Carroll said he did not like about last season was the Trojans’ inability to force turnovers. They forced only four more turnovers than they committed.“That’s a big issue, that’s still out there,” Carroll said. “We need to ball-hawk better. I’m hoping that will be a big characteristic of this year.”In a season already being characterized as one for the ages, it is likely to be the defense that powers U.S.C.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','European regulators are bringing antitrust charges against Intel, the world’s biggest chip maker, accusing the company of using illegal rebates in its fight against Advanced Micro Devices.A statement of objections, or an official charge sheet, was sent yesterday, said Ton Van Lierop, a spokesman for the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust regulator in Brussels.The decision to bring a formal case follows a six-year investigation into allegations of illegal discounts to personal computer makers. Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., dominated sales with about 80 percent market share until last year. Advanced Micro came back with newer chips and won over customers, and Intel ended 2006 with its share at an 11-year low.Intel will have two months to respond to the charges, and a final decision can be appealed in European courts. Under European Union rules, companies can be fined up to 10 percent of annual sales for breaking antitrust rules.The commission’s biggest antitrust fine was a penalty of 497 million euros (about $600 million at the time) against Microsoft in 2004 for abusing its dominant position in PC operating systems.Chuck Mulloy, a spokesman for Intel, declined to comment. An Advanced Micro spokesman, Drew Prairie, said the company had not heard directly from the European Union and would not comment until it did.Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., has claimed that Intel maintained its share of the $33 billion market for microprocessors by “engaging in a relentless, worldwide campaign to coerce customers to refrain from dealing with A.M.D.,” it said in a lawsuit filed in June 2005 in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del. The case is still pending.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','As Capitol lawmakers watch their credibility plummet in opinion polls, they can’t afford any further delay in requiring lobbyists to disclose the fortunes in campaign donations they harvest from clients out to buy legislative access. Both the House and Senate have approved separate bills containing this vital reform, but efforts to negotiate a final compromise have been blocked for weeks while the lobbying industry beats the drums for evasion.Voters are watching to see if lawmakers have the guts to own up to their scandalous weakness for pandering to bundle-bearing lobbyists.Right now, the main obstruction is Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, who is demanding iron-clad guarantees that the final compromise includes his version of a requirement to disclose pork-barrel earmarking. We’re all for that disclosure, too. But Mr. DeMint’s adamant posture looks a lot more like grandstanding — or obstruction — than a passion for reform.The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, who is up for re-election and is a sudden champion of ethics reform, has agreed to the Democrats’ unusual plan for bypassing Mr. DeMint. It involves the two houses’ redrafting and passing precisely the same bills to avoid the need to go to conference.This is an extreme tactic that raises fresh qualms that the bill writers, working in secret, will end up backtracking from full lobbying reform. The legislation must require a timely and detailed disclosure of the bundlers’ quid-pro-quo money flow — posted on the Internet so all can see. It would be political folly for Congress to invite a lobbyist-friendly devil into the final details.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Gerhard Skrobek, the premier postwar artisan of Hummel figurines, the rosy-cheeked porcelain people that have graced millions of mantels around the world for nearly three-quarters of a century, died on July 1, near Coburg, Germany. He was 85 and lived in Coburg.Mr. Skrobek, who had leukemia, died of complications of heart surgery, said Tiffany Fox, a family spokeswoman.Until his retirement in 2002, Mr. Skrobek was the master sculptor at the Goebel porcelain company in Rödental, Germany, which manufactures Hummelware. There he updated classic designs of the past and oversaw the production of new ones.Wildly collectible, Hummel figurines were inspired by the drawings of a Bavarian woman named Berta Hummel, who took the name Sister Maria Innocentia after she became a Franciscan nun. Starting in 1935, Goebel transformed her images into three-dimensional figures, manufacturing them under her supervision until her death in 1946. Since then the company has designed its figurines based on the trove of drawings she left behind.With their compact bodies, chubby cheeks, enormous shoes and exquisite distillation of sentiment, Hummel figurines are instantly recognizable. They have been issued in more than 1,000 different styles, including Nativity figures; all manner of angels (angels with harps, horns, tubas, concertinas, guitars, lutes, cellos, pianos, xylophones and what appears to be a radio); patriotic characters (Military Trumpet Boy Hummel, Desert Storm Hummel); practitioners of a range of professions (doctor, pharmacist, fisherman, chimney sweep); and brides and grooms fit to crown very sturdy cakes.Prices for new Hummel pieces can range from $100 to about $4,000 for elaborate tableaux containing multiple characters. Since their inception, more than 20 million figurines have been sold worldwide, said Carrie Kulak, the North American director of the M. I. Hummel Club, the official collectors’ organization.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Listerine Whitening, a growing division of Listerine, is also sponsoring ABC’s “Good Morning America” concert series as part of the promotion.The commercial, said Lisa Lieberman, senior product director for Listerine Whitening, is “a slice of life showing consumers engaging and interacting,” and is meant to carry the message that Listerine Whitening Quick Dissolving Strips “really do give you the freedom to be out in public.”As for the deliberately herky-jerky cinematography, she said: “It has a very modern look and is meant to look different from other commercials — it’s a real lifestyle situation.”White teeth remain a national obsession, according to a Gallup poll conducted for Listerine. The results indicate that 72 percent of consumers want whiter teeth, but only 25 percent have ever tried a whitening product.“We looked at the category created in 2001, and sales were declining as people weren’t satisfied with the whitening products,” Ms. Lieberman said. “They weren’t convenient or pleasant, and there was an opportunity to change the whitening experience.”Listerine describes this product introduction as one of the most significant in the brand’s 100-year history — and also the most noteworthy one since Johnson & Johnson’s $16.6 billion deal to acquire Pfizer consumer health care in June 2006.Listerine is aimed squarely at loosening Crest’s formidable grip on the business. The top three sellers in the whitening category are whitening strips from Crest, a unit of Procter & Gamble, that command about half of sales volume. Whitestrips, which were Crest’s breakout product, effectively introduced modern teeth-whitening products in 2001.Sales in the category — which includes other brands like Aquafresh White Trays, from GlaxoSmithKline — rose to $333 million in 2003, but have steadily declined, according to the Chicago-based Information Resources, which collects sales data from many retailers but does not include Wal-Mart and a handful of other stores. Industry sales in 2006 dropped to $218 million, while sales through June 17, 2007 were $112 million, Information Resources said.While its rival, Crest, has worked hard to win product placements on television shows and endorsements from celebrities, Listerine’s marketing team prefers to get the brand into the hands of potential consumers so they can try it. A national sampling program, aided by Arnold Worldwide of Boston and New York, is starting as part of an effort to distribute as many as 17 million samples during the first year.Some strips will be taped to other Listerine products; others given away at stores like Wal-Mart. The company plans to dispatch teams of workers on motorcycles in 20 cities to give away T-shirts that read, “Do It Here. Do It There. Do It Anywhere,” referring to consumers’ ability to use the whitening strips.“With a new launch we need to drive trial and awareness,” said Ms. Lieberman, who added that the company invested heavily in its sampling program. The experience of using the strips, she said, “is game-changing.”There are other nontraditional aspects to the campaign. Listerine is running a consumer-generated photo contest that allows people to upload photos of themselves using the whitening strips while doing other things, like walking the dog. The contest — at www.wheredoyouwhiten.com — will be judged by the singer Jennifer Nettles of the band Sugarland, who is being enlisted as a spokeswoman.RappCollins, the New York agency, is handling relationship marketing and the digital component, while Edelman, the public relations agency, has been briefing magazine editors on the new product.Listerine has some recent success at bringing new brands to market: its PocketPaks dissolvable breath strips ranked No. 2 on Information Resources’ “New Product Pacesetters” ranking for 2002, incidentally just behind Crest’s Whitening Strips.John Deighton, a professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in marketing, said that consumer product companies these days have to keep expanding their popular product lines. “A brand like Listerine has to get bigger or risk being pruned,” he said.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Jimmyjane, a San Francisco company that sells sex-related consumer products including high-end vibrators (a gold-plated one sells for $250), has six venture capitalists among its investors. The company’s chief executive said he was close to completing a $3 million to $5 million round of financing with one or more funds — not merely individual venture capitalists but marquee funds.“It will be a watershed,” said Jimmyjane’s chief executive, Ethan Imboden, formerly a design consultant to Nike, Motorola and other mainstream brands. He said the deal could be among the first major venture fund investments in an overtly sexually themed business.The involvement of mainstream investors in such companies is still very much in its infancy, and even those with a vested interest in developing it say it may not evolve further. There are considerable hurdles, chiefly and simply the discomfort of many in being affiliated with products and services they consider immoral or that they think could tarnish their reputations.In addition, investors are dubious that these companies can turn a sufficient profit to justify the risk. Pointedly, investors may find it tough to take sex-related companies public, or find big companies to acquire them, limiting their profit-making exit strategies. And the universities and endowments that invest in private equity funds and venture capitalists are not likely to approve deals they see as pornographic, investment bankers said.But there are also some forces compelling greater interest, according to venture investors and investment bankers, like P. Holt Gardiner, a partner at Ackrell Capital, a boutique investment bank that focuses largely on the high-technology industries but has a growing practice in matching investors with makers and distributors of sex-themed content.Mr. Gardiner said that investors were intrigued that the digital era is permitting a range of new distribution models — from the Internet to digital television — that are creating many opportunities to profit from making and delivering pornographic content. Those may include technical or payment infrastructure start-ups, like those that allow micropayments.More broadly, Mr. Gardiner noted that there was an enormous flow of dollars into the venture and private equity business and that investors were looking for creative ways to put that money to work. He said sex entertainment companies could be purchased at a discount, because there was less competition from prospective investors driving up the price.Investor reticence about the sex industry is changing notably, Mr. Gardiner said.But he conceded that for the most part, the interest had yet to translate into many deals. He said that he had been involved in several discussions with venture capital firms that showed interest in a sex-themed company, did the due diligence, signed off on the deal, and then showed it to their limited partners (the foundations or wealthy individuals that invest through venture capitalists).“Invariably, one of the limited partners balks,” Mr. Gardiner said. “It has happened four or five times.”Mr. Gardiner said a key selling point in getting these deals done was to give the mainstream investors some public relations cover by repackaging the company in a more conventional way. For instance, he said, a company can still get a big chunk of revenue from the pornography industry but also branch out into mainstream business.He cited as an example a company called Waat Media, which aggregates and distributes content to cellphones and has deals with several makers of explicit pornography, like Penthouse and the Vivid Entertainment Group. In September, Spark Capital, a mainstream venture capital firm, led a $12.5 million round of financing for Waat, but changed the company’s name to Twistbox Entertainment and packaged the company as a mobile content distributor.Spark Capital declined to comment for this column, as did Twistbox, which remains the parent company of Waat Media.Philip S. Schlein, a partner at US Venture Partners and among the venture capitalists who invested in Jimmyjane, has said that he believes investment in such enterprises will increase because society is becoming more open. Among Jimmyjane’s other venture investors is Timothy C. Draper, a partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson. He did not return calls for comment.Mr. Imboden, the chief executive of Jimmyjane, said what attracted venture capitalists was not anything unusual: the opportunity to finance innovative products that can change or take over markets. Their expertise can be valuable, Mr. Imboden said.“They understand innovation in consumer products and branding,” he said.Francis Koenig, a former hedge fund manager and now the chief executive of AdultVest, a small investment banking company in Beverly Hills focusing on the pornography industry, agrees that more investment dollars will appear thanks to the widespread availability of explicit content on the Internet.“Accessibility breeds acceptance,” Mr. Koenig said. He has started two funds to invest in the industry, named the Bacchus and Priapus funds, but he declined to specify any deals his company had participated in.Meanwhile, not everyone is convinced the interest among mainstream investors will make a long-term impact.Paul Fishbein, president of AVN Media Network, a company that publishes information about the pornography trade, said the time was ripe for mainstream investment. But, he noted, the industry has historically attracted talk of mainstream investment that in the end has been mostly that — talk.“For five years we’ve been talking mainstream, mainstream, mainstream,” Mr. Fishbein said of the pornography trade. “But it still sits on the periphery.”'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Microsoft fought a similar battle before. In the mid-1990s Microsoft defeated Netscape Communications by embedding the Internet Explorer Web browser as a free component of its Windows operating system. The strategy insured Microsoft’s dominance over Netscape, but at the same time embroiled Microsoft in a legal battle with the Justice Department, which Microsoft eventually lost.Now, however, Microsoft’s executives appear to be increasingly confident that in addition to giving away some free services, they will be able to sell Web-based services both to consumers and to businesses.“We’re not moving toward a world of thin computing,” said Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, referring to systems in which simple processing takes place on a PC, but more complex processing is moved to a centralized computer through a network connection. “We’re moving toward a world of software plus services.”Nearly every Microsoft software application will be transformed with the addition of a Web-services component within 3 to 10 years, he said.He rejected the notion that in the future all software would be based in what computer industry executives refer to as “the cloud” — computer hardware and software reachable over the Internet. “People tend to get weird and extreme about this,” Mr. Ballmer said. “Does everything move to the cloud? I think that is wrong-minded.”The company has already begun charging a subscription fee for a set of computer security services and this fall it intends to introduce a set of consumer services like photo sharing under the Windows Live brand.The strategy did not immediately ignite enthusiasm among the more than 100 financial analysts who follow the company. Microsoft’s stock fell 73 cents Thursday, or 2.38 percent, to $29.98.Microsoft’s weak reception, against the backdrop of a steep decline in the overall market, came despite the company’s statement that it has sold 60 million copies of its Windows Vista operating systems. Microsoft said that this was the strongest initial sales performance of any of its operating systems. “We eclipsed the entire installed base of Apple in the first five weeks that this product shipped,” said Kevin Turner, Microsoft’s chief operating officer.The company expects a billion Windows-based computers — including those running pirated copies — within the next 12 months. At that point, personal computers will outnumber automobiles worldwide.Microsoft also said it agreed to buy the online advertising exchange AdECN to bolster its presence in the online advertising market. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.AdECN runs a Nasdaq-like marketplace, where ad space on Web sites is bought and sold in real time through an auction. The deal follows Yahoo’s acquisition of the ad exchange Right Media, which was announced in April. Yahoo paid $680 million for the 80 percent of Right Media it did not already own, but Microsoft’s purchase of AdECN is likely to be smaller.Microsoft has lagged behind Yahoo and Google in this business despite spending heavily to build its own advertising technology, known as AdCenter. In May, Microsoft agreed to pay $6 billion to acquire aQuantive, an online advertising conglomerate. And Microsoft has also bought small companies that specialize in placing ads in video games and mobile phones.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','Martin promised a hard-fought trial for Vick, who had been told by Commissioner Roger Goodell to stay away from the Falcons’ training camp. But for at least one day, Vick’s presence was still felt there, too. Outside the gates to the Falcons’ headquarters in Flowery Branch, Ga., more than 100 supporters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals stood along a road. Across the driveway from them were about 10 people chanting, “We love Michael Vick.”Inside the building, Falcons Coach Bobby Petrino spoke to his team about ignoring the distractions. He reminded the players that all teams faced adversity, invoking the case of the Patriots’ Super Bowl team that rallied around quarterback Tom Brady when he replaced the injured Drew Bledsoe.But few teams face the sort of ordeal the Falcons are likely to encounter this season. If they looked outside before practice, they could see people holding posters of dogs that had been brutalized, a reminder of the gruesome charges contained in Vick’s indictment. The Falcons have not only lost their best player, one whom the new starting quarterback, Joey Harrington, called an athletic phenomenon. They may encounter a backlash from fans, including their own.Several Falcons acknowledged that teammates had a wide range of opinions about Vick. But as Harrington assumed the starting job, and as Petrino began the task of tailoring the offense to a different style of play, the Falcons were desperate to put Vick’s case aside.When asked if he noticed the plane circling the practice field, tight end Alge Crumpler replied, “I was wondering when it was going to run out of gas.”Crumpler added: “I support Michael. I’m hoping he can get through this tough ordeal, but the outlook isn’t the best right now. As far as what happens in this locker room, it’s under our control. It’s going to be a bump in the road as we go forward.”Safety Lawyer Milloy quickly interjected, “It’s going to be a big bump in the road.”The 18-page indictment against Vick and his co-defendants accuses them of animal cruelty in graphic detail and also alleges that Vick gambled on the fights. During a search of Vick’s property in April, 54 pit bulls were recovered, along with a so-called rape stand used to hold dogs in place for mating, an electronic treadmill modified for dogs and bloody carpeting.The property was searched again in June, and investigators uncovered the graves of seven pit bulls that were alleged to have been killed by members of the dogfighting ring, after sessions to test the dogs’ fighting ability. Sometimes dogs were starved to make them hungry for the opposing dog, the indictment said. Fights ended when one dog died or surrendered. According to documents, losing dogs were sometimes put to death by shooting, drowning, strangulation, hanging or electrocution.If convicted, Vick faces prison, and in any case his future in the N.F.L. is unclear. Goodell said his office would conduct an investigation before it determined how and when to discipline Vick, a process with an indefinite timeline. The Falcons were prepared to suspend Vick for four games before Goodell interceded, and the Falcons have skirted the question of whether he would ever play for Atlanta again.Other N.F.L. players — notably Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis, who was accused of murder — have recovered from serious legal trouble to flourish again. The Falcons’ owner, Arthur Blank, who had grown close to Vick, perhaps hoped to begin the process of moving on without Vick on Thursday when he said to a reporter, “This is football you’re following.”For Vick, standing in his dark suit and blue shirt Thursday, football must have seemed far away. One protester outside training camp may have summed up the damning perceptions that could haunt Vick’s future. “Dog fighter,” the protester’s sign called Vick. But then it said something more: “Mediocre Quarterback.”'"
"'07-07-27,'0','He added, “I want an owner to think what a player thinks, to feel what a player feels.”The Jets’ owner, Woody Johnson, talked yesterday of Martin’s good work off the field “helping the homeless on the streets of New York or volunteering at soup kitchens.” Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, also praised him as a positive role model.Bill Parcells, Martin’s former coach, called him “one of the most inspirational players I have ever seen.” Herman Edwards, another of his former coaches, called him “one of the classiest and most humble players that I have ever been around.”And Martin has long been a favorite of teammates.“Off the field, he’s a stand-up individual who grew up in a tough environment and learned how to make the transition from an urban, inner-city kid to a multimillion-dollar athlete who has had nothing but success on and off the field,” the recently retired receiver Keyshawn Johnson said. Added Kevin Mawae, the former Jets center: “He was never bigger than the game.”At 5-foot-11 and 210 pounds, Martin was not as big as many other running backs, either. He was not fast or flashy, but he was a rock on offense.In December 2005, Martin had arthroscopic surgery to remove torn cartilage from his right knee. But wear and tear left the knee with bone against bone, and Martin spent the 2006 season on the physically unable to perform list while rehabilitating.“I can’t imagine running or cutting on it,” he said. “Walking around, I’m doing fine. I’m able to jog a little at times. Running at full speed is difficult. I hope I don’t have to replace the knee, but I realized if I went back on the field, I would end up using a wheelchair or a cane.”Without Martin last year, the Jets used the rookie Leon Washington, Cedric Houston and Kevan Barlow at running back and finished 30th among the 32 N.F.L. teams in rushing.Now Barlow is gone and the burden falls on Thomas Jones, acquired in an off-season trade with the Chicago Bears. Jones has rushed for 1,335 and 1,210 yards the past two seasons. Despite those strong numbers, he shared the job with Cedric Benson last year and was unhappy about it.So today, when the Jets open training camp in Hempstead, N.Y., Martin will be in retirement and Jones will take over at running back. Martin said he already missed the routine.“Your mind gets used to cycles,” he said. “I feel that coming on, and there’s nothing I can do about it.”Left guard Pete Kendall reported for camp yesterday. Kendall, a 12-year veteran who turned 34 this month, is set to make $1.7 million this year after averaging $3 million the previous three seasons. He is seeking to have the four-year deal he signed with the Jets last season restructured so he will be paid $2.7 million in 2007.'"

And the Nasdaq composite index fell 37.10 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,562.24.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.76 percent, from 4.787, and has now fallen for the eighth trading day in row.Markets took little comfort from a revised report that showed the economy grew at a faster pace in the second quarter, 3.4 percent, not 3.2 percent as earlier reported. The report also showed that consumer spending was weaker than had been thought and that much of the growth was due to stronger government spending and an increase in exports.The debt markets relatively newfound aversion to leveraged buyouts continued to rattle investors.Cadbury Schweppes, the British candy maker, said today that it would delay the sale of its beverage unit, which makes Dr. Pepper and 7 Up, because of “extreme volatility.” The news came just days after private equity firms and their banks had trouble finding investors willing to lend them money to fund the buyouts of Chrysler, the automaker, and Alliance Boots, the British drugstore chain.The information technology, energy, health care and information technology sectors led the market down. Of the 500 stocks in the S.&P., 359 ended down, 135 were up and 6 were unchanged. In the energy sector, the shares of major oil producers fell even as crude oil prices jumped and Chevron issued a strong profit report that was in line with analysts’ expectations. Mr. Levkovich suggested that the sell-off could be driven by profit taking, given that the energy sector is up nearly 19 percent for the year.Investors may be thinking “I’ve made money here and I want to protect my winnings,” Mr. Levkovich said. “You never lose money taking a profit,” he added. In Asian trading today, few markets were spared from the downturn. South Korea’s Kospi index closed 4.1 percent lower after the biggest sell-off in three years. Also, the Taiex, in Taiwan, fell 4.2 percent; the Singapore Straits Times index fell 3.2 percent; the Nikkei 225 Stock Average in Japan fell 2.4 percent; and the Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 2.8 percent.

"'07-07-27,'0','As Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate minority leader, Malcolm A. Smith, looked on awkwardly, the governor said that he had not been involved in an effort to tarnish Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader.“The attorney general’s office has put out a report that Senator Bruno has called thorough and complete, dealt with all of these issues,” he said, adding that he had “accepted those conclusions.”But his answers were challenged, and at one point after being interrupted repeatedly, a tense Mr. Spitzer asked a New York Post reporter, “Would you please calm down for a moment?”Mr. Cuomo’s report concluded that the governor’s staff had broken no laws but misused the State Police to gather information about Mr. Bruno in an effort to plant a negative story about him. The governor, a Democrat, has maintained that he was misled by his staff and knew nothing about the effort to discredit Mr. Bruno, the state’s top Republican.He has also said his staff was fully cooperative, even though two of his top aides, Mr. Dopp and Richard Baum, the secretary to the governor, refused to be interviewed at the direction of the governor’s counsel, instead providing brief sworn statements.Concerns have been rising from a number of quarters that the attorney general’s investigation was limited by his inability to compel the governor’s staff to submit to sworn interviews or seek subpoenas.Technically speaking, Mr. Cuomo could have asked the governor to grant him the authority to investigate the governor’s staff and issue subpoenas, though legal experts interviewed on Thursday said they did not recall a precedent for such a step.High-level staff members in the attorney general’s office, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the nature of the matter, said such a step seemed unlikely to succeed, given the unwillingness of the Spitzer administration to allow two of its top staff members to be interviewed.In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Baum said he had been told not to testify by the governor’s counsel.“In general, the counsel’s office frowns on sworn testimony of people in the executive chamber who advise the governor because they prefer to not have wide-reaching questions about the advice to the governor,” he said.The Associated Press first reported the Ethics Commission inquiry on Thursday.The commission sent a letter to the attorney general’s office on Monday seeking transcripts from their investigation, interview notes, documents, tape records, correspondence and copies of e-mail messages.The commission can impose fines up to $40,000 and refer matters for prosecution where criminal misconduct is suspected. Senate Republicans said the move would not affect their plans as they consider their own investigation.Though Democrats this week have not defended Mr. Spitzer’s conduct, there were signs on Thursday that party members may be closing ranks with the governor.Mr. Silver was irked after the combative questions at the bill-signing ceremony. He said he accepted the attorney general’s report that no laws had been broken, and suggested that the governor’s critics were now trying to wound him politically.Legal experts disagreed, however, on whether the attorney general knew enough to say laws had not been broken.Though he credited Mr. Cuomo for his thorough report and “being willing to call it as he saw it notwithstanding the fact it concerned a fellow Democrat,” Stephen M. Gillers, a law professor at New York University, suggested the attorney general was premature in his conclusions. He cited one particular section of the state penal law, Official Misconduct, which says that a public servant is guilty of a misdemeanor if he commits an “unauthorized exercise of his official functions” with the “intent to obtain a benefit or deprive another person of a benefit.”“It’s certainly sufficient to warrant investigation and prevent the attorney general from saying no laws were broken without further investigation,” Professor Gillers said.“I think that’s not a fair reading of the statute,” he said, adding that “this is a political matter, not a criminal matter.”'"
"'07-07-27,'0','The plunge came a day after the private equity firm buying Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler said it would complete the transaction for the automaker despite an inability to borrow the money in credit markets, as had been planned. Banks will hold those loans, as they will for a similar deal involving Alliance Boots, a British pharmacy chain. Shares of DaimlerChrysler fell $4.11, to $88.91.“There is fear, but not a fear of recession,” said Bill Gross, chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco, a large bond management firm. “The fear is directed toward the question of who will be willing to lend $200 billion to provide takeout financing for previously announced private equity deals.”Yesterday, the Dow industrials plunged 311.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 13,473.57, while the S.& P. 500 dropped 35.43 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,482.66. The Nasdaq composite index was down 48.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,599.34. The S.& P. is still up 4.5 percent for the year, while the Dow is 8.1 percent higher. But the S.& P. has fallen 4.5 percent since reaching a record last week.In the last hour or so of trading, the major Wall Street indexes recovered about a third of their steepest losses for the day.Losses of more than 2 percent were recorded in Spain, France and Germany, while Britain, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil fell more than 3 percent. Asian markets fell less yesterday, closing before the worst selling began, but opened down sharply on Friday.The Nikkei 225 in Japan and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong were down some 2.5 percent at the opening. Benchmarks in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore all fell by more than 3 percent. All had regained some points by midmorning, but continued to trade broadly lower.The credit difficulties began in the United States with investors growing worried about losses on securities that helped to finance subprime mortgages for borrowers with weak credit, but now they have spread to highly leveraged companies as well.“The really good times are over,” said Simon Ballard, a global credit strategist at ABN Amro Asset Management in London. “What we have now is a very weak market in terms of credit globally,” he added. “It will change the environment for higher leverage-type transactions going forward, especially leveraged buyouts.”In the past, a sudden slow down in lending has sometimes led to sharp market falls. The leveraged buyout boom in the 1980s came to a halt when a planned buyout of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, could not be financed. The S.& P. 500 fell 6 percent in one day when that was announced, but regained all the lost ground within 12 weeks.Even as the stock market has gyrated in recent weeks — with the Dow industrials alternating between rising and falling over the last eight trading days — financial stocks have been coming under pressure. Citigroup dropped $1.40, or 2.9 percent, to $47.81 yesterday, and is down 9 percent in the last two weeks. Goldman Sachs fell $8.04, or 4 percent, to $195.12 yesterday, and has dropped 12 percent over the period.The falling stock markets yesterday helped turn oil markets lower. After rising above $77 a barrel in early trading — the first time since last summer that level was hit — the nearby crude oil future fell back below $75.Exxon Mobil reported its first earnings decline in years, saying it made $10.26 billion in the second quarter, about $100 million less than in the second quarter of 2006. Earnings per share were up, because of an aggressive share repurchase plan, but shares of Exxon fell $4.56, to $88.23.American investors were also depressed by a report of slowing sales of new homes, and by reports of losses from home builders. Beazer Homes fell $1.48, or 8.7 percent, to $15.56, and has now lost two-thirds of its value this year.Beazer faces a criminal investigation for arranging government-guaranteed mortgages for buyers who should not have qualified, but other home builders have also plunged. Pulte Homes fell 63 cents, or 3 percent, to $20.04, and is off about 40 percent this year.Not all stocks were lower.In an indication of the higher volatility in the stock market, Apple, which lost 8 percent of its value on Tuesday amid fears that its iPhone had not sold as well as expected, regained all of that loss after it reported strong profits Wednesday and said it expects to sell one million phones by the end of September.One index that tracks volatility in the stock market, the VIX, is at its highest level in more than a year.3M, which reported record profits, was the only one of the 30 Dow industrials to be up in late trading.The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.79 percent yesterday from 4.90 percent Wednesday, as some investors sought safety in the most secure financial instruments available. For lower quality bonds, however, the yields rose and some were difficult to sell.“We needed to clean house and it’s getting cleaned,” said Kingman D. Penniman, the president of KDP Investment Advisors, which focuses on high-yield bonds. “It’s the market going from too much liquidity to none. Many of the participants have never seen it.”Standard & Poor’s, in its leveraged commentary report, said the decline in high-yield bond prices this week was the largest since the plunge after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.“It’s pretty clear that this is a big move away from taking risk,” said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and chief economist for OppenheimerFunds, a mutual fund company.“People have been borrowing unusually cheaply to buy assets,” Mr. Webman said, “and that whole transaction made sense — whether it was houses or companies — if the asset was going to appreciate. But if that asset was not going to appreciate, your loan was not going to work.”The fall in Treasury bond rates has done little for mortgage rates. Freddie Mac reported that the average rate for 30-year mortgage loans was 6.69 percent. Since mid-June, Treasury rates have fallen by half a percentage point, but only a tenth of that move has carried over to the mortgage market.With the growing distress in credit markets, securities backed by risky mortgages have been a top concern. They are held by pension funds, hedge funds and many other investors around the world. Until recently, most policy makers and analysts argued that even if the market for those bonds collapsed, no major firm was likely to be seriously injured.But the big banks now find themselves taking on more loans because they had promised to do so if the loans could not be sold. And the market for some types of securities has all but vanished.Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said this week it may have to keep riskier mortgage securities that it used to routinely sell. Countrywide fell 82 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $29.25, and is trading at a three-year low.“Everybody now recognizes that the elimination of creative finance in housing leaves us with a problem for new homebuyers,” said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, because their income is not high enough to buy homes with interest rates and home prices at current levels.“You can make the case,” Mr. Barbera added, “that we are simply witnessing a reverse of the late 1990s — Asia collapse, long-term interest rates swoon and U.S. housing booms.”This time, however, interest rates may not fall much, he said, because of a boom in Asia, and that will put more pressure on housing prices.'"
"'07-07-27,'0','LITTLE did this nation’s earliest settlers know that their agricultural fairs would be the start of a long, strong American tradition that now encompasses everything from corn-dog stands to pop concerts. North America is today home to more than 3,200 events called state fairs, county fairs, livestock shows or expos, depending on who is putting them on.Among the most anticipated are the huge state fairs held in serious farm country during August and September.“Fairs came into existence to provide a place for competition among those who produce agriculture, to aid in scientific studies and for education,” said Jim Tucker, chief executive of the International Association of Fairs and Expositions, a Missouri-based trade organization. “With less than 2 percent of this country engaged in the production of agriculture, it’s critical that this information is made available to the public.”But along with the lessons on animal husbandry and displays of fertilizing techniques and tractors guided by global positioning systems come other attractions, including slick grandstand shows, parades, midways, exhibits of local artwork, endless food-tasting stands and wacky contests that yield thousands of dollars in prize money.The biggest state fair is the one in Texas, which draws about three million visitors over a whopping 24 days (most fairs last about 10 days). It starts in late September. Its main attractions are certainly in keeping with Texas’ massive-is-better theme: the Texas Star Ferris Wheel, which, at 212 feet high, is called the largest in North America, and the icon named Big Tex, a 52-foot-tall cowboy who wears a 75-gallon hat and drawls “Howdy, folks!” in a deep, dopey voice.'"

"'07-07-28,'0','PARIS, July 27 — The former prime minister of France, Dominique de Villepin, was placed under formal investigation on Friday in an inquiry into whether he was involved in a campaign to smear Nicolas Sarkozy before Mr. Sarkozy won the presidency.A lawyer for Mr. de Villepin, Luc Brossollet, said Friday that Mr. de Villepin was being investigated for “complicity to make false accusations” after the former prime minister appeared before two judges assigned to the case, Agence France-Presse reported.The scandal involved false documentation that seemed to show large sums of money, presumably bribes, passing through secret bank accounts held by Mr. Sarkozy and others. Mr. Sarkozy said at the time that the scandal had been orchestrated to ruin his chances for the presidency.Mr. Sarkozy was Mr. de Villepin’s chief political rival at the time the accusations were made.The court decision on Friday puts Mr. de Villepin on notice that he might eventually face formal charges and should begin to make legal preparations.“I would like to restate this morning that at no point did I ask for an investigation into political figures, and at no moment did I partake in any political machination,” Mr. de Villepin said Friday.On July 5, the police raided Mr. de Villepin’s office, a day after spending more than six hours searching his Paris apartment. He was also questioned on the matter last year.In 2004, when Mr. Sarkozy was a cabinet member, hoping to succeed the longtime president, Jacques Chirac, investigators received a CD-ROM containing the names of supposed beneficiaries of kickbacks paid in the sale of French frigates to Taiwan in 1991. The list included secret bank accounts at Clearstream, a financial clearinghouse based in Luxembourg that had earlier been the subject of corruption charges.'"

"'07-07-28,'0','The main runway at Congonhas Airport in São Paulo, Brazil’s busiest, reopened, 10 days after a passenger jet skidded off its rain-slicked surface and crashed, killing 199 people. Until the runway is entirely grooved to drain rainwater, which could take weeks, landings will be restricted in wet weather. The runway’s closing after the crash forced airlines to cancel hundreds of flights and caused a ripple effect of delays around the country. Air travel has slowly started to return to normal, the Brazil airport authority said, with fewer delays and cancellations.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','Still, the panel observed that Mr. Corzine’s accident provided the context for a total of 18 recommendations.“Travel far in excess of posted speed limits or the flow of traffic, particularly when accompanied by the use of emergency lights or sirens, is unjustified and should not be tolerated absent a particularized threat, security-related reason or other emergency,” the report said. “Lights and sirens are unnerving to other drivers on the road, produce erratic and unpredictable responses and serve to increase, rather than decrease, the threats to the governor’s safety, and should be used only in limited circumstances where adequate justification exists.”The state attorney general, Anne Milgram, appearing with the state police superintendent and a co-chairman of the panel, said at a press conference on Friday, “It’s our obligation now, and it’s our intention, to follow the blueprint that has been set forth by this panel.”The report is expected to be the final formal investigation into the accident. Last month, Col. Joseph R. Fuentes of the state police concluded that the trooper who drove Governor Corzine, Robert J. Rasinski, violated policy by speeding and using emergency lights, and was not alert enough to prevent the accident.In this case, the panel looked at the practices of the Executive Protection Unit, a 29-member team that is responsible for the safety of the governor and other top officials. The panel said perhaps seven troopers should be added to the team.The panel urged that the state use its helicopters more often, for both safety and efficiency; Colonel Fuentes said that because state helicopters were up all day long anyway, performing missions related to domestic security and other tasks, the additional costs of transporting the governor would probably not be excessive.“All we’re saying is instead of going from this, A to B, you go from A to B with the governor in the back,” he said.When on the road, the report said, the governor should ride in vehicles with less wear. In the current fleet of 35 vehicles, mostly Chevrolet Suburbans, most have more than 120,000 miles on the odometer. The report suggested that 80,000 miles be the maximum.At the same time, the panel expressed “real concern” that these troopers had been taxed by too many requests from too many state officials and visiting dignitaries. Indeed, the panel observed that the Executive Protection Unit had provided security and drivers to more than 300 foreign and domestic visitors since 2005, and as many as six state officials.The panel said that only the governor and the attorney general be guaranteed a security detail and that others be assessed on the basis of an impending threat. In a separate report released on Friday, the Division of Highway Traffic Safety said the percentage of people using seat belts had reached a record-high 91.4 percent.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','In another account, an astronaut flying to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft became drunk before the trip.No names or dates were given for either incident.The committee’s review of physical and psychological health issues affecting astronauts stemmed from the arrest of an astronaut, Capt. Lisa M. Nowak, a naval officer, after she confronted a romantic rival last February in the parking lot at Orlando International Airport. Captain Nowak was subsequently discharged from NASA and faces charges of assault and attempted kidnapping.At a news conference here Friday, the panel’s chairman, Colonel Bachmann, said via telephone hookup that the reason the anecdotal references to the drinking incidents were included in the report that the panel delivered to NASA was not to suggest that the agency necessarily had an alcohol problem, but to emphasize the importance of heeding flight surgeons.The panel did not ask for details of the accounts, including reports of heavy alcohol use by astronauts immediately before flights, and does not know how any such episodes were resolved, he said.“In none of these can we say factually they did or did not occur,” he continued, adding that the panel’s mission had been not to investigate allegations but to point out that health and safety concerns might have been ignored.Dr. Jonathan Clark, a former NASA and military flight surgeon whose wife, Laurel Salton Clark, died in the loss of the shuttle Columbia in 2003, said he was surprised at the lack of factual substantiation in the report.“If you’re going to put something in like that,” Dr. Clark said, referring to the allegations of heavy drinking before fights, “you’ve got to make sure you’ve got your facts straight.”But if an astronaut did actually board and fly a T-38 jet while intoxicated, “that’s a big deal,” he said, reflecting a “blatant disregard for safety.” That in turn would hark back to the findings of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board and the presidential commission that investigated the earlier Challenger explosion. Both concluded that a culture of playing down safety issues had had a part in the disasters.Dr. Sandra A. Yerkes, a retired Navy captain and flight surgeon who was a member of the astronaut health panel, said she and her colleagues had been concerned that the alcohol allegations might be sensationalized.“We thought we had couched it properly,” she said of the references to drinking, which involved five paragraphs of the panel’s 12-page report. “Perhaps it was naïve of the committee to put it in there.”In response to the report, NASA officials said astronauts would be asked to draft a code of conduct to detail what behavior was expected from members of the agency.Ellen Ochoa, director of flight crew operations at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, said NASA policy had long prohibited drinking in the 12 hours before an astronaut flies a training jet — the so-called “12-hour bottle-to-throttle rule.”This policy has also unofficially applied to spaceflights, she said, but from now on will formally apply.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','The former official described the encounter as “cordial” and said both leaders had agreed on the need to work together as moderates to counter rising attacks by hard-line Islamists in Pakistan.General Musharraf offered to allow Ms. Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, to return to Pakistan and contest elections for prime minister, the former official said. But General Musharraf said he would continue to serve as both Pakistan’s president and chief of the army.Ms. Bhutto objected to his holding both positions, according to the former official, but more meetings between their aides are expected. “The uniform is the problem,” the former official said, adding: “From his point of view, staying in uniform is the key to him staying in control of the levers of power. The civilians know that and are not going to accept that.”The meeting added to speculation that Ms. Bhutto could return to politics in Pakistan as early as September. It was also an indicator of the relief General Musharraf is seeking from the pressures increasingly besieging him, from prodemocracy demonstrators to radical Islamists, who have carried out a rising number of attacks and were further antagonized by the Red Mosque siege.There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the suicide attack on Friday, though there was speculation that it was another in a series of retaliatory strikes that have killed more than 100 people.Javed Iqbal Cheema, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said the suicide bomber on Friday had apparently sought to kill the security forces. Seven police officers were killed and 14 wounded, he said, according to the state-run news agency. Six civilians were killed and 47 wounded, he said.The explosion shook nearby buildings and was heard miles away.“Everything seemed to tumble down after a deafening blast,” said Muhammad Daud, who owns a pharmacy. “I crawled out of the debris and saw pieces of flesh all around.”The trouble began around 12:30 p.m. when angry protesters chanting slogans in support of Abdur Rashid Ghazi, a religious leader killed during the mosque assault, barred a government-appointed cleric from leading the prayers.The government cleric, Maulana Ashfaq, was forced out of the mosque and said that he would never return.The seminary students then occupied the mosque as police officers retreated and fired tear gas. Dozens of protesters climbed to the rooftop and chanted jihadist slogans. Hundreds of people rummaged through the rubble left from the siege at the mosque compound and an adjacent public library.Asma Mazhar, 15, dressed head to toe in a black burqa, stood barefoot amid the rubble. It is a sign of respect, she said. “This is sacred land,” she said. Ms. Mazhar said she had been studying at the seminary for five years. On July 10, the last day of the siege, she surrendered with 28 other women.One bearded young man, who did not want to be identified, held pieces of rubble from the siege. “These are fragrant with the blood of the martyrs,” he said. More than 100 people were killed in the Red Mosque siege, the government says.By 6 p.m., the security forces had regained control of the mosque. Chaudhry Mohammad Ali, the deputy commissioner of Islamabad, said dozens of seminary students were arrested. “There is no occupation,” he said with relief.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','Quarterback JaMarcus Russell, the No. 1 overall draft pick, and the Oakland Raiders failed to agree on a contract before the start of training camp yesterday.Coach Lane Kiffin said Thursday that the team was making progress toward signing Russell, but the two sides were unable to reach an agreement before practice began yesterday afternoon. The Raiders’ second-round pick, Zach Miller, a tight end from Arizona State, also failed to reach a deal and missed the opening session of training camp.The Raiders’ talks with Russell and his agent, Eric Metz, have been going on for weeks. Russell is reportedly seeking a deal worth $60 million. Last year’s No. 1 overall pick, defensive end Mario Williams of the Houston Texans, signed a six-year, $54 million contract that included $26.5 million in guaranteed money.The deal with Russell is so complex that the Raiders have had as many as six people from their front office working on the contract.BULGER SIGNS EXTENSION WITH RAMS The St. Louis Rams signed Marc Bulger, a two-time Pro Bowl quarterback, to a six-year, $65 million extension yesterday that makes him the highest-paid player in franchise history.

"'07-07-28,'0','Chevron posted a better-than-expected 24 percent rise in quarterly earnings yesterday on higher profit from its refineries and a gain from the sale of its stake in the power company Dynegy.Refining margins hit near-record rates during the quarter, propping up profits at integrated oil companies, which both produce and refine oil and gas, as commodity prices dipped.Still, the second quarter was a mixed bag for the sector as lower output and crude oil prices outweighed strong refining profit at some large oil companies.Chevron’s net income in the quarter increased to $5.38 billion, or $2.52 a share, from $4.35 billion, or $1.97 a share, a year earlier.Excluding a gain of $680 million on the sale of Dynegy stock and a loss of $160 million on debt redemption, the company earned about $2.37 a share. Analysts’ average forecast for that figure was $2.30 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.The company’s production in the quarter dropped about 1 percent, to 2.63 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, because of changes in ownership at its operations in Venezuela and lower production in the United States.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','The newest observation wheels frequently form part of a larger development project. Visitors to the wheels in Singapore and Melbourne, for example, will be able to meander though shops, restaurants and other entertainment as they wait for their “flight,” a contrast to the glacially slow queue that snakes outside the London Eye.The sponsorship possibilities are also rich. Last month, the British Airways London Eye, as it is officially known, was used to promote the movie “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.” A 100-foot likeness of the surfer was affixed to the center of the Eye, as the film’s stars did their interviews in the wheel’s capsules. And the pods on the new wheel that spins atop the Dream Mall, a huge shopping complex that opened this spring in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, are decorated with images of the popular cartoon character Hello Kitty.Unlike the seating in their older counterparts, the observation wheels feature climate-controlled, rotating capsules that can hold up to 40 people, and can be reserved for business meetings, birthdays and weddings. Capsule amenities include leather seats, plasma screens, refrigerators and bars.The new wheels also spin more slowly, allowing passengers to board without the wheel’s being stopped. The London Eye, for example, revolves at a leisurely 0.6 mile an hour. The 394-foot Sky Dream Fukuoka in Japan even advertises this lazy pace as a selling point — it helps ensure “maximum kissing time.”In fact, slow speeds have long been the norm in Japan, where Ferris wheels have enjoyed a unique popularity. “After World War II, they were a symbol of our economic recovery,” said Yuko Fukui, who wrote a book on the history of Ferris wheels. “In Western countries, they’re more thrilling, like a roller coaster. However, in Japan, they’ve always been more like the new observation wheels.”Structurally, the wheels rising up today still bear much in common with the original, designed by the civil engineer George W. Ferris for the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. It was presented as America’s answer to the Eiffel Tower (which opened in 1889 and, like the London Eye, was meant as a temporary structure).Even by modern standards, Ferris’s original was no slouch: for 50 cents apiece, nearly 1,500 passengers at a time could ascend to 264 feet. The biggest wheel in the United States today is the comparatively modest Texas Star at the State Fair of Texas, in Dallas. At 212 feet, it fails to top even the Riesenrad in Vienna, which was made famous in the 1949 film “The Third Man” and is still operating 110 years after its construction.Before the recent renaissance, times were tough on Ferris wheels, especially in the United States and Europe. According to Norman Anderson, a retired professor at North Carolina State University who wrote the book “Ferris Wheels: An Illustrated History,” neither Disneyland (which opened in 1955) nor Walt Disney World (1971) deigned to include one. And as increasingly spectacular theme park rides set the tone in the 1970s and ’80s, traditional attractions like Ferris wheels and carousels fell out of favor.“Almost every carnival and state fair, even the church bazaars, had a Ferris wheel,” Mr. Anderson said. “But the problem is that the things are so well-built they last forever, so there wasn’t a lot of economic encouragement to build new ones.”Mr. Speigel, of the International Theme Park Services, agreed. “They became somewhat passé in the mid-70s,” he said. “Nobody was putting them in anymore, and we didn’t see any activity there until really the success of the London Eye."" Since then, he said, the boom has been “similar to what happened in the roller coaster industry, when steel roller coasters started getting higher and higher. Now the wheels are getting larger and larger in diameter, and I’m not sure where it’s going to end.""In that respect, the sky is the limit. According to several engineers, the wheels could theoretically get as tall as any building. “Technically there are ways,” said Roy Vocking, vice president of Ride Trade International, a company based in Liechtenstein that builds amusement rides. “You can build it in concrete, and it can be any height you want,” he said.But bigger is not always better. “These very big wheels of over 120 meters are costing around a hundred to two hundred million dollars,” he said. “So if you’re not going to get millions of people through a year, it doesn’t make economic sense to build them.”The call of nature is another barrier to height. “The biggest constraint is the amount of time people need to be away from the toilet,” Mr. Vocking said. A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, another builder of giant wheels, said studies indicate 35 to 45 minutes is the longest people are willing to wait.Indeed, “half an hour is a good time to experience a good view,” said Florian Bollen, the chairman of the Great Wheel Corporation, a company developing many of the newest wheels. “Everything beyond that gets kind of repetitive.”“I think we are now already stretching toward the limits,” he added. “I think that the 208 meters in Beijing is not going to be topped very quickly.”So now some wheels are competing on novelty, rather than size. The Tianjin Eye, a wheel planned in China for next year, will be built on a traffic bridge, with cars passing on either side. Big wheels on the roofs of department stores have become a fixture in Japan and Korea, and in 2005 Ride Trade built an oval wheel on the facade of a gambling parlor in Osaka.“The developers want something to make their particular attraction stand out,” Mr. Vocking said, adding that Ride Trade had even received a recent request for a figure-8 shaped wheel.At the same time, relatively smaller (and often portable) observation wheels are also quietly rising in cities like York, England, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. In North America, the first next-generation observation wheel is the 175-foot Niagara SkyWheel, which opened last summer on the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls.“At the end of the day, it all comes down to location,” Mr. Vocking said. “If you have the location and an interesting iconic attraction which will enable you to have a bird’s-eye view of the area, success is almost guaranteed.”'"
"'07-07-28,'0','In an e-mail message titled “Cleavage,” Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign has an eye-catching pitch for campaign contributions.The subject line of the message refers to a July 20 article in The Washington Post about the neckline on an outfit Mrs. Clinton wore during a floor speech she gave two days earlier. It “sat low on her chest and had a subtle V-shape,” said the article, by Robin Givhan, a style writer who had watched the speech on C-Span2. “The cleavage registered after only a quick glance. No scrunch-faced scrutiny was necessary. There wasn’t an unseemly amount of cleavage showing, but there it was.”Ms. Givhan’s article described the cleavage as “an exceptional kind of flourish” even for a woman who, in her campaign for president, has given up on her onetime “desexualized uniform” — a black pantsuit — in favor of “a wide array of suits and jackets” that have allowed her to play “the fashion field.”Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, not at all happy about the article, is hoping its attack on it will prove to be a lucrative tool. “Frankly, focusing on women’s bodies instead of their ideas is insulting,” says the fund-raising e-mail message, written by the senior Clinton adviser Ann Lewis and distributed yesterday.Ms. Lewis also lamented a moment during Monday’s Democratic presidential debate when John Edwards, asked to critique Mrs. Clinton, jokingly expressed reservations about her coral jacket, which Senator Barack Obama defended.In big letters, the note reads: “Clothes? Makeup? Cleavage? What’s really important in this race? Help Hillary fight for what matters.”'"
"'07-07-28,'0','The chancellor said he had long planned to raise standards further. The new move, which has been discussed with some college presidents but has not been announced publicly, is also a response to some professors’ complaints that too many students are poorly prepared for college work, especially in math.In the fall of 2005, for example, more than 40 percent of students in introductory math courses — pre-calculus, college algebra and calculus — either failed or dropped out of the classes, numbers typical of many universities nationwide.Still, some CUNY professors fear that the new requirements will keep low-income and black and Hispanic students from entering bachelor’s degree programs. The same concern was voiced nine years ago, when students needing remedial instruction were barred. Students, faculty and some elected officials also argued then that enrollments would plunge.Enrollments, in fact, have grown since then. But the proportion of black students at the top five colleges fell to 14 percent of regularly admitted freshmen last year, from 20 percent in 1999, according to the university’s data. (Those figures do not include those admitted through SEEK, a program for economically and educationally disadvantaged students, who do not have to meet the same criteria.) The proportion of Hispanic students has held even.William Crain, a City College psychology professor who fought the earlier change, said he vehemently opposed the new plan because he feared it would keep low-income and black and Hispanic students from entering bachelor’s degree programs. “This is turning the university into more of a middle-class university,” he said.Robert Ramos, a Brooklyn College graduate student who is chairman of the University Student Senate and is a trustee, said he was torn.“I understand the importance of having high standards,” he said. “They help in making your degree much more valuable, especially in this day and age, especially when there is so much competition.”But, he added, “you also have to look at who CUNY is and who the mission of CUNY is to provide education for.”Dr. Goldstein acknowledged that “some dislocating effects” were inevitable, but said he expected them to be limited.Under the new standards, freshmen will have to earn at least 510 on the math SAT to win entry to the five top colleges, and 500 for the bachelor’s degree programs at the other senior colleges — John Jay, Lehman, Medgar Evers, New York City College of Technology, Staten Island and York. The university minimum is now 480, although some colleges have set higher cutoffs.The university said 266 students at the five top colleges scored between 480 and 510 on the math SAT last year, but might have qualified in other ways.Currently, students who do not meet the SAT requirement can substitute a score of at least 75 on the Math A Regents exam, which is typically taken in grades 8 to 10, or qualifying scores on ACT’s Compass placement tests in pre-algebra and algebra. The university has not yet set the tougher Regents cutoff because the state is changing its high school math program.The plan to raise standards took on momentum last winter, after the university’s math council, a group of college professors, asked that the Compass test cutoff scores be raised.In May, Selma Botman, the university provost, notified college presidents that those cutoff scores would be raised very slightly this fall — to 30 from 27 — and called on the presidents to improve their teaching and develop other courses for weaker students.Math professors were pleased by the provost’s attention but less happy with her solutions.Wallace Goldberg, chairman of the math department at Queens College, said at the time that the small increase was like going “from an F minus minus to an F minus.” This week, he said the plan to move still higher on Compass cutoffs in 2008 — a jump to 45 at the top five colleges — was better but still not enough.Many college presidents said they were eager to raise the requirements. “They are right in thinking the time has come,” said Christoph M. Kimmich, president of Brooklyn College, who was acting chancellor of the university when the earlier policy change was approved.Some CUNY officials, like Ricardo R. Fernández, president of Lehman College in the Bronx, who were not big supporters of that change, said they had come to embrace it.“Perhaps I have become more convinced that students are able to rise to the challenge,” Dr. Fernández said.He added that higher admissions standards would give Lehman added cachet and help it attract some of the 8,000 Bronx students who attend CUNY colleges in Manhattan that have tougher admissions requirements than Lehman does.Marcia V. Keizs, president of York College in Queens, said higher admissions standards were bringing in better prepared students who had a greater chance of graduating. “Many schools that had described York as not being on their radar screen before have put us on their radar now,” she said.Edison O. Jackson, president of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, said higher admissions standards had increased the proportion of students in the college’s bachelor’s degree program to about half of his student population, while the college’s associate’s degree track had shrunk.“Students are coming in and saying, ‘I want to move into the baccalaureate program and into my major much more quickly,’ ” Dr. Jackson said. “And they are.”'"

Be sure to keep copies of everything.”Then put it in writing. “Mail is best, since phone calls may be routed to a call center,” which may not have the authority to do what you want, and “e-mails can be easily ignored.” The magazine suggested sending everything certified mail with return receipt requested so that the company won’t be able to say later that it never got your letter.Make sure you are clear, factual and unemotional in detailing what went wrong. Include names and dates. “The more specific you can be the better.”Finally, tell the company exactly what they can do to make you happy. If you want your money back, say so.INFLUENTIAL TV Ladies Home Journal wonders whether it is the “Grey’s Anatomy” effect, referring to the fictional television program that shows that all doctors are remarkably good-looking people who have endlessly fascinating lives.“In a new poll of 1,500 teenagers, ‘doctor’ came in first as girl’s most desirable career, with 10 percent naming it their ideal job,” the magazine writes. “When ‘The Apprentice’ premiered three years ago, ‘businessperson’ topped the charts.”Clearly, there needs to be more TV shows about people who write for newspapers.FINAL TAKE You already know it costs a fortune to rear a child, but here is more bad news for parents.

Another asks provocatively, “Do you mind if my friend joins us?” At the end, the young male viewer has come to understand that if he simply sprays Lynx on himself, he can be as obnoxious or creepy as he likes, and he will still get, and keep, the fabulous babe.Alternative Newspeak The Atlanta-based Creative Loafing chain of alternative newspapers is taking over the company that owns The Chicago Reader and the Washington City Paper weeklies.

"'07-07-28,'0','Already there have been several casualties among hedge funds that invested primarily in subprime mortgages — those extended to people with weak credit. But problems have now moved into the broader credit markets, which have sold off sharply and are facing significant structural problems.Some of the securities in these markets are trading infrequently, which raises questions about whether the pricing portfolios, or “marking” positions, reflect their true value. With illiquid securities, traders cannot know the true value of the securities until they are sold. Bids and offers, or the prices in the marketplace, have been erratic, traders say.Market participants say Sowood’s credit securities were sold at a deep discount, which some in the market viewed as a fire sale, leading to speculation that the fund was in distress.The fund was up a little more than 1.5 percent through March, according to an investor letter, showing how quickly the markets — and a fund’s returns — can turn. Marketing documents indicate that a little less than 15 percent of the portfolio’s risk is in structured credit.For now, the fund appears to be simply selling positions. Investors’ capital is locked up for two years and three months. The fund also has a so-called gate, meaning that once investors have filed to redeem 25 percent of assets, the fund can suspend redemptions.But the situation is indicative of a teetering market. The debt market is essentially frozen with concerns that the following scenario emerges: a major hedge fund moves to sell a position, getting a low price or mark. The low price indicates the market is in distress, and the brokers significantly discount the collateral the funds have set aside in order to do business. At that point, the brokers issue margin calls, and the hedge funds sell to meet the calls — into a distressed market — causing investors to panic and redeem their money. And the death spiral begins.At this moment, that situation does not seem to have appeared in the markets, though several funds focused on the subprime market, including two large Bear Stearns funds, are essentially worthless.Wall Street has also tried to convince the marketplace that recent problems in the subprime sector were contained. In the subprime market, not only were mortgages extended to individuals with very poor credit, but those mortgages were wrapped into different debt products bought by investors looking for high returns.But as mortgage lenders have become increasingly bearish about the housing market, and the markets recognized the glut of loans and bonds waiting to be sold to finance the buyout boom, concerns have spread to the credit market.Because some of the credit markets have been illiquid, many funds have to sell stock to make margin calls or to meet tighter collateral standards.“All of this is mismarked and has been for months,” said one hedge fund investor who was commenting on the market in general and not Sowood. He said the death spiral situation was to be expected; the only question was just who would face it. “This is more likely an outcome than speculation.”Not everyone has suffered.MKP Capital, an investment company that has hedge funds focused on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, bet the market would fall apart and its investors have profited handsomely. MKP Credit, one fund, is up 7.3 percent for July and 22.3 percent for the year, while a distressed fund, MKP Credit II, is up 5.5 percent for July and 13.1 percent for the year, according to a person briefed on the fund’s results.A spokesman for the fund declined to comment.'"
"'07-07-28,'0','The economic strength this year has been largely in Asia, where there is talk of an overheating Chinese economy and annual growth rates in gross domestic product remain in the double digits. While recessions in America and Europe would presumably damage China’s exports, its growth has so far resisted government efforts to slow it down through higher interest rates.As a result, the prices of such economically sensitive commodities as oil and copper are significantly higher now than they were in February.The Feb. 27 plunge also seems to have heralded a return of stock market volatility, which has risen substantially in many markets, including both the United States and China.In this week’s five sessions, the S.& P. 500 rose on two days, but fell sharply on the other three. It has now lost more than 1 percent of its value in four of the last six trading sessions.In the entire fourth quarter of last year, there were only three sessions in which the index rose or fell 1 percent. The year has had two days of more than 2 percent moves — Feb. 27 and Thursday — and while both were negative the overall pattern is still positive.In recent weeks, interest rates on government bonds have fallen around the world, including in Japan, Britain, Germany and the United States. That would normally tend to stimulate economies, but the impact has been muted by the recent rise in interest rates paid by borrowers who do not enjoy the sterling credit standing of major governments.In the United States, the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes is higher than it was in February, but fell to 4.76 percent yesterday from a high of 5.29 percent in mid-June. But the yield on an index of high-yield corporate bonds maintained by KDP Investment Advisors has risen rapidly, to 8.85 percent from 7.11 percent. And Freddie Mac’s weekly report of interest rates on conventional 30-year mortgages showed a rate of 6.69 percent this week, down a little from the week before but well above February levels.In addition, some highly leveraged borrowers have suddenly found it hard to borrow at all, causing problems for private equity firms that need to complete announced takeovers. Cadbury Schweppes, the British company trying to sell its United States beverage business, which includes 7-Up, Dr Pepper and Snapple, delayed the deadline for submitting bids, a move that reflected financing hardships.A look at world stock market movements, shown in the accompanying charts, since the February plunge shows that major markets now tend to move more in line with one another than ever before, reflecting the dominance of global companies. One of the charts shows the performance since the Feb. 27 plunge of both the S.& P. 500, which contains large American companies, and the S.& P. Euro 350, made up of major European companies. Over all, they have moved in lock step with one another for most of that period. And similar sectors seem to have done well or poorly. The figures are in dollars, to remove the effect of currency changes.The divergences between Europe and the United States are in areas with a greater reliance on the domestic markets. The consumer discretionary sector did much better in Europe than in the United States. Financial stocks underperformed in both markets, while energy and industrial stocks did well.Within the American markets, many industrial stocks are up significantly since February, even with this week’s problems, as is shown in the graph of the Bloomberg industrials. But retail stocks have given up the gains they recorded in the spring, and are lower than they were after the February plunge. Home builder stocks have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three years.'"

"'07-07-29,'0','The loss, however, will allow the opposition to check Mr. Abe’s legislative agenda. Using parliamentary majorities that he had inherited from his popular predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, Mr. Abe rammed through laws to instill patriotism in schools, elevate the status of Japan’s military and prepare for a referendum on revising the pacifist Constitution.Of the 242 seats in the upper house, half, or 121, were being contested this election. The Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner, the New Komeito Party, had to win a combined 64 seats to maintain a majority in the upper house.With all but a few votes counted, Mr. Abe’s party won 35 seats and its coalition partner took 8. The opposition Democratic Party captured 59 seats.“Last time, I voted for the Liberal Democrats under Koizumi,” Takeshige Iijima, 53, said after voting in Yokohama. “I can’t support the present Liberal Democratic Party. Japan can’t go on under Abe’s leadership.”Given the voters’ wrath, members of Mr. Abe’s party may start looking for another leader with more popular support as they turn their attention to the next election. Although Mr. Abe, now 52, was relatively young and inexperienced, party members chose him as leader last September on the premise that he, like Mr. Koizumi, would lead them to electoral victories.Under Japanese law, the lower house of Parliament, which Mr. Abe’s party firmly controls, chooses prime ministers. So a loss in the upper house would not immediately force his resignation.But past prime ministers have taken responsibility for defeats in the upper house by resigning.With polls predicting a tide against Mr. Abe’s party, the Liberal Democrats had braced themselves for a defeat. Some members of his party — like Kohei Tamura, a lawmaker seeking a third term in a race that he had seemed assured to win just a few weeks ago — sought to survive by openly attacking Mr. Abe. Mr. Tamura, who represented the Kochi prefecture in western Japan, lost Sunday.Mr. Abe’s approval ratings, once higher than 60 percent, plummeted as he appeared out of touch with voters’ anxieties about everyday issues, especially a national pension record-keeping problem that could jeopardize the benefits paid out in what is a rapidly aging society. Instead, Mr. Abe pursued a nationalist agenda, saying until recently that this election’s main theme was revising Japan’s pacifist Constitution and repeating his trademark, if vague, promise of turning Japan into “a beautiful country.”During the 17-day campaign, Mr. Abe switched gears and focused on economic issues. Mr. Abe took out full-page advertisements in newspapers on Sunday, pledging to turn voters’ “anger and anxieties” into “peace of mind and hope.” But the change in strategy was too late, particularly because the opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, had centered his campaign on the economy.“Until now I’ve always voted for the Liberal Democratic Party, but this time I voted for Ozawa,” said Kazuyoshi Tobita, a restaurant owner in Saitama, a prefecture next to Tokyo. “There were all sorts of problems. The pension problem was terrible. I mean, what are they thinking? We’re all worried whether the money we paid into it is actually there.”Mr. Tobita, 71, said of Mr. Abe, “I’d like him to step down,” adding, “Doesn’t everybody think that?”Mr. Ozawa, a longtime politician famous for his tactical skills, focused on building support in rural areas whose backing the Liberal Democrats had secured for decades with public works projects and agricultural subsidies. Results showed that Mr. Ozawa’s party won overwhelmingly in rural Japan.Mr. Ozawa, a former power broker in the Liberal Democratic Party, famously left it in 1993 and formed an alliance of opposition parties that toppled the Liberal Democrats for 11 months, the only time the party has been out of power since its founding in 1955.Shige Tahara, 60, said after voting that she had always supported the Liberal Democrats, but now believed that a two-party system would make politicians more accountable.“We’ve come all this way with the Liberal Democratic Party, and things keep getting worse,” Ms. Tahara said. “So, if another party took power, I’d like to see what kind of policies it would come up with.”'"
"'07-07-29,'0','On Saturday, nearly 3,000 relatives, friends, co-workers and classmates of Ms. Hawke-Petit and her daughters gathered for an emotional memorial service at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain. The service was 20 miles from Cheshire, where the family’s house on Sorghum Mill Drive was invaded by two men about 3 a.m. on Monday.“The hole left in our hearts is deep and wide,” said Johanna Chapman, Dr. Petit’s sister.For the first time since the attack, Dr. Petit, 50, spoke publicly on Saturday. Dr. Petit, who had been hospitalized with a head injury, stood at the podium inside Welte Hall, a large vertical scar on his forehead above his right eyebrow. For several minutes, after thanking the audience, the authorities and the choir that performed in the service, he shared memories of his wife and two daughters.Dr. Petit still remembered the room and the patient at the children’s hospital where he met his wife: the girl’s name was Becky, and she had a kidney problem. He was a third-year medical student then, and she was a new nurse.In recent years, Ms. Hawke-Petit had worked as a nurse at the Cheshire Academy and was an active member of the family’s church, Cheshire United Methodist Church, where she had taught Sunday school.She was Hayley’s and Michaela’s confidante, Dr. Petit said. “They were really more like sisters,” he said of the three. “I had to keep saying to her, ‘You’re the mother, not the sister.’ ”He recalled how Michaela used to listen to the Beach Boys on her iPod, and the shy way she had of greeting some people, by staring at the carpet. She was a student at the Chase Collegiate School in Waterbury.Ms. Chapman, the girls’ aunt, had promised Michaela that she was going to teach her how to make pasta from scratch this summer.“Losing her at age 11 is possibly the greatest loss of all, because she never got the chance to show us just how great she could have been,” she said.Hayley was athletic — she had sharp basketball skills by age 10 — and had become involved in raising money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society’s Greater Connecticut Chapter after her mother learned she had the disease eight years ago.“Hayley wanted to do something,” said Dr. Petit, a diabetes expert. “She thought her mom was going to die, and she figured if she did something she could save her.”“Hayley’s Hope,” a team Hayley formed to raise money in an annual walk in Cheshire, collected more than $50,000 in eight years.Hayley graduated in June from Miss Porter’s School in Farmington and was to attend Dartmouth College, her father’s alma mater, in the fall. Dr. Petit read from an admissions essay she wrote for Dartmouth titled “My Dad,” describing how his presence in a hospital made it seem like a fortress or a safe haven.Dr. Petit said St. Mary’s Hospital in Waterbury, where he had stayed recovering from the attack, had felt like a safe haven to him, reminding him of Hayley’s essay.“A part of me wanted to hide there and not face things,” he said.The two suspects in the attack — Joshua Komisarjevsky, 26, who lived near the Petits in Cheshire, and Steven J. Hayes, 44, of Winsted — have been charged with a long list of crimes, including murder in the course of kidnapping and sexual assault. Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty against the men.A private funeral for Ms. Hawke-Petit and her daughters was held on Friday at the Cheshire United Methodist Church. They were buried in a cemetery in Plainville.At Saturday’s public service, relatives read Bible passages and choked back tears as they remembered and mourned. At one point, all the children in the audience were asked to come forward. Adults on the stage handed each child a flower.“We hope that being together will not be in vain, but will bring about a strength to all of us,” said Ms. Hawke-Petit’s father, the Rev. Richard Hawke, who spoke and led the audience in a prayer.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Daniel Gilbert, author of the book “Stumbling on Happiness” and a psychology professor at Harvard, said the recent failed drug tests suggest that cheating in cycling is more pervasive than is known publicly. The riders who dope are taking a calculated risk, and they must know that the odds are in their favor, he said.“These guys may be able to get jobs as economists,” Gilbert said. “They may be thinking very logically about their decisions.”In 1998, the entire Festina team was ejected from the Tour after doping supplies were found in a team vehicle, but drugs remained in the sport.Tyler Hamilton tested positive for a blood transfusion in 2004, the year he won an Olympic gold medal. This year, Vinokourov, one of the race favorites, tested positive for the same infraction. Last year, Landis was found to have synthetic testosterone in a urine sample, the same violation Cristian Moreni was cited for at this year’s Tour.“They may be immoral, but they are not necessarily stupid,” Gilbert said. “Why would they put everything on the line for such a small possibility that they would get away with this? Well, who said the possibility was small? It might not be small at all.”Doping in cycling has evolved from simple methods, like using alcohol or amphetamines on a tough ride, to more innovative ways of enhancing performance, like the use of bovine hemoglobin — a derivative of cow’s blood — which would give the rider more oxygen for taxing stages of a race.In some cases, using performance-enhancing drugs goes unpunished, even in this era of heightened testing, said Donald Catlin, former head of the Olympic antidoping lab at U.C.L.A. At the Tour, riders are not tested enough — or at all, he said. They are given advance notice of testing, allowing them time to prepare their bodies to pass those tests by using techniques like saline drips to thin their blood.“They have a very active underground that helps them figure these things out,” Catlin said Friday at his new antidoping research facility near Los Angeles.“But they don’t know all the answers. Sometimes things go desperately wrong, like they did in the Landis case. Sometimes they get caught.”To outsiders, the drug testing at the Tour may seem unbeatable, but to some the tests are laughably easy to circumvent.Dick Pound, head of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said last week by telephone that cycling is at a breaking point and should enlist the help of governments and law enforcement to catch those athletes who continue to cheat. He called the Tour “the annual disappointment.”Greg LeMond, a three-time winner of the Tour de France, said that the drug testing needed to be plucked from the hands of the International Cycling Union and given to outside agencies to ensure stricter testing and prevent manipulation of the results.Right now, he said, riders use drugs because they feel that they cannot win without them, considering the competition is most likely using them, too.“Nobody trusts the system,” LeMond said last week in a phone interview. “What they need to be assured is that there are no loopholes.”There is also little incentive for riders to admit having used performance-enhancing drugs because they can be suspended after the fact and are, at the least, ostracized from the cycling community for revealing drug use.Papp, who has been out of the sport for a year, said he received hate mail and threatening phone calls after he testified in May about the testosterone use in cycling at an arbitration hearing involving Landis and the United States Anti-Doping Agency. But Papp knew he would be a target.“When a rider tests positive, it’s like Stalinist Russia,” he said. “You are taken off the Web site, your paycheck stops coming, the team just washes its hands of you. The team goes on, and there is no motivation, outside their own morality and ethics, to stamp out doping. But they still expect you to keep quiet about everything.”The cycling culture is such that athletes are brainwashed into believing that doping is acceptable, and even necessary, Papp said. He likened it to “being in the mob” because the cyclists have the backing of their teams to use performance-enhancing drugs, the promise of secrecy from their teammates and the audacity to look the drug testers in the eyes, knowing full well that their doping will go undetected.Papp described the induction into that closed society. At first, a team official offers to initiate a cyclist into a special program. Then, with time, the rider is given more trust and more access to the world behind the closed doors.Papp, a University of Pittsburgh graduate who hoped to work for the State Department, said he soon became a part of the doping fraternity. He became an expert on giving himself injections and transfusing his own blood.“You are so focused on the travel, the training, the money and what a wonderful life you are having,” he said, “you almost don’t realize how far down the slope you have slid.”'"
"'07-07-29,'0','“From A to Z, everything has been a problem from the very beginning,” said Jorvan Vieira, the head coach from Brazil who brushed aside death threats to take his short-term job with Iraq.For starters, Iraq lost an early preliminary match against South Korea, 3-0, after traveling 36 hours to get to the game. And then, an already exhausted Younes Mahmoud, the team’s captain, was detained for 12 hours in Bangkok, awaiting permission to enter the country on the eve of Iraq’s first tournament game against Thailand.Upon arriving in Kuala Lumpur for the semifinal match against South Korea, the players found their hotel rooms occupied by the Iranian team, which had already been eliminated. The Iraqis waited for hours in the lobby for rooms, delaying their scheduled practice — and sleep.Saudi Arabia, on the other side, with more than double the budget of Iraq and players who have been promised lavish gifts if they win, has had virtually no logistical problems.The “Lions of the Two Rivers,” as the Iraqi team is known back home, are no strangers to adversity. The war plays heavily on their minds and has taken at least one family member from every player on the team, some very recently.Noor Sabri, Iraq’s goalie-turned-national hero whose save helped the team defeat South Korea in penalty kicks to reach the final, lost his brother-in-law in a bombing four days before the team arrived in Bangkok for the start of the tournament.“We are all suffering, but we are also surviving,” said Mr. Mahmoud, the captain. “We try to concentrate only on the matches because it is the only way to bring happiness to the Iraqi people.”The team brought joy to Iraqis by simply making it to the quarterfinals, which was their modest goal in the beginning. After defeating Vietnam, 2-0, in the quarterfinals, spirits began to rise. And after the victory over South Korea, the world watched as the players cried, wrapped in Iraqi flags, on the Malaysian field.The Asian Cup, held every four years, is taking place a year early because of the logistical jam created by the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the European soccer championship. The next Asian Cup is set for 2011.On a balmy night here on Friday, the team showed no signs of the stress of home or the pressure of the tournament.Mr. Vieira, the head coach, says the same thing to the team every day for motivation.“Play for the Iraqi people,” he said on Friday night. “Play to put a smile on their lips.”Haider Abdul Amir, a defender, says he is playing for his family.“I talk to my family every day,” he said. “They are so excited, so happy. It’s a wonderful thing.”His family lives in Baghdad and, like his fellow teammates, he was troubled by the bombings that killed more than 50 people there during the victory celebrations this week.Despite all of this, the Iraqi players have remained positive. Shy smiles splashed across their faces as they met the horde of journalists after Friday’s practice. The teammates then boarded a bus back to the hotel, their exhaustion revealed as the bus lurched through Jakarta.In the back of the bus, a friendly discussion quickly turned into a rollicking debate. The team argued about the Koran and about where one goes after dying. Sunnis and Shiites participated in the debate, and it lasted all the way to the hotel, illustrating another hurdle for this team, which also includes Kurds.Mr. Amir smiled at the arguments, at times shouting his own opinion.“I am a Shiite; he is a Sunni; and we are best of friends,” he said referring to Mahdi Karim, a midfielder who smiled broadly. He added: “We play for Iraq. We are all family on this bus.”Helio Anjos, the Saudi Arabian head coach, said that he was well aware of the strength of the Iraqis.“For tomorrow, Iraq will be a very, very tough opponent,” he said. “They are playing with a lot of emotion and a lot of motivation.”'"
"'07-07-29,'0','SOME years ago, when a German critic accused me of “meteorological mannerism” because weather plays such a large role in my books, a friend came to my defense: “We happen to have a lot of weather in Switzerland.” Even our national anthem is full of meteorological phenomena: we sing of gray mists and dark clouds and sunshine’s cleansing power.My country’s diverse topography accommodates all kinds of climates, from Mediterranean to arctic. Forecasts roughly divide the country into two parts — the north and south sides of the Alps — but weather events are far more local; it frequently happens that one valley has a full day of rain while the next basks in sunshine.Consequently, it’s not that easy to discern the changes in climate. Not every hot summer day is proof of global warming; nor does one winter’s heavy snowfall herald a new ice age. But the number of weather-related disasters has increased significantly, and the rise in temperature in Switzerland since the 1970s is double the average for the Northern Hemisphere.The change is most clearly visible in the shrinking of our glaciers, which have lost almost 50 percent of their surface area in the past 150 years; half of this loss has occurred in the last 30. Some 100 out of our nearly 2,000 glaciers have already disappeared, and researchers predict that most will have melted away by 2050. The trend is unmistakable and some scientists fear it is irreversible. In the ski areas, some glaciers are covered with plastic sheeting during the summer months to delay the process at least a little. More radical measures are politically difficult; they would require that we reduce our consumption of fuel and gasoline, and scarcely anyone is ready for that.A dangerous fatalism has spread among many Swiss. They are happy to see the water in the lakes getting warmer, and view the disappearance of the glaciers as a sad but not necessarily bad development. They blithely forget that the ice is also our reserve supply of drinking water, and make light of the fact that the ground is thawing along with the glaciers, sending mudslides into the valley. The tragic stories are rare, and they are reported on the daily news more as entertainment than admonition.Most Swiss live in stable houses in the lowlands, far from the crashing slopes and the brooks swelling into raging rivers. Those who are affected bravely clear the debris. Then a feeling of solidarity courses through our country, and only spoilsports ask what is the cause and who is to blame. When catastrophe strikes, the TV does not call upon climate experts but instead interviews the men from the fire department, the heroes of the hour.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','It was a very bad week for the stock market. By some measurements, it was the worst week in several years.A big sell-off Thursday, followed by another sizable decline Friday, put the week in a memorably miserable class. For the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, which lost 4.9 percent for the week, it was the worst five-day decline since 2002. For the Dow Jones industrial average, which dropped 4.2 percent, it was the worst week since early 2003.Worries about the subprime mortgage crisis, the housing slowdown and a global credit tightening sent stocks around the world down sharply.What was striking about the losses was that they came on the heels of so many market highs. It was on July 19, after all, that the Dow closed above 14,000 for the first time.For the week, the Dow lost 585.61 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 13,265.47. The S.& P. 500 lost 75.15 points, or 4.9 percent, to close at 1,458.95. The Nasdaq composite index fell 125.36 points, or 4.7 percent, to close at 2,562.24.The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note sank to 4.76 percent, from 4.95 percent the previous week.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Re “States Try to Weigh Safety With Dog Owners’ Rights” (news article, July 23):Any law that deems a dog as dangerous or vicious based on appearance, breed or phenotype is unfair and discriminatory. Canine temperaments are widely varied, and behavior cannot be predicted by physical features. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.As an organization comprising dog trainers, behaviorists and other animal professionals, the Association of Pet Dog Trainers is aware that any dog can bite, any dog can maim and any dog can kill. A dangerous or vicious dog is a product of a combination of individual genetics, upbringing, socialization and lack of proper training.Designating certain breeds as inherently dangerous implies to the public that behavior is not effectively influenced (positively or negatively), by training, and also encourages the faulty perception of other breeds as being inherently safe.The solution to preventing dog bites is the education of owners, breeders and the general public about aggression prevention through selection, socialization and training.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','It quoted Edward M. Gistaro, a principal author of the July 17 N.I.E., as saying that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is “focused on the conflict in Iraq at this time.”Readers had a lot to say about a column I wrote on July 8 about this subject. Here’s a sampling.You complain that “The Times has slipped into a routine of quoting President Bush and the military uncritically about Al Qaeda’s role in Iraq — and sometimes citing the group itself without attribution.”Well, yes, The Times has returned to its default process — stenographer to the government. I do realize there is constant pressure from the emperor’s fashion commentators, but the job is to report that he is naked, not merely that he described his new (nonexistent) clothes.You write: “It’s a good move. I’d have been happier still if The Times had helped its readers by doing a deeper job of reporting on the administration’s drive to make Al Qaeda the singular enemy in Iraq.”Well, this reader would be a whole lot happier if The Times would spend more time covering the actual war, instead of looking at virtually everything through the distorted lens of domestic politics. It’s certainly possible to distinguish Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia (which is itself a political convention designed to avoid the sin of putting Al Qaeda and Iraq in the same sentence) from Al Qaeda elsewhere. So? Where exactly do you go from there?If you can argue that Baquba was not a Qaeda stronghold, or that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia hasn’t had a catalytic effect on sectarian violence, or isn’t worth pursuing, or would not metastasize on our withdrawal, I’d sure like to hear it. Otherwise, you’re not really arguing content, you’re arguing slant.I was pleased to see you shed light on the new administration meme of conflating all Sunni insurgent activity in Iraq with Al Qaeda. The first time I noticed this was in a June article by The Associated Press on the “surge” in Baquba, where I counted eight references to Al Qaeda as the enemy we’re fighting there now.But you miss the other half of the new equation, which (to quote from other recent A.P. articles on operations in Sadr City and elsewhere) refers to Shiite activity as “militants suspected of ties to Iran.” So it appears the new math in Iraq is as follows:It’s about time The Times started questioning its, and most mainstream media’s, thoughtless parroting of the Bush administration’s talking points and returned to doing real journalistic work. This means more research and a broader perspective than simply quoting the administration’s point of view.Newspapers are supposed to inform their readers, who often don’t have access to the same materials and sources of a large news organization, though that issue has greatly improved with the Internet.Now that The Wall Street Journal will most probably succumb to the same fate as The Times of London and other media owned by Rupert Murdoch, The New York Times has an even greater responsibility as one of the very few respected national newspapers left on the scene.Thanks for pointing out the White House’s capacious usage of the term “Al Qaeda.” No doubt the goal is to say in the eventual memoirs that the invasion of Iraq was retaliation and not a war of choice.There is one aspect of this slippery usage that I have never seen clearly explained in The Times or elsewhere. Where is the money coming from to support Sunni extremists, including Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia? Surely it’s more likely to be coming from Saudi Arabia than from Iran. Would you prompt the foreign desk to do more to “follow the money”?I admit I was confused by the classification of “Al Qaeda” as one of the groups involved in the fighting in Iraq. It is reassuring that The Times is going to be less “sloppy” in its reporting from now on.As to the larger thesis of the complicated nature of the battles in Iraq, I find that The Times is presenting the Iraq situation in clearer terms than might be the reality. In reading coverage on July 9, for example, I saw mention of only two of the insurgent groups involved in the fighting (Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia being the primary one), when in reality there likely were many others.But as a whole, I applaud the Times coverage of the fighting. For example, in the July 8 Week in Review was an informative article that traced the roots of a recent decline in violence in Ramadi. It was not clear whether the decline was the result of the recent increase in American troops, or merely that Sunni groups there are fed up with the fighting. This is an interesting contrast to Senator John McCain, who insisted on July 10 that the drop in violence in that region is directly related to the Bush administration’s surge.I would hope that Times reporters do more than just “distinguish” the differences between Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. The real issue you raise is that the reporters are taking the administration and military talking points and references without question.Inserting “Mesopotamia” as a qualifier does not change the fact that the administration is again conflating Al Qaeda with 9/11 and ignoring the civil war raging in Iraq.The administration peddles the slogan that Osama bin Laden calls Iraq the main front against the West, so therefore it must be. If I were Osama bin Laden, why wouldn’t I try and goad our president to commit unlimited resources and world political capital into a never-ending civil war?If the president truly believes that because Osama bin Laden says Iraq is the main front then it must be, then the president has been duped. And if the president doesn’t believe that Iraq is the main front on the “war on terror,” then we the people have been duped.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Thank you for raising awareness of the inefficiencies and failings of Access-A-Ride (“Elderly Road Rage Over Transit for the Disabled,” July 22). Grateful as I have been recently for its availability, the system merits a report covering much deeper issues.City residents are being treated inhumanely just when they are most fragile: sick, disabled, elderly. They are treated with deep suspicion (for example, looking at a knee-length cast and crutches “and tell me why you can’t take the subway?”). The interview to get in to the system has to be conducted in person only when you become immobile, and on my interview day everybody was kept waiting at least two hours beyond their scheduled appointment, including a lady so disabled she could not even raise her head.One day I had a 9:30 a.m. medical appointment with an 8:11 a.m. pick-up time. I made it to my appointment in Manhattan at 10:50 a.m. after being picked up one hour late with two other people still to be collected. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority needs to conduct some high-level oversight.“Mandatory Fairness,” by Dirk Olin (Op-Ed, July 22), raises legitimate concerns about the use of arbitration to resolve employment and consumer disputes. However, making it easier to sue arbitrators would not address those concerns.It is essential that arbitrators, like judges, decide cases with complete impartiality and neutrality, and without fear that a party with financial or other recourses will sue them for a decision that does not go their way. For that reason, arbitral immunity is uniformly embraced by courts around the country.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','So what? The fact that the law is such and such as of July 2007 does not mean that it has to be that way in July 2008 or even in September 2007. The laws of taxation, like all laws, are political. They are not based on commandments from the Lord God Jehovah carried down on tablets from the mountaintop. They are not ordained by Solomon. They are political, hewn from the give-and-take of lobbyists, expert witnesses, law professors, economists and donors.The law can be changed. Laws are changed all of the time in the tax arena. The oil companies used to get immense tax allowances that they don’t get any more because of political pressures. The tax rate on the last dollars of high-income people used to be above 90 percent. It’s not like that any longer. Why? Political change. It applies to the tax code as well as to all other laws.Now, let’s think about what’s going on in America right now. We are in a war. We are apparently not winning the war. The military is desperately shy of funds, to the point where our fighting men and women are being shortchanged in training and equipment.We also need more money for our soldiers’ pay, so their families do not have to live like church mice while their spouses are deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan. In these circumstances, is it fitting and morally right for the richest of the rich to be paying either very low taxes or no tax at all?Is it right or even admissible in the human conscience that while teachers, emergency room technicians, police and firefighters are taxed at full earned-income rates — and often underpaid — that the highest-earning people in this country should pay at either very low tax rates or none at all?Or, put it like this: do we dare send our men and women to fight for an America in which the very rich are so favored by the government that it amounts almost to an aristocracy?Long ago, I had a European history teacher named Mrs. Enright. She explained to me that one of the causes of the French Revolution was the sad truth that the aristocracy was not taxed at all, while the workers and burghers were taxed highly. Is this our future?Maybe the law does allow for favorable tax treatment for hedge funds if you have good enough lawyers. Maybe the law does allow for private-equity managers to receive capital-gains treatment for what is clearly money management, not risking their own capital.But the mark of a great society is that its laws approximate morality and fairness. Is this really what we have in the tax code now? If so, fine. If not, why are we not changing it?AND please, let’s not haul out that old chestnut about having tax incentives to encourage entrepreneurship. We already have enough people who want to be rich (which is another phrase for “entrepreneurship”). What we are lacking is oil and gas. Maybe we should give the oil exploration people lower taxes. What we are lacking is people willing to fight the war on terror.Why don’t we just have a tax holiday for people who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years after they get back? This would be the tax code addressing real shortages, not an imaginary shortage of money mania (oops, I mean “entrepreneurship”).Let’s keep it real: Congress can take notice of a mammoth inequity in taxation during wartime and make the tax on private equity and hedge funds approximate the treatment of other highly paid people — or it can continue down the road to the Bastille.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','“The hot dog now is for tourists,” said a rueful Chafik el-Mokhtar, office manager at 2M Friend Corporation, a hot-dog cart garage and supply store on West 47th Street near 11th Avenue.“The people usually go for chicken and rice because it’s good for hunger,” he added wistfully.Mohamed Abouelenein, an Egyptian who used to sell hot dogs, said, “Hot dog is not a meal.” That’s one reason he switched to gyro and chicken in 1992, becoming, he claims, the first peddler in New York to sell halal meat from a cart.“We figured out that most of the cabdrivers are Egyptian, Pakistani,” he said. “They suffered too much from no halal.”On some corners of Manhattan, halal carts outnumber hot-dog vendors by as much as three to one. Mr. Abouelenein’s cart, named 53rd and 6th, after the Midtown corner on which it sits, stays open from 7 p.m. to 4 a.m., feeding throngs of clubbers, foodies and cabbies. Its success has been such that Mr. Abouelenein recently opened a new cart across the street, supplanting — yes — a hot-dog stand.The term halal may be applied to any food prepared in accordance with the laws of the Koran, although in New York the term has taken on special connotations: oily chunks of chicken or gyro meat, yellowish rice, some scraps of lettuce, hot sauce and, of course, the mysterious substance known as white sauce.The most obvious explanation for its popularity is that the city is home to many more Muslim immigrants than in the past.Arthur Schwartz, a New York food historian who runs the Web site foodmaven.com, also suggests that a particular kind of customer has been instrumental to the success of halal carts. “You can always tell who the new immigrant group is by the cabdrivers,” Mr. Schwartz said. “Most of the cabdrivers are now Bangladeshi, and the car service drivers are Egyptian. And they are good customers for the carts.”Sidewalk wisdom holds that Muslims took over the street-cart business in the 1990s from Greeks, who had themselves inherited it from Italians and Germans. Census data broadly supports this chronology. In an analysis of data from 1990, the Queens College sociology department found that 306 first-generation German and Italian New Yorkers identified themselves as members of an occupational category that included the job “street vendor”; by 2005, that figure had dropped to zero. During that period, the number of Greeks in the field rose to 200 from 120, while the number of Egyptians, Bangladeshis and Afghans surged to 563 from 69.Tony Dragonas, a native of Greece and a sidewalk chef on the corner of 62nd Street near Madison Avenue, vividly remembers many of his compatriots selling their carts to Muslim buyers in the 1990s. “A lot of people got old, a lot of people died,” he said. Raising one leg of his denim shorts to reveal a skein of varicose veins, he added: “It’s hard work. My kids — they don’t want to do this. They want to get educated.”The son of a hot-dog vendor, Mr. Dragonas has succeeded by continually reinventing himself, supplementing staples like souvlaki and Italian sausages with black angus steak and prosciutto-and-mozzarella sandwiches. Some halal vendors have gone even further in adapting their cooking to the New York palate, which has itself grown more sophisticated as recent immigrants from places like Mexico and Thailand have redrawn the restaurant landscape. Halal vendors sell varieties of white sauce so far removed from any traditional food that no term less ambiguous than “white sauce” would accurately describe them.X-Press Power Lunch, a chain with carts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, is one of many companies that cater to the city’s less adventurous types with a white-sauce base of mayonnaise. At the other end of the spectrum is Mr. Rahman, whose quest for the sophisticated “suit and tie” market has culminated in the creation of what many consider Manhattan’s white sauce par excellence, a mélange of yogurt, sour cream, cottage cheese and cucumber.ALONG with culinary innovation, creative approaches to marketing may explain the popularity of halal food among non-Muslim customers. Asim Rafiqi, a 33-year-old refugee from Afghanistan, studied computer science for two years at St. John’s University in Queens before going into the family business, Rafiqi’s, in 1996. Since then, the pushcart chain that he owns with four of his brothers has stretched across Midtown and beyond, staking out no fewer than 11 spots with its signature red-and-black umbrellas.Last winter, he and his brothers designed several new carts; their structures call for cooks and customers to stand facing one another. This should prove especially advantageous for Mr. Rafiqi, a gregarious man with a gleaming smile. “You’re talking to the customer, you’re with the customer,” he said.When it comes to innovation, few vendors have proved the equal of Mr. Abouelenein, the owner of 53rd and 6th. His employees wear uniforms of yellow — “We Are Different,” the T-shirts proclaim — and the business has a Web site, 53rdand6th.com, where devotees are invited to submit works of cart-inspired art.Nine months ago, after a scuffle among customers spiraled into a stabbing. Mr. Abouelenein responded with yet another innovation, one that few hot-dog vendors have ever contemplated. He hired bouncers.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','“I keep telling you, Mr. Ransome, I don’t know anything.” The pub’s door flew open as a stag party burst in, rushing the bar with barked orders. Easy to spot the groom to be, reduced to underpants, shoes and his T-shirt, the latter defaced by graffiti. Ransome angled his phone away from the noise.“Doesn’t mean you’re not going to hear anything, Glenn. And when you do, I’m your first port of call, understood? Next day or so, this whole thing’s going to come crashing down, and Chib Calloway with it.”“I didn’t catch that, Mr. Ransome — too much noise. Hello? Mr. Ransome?”But the detective had already headed out into the night.Chib Calloway had agreed to meet Mike at the little-used snooker hall. Mike was cagey on the phone, keeping it short, saving his fury for the meeting itself. But then Mike reminded himself who and what Chib was, and revised his strategy accordingly.Chib stood behind one of the unlighted tables, his face in shadow, rolling balls into the cushion to watch their angles and trajectories.“What’s on your mind, Michael?” Chib asked, his voice icebox-cold.“The warehouse is missing a few paintings, Chib. A dozen, actually. Which blows our brilliant plan to smithereens. They may not have noticed the switch, but they know a robbery’s happened because they’re suddenly short 12 masterpieces.”“I saw it on the news. Can’t say I was too thrilled.”“If you’d thought about it, you’d have realized they would do a full inventory.” Mike paused. “Or did your four bright young things just get greedy and grab the paintings for themselves?”“Sorry, Mike, I’m a bit confused. Didn’t you use those same four guys to cover the gatehouse and guardroom? Leaving you and your friends to empty the vaults?”A laugh exploded from Mike. “You’re not seriously suggesting we lifted those paintings? Are we supposed to have tucked them under our sweaters?”“How would I know? I wasn’t there, and neither were my boys — they were keeping an eye on the hostages while you went about your business. When are they supposed to have pulled off this miracle? Did they make themselves invisible, so they could get past you in the vaults without any of you noticing?”Mike slammed both fists against the green baize. “Why the hell would we steal paintings? We’d gone to all the trouble of switching them so nobody would ever know they were missing!”Chib was silent for a moment. “You play a good game, Mike. I could almost use someone like you on my team.”“This is crazy!” Mike thumped the table again, then ran a hand through his hair, stopping just short of yanking a few clumps out.“I’ll tell you what’s crazy. Your friend Allan was paid a visit earlier today by Inspector Ransome.”“How do you know that?”Chib’s grin showed against the shadows, much like the Cheshire Cat’s. “I had Johnno tail Ransome for a couple of hours, wanted to know what he’s up to. He paid a visit to First Caledonian Bank — I remember you telling me that’s where Allan works.”“It’s not a big deal — Allan called me to let me know Ransome was there.”“And nothing — I spoke to Allan afterward; it was a fishing expedition, that’s all.”“You’re changing the subject — right now, it’s these paintings I’m bothered about.”“Who else was in the warehouse?”Chib stepped out from the shadows and rounded the end of the table until he was face to face with Mike. “What about afterward?”“I’ve heard of it happening — a bank gets turned over, staff take the opportunity to help themselves to a bit of loose change.”Mike’s eyes narrowed. “You’re saying the guards at the warehouse . . . ?” He started shaking his head. “No, I’m not buying that.”“You’d rather convince yourself it was me?” Mike could feel Chib’s breath on his face — garlic had played some part in the man’s dinner. “Three of my guys were in that warehouse, meaning they must’ve taken four paintings apiece. What were they wearing, tents?” Chib gave a chuckle. “No, my friend, this was down to one of you, and I’m sure if I ask them nicely, Westie and Allan will spill their guts.”“What about asking your own guys first?”“Wouldn’t be the first time someone had given into temptation.”Their mutual staring contest lasted 20 seconds. Chib was the first to blink as he reached into his pocket for his phone. Mike kept his breathing steady, knowing he was playing for time. Chib was right — no way those four had been hiding anything under their jackets. Mike needed to think, needed to find some answers. Needed to talk to Allan and Westie. . . . No, not Allan. It couldn’t be Allan. And if Westie, why the text message asking for more money or an extra painting?“Glenn?” Chib was saying. “I want you to round up Billy, Kev, Dodds and Bellboy. Get them round here to the snooker hall pronto.” As he snapped shut his phone, Mike’s sounded: Westie’s number on the screen.“Mind if I take this outside?” he asked Chib.“Just personal,” Mike said, making for the door.Outside, he took a few deep gulps of air as he answered the call.“What can I do for you?” Mike asked.“I wanted to say sorry — I’d no idea Alice was going to send that text. And of course she didn’t mean it — we don’t. . . . I don’t want any more money. Or a painting, come to that.”“I suppose so. . . . ” Westie sounded slightly confused. “But look, I really need a favor from you.”“You’ve got to get Calloway off my case.”“I wasn’t aware he was on your case.”“He wants me to do more fakes for him. Loads of them. And I’m scared — scared to say no to him, and scared of what’ll happen if I say yes.”Mike found himself gazing back toward the windowless snooker hall. “Why does he want them, Westie?”“You think I was going to ask? He’s a monster, Mike, everyone knows that.”“Maybe I’m just beginning to realize. . . . ” And why not? Wasn’t this the very city that had spawned Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? He placed a hand against the building’s dank, defaced wall. It was a hellish spot — wasteland across the road, bags of rubbish broken open by rats and foxes. Mike realized that he really was a long way from home.So why go back in? Why not run for it and try forgetting that he had once known anybody called Chib Calloway? Somehow, he didn’t think it would be that easy.“What?” he asked into the phone, having just missed Westie’s last couple of sentences.“Alice,” the young man repeated. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”“I had a go at her about the text and Calloway and everything. . . . She’s left me, Mike.”“You’ve got to go after her!” Mike hissed, struggling not to yell at the phone; had to hold it in both hands, such was the tremor running through him. “You’ve got to bring her back, calm her down. She knows everything, Westie — and she’s got less to lose than any of us.”“If she goes to the police, there’s almost nothing they can charge her with.”“Wouldn’t she? Try calling her — get down on your knees and plead with her. She’s got to come back!”“Let me know, soon as you find her.”“Find who?” Chib was standing in the doorway to Mike’s left. Mike ended the call and thrust the phone into his coat.“Nothing,” he lied, making a show of checking his watch. “You reckon your guys will be here in half an hour?”“They won’t be coming, Mike. I changed my mind. We both know this has nothing to do with them. Could have something to do with that call you just took though.”Chib thought for a moment, then offered a smile. “He told you about my little scheme?”“What are you up to, Chib?”Calloway sniffed the air as he considered his answer. “Seems to me,” he eventually offered, “we’re all up to something, Mike. That means there’s going to be winners and losers. . . . Want to take a bet which side I’ll be on? Now come back inside, I’ll fix us both a drink.”“I’ve got to be going.”“Of course you do. But do me a favor, will you?”hat was quick,” Ransome said into his cellphone, recognizing Glenn’s number.“Got four names for you, Mr. Ransome. Chib wanted to talk to them, then he didn’t.” Glenn recited the names while Ransome jotted them down.“The gang’s all here,” the detective muttered to himself, before thanking his CHIS and ending the call. Billy, Kev, Dodds and Bellboy. Add Mike Mackenzie and Calloway himself and you had a gang big enough to pull off the heist. He still wasn’t sure about Allan Cruikshank and Professor Gissing. Oh, he thought they knew about it — knew all about it. But he couldn’t say either of them had taken part as such. Which didn’t mean they wouldn’t squeal — Cruikshank in particular, if he didn’t have an aneurysm first. All it would take was a bit more squeezing.It was nearly 11 when Chib Calloway got home. He parked the BMW in the driveway and stood for a moment, staring up at the night sky. He bought a telescope once, but didn’t have much success with it. Light pollution, he was told: all the city’s street lamps. So he made the shop take it back with a full refund. Turned out later, they’d given him 20 quid too much, which hadn’t worried Chib.Some of his men wondered why he chose to live in a newly-built subdivision when he could have practically any house in Edinburgh. But those four-story Georgian jobs in the New Town, they just didn’t do it for him. Nor did he want rolling acres and stables and all of that, which would entail leaving the city behind. He was an Edinburgh boy, born and bred. Not too many could say the same — whole streets filled with immigrants, not to mention the tens of thousands of students. But this was still Chib’s city and sometimes he loved it to bits.The house — detached, ex-model home and by far the largest on the street — was in darkness. A neighbor had warned him that he should keep a light on at night in the hall, just to deter thieves. Chib hadn’t bothered pointing out that thieves weren’t that stupid. Did the neighbor think they went around wondering why whole families congregated in the hallway rather than the living room? Thinking back, he had another chuckle now, then slid the key into the lock. Another thing about his house: 10-year warranty. And the builders had thrown in an alarm system free of charge, not that he ever used it.Once he had closed the door after him, he felt a sense of contentment. This was where he could relax, unwind, forget all his troubles. A couple of whiskeys and some trash TV. The local Indian restaurant would deliver. So would his favorite pizza place. And if he fancied fish and chips, well, the guy there would deliver, too — just because Chib was Chib. But tonight all he wanted was the whiskey — maybe three or four, just to shut out the likes of Mike Mackenzie and Inspector Ransome.Bit of a surprise, then, to walk into the living room, flick on the lights and see that someone was waiting for him. The man was bruised and battered, bound and gagged. He was seated on one of the dining-room chairs, which had been positioned so it was the first thing Chib saw. The man’s eyes seemed to be pleading, even though one of them was swollen shut and the other reduced to little more than a slit. There was a crust of blood below his nose, others at the side of his mouth and trailing down his neck from his left ear. Sweat was drying in his hair, and his shirt and suit were stained.“This is Mr. Watts-Fulton,” Hate said, emerging from the kitchen. He was eating a banana from the fruit bowl.“Nobody does this to me!” Chib spat. “Nobody comes in my house, making a mess!”“I don’t think we’ve made a mess,” Hate replied calmly, “not yet.” But he dropped the banana peel on the floor and ground it into the carpet with the heel of a black cowboy boot.“You’re tangling with the wrong man,” Chib warned him. Hate ignored him, concentrating instead on Watts-Fulton. The man flinched as Hate’s hands reached toward him, but all Hate did was peel the silver tape from his mouth.“Mr. Watts-Fulton has come all the way from London,” Hate was explaining. “Mr. Watts-Fulton runs a gallery there, from a very nice position on Bond Street. It’s a successful gallery, and he sells a lot of Scottish paintings, as well as 19th- and 20th-century English and Flemish — that’s because Mr. Watts-Fulton speaks Flemish. He is part owner of a sister gallery in Antwerp, where money from diamonds has been good for the art market.” Hate turned toward Chib. “Are you with me so far?”’ But he didn’t wait for an answer, and turned back to his captive. “Tell him what you told me, Mr. Watts-Fulton.”But Chib already knew what the terrified man was going to say.Next week: Mike discovers how far in over his head he really is.'"

"'07-07-29,'0','In all, Mr. Mercurio said the market, instead of soaring or falling, had settled “at a fairly high and healthy level.” Looking ahead, he said, there is no reason to expect further erosion of sales volumes or prices, absent problems arising from subprime mortgage financing.But the president of the listing service, Mark Boyland, also a broker with Keller Williams Realty in White Plains, was troubled by a decrease in inventory. At the end of last month, according to the report, there were 7,140 active residential listings posted with the listing service, a decrease of 8 percent from a year ago. The inventory for single-family houses was down by nearly 11 percent, with only condominiums posting an increase — about 3 percent, to 926 units.The figures for second-quarter inventory ended a 12-quarter run of year-to-year increases that ranged from 2 percent in 2004 to 38 percent in the first quarter of 2006.The problem, Mr. Boyland said, is that some sellers have become discouraged and taken their properties off the market.“Sellers often get a number in their heads about what their house is worth,” he said, “and it takes a long time for them to come to grips with what the property is truly worth.”Except for sales of multifamily houses, second-quarter price changes were minimal compared with a year ago, the report shows. The median for single-family houses was down about 2 percent; for condos, it decreased less than 1 percent, to $382,500; and for co-ops, it was up almost 2 percent, to $193,000, the second-highest level on record.The median sale price of a two-to-five-family house, though, dropped 5.6 percent, to $547,500, at the end of June, compared with the same period a year ago. Investors who had been disenchanted with the stock market’s performance several years ago and tried to diversify their portfolio by buying multifamily housing were twice thwarted, said Darryl R. Selsey, owner of Four Seasons Real Estate Center in Mount Vernon.“At end of day, when you calculate all the expenses for owning and renting out a multifamily home, you’re lucky if you even break even,” Mr. Selsey said. The only time owning a multifamily dwelling makes sense, he said, is when the owner lives there and uses it to offset monthly mortgage payments.Over all, the numbers in the report represented good news, said Harding Mason, president of the County Board of Realtors and an associate broker with Houlihan Lawrence in Katonah. “Especially compared to some of the horror stories we’re hearing in other parts of the country,” he said, “Westchester isn’t in any trouble at all.”'"
"'07-07-29,'0','YOU might call her the Paul Poiret of the suburbs. Just like the French couturier who liberated women from corsets back in 1905, Kristin Clotilde Darnell, the former supermodel who walked the runways of Paris in the late 1970s and ’80s and starred in ads for Yves Saint Laurent and Ralph Lauren, would like to liberate today’s suburban women from jeans and T-shirts.“I want to get women — moms — out of their pants and into dresses,” she declared the other day sitting in her Chatsworth Avenue dress shop, Clotilde, which opened here six weeks ago.“The whole concept is of having pretty dresses to wear for everyday life in the suburbs,” said Ms. Darnell, looking casually polished in her bright-pink, full-skirted linen dress. “Instead of going to dinner in jeans with your husband, wear a dress and suddenly it’s more fun.”Ms. Darnell, whose iconic advertisements for Lauren perfume dot the walls of her shop (she was that aristocratic, blue-eyed brunette staring confidently into the middle distance), wanted to create the kinds of dresses she was dying to wear when she retired from modeling in 1988 to become a full-time mom. “Even in the hippie days, going to Mamaroneck High School, I never liked jeans,” she said. “For 10 years I wore khaki pants and T-shirts because I couldn’t find nice day looks in the stores.”Today Ms. Darnell, divorced long ago and since remarried to Dr. James Darnell, believes she’s solved that problem. The dresses, which range in price from $150 to $395, have such a 1940s or ’50s flare that Joan Delaney, a Larchmont resident who walked into the shop during a recent interview, declared with delight: “It’s the 1950s reincarnated! Crinolines! Saddle shoes!” (Ms. Darnell was shocked when the $49 petticoats, meant to create mood only, actually sold.)'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Experienced museumgoers know all too well what it is like to wander through a provocative contemporary art show wondering what the point of it all is. I had something of that reaction at “Martin Creed: Feelings,” the summer show at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College.Born in 1968, Mr. Creed belongs to the generation of Young British Artists, or Y.B.A.’s, who came to prominence in the 1990s. In addition to doing conceptual art, sculpture and paintings (paper sheets covered with fluorescent highlighter or marker pens), he has a rock band, Owada, formed in 1994, which performed at the opening of the Bard exhibition earlier this month. Among their songs is “1-2-3-4”, in which the full lyrics are spelled out in the title.If art prizes are any measure of success, Mr. Creed is at the top of his game — in 2001, he won the Tate’s Turner Prize for an installation of museum lights intermittently going on and off in a gallery. That same installation is just inside the entrance to the Hessel Museum of Art, a newly opened building at Bard where the artist has installed some of his own works alongside the permanent collection. The rest of Mr. Creed’s art is showing next door in the C.C.S. Galleries.To get to the light installation you must first wade through a room half-filled with bright blue balloons titled “Work No. 628: Half the Air in a Given Space,” the idea being that half the air space in the gallery is contained in the balloons. It is an interesting concept, and is also one of the better, more thoughtful efforts in this show.But many of the other works — stacks of plywood and lumber, a sheet of paper crumpled into a ball, neon lights spelling out simple words and phrases, a mound of bean bags, a display of different kinds of balls, a cross-hatched wall painting recalling the wall drawings of Sol LeWitt — are tired reruns of Dada and conceptual art stunts from the 1960s and ’70s. They were once amusing but now so old and shorn of irony they are simply boring — like a joke told over and over again to a point where it is no longer funny.Of course, these installations are intended to be provocative, forcing us to confront expectations of what an artwork is or looks like. That’s fair enough. But there is also a limit to this kind of historical envelope-pushing. In subsequent rooms of the show are two videos of women, one vomiting on a pristine gallery floor, the other urinating and defecating on the floor. Aside from being tasteless, they are not original. The history of art, film and performance is checkered with similar antics, most memorably the violent vomiting scene in Monty Python’s film “The Meaning of Life” and Andy Warhol’s famous series of urine paintings.But all is not lost. Strip away the gratuitous shock value and childish conceits, and there are some works of genuine, commendable thought and feeling. Two videos showing the same ferry docking at a pier has a certain poetry and poignancy, the separate, balletlike maneuverings of the boats coming together at the end as they seemingly dock at the same time.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','MARY CARROLL MOORE, a resident of Bridgewater, radiates such calm that it is hard to believe the extent of her accomplishments. Since 1977, her essays, articles and award-winning short stories have been published in magazines, newspapers and literary journals. She is the author of 10 published nonfiction books, two of which are memoirs, and a novel, “Qualities of Light,” which is being shopped to publishers. Her soft pastel paintings — impressionistic studies of the light and color in nature — have been exhibited nationally since 2002, and are in permanent collections, including that of the Pacific Street Gallery in New London. Ms. Moore sings with the group Keystone, whose music she described as “New Age pop,” and whose 2003 CD, “No Limitations,” includes her song “Melody;” she is also a member of the Connecticut Women’s Chorus.She says her triple vision is focused on common themes. One is the relationship between health and self-expression. The second is what she calls “deserved happiness,” which she defines as “a fascination with the choices we make after personal disaster or suffering.”Both concepts are rooted in Ms. Moore’s own experience, most notably two bouts of cancer — thyroid in 1988, breast in 1999. “Treatment for breast cancer was traumatic,” she said. “Chemotherapy forced me to a full stop.”Her creative work, she believes, hastened her recuperation. “Art and writing bolstered my belief that life was essentially supportive rather than victimizing,” she said, “and that I would survive.” She emerged with a fortified commitment to her work.She began writing “Qualities of Light,” whose main character is a young artist grappling with the notion of deserved happiness. She started painting after a 20-year hiatus, and wrote her first songs. “Cancer forces you to re-evaluate your life,” she continued. “I began to make choices, weeding out what was not sustaining, making room for creative work. I can’t say my cancer was a blessing, but it was certainly a wake-up call.”She expanded her work to include teaching, starting with a class at the Loft Literary Center in Minneapolis for breast cancer survivors who wanted to use writing to heal. She returns to Minneapolis regularly to lead a variety of writing workshops, which she also offers at the Litchfield Community Center and at the Hudson Valley Writers’ Center in New York.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','I was 24, and suddenly I was the eyes and ears for some of the world’s top journalists. I would spend the next three years as a fixer and watch as my country learned a painful lesson: sometimes when you try to fix something, you break it even more.The trigger of war was pulled on the morning of March 20, 2003. It wasn’t long before fixers were dying in the line of duty, which made me and others like me think twice about our new jobs. Kamaran Abdurazaq Muhamed was a fixer with BBC-TV. Soon after the war started, he went to help film what was to be an American bombing mission aimed at an Iraqi Army position. A U.S. warplane mistakenly dropped a bomb on a convoy of U.S. Special Forces and Kurdish soldiers. The accident killed 18 people and injured 45, among them Kamaran. He later died.When Baghdad fell, on April 9, 2003, journalists in the north wanted to go south. Until then I had never seen Baghdad, the capital of my country. As a child I always thought of Baghdad as a big city crowded with people and cars at night, but now the city was dark and lifeless — a sad place.In Baghdad, too, the journalists were hiring fixers. I quickly became friends with fixers for National Public Radio, Knight Ridder, The Boston Globe, the BBC and The Times of London. To them I was a novelty because the Kurdish areas of Iraq had essentially split from the rest of the country in 1991. The fixers would quiz me about the north, and I asked them for directions and addresses in Baghdad when I needed them. I supported the war, as did many of my countrymen and pretty much all the fixers. We thought that only a powerful outside force could take on the job of ousting Saddam. The war also brought an economic boom. People began to refurbish their houses. In some streets, the sidewalks were piled with boxes containing TV sets, air-conditioners and other appliances. People thought Iraq would become a kind of 51st state. Everyone wanted to find a job with a news agency, a foreign company or the U.S. Army. Speaking English was a key for success in “the new Iraq,” so English schools sprang up around Baghdad.I rented an apartment in Karrada, a Christian neighborhood in Baghdad. One Friday I was wandering Mutanabi Street, which has a book market with a popular teahouse. In one of the bookstores I found 27 Agatha Christies in English. I wanted to buy them all because I love her books. Instead, Elizabeth bought them and gave them to me as a present. I sat and relaxed at that teahouse, drinking tea and browsing through my new books. It was one of the happiest days of my life.n a televised address on May 1, 2003, President Bush announced, “Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.” But the war had only entered a new phase. A few weeks after Bush’s announcement, American troops were battling insurgents across Iraq. Humvees were being blown up by roadside bombs, and some Iraqis were beginning to settle old scores among themselves, often fatally. All of these were stories for the Western journalists.My responsibilities as a fixer were rapidly expanding. I was not only taking reporters around the country and interpreting for them and then choosing safe routes home, but I was also finding people to be interviewed. Then, five months into the new phase of the war, Elizabeth was leaving Iraq, which meant I was out of a job. But before she left, she introduced me to Quil Lawrence, an American reporter for the BBC who worked for the show “The World.”Quil needed a fixer, and I was very excited to work with him. I grew up listening to the BBC; my father was fond of radio, and he used to listen to the Arabic and Persian services. Almost every morning I woke to the sound of Big Ben. At 19, I bought my own radio to listen to the BBC; this is how I started learning English. After a while I memorized the names of all the BBC programs and their reporters. I would daydream about being a radio reporter and having a “sign off” as a foreign correspondent.Every morning, Quil and I would set out for interviews along with our driver, Abdulrazzaq. We did political reports as well as human-interest stories on reconstruction, the printing of new textbooks, the release of new albums by local singers. From the beginning, I watched carefully as reporters asked questions. When I began working with radio reporters, I also learned the techniques of recording. But I was still trying to figure out the rules of journalism. Every time we interviewed someone I thought we had enough to write a story, but the reporters always wanted to meet a variety of people. I thought to myself, But that guy told us everything. I did not understand the concept of interviewing multiple sources.Other Iraqi journalists were getting a similar education. During Saddam’s regime, the media were controlled by the state, and journalism was not an enviable profession. But only a few months after Saddam was toppled, there were more than 100 newspapers being published in Baghdad alone. Newsboys stood on street corners with packs of colorful newspapers on their shoulders. It was a turning point in the history of the Iraqi media.Soon, however, the situation in Iraq grew much worse. The insurgency spread to cities, and all foreign nationals became targets. The fixers were in danger, too. The insurgents hated fixers. They called us “collaborators.” They broke into my apartment three times in Baghdad, but luckily I wasn’t there. Many of my fixer friends received letters from armed groups ordering them to quit their jobs or they would be killed. At times, fixers have been killed without warning. Just two weeks ago, Khalid W. Hassan, a 23-year-old interpreter and reporter with The New York Times in Baghdad, was on his way to the bureau when he was stopped by gunmen and shot dead.Though fixers run as many and often more risks than Western reporters, we haven’t had the same protections. There have been no insurance plans to cover us, no guidelines on what we should wear or when it is O.K. for us to travel for a story. As Iraqi natives, we have been expected to use our judgment about these things. Even large American newspapers like The Times can’t guarantee that they will be able to help fixers if they become targets. And while American news organizations have often supported fixers’ applications for visas to the United States, the U.S. government does not see itself as having a special obligation to them.Many Americans don’t realize how central Iraqis are to bringing them the news they read every morning — that if Iraqis didn’t risk their lives everyday, Western reporters wouldn’t be able to do their jobs. But most of the journalists we worked with knew, even before we did, that they would come to rely on us more and more.One day, Quil and I were sitting in our hotel-room studio when he turned to me and said it was time for me to learn how to edit sound on the computer and file radio pieces myself.“One day we won’t be able to come to this country anymore,” he said. “You fixers will have to replace us.”In March 2004, insurgents in Falluja killed four American contractors, mutilating their bodies and hanging two of them from a bridge over the Euphrates. As U.S. troops entered the city to battle Sunni insurgents, the followers of the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr began clashing with coalition forces throughout Iraq. This countrywide revolt signaled the end of even the little safety foreign reporters still enjoyed. Often, now, they were afraid to leave their hotel rooms. Increasingly, they were asking their fixers to go out and do interviews for them. It was challenging, but we were happy to do it on our own — and honestly, it was a huge relief to no longer have to worry about the reporters’ safety. I began going out with the radio equipment to interview the police, militia leaders and people on the street. I would take the tape back to the hotel and give it to the reporter or reporters I was working for. Sometimes a reporter would call me on my cellphone and tell me whom to interview and even what questions to ask. And sometimes I would do my own article. Some fixers had so much autonomy — this was especially true of those who worked with print journalists — that after doing interviews and research for an article they would get a byline in a foreign paper.In the fall of 2004 Iraq’s political parties were preparing for general elections. At the same time, American troops were preparing for their second attack on Falluja — to make the city “safe for voters,” they said. In this assault many hundreds of Iraqis, among them civilians, were killed. The attack came seven months after the disclosure of the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib. I had always justified the war by saying it would bring democracy and freedom. But when I saw the pictures of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib, I was so disgusted that I wanted to give up my job as a fixer and anything else that had to do with the English language and America.Amid my anger and disillusionment, I recognized that as a journalist I was in the right place to help Iraq. A few weeks before the elections, Quil told me it was time for me to do my own radio pieces. With the recording equipment in my bag, I set off. First I went to the headquarters of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. At the gate I introduced myself as a BBC reporter and showed the guard my press badge.They ushered me into a room that had a set of new and comfortable sofas. A man in a blue suit stepped into the room and introduced himself as the party’s spokesman. A moment later a young man brought us two cups of tea, which we sipped while talking. When the interview was over, I noticed the man seemed very happy to meet a BBC reporter. If only he had known how I was feeling. I was so nervous the entire time, sitting with the spokesman of the most powerful party and dealing with all the equipment. The minute the interview ended, I couldn’t remember the taste of the tea or a single sentence he said. Luckily I managed to work the tape recorder properly.Over the next two days I met a range of politicians and people in the street. The Iraqis I talked to were angry about the plan to attack Falluja. One man told me, “You cannot hold an election on the blood of Iraqis.” I took the tapes back to the office, and I sat down to write my script. Finally it was time to read my piece over an ISDN line that would allow me to be recorded in the studios in Boston. My report was broadcast the next day. The only way for me to listen to my story was via the Internet, so I logged in and listened to it over and over again. I was not paid for that story because I was still in training, but my “sign off” dream had finally come true.“For The World, this is Ayub Nuri, in Baghdad.”There was so much for me to learn. I especially wanted to improve my writing skills so that I might one day write for foreign newspapers. I often found radio frustrating. I would work on a story for a week, and it would air for only four minutes. A newspaper article would stay around for at least a day, I thought to myself. I had also had enough of covering the everyday violence and needed to get away. My American journalist friends encouraged me to apply to Columbia University’s journalism school. It was an online application, with which I was unfamiliar, but my friends helped me out with the process.Last summer, I received a scholarship from Columbia. I was very excited to begin that new experience and get away from the war for a while. Unfortunately, the American Embassy in Baghdad — the biggest U.S. embassy in the world, with thousands of employees — does not issue many visas, so Iraqi citizens have to risk their lives driving through hostile areas where the insurgency is still at its strongest to get to Jordan and apply for visas at the embassy there. I spent several thousand dollars flying back and forth to Jordan applying for my student visa. Then I waited 47 days while the Department of Homeland Security screened my application. I checked my e-mail eagerly until the weeks of waiting killed my excitement. Finally, at 2 o’clock one morning, my phone rang, and I was told that my visa was ready. I had only a few hours to say goodbye to my family. I landed at Kennedy Airport the night before my classes started.Soon I faced a big challenge. The first semester, I had a class called Reporting and Writing I. I was assigned to cover Sunset Park in Brooklyn. When I interviewed people there, I did not understand many of the things they said. In class, I would sit with a dozen American students, and the professor would be talking about something, and suddenly everyone was laughing — but I had no idea why. One day during a local primary election, I stepped into a class, and my adjunct professor said, “Ayub, you are going to cover the S.P. Maloney race.” I did not know what S.P. Maloney meant, and by “race” I wondered if he meant a horse race or the human race.Several other Iraqi fixers have also come to the United States to attend journalism school. We all face the same problem: understanding local issues. One, Omar Fekeiki, now studies at U.C. Berkeley’s journalism school. “In Iraq I was a king, but here I am nothing,” Omar complained to me on the phone one day. “Now I need a fixer myself.” When we left Iraq, we were all planning to go back after graduation. But the worsening war has made return all but impossible. We are stranded here. Every time we speak with our families on the phone, they tell us not to come home.“At least one less person to worry about,” they say.Many of the fixers fled Iraq and are now refugees in neighboring countries. Those who remained risk their lives every day. Some of them have big families to feed, so they stay. But some fixers I know refuse to leave the country merely out of loyalty to their trade. We welcomed the U.S. war with a lot of hope. We changed careers and became fixers to help Iraq. Some of us paid with our lives. Now we are no longer sure we will ever be able to fix anything.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Five years ago the apparitional rasp of Billie Holiday brought a whiff of desolation to “Verve Remixed,” the album that sparked a vogue for jazz-meets-D.J. compilations. The better of her two tracks on the album was produced by Tricky, who found a way to make “Strange Fruit” even stranger, in the word’s most foreboding sense. A triumph of its kind, it’s also a stark anomaly. (You don’t hear “Strange Fruit” in retail and coffee chains. At least here’s hoping you don’t.) It’s no surprise then that “Billie Holiday: Remixed & Reimagined,” due out next week from Columbia/Legacy, lacks a moment as chilling as that one. Instead the album suggests a high-gloss fluorescent idyll. This is bad news for Holiday on most tracks — like the Tony Humphries techno remix of “But Beautiful” — even if it’s good news for the people who will gently sway, or gingerly sip, to the sound of her processed avatar. Yet redeeming exceptions can be found, including a frisky “Trav’lin’ All Alone” produced by Nickodemus and Zeb. (Nickodemus and Jazzy Nice, another of the album’s more successful interlopers, will spin some of this material at the South Street Seaport on Friday night.) Perhaps the executive producer, Scott Schlachter, who oversaw a similar project involving Nina Simone last year, emerged from this one with a new appreciation of Holiday’s miraculous Columbia catalog. Anyone else with that aim should bypass all middlemen; the remixes may be modish, but the originals are timelessly modern.Of course there can be folly in the valorization of authenticity, a downright chimerical ideal in the realm of popular music. For what it’s worth, Spencer Moore is plenty authentic: an old-timey country singer in the Blue Ridge mountain style, he recorded his new self-titled debut last year at his home in southeast Virginia. He was 87 at the time and the latest in a line of folk-revival rediscoveries inspired by the field recordings of Alan Lomax. (Josh Rosenthal, the founder of the Tompkins Square label, tracked down Mr. Moore after spotting his image in an exhibition of Lomax’s photographs.) The album feels austere, un-messed-with, and Mr. Moore sounds unschooled but learned, especially where his guitar playing is concerned. His voice shows the deterioration of age, but the evidence collected long ago by Lomax — a small clutch of songs, including “Jimmy Sutton” and “The Lawson Family Murders,” which resurface here — shows that it was never a youthful thing anyway. And a plain, unsparing hardship runs through “Our Baby Boy Is Gone,” a ballad written by Mr. Moore’s wife after the death of their only child.So far the EP has been a potent delivery system for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. The band made its name with one, self-titled, in 2001; another one, released the following year, only fueled the hype. “Is Is” (Interscope) comes at a radically different juncture — on the heels of a disappointing sophomore full-length album — but it fulfills a similar function, to get people fired up again. Its five songs, produced by Nick Launay, mostly go back a few years in provenance. Karen O seizes every chorus with her best feral yowl, while her partners, the guitarist Nick Zinner and the drummer Brian Chase, sound as tautly focused as ever. At times they get self-reflective, as in the quiet prelude of “Down Boy,” before an explosion of guitars and cymbals. Each track has an accompanying video, shot in night vision this spring at a Brooklyn show. Their pallid greenish hue suggests unmentionable covert operations, which seems just about right.The guitarist Mary Halvorson and the violist Jessica Pavone have worked together in ensembles led by the avant-garde eminence Anthony Braxton, and separately in a wide array of upstart new-music groups. As an acoustic duo they produce something distinct and beguiling: an amalgam of experimental folk, rock and chamber music that feels both meticulous and raw. Their debut, “On and Off” (Skirl), presents a dozen pieces of modest scale but impressive metabolism. There’s a disarming openness to their interaction, never more pronounced than when the two are blending their voices in something like a campfire harmony. But this music isn’t clever or cute. Its core is steely, and its execution clear. (Catch the duo this Thursday in New York at Cake Shop on the Lower East Side.)“Trio Alto Volume Two” (SteepleChase) is the latest noteworthy effort by the probing young alto saxophonist Loren Stillman. It’s also an indication of Mr. Stillman’s promise as a small-group composer. Finally, much more unexpectedly, it is an elegy for the drummer Take Toriyama, whose effervescent playing on the album compounds the sadness of his death. (Two months ago Mr. Toriyama took his own life. He was 38.) Mr. Toriyama, a Japanese-born improviser especially beloved by his peers in Brooklyn and Boston, had a style that was assertive but supple, and never overbearing. Here, in a rhythm section with the bassist John Hebert, he is heard in top form: making simple themes feel more substantial and difficult themes more natural. The album shouldn’t have to serve a memorial purpose, but like another recent release — “Teknochek Collision” (Barbès), featuring his regular cohort, the Balkan brass band Slavic Soul Party! — it does so with spirit and style.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Ugly things happen during wartime. This is self-evident, but worth repeating in the context of any discussion of the Abu Ghraib scandal. There is a simple reason military commanders from Sun Tzu to George Washington to Colin Powell have recognized the need for placing limits on battlefield behavior: otherwise, all hell will break loose.In “Monstering: Inside America’s Policy of Secret Interrogations and Torture in the Terror War,” Tara McKelvey sets out to describe, in fresh and unremitting detail, exactly what can, and did, happen in the absence of those limitations. McKelvey, a senior editor at The American Prospect, had her work cut out for her. The images of Abu Ghraib — Hooded Man, Leashed Man, the Naked Human Pyramid, to name a few of the most notorious — have long since been seared into the world’s consciousness. Since the scandal broke in the spring of 2004, the question of United States policy on torture has been widely debated, and Abu Ghraib itself has already been the subject of several books, including “Chain of Command,” by Seymour M. Hersh of The New Yorker, the first journalist to get his hands on the Taguba report, the military’s initial probe into American conduct at the prison. There have also been countless newsmagazine articles and at least two documentary films.McKelvey worked hard to break new ground, interviewing, among many others, Samuel Provance, one of the scandal’s key whistle-blowers; the infamous Lynndie England (“the lady with a leash,” as Mick Jagger refers to her in the song “Dangerous Beauty”); and more than 20 Iraqis who say they were abused. The sweep of her reporting is impressive, and she would have been better off letting it speak for itself rather than hyping it with prose that feels out of place in a serious work of nonfiction: “Much has been reported on the criminal behavior of soldiers at Abu Ghraib. But until now few — if any — detailed, documented accounts of sexual relations among soldiers and between soldiers and female prisoners have appeared in the press.”The administration began by dismissing the misconduct at Abu Ghraib as the work of what President Bush called “a few American troops.” The bad-apple defense quickly crumbled, though, with the leak of government memorandums authorizing the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques.” These new methods were specifically sanctioned for members of the Taliban and Al Qaeda being held at Guantánamo Bay, who the administration determined were not entitled to Geneva Conventions protections. But it is not difficult to draw a line from Camp Delta to Abu Ghraib. In August 2003, Maj. Gen. Geoffrey Miller, the commander of the joint task force at Guantánamo, was dispatched to the Iraqi prison — formerly Saddam Hussein’s favorite torture chamber — to make it a more effective laboratory for producing intelligence that might help defeat the insurgency. In Iraq, the use of harsh interrogation techniques required the signature of a superior officer, though that was apparently not much of a deterrent. “I never saw a sheet that wasn’t signed,” McKelvey quotes one interrogator as saying.The book is constructed not as a narrative of the scandal, but as a series of dispatches centered on her meetings with various firsthand participants, including a compelling, if ultimately unsatisfying, jailhouse interview with England. (“Why she committed the crimes is still not clear — even to her,” the author concedes.) McKelvey opts not to examine the motivations of her characters, though she does mine her notebook for every last morsel from her various reporting trips — the song playing on the radio in her rental car after she pulls into England’s hometown (“Dust in the Wind”), a quotation from an elderly woman who thinks she remembers England’s “pretty smile,” the fact that a human rights lawyer working on behalf of some of the detainees enjoys Arabic-style lamb chops. Sometimes these details enrich her story. Often they feel indiscriminate and irrelevant.“Monstering” is a book of reportage. This is not to say that McKelvey makes an effort to conceal her own outrage at what went on at Abu Ghraib, but rather that she is less interested in exploring how this great moral and institutional failure came to pass — the toxic mix of fatally misguided policy and undisciplined soldiers and interrogators — than in depicting what, precisely, went on behind the prison’s cinder-block walls. In describing such scenes, she uses her rigorous reporting to fine effect, drawing on her interviews with detainees to reconstruct their haunting accounts in straightforward, lucid prose. McKelvey also manages to advance her well-covered story by illuminating the deranged culture that obtained among the soldiers posted to the prison, some of whom evidently battled the stress and boredom by “Robotripping” — chasing tablets of Vivarin with eight-ounce bottles of Robitussin for a cheap high.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','I strained to listen, waited and, finally, in my dimness, realized that there was nothing to hear.At a Low Mass, the priest prays unamplified or silently. The people do not speak or sing. They watch and read. All around me, people’s heads were buried in thick black missals. I flipped through my little red Latin-English paperback, trying to keep up. Had it been 50 years ago, I would have had every step memorized. But I didn’t know any of it.I felt sheepish, particularly because I was surrounded by far more competent flock.I also felt shaken and, irrationally, angry. Catholics are told that the church is the people of God, but from my silent pew, the people seemed irrelevant. This Mass belonged to Father and his altar boys, and it seemed that I could submit to that arrangement or leave. For the first time, I understood viscerally how some Catholics felt in the ’60s, when the Mass they loved went away.I called Eugene Kennedy, professor, author and former priest, an old Chicagoan and eloquent critic of church matters. He is a scourge of the Catholic hierarchy, which he considers grasping and autocratic. But he spoke fondly of the old Mass, of the majesty to be unearthed by learning and praying it, like reading Proust in French. It contains a profound sense of mystery, he said, which is what religion is all about.But he said he wouldn’t want it back. Priests aren’t ready; it takes years to learn. And forget about the laity, he said, which is accustomed to a half-century of liturgical participation and rudimentary parish democracy. He seemed certain that most Catholics would never go for it.But St. John Cantius, once given up for dead, is thriving with an influx of new parishioners. In his homily, the pastor, the Rev. C. Frank Phillips, spoke proudly about the Latin Mass, which his parish was the first in Chicago to revive. He announced that it would soon be training priests in the old rite, which he vowed would restore the Catholic church to its place leading the world back to Christ.Father Frank does not disparage the contemporary Mass, nor could he, lest he cast doubt on the legitimacy of the last 40 years of Catholic worship. But other traditionalists do not always share his tact. Their delight at the Latin revival can seem inseparable from their scorn for the Mass that eclipsed it, which they ridicule for its singing, handshaking and mushy modernity.They’re right that Mass can be listless, with little solemnity and multiple sources of irritation: parents sedating children with Cheerios; priests preaching refrigerator-magnet truisms; amateur guitar strumming that was lame in 1973; teenagers slumping back after communion, hands in pockets, as if wishing they had been given gum instead.Pope Benedict insists he is not taking the church on a nostalgia trip. He wants to re-energize it, and hopes that the Latin Mass, like an immense celestial object, will exert gravitational pull on the faithful.Unless the church, which once had a problem with the law of gravity, can repeal inertia, too, then silent, submissive worship won’t go over well. Laypeople, women especially, have kept this battered institution going in a secular, distracted age. Reasserting the unchallenged authority of ordained men may fit the papal scheme for a purer church. But to hand its highest form of public worship entirely back to Father makes Latin illiterates like me irate.It’s easy enough to see where this is going: same God, same church, but separate camps, each with an affinity for vernacular or Latin, John XXIII or Benedict XVI. Smart, devout, ambitious Catholics — ecclesial young Republicans, home-schoolers, seminarians and other shock troops of the faith — will have their Mass. The rest of us — a lumpy assortment of cafeteria Catholics, guilty parents, peace-’n’-justice lefties, stubborn Vatican II die-hards — will have ours. We’ll have to prod our snoozing pewmates when to sit and stand; they’ll have to rein in their zealots.And we probably won’t see one another on Sunday mornings, if ever.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Q. What happened to the memorial to President Kennedy that was in Brooklyn’s Grand Army Plaza? Will it be returned?A. Yes, it will, after it is redesigned.Over time, the 1965 bronze bust of Kennedy, by the sculptor Neil Estern of Brooklyn, and its marble column were damaged by weather, said Philip Abramson, a spokesman for the Parks Department. So the monument was removed for repairs in 2002.The Parks Department decided that when the monument was returned, the bust should sit atop the column rather than be set into it, Mr. Abramson said in an e-mail message, adding, “However, since it was not a completely 3-D bust, it went back to the artist for remodeling.”The Art Commission has approved the new design of the Kennedy memorial. The bronze bust will be recast. “We estimate that it will all be done and re-installed by next year,” Mr. Abramson said.Q. Will the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway ever be finished?The current or recently completed work on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway involves five projects costing almost $600 million, according to Adam Levine, a spokesman for the State Transportation Department. Roadway curves, entrance and exit ramp lengths and other features are being upgraded, and the projects should be finished by late 2009.Several additional contracts will be coming out over the next few years on other sections of the Interstate 278 corridor in Brooklyn and Queens, which comprises the B.Q.E. and the Gowanus Expressway. Among these are rehabilitation or replacement of the Kosciuszko Bridge and the Gowanus itself. These projects are expected to start from 2010 to 2017.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','Barry Bonds may not have had to overcome the obstacles that Hank Aaron did in trying to become baseball’s career home run leader, but Aaron did enjoy one advantage Bonds would dearly appreciate: He rarely lacked for a pitch to hit.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Bonds’s late-career surge toward the record is that he has challenged Aaron’s mark, 755, despite the best efforts of opposing managers and pitchers to deposit him safely on first base whenever possible. Since 2001, Bonds has drawn walks or been hit by a pitch in more than 30 percent of his plate appearances, and more than half of those walks have come on four consecutive pitches. Giants fans have become so fed up with teams pitching around Bonds that for years they have wielded rubber chickens, which they use to taunt opponents for their cowardice.But if winning is more important than records, San Franciscans should break out in cheers whenever their beleaguered, beloved Bonds trots to first base. Although Bonds’s walks may not be able to match one of his laser beams into McCovey Cove for spectacle, opposing teams far more often than not are adding victories to the Giants’ ledger when they walk him.Walking Bonds is the right move in certain circumstances. But evaluating the treatment of Bonds in the aggregate requires a more sophisticated tool than intuition: a statistic known as Win Expectancy. Although difficult to calculate, Win Expectancy is perhaps the most intuitive statistic ever developed. It is, quite simply, the probability that a player’s team will win the game. By comparing the Giants’ likelihood of victory if Bonds walks against their chances of winning if he is pitched to, the impact of the decision whether to walk him can be expressed with mathematical certainty.For example, if the 2002 version of Bonds is allowed to hit with the go-ahead run on second base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Giants win the game 69.2 percent of the time. But if he is walked, their probability of victory falls to 62.5 percent. By contrast, if he is allowed to hit with one out in the bottom of the ninth, a man on second, and the Giants trailing by two runs, San Francisco has a 16.8 percent chance of winning, but if he draws a walk, their odds improve to 18.7 percent.'"

"'07-07-29,'0','In his very unfavorable review of my book “The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of Darwinism” (July 1), Richard Dawkins writes, “If correct, Behe’s calculations would at a stroke confound generations of mathematical geneticists, who have repeatedly shown that evolutionary rates are not limited by mutation.” If I am right, says Dawkins, “the entire corpus of mathematical genetics, from 1930 to today, is flat wrong.” Dog breeding alone, Dawkins says, proves that mutation rates are sufficient to account for evolution.But these criticisms completely miss the point of my argument. I agree that natural selection operates on mutation. The question is, what kind of mutation? Are most critical mutations in the history of life on earth random, or do they appear to be nonrandom? My book examines the actual genetic content of mutations for which we have extensive evidence, something that has become possible only in the past decade or so. Most of the luminaries Dawkins lists worked before the structure of the cell’s molecular machinery was fully appreciated, or even known at all. In the 1930s the nature of DNA and proteins was obscure. Today cellular machinery is known to be much more complex than supposed only a few decades ago.That matters quite a bit; mathematical models are only as good as their conformity to the real world. To a degree, one of the later theoretical geneticists Dawkins names, John Maynard Smith, appreciated the problem. In a 1970 essay in Nature, Smith compared protein evolution to a game in which one word must be changed to another, one letter at a time, without misspellings at any step. If two changes are needed at the same time to make sense, the game stops. The data cited in my book show that is a severe problem for random mutation. Evolution happens, but major molecular innovations aren’t random. Nothing about that statement is contradicted by dog breeding or the models of mathematical evolutionists.'"
"'07-07-29,'0','A single artery, Strandvejen, curves through the area like a Danish version of the Pacific Coast Highway. During the weekends and evenings Strandvejen's bike paths are jammed with inline skaters and bikers heading up to the beaches, getting exercise or simply checking out the scene. Copenhagen's mass transit system, the S-train, also has a “Coastal Line” for commuters, explorers and urban invaders.The most glamorous part of the coast is six miles north of Copenhagen's center, when you round the bend at Klampenborg and see the bay dotted with Victorian villas and low modern apartment buildings whose white facades and curving forms reflect the seascape. Most striking of all is a formidable mansion with a green-topped cupola hovering on a low hill above the bay. This is Hvidore, where the Danish-born Empress Dagmar of Russia, whose son Czar Nicholas II was murdered after the Russian Revolution, fled with her jewelry and her Cossack guards. From her widow's walk she could gaze across the sound toward Russia, somewhere beyond the Swedish coast. Her gaze is now mirrored by a statue of Knud Rasmussen, the Danish polar explorer, which permanently stares at Sweden from his granite beachside pedestal beneath the mansion.There's a lot to stare at here. This stretch of road fronts Bellevue Beach, whose summer inhabitants tend to be as sexy, though more blond, than those at Copacabana. And practically every 20th-century structure you see here was designed by Arne Jacobsen, whose organic buildings and furnishings defined Danish Modern for the rest of the world. Jacobsen lived and worked in the Whiskey Belt for most of his career. He even designed the funky white-tiled gas station — now an ice cream parlor — with its George Jetson-ish toadstool awning in front of Skovshoved harbor.But for me the coolest of Jacobsen's designs is Bellevue Beach itself, with its cartoonish blue-striped lifeguard towers and white geometric kiosks, which, when they were built in 1932, must have seemed half a century before their time.Time travel does seem possible in the Deer Park, behind the beach. This is probably Denmark's most popular and certainly most populist green spot despite having been a royal hunting ground for three and a half centuries. Cross under the royal crest on the red wooden gate next to Klampenborg Station and enter into an ancient forest worthy of Hansel and Gretel. Some 2,000 deer stride freely around this fenced-in hilly terrain more than three times the size of Central Park, amid massive trees that make other forests seem pygmy-like.“The trees here are unusually tall because after Denmark lost its navy to the British in the early 1800s, they decided to plant lots of oak and beech trees here for use in building future ships,” said Ingvar Sahlberg, who manages Pieter Lieps Hus restaurant, a popular excursion point for people wandering the forest. “They just never got around to chopping them down.”Walking past Lieps at night takes you to a surreal sight: Half a mile into the dark woods you come upon a colored light bulb riot of beer gardens, rides, theaters and even a wooden roller coaster. This is Bakken, which bills itself as the world's oldest amusement park. Started in the early 18th century when jugglers, troubadours, clowns and other entertainers began setting up their tents around a holy spring, Bakken remains a boisterous place where Copenhageners flock to eat greasy food, take thrill rides, drink lots of beer and watch risqué cabarets. Bakken's setting in these pricey bucolic surroundings would be a little like bringing Coney Island to Montauk.“Bakken is bawdier, more folksy, cornier and a lot older than Tivoli,” said Anne Kjeldsen, referring to Copenhagen's famous amusement park. Ms. Kjeldsen owns the Skovly, a colorful restaurant and beer garden in Bakken; keeping with tradition, she and the park's other business owners are still called “tent holders.” “Bakken's got more soul,” she said.The most famous meal in Bakken is fire, eaten several times a day in front of a little green house inhabited by the park's mascot clown, Pjerrot. Beloved by several generations of Danes, Pjerrot is a character out of Italian comic opera who has been entertaining Bakken's visitors since 1800. He is essentially a set of oversized red lips cracking jokes from a sea of white makeup and clothing. Tivoli also adopted Pjerrot as a mascot, but the difference between the two says it all: Bakken's Pjerrot sings, does tricks and, yes, eats lots of fire; Tivoli's Pjerrot performs in a ballet.If one seeks deeper refinements, drive 10 minutes north to Louisiana (Gammel Strandvej 13, Humlebaek; 45-4919-0719; www.louisiana.dk; entry 80 kroner, or $14.50 at 5.5 kroner to the dollar), one of Europe's most prominent modern-art museums. It was named, according to legend, by a former owner of the museum's grounds who had three wives named Louise. Few places better epitomize the Whiskey Belt's unique blend of populism and elitism. Part modern museum and part leisure park, Louisiana is a series of pavilions linked by glass walkways along a fantastic garden overlooking the Oresund. When I was there in early June, there was a provocative multimedia exhibit on modern Chinese art alongside the museum's permanent “Best of the 20th Century” collection. But the star of Louisiana is the amazing outdoor surroundings, and most visitors were sunbathing in the seaside garden while their kids tottered about the lawn among the Giacomettis and Calders.Just down Strandvejen, in Rungsted, lies the creation of another artist. Like Empress Dagmar, Karen Blixen returned to the Whiskey Coast as an exile in her own land. In 1931, divorced from her husband, rejected by her lover, broke and humiliated by the failure of her coffee plantation in Kenya, Blixen moved back with her mother at Rungstedlund to do the only thing that was left for her to do: write. Here on her father's old slanted desk is where she wrote “Out of Africa,” “Babette's Feast” and most of the other tales that would put her on the world literary stage under her pen name, Isak Dinesen. Rungstedlund is now a museum (Rungsted Strandvej 111; 45-4557-1057; www.isak-dinesen.dk; entry 45 kroner), and its densely planted park provides a captivating glimpse at the other talents Blixen cultivated, literally.Wandering around the park's 40 acres of groves and perennial-filled gardens is like taking a botanical tour of Denmark. Blixen grew herbs, flowers and shrubs from all over the Danish isles here. Ever true to her aristocratic aspirations, she had trees from Denmark's major estates replanted throughout the grounds. But, like a true citizen of the Whiskey Belt, she gave her blue-blooded ideals a populist slant. Four years before she died in 1962, she converted the estate into a bird sanctuary after encouraging the Danish public to donate one krone each to the cause. Some 80,000 Danes complied, and now the park is a popular walking and picnicking area. Blixen herself is buried beneath a giant beech tree at the northern end of the grounds.From this spot, perched between the forest and the sea, the sight of a rainbow of wildflowers mingles with birdsong. Contemplating this perfect slice of nature at the edge of Copenhagen, a visitor can easily see how Blixen could have written “Out of Africa” here. It's also easy to see why she never went back.HOW TO GET THEREScandinavian Airlines, United and Continental offer flights from Newark Airport to Copenhagen.

"'07-07-30,'1','During a wide-ranging interview last week exploring his diminished role at Microsoft, the company’s challenge and its competitors, Mr. Gates insisted that he really has begun stepping back.“I am in a lucky situation of having way more things that seem interesting to do and very exciting and important, and working with smart people, and highly impactful, way more than a 24-hour day will fit,” Mr. Gates said. To be sure, there is widespread skepticism in the industry about the possibility of Mr. Gates genuinely disengaging. Microsoft’s dominance is being challenged as never before by Google in particular, and Wall Street refuses to believe the company will regain its edge. The company’s stock has largely remained flat since the end of the dot-com era.“It’s very hard for someone at his age, who has built a company with that much success and with continuing challenges to really walk away,” said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard’s business school. “He will never be a titular leader.”As he spoke in his office, Mr. Gates was joined by the two Microsoft executives, both veteran technologists, who are succeeding him. Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer, and Ray Ozzie, chief software architect, agreed with Mr. Gates that despite significant industry challenges from all directions, Microsoft is at a perfect historic juncture for Mr. Gates’s departure and the first stage of his withdrawal from Microsoft has been reasonably seamless.“The weaning process inside the company is inevitable,” said Mr. Mundie, a computer scientist who began his career developing minicomputers and supercomputers before joining Microsoft in 1992.The greatest danger, according to all three executives, would be if Mr. Gates continues to make decisions while not staying deeply involved. He will remain chairman.“It can’t be a situation where he’s expected to suddenly, magically come up to speed,” said Mr. Ozzie, a software designer who developed a software collaboration tool called Notes for Lotus and then started Groove Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2005. “You know, did you see the 20 announcements last week that Google did, Yahoo did, Cisco did?”For his part, Mr. Gates said he planned to remain deeply involved in a few areas indefinitely.“Other than board meetings, there’s not much in terms of regular meetings,” he said. “It’s much more sitting down a couple hours a month with Craig, sitting down a couple of hours a month with Ray.”On Thursday, Steven A. Ballmer, who took over the chief executive role from Mr. Gates seven years ago, said the company’s overall performance had never been stronger. Microsoft, he noted, has doubled its revenue and almost doubled its profits in the half decade that he has been at the helm. Despite that growth, the stock price has remained vexingly flat in the period.Although smooth leadership transitions are infrequent among high tech firms, it appears that Mr. Gates has had the freedom to begin stepping away gracefully because Mr. Ballmer has been largely successful in shouldering the burden of running Microsoft.Mr. Gates no longer attends senior leadership team meetings, and earlier this month he made what company executives described as a farewell appearance at the annual Microsoft sales force meeting in Orlando, Fla. When Mr. Gates finished his speech to the thousands of sales people at the meeting, they gave him a five-minute standing ovation, underscoring the bond the company still retains with its co-founder, according to a person who attended the event.But as he cedes Microsoft’s technology leadership to Mr. Mundie and Mr. Ozzie, the company is struggling with a radical transition in the computer industry. Six months ago, Microsoft shipped its long-delayed Windows Vista operating system, and there is widespread belief within the industry that the era of such unwieldy and vast software development projects is coming to an end.Ubiquitous broadband networks and high speed wireless networks have for the first time given rise to meaningful alternatives to bulky and costly personal computers. In their place are a proliferating collection of smart connected devices that are tied together by a vast array of Internet-based information services based in centralized data centers.The industry is rushing to “software as a service” models ranging from Salesforce.com, a San Francisco company that sells business contact software delivered via Web browsers, to Apple’s iPhone, which is designed as a classic “thin client,” a computer that requires the Internet for many of its capabilities.It is a vision that Microsoft itself has at least partially embraced. Microsoft, in contrast, is calling its strategy “software plus services,” an approach that is intended to protect the company’s existing installed base.During the interview, all three executives indicated that Microsoft is now moving quickly to offer new Internet services for personal computer users. Centralized data storage will make it possible for PC users to gain access to most or all of their information from all of the different types of computers they use, whether they are desktops, laptops or smartphones, and wherever they are located.During the transition, Mr. Gates has also stayed closely involved in shaping Microsoft’s strategy in the search market where it has been assiduously attempting to catch Google and Yahoo.“We made all the structural changes we were going to make, and we rode in tandem last year,” said Mr. Mundie. “In the last few months Bill has transitioned to what I start to think of as special project mode.”If he is stepping away from Microsoft, Mr. Gates has shed none of his trademark combativeness. He rejected the Silicon Valley view that Microsoft has begun to exhibit the same sclerotic signs of middle age that I.B.M. did when it dominated the computer industry, but failed to respond effectively to the challenge of the personal computer.I.B.M. is no longer at the center of the computer industry, he asserted, for two reasons. First, the industry is now centered on personal computing. “As much as I.B.M. created the I.B.M. PC, it was never their culture, their excellence,” he said. “Their skill sets were never about personal computing.”Second, the center of gravity in the computer industry has dramatically shifted toward software, he said. “Why do you like your iPod, your iPhone, your Xbox 360, your Google Search?” he said. “The real magic sauce is not the parts that we buy for the Xbox, or the parts that Apple buys for iPhones, it’s the software that goes into it.”During the interview Mr. Gates rejected the notion that Google could become a successful competitor in the smartphone software market, where Microsoft has about 10 percent market share. The Silicon valley search engine provider has been widely reported to be preparing to enter the cellphone market with its own software and a host of services springing from that software.Microsoft’s chairman said it was unlikely that Google would be able to make inroads into the Microsoft’s share of market for mobile phone software.“How many products, of all the Google products that have been introduced, how many of them are profit-making products?” he asked. “They’ve introduced about 30 different products; they have one profit-making product. So, you’re now making a prediction without ever seeing the software that they’re going to have the world’s best phone and it’s going to be free?”Again, the ability to create compelling software will determine the winners. “The phone is becoming way more software intensive,” he said. “And to be able to say that there’s some challenge for us in the phone market when its becoming software intensive, I don’t see that.”The new, less central role for Mr. Gates was first formulated more than a year ago at a June 2006 meeting in which the three men worked out how they would divide responsibilities for guiding the technology direction of the $51 billion company, according to Mr. Ozzie, who was a longtime rival of Mr. Gates at companies like Lotus and I.B.M. before joining Microsoft two years ago.They decided at that meeting that Mr. Mundie and Mr. Ozzie would divide Mr. Gates’s role at the company along three axes. Along one of these lines, Mr. Mundie, who has been described as Microsoft’s “secretary of state” and who is deeply involved in federal government and international policy issues, would take a more public-facing role, while Mr. Ozzie would focus more closely on internal company matters.In another, Mr. Mundie has tackled the company’s long-range strategic decisions, while Mr. Ozzie has taken over the near-term challenges of weaving together the product development issues. Finally, Mr. Mundie has taken responsibility for software that sits closer to the computer hardware, like the Windows operating system, while Mr. Ozzie has shaped Microsoft’s response to the growing challenge of network software.“There’s been a very natural shift in the past year where I will engage with a particular software team and Bill will disengage,” said Mr. Ozzie. Mr. Gates insists that his new world of philanthropy will be just as compelling as software has been. “I’ll have also malaria vaccine or tuberculosis vaccine or curriculum in American high schools, which are also things that, at least the way my mind works, I sit there and say, ‘Oh, God! This is so important; this is so solvable,’ ” he said, “You’ve just got to get the guy who understands this, and this new technology will bring these things together.”'"

On his Web site, paulstanley.com, he wrote on Saturday, “During sound check yesterday, my heart rate spontaneously jumped to 190 plus beats per minute, where it stayed for over an hour, necessitating paramedics to start an IV and give me a shot to momentarily stop my heart and get it into a normal pattern.” Mr. Stanley added that consultations with the paramedics and a cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center confirmed his worst fear: “They said I would put myself at risk if I tried to do the show.”'"
"'07-07-30,'1','Eleven years ago, researchers discovered a quirk in consumers’ thinking about prices: they acted as if low digits were farther apart than higher ones. For example, consumers behaved as if there were more of a gap between three and four than between eight and nine.A recent paper in the Journal of Consumer Research builds on that notion by examining people’s responses to sale prices for fictional items, focusing on their reactions to differing right-hand digits in price figures. The paper was written by Keith S. Coulter and Robin A. Coulter, professors at Clark University and the University of Connecticut, respectively.In one study, college students looked at an ad for a fictional roller skate that gave the skate’s regular and sale prices. Among other questions, the students were asked how likely they were to buy the skates and how large they thought the discount was.Students who saw ads showing a $233 skate marked down to $222 thought they were getting a larger discount than did students who saw a $199 skate marked down to $188, even though the opposite was true.

The farm lobby most likely convinced them that subsidy programs ensure price stability for program commodities. As an agricultural economist in Washington, I heard this ridiculous argument every time a farm bill came up for passage.I have faith in the marketplace to stabilize food prices. If the government were ever to get out of farming, consumers would enjoy lower food prices.Large agribusiness corporations provide our food supply, and they don’t need government subsidies to do it. These are highly sophisticated companies with sophisticated managers who understand how to manage and how to profit from crop risk. It is time for corporate agribusiness welfare to come to an end.'"
"'07-07-30,'1','Recently a controversial bill — Assembly Bill 1634 — was withdrawn from a committee of the California State Senate by its sponsor, Assemblyman Lloyd Levine, a Democrat from Van Nuys. The bill would have required the mandatory spaying or neutering of all cats and dogs, applying statewide the kind of regulations that have already been enacted in some cities across the country.In its various drafts, Mr. Levine softened the basic provisions of the bill, changing the mandatory age of compliance from 4 months old to 6 months, allowing even later compliance if it was recommended by a veterinarian, and adding an amendment that would let local agencies issue “one litter” permits for the family pet. The bill would also have required breeders to obtain an “intact animal permit.”None of these changes satisfied the bill’s main opponent, the American Kennel Club. The A.K.C. argues that this bill threatens “the right to own and breed dogs responsibly.” In fact, what the bill attacks is the habit of breeding dogs and cats irresponsibly.In California last year, 450,000 cats and dogs were euthanized. The real thrust of the A.K.C.’s argument is economic. Dog fanciers have been reluctant to bring their animals to dog shows in municipalities with mandatory spaying and neutering laws. The trump card politically? Loss of local and state revenue.There may be better ways than a statewide law to reduce the number of unwanted pets. But the opponents of mandatory neutering make it sound as though the problem can be solved mainly by teaching owners to spay or neuter their pets voluntarily. That might be true, if we thought more rationally about our pets. But keeping pets isn’t about rationality. When it comes to them, Americans are lost in a seemingly endless act of transference.'"

"'07-07-31,'0','Aurorita M. Mendoza, a former Nepal coordinator for Unaids, the United Nations agency, called the study “very important.”“It’s the first I know of that’s linked H.I.V. to sex-trafficked girls,” she said.Nepal — a poor, religiously conservative country in the Himalayas — has until recently had relatively few AIDS cases. The government estimates that it has only about 10,000. The official Unaids estimate is 75,000, but that may be high. One month ago, Unaids cut its official estimate for neighboring India by 56 percent to about 2.5 million infected, more than anywhere except South Africa and Nigeria.The study, which was paid for by the State Department’s Office of Trafficking in Persons and by Harvard and Boston Universities, tested 287 girls and women being helped by a charity called Maiti Nepal, or Nepali Mother’s Home, in the capital, Kathmandu. Most had been sent home by Indian anti-prostitution groups working with the police.Thirty-eight percent of the Nepali women tested by Dr. Silverman’s team were infected with the AIDS virus — a high rate for any subgroup. But among the youngest — the 33 girls who had been sent into sex slavery before they were 15 years old — the infection rate was an astonishing 61 percent.Brothel owners pay twice as much for young girls, Dr. Silverman said, and charge more for sex with them, sometimes presenting them as virgins, because men think young girls have fewer diseases or believe the common myth that sex with a virgin cures AIDS.“It’s absolutely heart-breaking,” Dr. Silverman said. “Some of them are just shells — and shells of very young human beings. It’s every father of a daughter’s worst nightmare.”About half of those tested had been lured to India by promises of jobs as maids or in restaurants. Some were invited on family visits or pilgrimages and then sold — sometimes by relatives. Some were falsely promised marriage. Some were simply drugged and kidnapped, often by older women offering a cup of tea or soft drink in a public market or train station, Dr. Silverman said.Not all Nepali women are kidnapped or tricked, Miss Mendoza noted; poverty drives some into the profession knowingly.“This heartless ‘trade’ has been popular for more than six decades in the subcontinent,” said Romesh Bhattacharji, a former national law enforcement official in India. “In some parts of northern Nepal, one can tell which house has a girl working in an Indian brothel by its roof. If it’s tin, that’s brothel money.”Miss Mendoza said returning girls may be rejected by their families and villages because of fear that they will either corrupt other girls or will so taint the village’s reputation that no one will marry its young women.As a result, these victims of kidnapping and rape may be forced to keep selling themselves. One survey of Kathmandu prostitutes, Dr. Silverman said, found that half had worked in India. They may also become pregnant, and without treatment infect their children.Working in a brothel in Mumbai — India’s financial capital and one of the world’s largest cities — was a risk factor in itself, the study found. The youngest also tended to have been in multiple brothels and in them for more than a year, raising their risk.Brothel owners, said Jhumka Gupta, one of the researchers, typically hide their youngest girls from the police and groups trying to help women.India’s epidemic, concentrated among sex workers, truckers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs, is most common in its industrialized south and in the heroin-smuggling areas near Pakistan and Myanmar, not in regions bordering Nepal.Worldwide, about 500,000 young women are trafficked each year, according to the State Department. Most of the 150,000 trafficked in southern Asia end up working as prostitutes in Indian cities, according to the Congressional Research Service. Human rights agencies said a decade ago that up to 7,000 women from Nepal were trafficked to India each year.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','WASHINGTON, July 31 — With only eight votes cast against it, a bill requiring greater disclosure of fund-raising information and measures to fund pet projects was overwhelmingly passed by House today.The bill, which was drafted by Democratic leaders, has been a signature issue for Democrats since winning control of Congress last November. The measure would end gifts to lawmakers, including meals and tickets, by lobbyists and their clients. The bill is also intended to force members of both houses to make public the names of lobbyists who raise $15,000 or more for them in any six-month period with practice known as “bundling,” the combination donations from many people.House members approved the new legislation 411 to 8, even though some privately grumbled that it would make fund-raising more difficult.“Last year, we promised to break the link between lobbyists and legislators here in Washington and to fundamentally change the culture of corruption that had become accepted practice here,” said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, who led the Democratic Party’s efforts to win control of the House. “This new reform is on the doorstep of becoming law.”Several key Democrats voted against the bill, including Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, who has long been the subject of criticism by ethics and lobbying-reform proponents.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','The increase in American strength, he said, “is challenging their ability to be resilient.”It was not clear from the exchange whether Mr. Graham was referring specifically to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign-led, or whether he was simply using shorthand to describe all Sunni Arab insurgents.When Senator Graham asked Admiral Mullen how he would define “winning in Iraq,” the admiral said he worried about specific definitions. He said he hoped to see “a stable Iraq which can govern itself,” reconcile the feuding factions within the country and not be a haven for terrorists.Pressed to gauge the chances of an American victory, Admiral Mullen acknowledged that he was troubled about the Iraqis’ failure to come together politically. “I would be concerned about whether we’d be winning or not,” he conceded.General Cartwright said he thought victory was achievable. “It’s going to be a challenge,” he said. A mid-September progress report from Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American commander in Iraq, will offer a chance to determine whether “we’re on is the right path or whether we want to make adjustments,” he said.The admiral said he saw the struggle in Iraq as one with global impact. Asked whether he believed that “this is a war really we can’t afford to lose, when it’s all said and done,” as Senator Graham put it, he replied, “Yes, sir.”He said one reason victory is essential is that Iran, which is already trying to undermine American interests, would be strengthened by an American debacle in Iraq.The military leaders’ testimony may have offered grist both for supporters and opponents of President Bush’s policy. The president himself has said that the war is one that must be won, not only for peace in the Middle East but for American security worldwide. And Admiral Mullen said it would be a mistake to set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, because doing so would hamstring American commanders and telegraph American intentions to the enemy — points that President Bush has made repeatedly.But General Cartwright’s comments about militants’ strength in Iraq may be seized upon by critics of the war, many of whom have said that Al Qaeda was not even present in Iraq before the American invasion of 2003 and that the invasion created an opportunity for terrorists.Critics have also accused the administration of using the term “Al Qaeda” disingenuously in referring to Iraq, to imply that there are links between Iraqi militants and the Qaeda network led by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11 attacks, when in fact no concrete link has been shown to exist.But Admiral Mullen said there was essentially no difference between Iraqi terrorists who call themselves Al Qaeda members and the Al Qaeda terrorists who were sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan and were responsible for the 9/11 attacks.“In other words,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, “there are the same, part of the same global terrorist network.”“Same group of killers, with the same intention and objective,” the senator went on.The admiral, who would succeed Gen. Peter Pace as Joint Chiefs chairman, and General Cartwright appeared certain to win the committee’s endorsement for confirmation by the full Senate. The panel’s chairman, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who has been highly critical of the administration’s Iraq policy, called the nominees “outstanding individuals with exceptional military backgrounds,” and other committee members offered similar praise.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Johnson & Johnson, the health care conglomerate, announced plans today to eliminate up to 4,800 jobs as part of a restructuring that the company said would save $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion a year.In an announcement this morning, the company cited patent expirations on some of its key pharmaceutical products for the need to trim its work force of 120,000 people. The company’s chief executive, William C. Weldon, was scheduled to hold a conference call at 9 a.m. to explain the reductions.“These actions we are taking to improve our cost structure will enable us to continue investing for future growth and profitability,” Mr. Weldon said in a statement.The company, based in New Brunswick, N.J., is the third large pharmaceutical concern in the last month to announce a plan for layoffs. Bristol-Myers Squibb said last week that it planned a restructuring, with details to be made public later this year. AstraZeneca said last week it would lay off about 7,600 workers, 10 percent of its employees, to achieve $900 million in annual savings by 2010.J.& J. said it would take a charge of $550 million to $750 million in the second half of this year.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','General Motors’ global business helped lift the company to a profit in the second quarter, the company said today, but problems in North America continued to act as a drag.Over all, G.M. earned $891 million, or $1.56 a share, compared with a loss of $3.4 billion, or $5.98 a share, in the period a year earlier.The company’s North American operations — the centerpiece of its business — lost $39 million in the quarter. That was an improvement from the second quarter of 2006, when losses totaled $3.95 billion in North America.Still, the company acknowledged that it has not made enough progress.“It’s true that our North America team has made huge improvements,” Rick Wagoner, G.M.’s chief executive, said in a statement. “But our current earnings clearly demonstrate we’ve got more to do.”G.M. embarked on a restructuring plan in late 2005 that called for it to close all or part of a dozen plants and eliminate 30,000 jobs. The plan was aimed primarily at stemming G.M.’s red ink in North America, the main reason for a near-record loss of $10.6 billion in 2005 and a $2 billion loss last year.'"

"'07-07-31,'0','The Iranian news media have gotten in on the act too, claiming that foreign forces have been fitting squirrels with miniaturized surveillance devices and sending them scurrying across the border to spy. Iranian news reports, monitored by the BBC, recently referred to 14 spy squirrels being captured by alert Iranian intelligence officials before the animals could take action against the nation.No doubt, part of the reason rumors have thrived in Iraq is that the distinction between credible and incredible has at times become blurred by the haze of war.As for the badgers, the distinction between reality and fiction is further obscured by the fact that the badger, called Girta or Gariri in Arabic, has in fact been a native of the marshland area around Basra for decades. Less commonly seen after Saddam Hussein drained the marshes, it has reappeared as wetlands returned.“Old people know of the Girta, but the younger generations are not as aware of these animals,” said Dr. Mushtaq Abdul-Aziz of Basra’s health department.That much is verifiable. But many of the deeds ascribed to the creatures are not.One Basra farmer claimed the beasts attacked his cattle. Panic spread, with other reports of it killing children.The alarm was heightened by the rapid circulation of a cellphone video showing one fearsomely clawed and apparently dead animal surrounded by nervous villagers.The British were soon blamed, perhaps aided by the unfortunate coincidence that one of the British Army units is named Badger Squadron.Maj. Mike Shearer, a British military spokesman in Basra, rebutted all animal-related allegations with a straight face: “Of course we categorically deny that we have released badgers into Basra.“It flies in the face of what we are primarily here to do, which is to set conditions that will enable the Iraqi security forces to have self-determination in their own security matters.”A spokeswoman for Britain’s Foreign Office was more succinct in denying the rumor. “Don’t be silly,” she said.At the British headquarters, commanders have weightier matters to consider. On senior officers’ desks sit copies of Carl von Clausewitz’s 1832 treatise, “On War,” and David Galula’s colonial-era French manual, “Counterinsurgency Warfare.”Asked whether coalition forces were ever likely to have been as welcome in Iraq as prewar optimists hoped, one senior British officer shook his head wearily. “It would have been difficult, given the conspiracy mindset,” he said. “Just look at the badgers.”'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Gov. M. Jodi Rell has ordered a “top to bottom” review of the criminal justice system to see where it failed, but equally perplexing is the transformation of Mr. Komisarjevsky, who was adopted at 14 days old by a couple who believed they could not have children of their own. The grandson of a famous Russian theatrical director and a pioneering modern dancer who once owned vast tracts of land not far from the Petits, he was home-schooled along with his sister, Naomi, in a pre-Revolutionary landmark that is known around town as the Merriman Cook house.“This was a kid in and out of trouble,” Christopher Komisarjevsky, an uncle, said in an interview. “He was estranged from the family. A lot of what you’re asking is information that we just don’t know.”A former neighbor who insisted on anonymity said the only mischief he could recall Joshua’s stirring up as a child in the 1980s was when he and his friends scuffed the clay tennis court behind his grandparents’ home with their tricycles.But the 2002 court transcript quotes his defense lawyer, William T. Gerace, as saying that Mr. Komisarjevsky suffered from attention deficit disorder and the learning disabilities dyslexia and dysgraphia as a child, and suffered eight concussions along the way that affected his personality.Mr. Gerace also told the judge his client was sexually abused “at several different points in his life,” starting at the hands of foster children his parents had taken in. Health officials at Elmcrest, a psychiatric hospital, tried at one point to put Mr. Komisarjevsky on antidepressants, but his parents balked, suggesting their son “deal with it on a spiritual level” and sent him to “a faith program” instead, according to the transcript.Efforts to reach Mr. Komisarjevsky’s parents, Benedict, an electrical contractor, and Judé, by telephone at their home Monday were unsuccessful. In a statement last week, they said, “We cannot understand what would have made something like this happen.”Mrs. Komisarjevsky said at the sentencing hearing that she did not want her son to have antidepressants because she feared he wanted to overdose; her husband said he was proud that Joshua had admitted to his misdeeds on arrest.“We have stood by our son for all these years and we do love him and care about him and consider him as our true son even though he was adopted,” the elder Mr. Komisarjevsky told the judge. “It’s a privilege to have him as a son since then and to walk all the trials and tribulations that we have experienced.”One turning point appears to have come in 1995, when Joshua was 14, according to the transcript. That year, his step-grandfather, John Chamberlain, with whom he was close, died. He was a celebrated newsman and syndicated writer who had married Benedict’s mother, Ernestine Stodelle, the dancer, after her first husband, Theodore Komisarjevsky, died in 1954. Also when Joshua was 14, he learned he had been adopted, and it was then, he told the authorities before his 2002 sentencing, that he first broke into a house.It grew into a habit. Arrest warrants show a series of mostly petty burglaries in Bristol, Burlington, Cheshire and Farmington: He stole flatware, china and a medical bag with a stethoscope from one house; a crystal vase and cigarette case from another; $40 from one purse and $20 from another. He typically broke in through a back screen door or back window, using night-vision equipment, a knife, latex gloves and a green Army backpack, the documents show.Once, at a state trooper’s house protected by a dog, he took boots, uniform shirts, a sweater and some other items, totaling $624, from a locker in the cellar.“The warrants kept coming and coming,” Mr. Gerace, his former defense lawyer, recalled of the earlier burglaries in an interview on Monday. “He covered a lot of territory.”George A. Montowski, whose home in Bristol was burglarized in July 2001 while he and his wife were away on vacation but their 19-year-old was home, said in an interview Monday that the incident “made us feel violated,” recalling the fear of it happening “while my son was sleeping downstairs.”Another burglary victim, according to the prosecutor’s comments at the 2002 sentencing hearing, said, “Someone like him shouldn’t be out on the streets.”But Mr. Gerace described his former client as “a shy, withdrawn, quiet polite kid” who was “very, very contrite,” saying he was having trouble squaring the young man he knew with the heinous crimes against the Petit family.“His pregnant girlfriend would come to court like clockwork,” Mr. Gerace said. “She was very worried about him not being able to see the baby if he did time.”In fact the baby, Jayda, was born in March 2002, while Mr. Komisarjevsky was behind bars; he pleaded guilty that September to 12 burglaries, having already been convicted of a similar string in Meriden. The former girlfriend, Jennifer Norton, Jayda’s mother, did not return repeated telephone calls in recent days.The prosecutor in the 2002 cases, Ronald Dearstyne, told the judge that in 15 years of prosecuting burglaries, he could not recall a perpetrator who “had planned it out to this degree.” Beyond the $25,369 in goods Mr. Komisarjevsky’s victims reported stolen, Mr. Dearstyne said, there was “a cost that cannot be quantified, and that’s the emotional trauma suffered by these people.”“These people are just like us: They’re family people, they go to work, they come home,” he added, in a chilling precursor to the current case, which has spread fear across the middle-class suburbs of this state. “If we can’t go home at night and feel safe in our own home and then go to bed at night and sleep in our own home and feel safe, then where can we feel safe, judge?”Mr. Dearstyne declined through a secretary to discuss the case Monday.Judge Bentivegna agreed that the crimes were serious, leaving homeowners feeling violated and vulnerable, and told Mr. Komisarjevsky that between the five previous convictions in Meriden and the dozen in Bristol, “it’s fair to characterize your course of conduct as predatory.” With the sentence of nine years in prison followed by six on parole, he instructed the defendant, “If you can’t change your life around” in the next 15 years, “there’s really no hope for you.”'"
"'07-07-31,'0','A spokesman for the Anchorage office of the F.B.I., David Heller, would not discuss details of what was being sought in the raid and referred calls to the Justice Department’s public integrity division in Washington. The division handles major corruption cases involving public officials.Mr. Stevens is one of more than a dozen current and former members of Congress who are known to be under scrutiny by the F.B.I.His case may be the most politically consequential. He is the only senator known to be under criminal investigation, and he continues to wield power on the Appropriations Committee, which controls how the federal budget is distributed. Mr. Stevens, 83, is up for re-election next year and has suggested that he will seek another term.Mr. Stevens has been caught up in a larger corruption investigation in Alaska that resulted in raids last year on the homes of six state lawmakers, including the senator’s son, Ben, who was then president of State Senate. All of the state lawmakers are under scrutiny over their relationships with Mr. Allen and his company, VECO, and other large Alaska companies.Senator Stevens’s home in Girdwood was renovated in 2000 with the help of Mr. Allen, a longtime friend, and contractors have said that bills for their work went to VECO before they were passed on to Mr. Stevens.The remodeled home has 2,471 square feet of living area, about double its original size, with a taxable value of about $420,000, tax records show. The carpentry work alone for the renovation is known to have exceeded $100,000.Girdwood, which is surrounded by the Chugach Mountains, is popular among skiers and is a second home to many of the most affluent residents of Anchorage, the state’s largest city.“I will tell you that we paid every bill that was given to us with our own money,” Senator Stevens told reporters in Washington earlier this month.Mr. Stevens is also a business partner of Mr. Allen. The two men, along with several others, purchased a racehorse, named So Long Birdie, and were occasionally seen dining together at a Girdwood restaurant owned by another of the horse owners, Bob Penney. Mr. Penney testified last month before a federal grand jury in Anchorage that has gathered information in the corruption cases.Last week, the state’s other senator, Lisa Murkowski, a fellow Republican, announced that she and her husband would sell a large plot of land back to Mr. Penney after a complaint was made to the Senate Ethics Committee about the circumstances of the purchase.Ms. Murkowski paid about $180,000 for the undeveloped land, which local real estate agents described as about half its true value. The senator said she believed she paid a fair price for the land but had decided to sell it back to Mr. Penney to avoid any “distraction from the major challenges I face in representing Alaska.”'"

"'07-07-31,'0','Like Amaranth Advisors, the $9 billion hedge fund that last year lost $6 billion in one week, Sowood Capital got caught with leveraged positions — bonds and derivatives — whose value plummeted in a remarkably short time in markets with few buyers and with lenders that started demanding more collateral.Hedge funds are lightly regulated investment vehicles with generally expansive investment guidelines. They can invest in different kinds of securities; they can make money when the market falls by shorting stocks (betting the price will fall); and they can use leverage or borrowed money.Hedge funds manage about $1.7 trillion, more than double the amount five years ago.Sowood’s portfolio started to experience losses in June, as credit spreads — the difference in the risk to holding an entity’s debt compared with the risk-free rate of United States Treasuries — got wider and the stock market remained strong.In July, its positions eroded even further as the credit market worsened, especially for loans and for so-called credit default swaps, which are derivatives that enable investors to bet for or against the value of credit.“Until the end of last week, these developments, while reducing the value of our portfolio, were manageable,” Mr. Larson said in the letter.But at the end of last week, Sowood’s counterparties — those holding the other side of the trade — discounted the value of the collateral, meaning the fund had to post more. At the same time, there were very few buyers.After a weekend of marathon meetings in Boston with a small team from Citadel, the fund opted to sell the portfolio at a significant discount.“We believe that the arrangement with Citadel provided our best option under the circumstances, since we were unable to find other sources of liquidity,” Mr. Larson wrote.Mr. Larson joined the Harvard Management Company in 1991. By the time he left to start Sowood in 2004, he managed $3 billion of the university’s endowment in international stocks and commodities, according to Bloomberg. His pay, along with that of his boss, Jack R. Meyer, was considered outlandish by some alumni (Mr. Larson earned $17.3 million in 2003). When Mr. Larson left in 2004, Harvard gave him $500 million to help start his fund.A spokesman for the university endowment declined to comment.Sowood’s start was considered a huge success, raising $2 billion from investors. The fund was up a little more than 1.5 percent through March, according to an investor letter, showing how quickly the markets — and a fund’s returns — can turn.When Sowood started to have problems, one of its prime brokers, Morgan Stanley, put it in touch with Citadel, a well-known opportunistic buyer of distressed assets.The Boston-based fund is not the first distressed fund purchased by Citadel, a $14 billion hedge fund based in Chicago and run by Kenneth C. Griffin, a 39-year-old who started trading convertible bonds in his Harvard dorm room. Last year Citadel bought Amaranth’s distressed energy book with JPMorgan Chase & Company; Citadel later bought JPMorgan’s positions. After the collapse of Enron, Citadel hired several of its energy traders and started an energy-trading business amid dramatic dislocations in the market.Regarding Sowood, Mr. Griffin said: “This transition provides for an orderly transference of risk between the parties.”Mr. Griffin’s penchant for taking advantage of these opportunistic transactions has led some in the hedge fund industry to refer to him as a grave dancer.Other funds are also taking advantage of dislocations in the credit markets to quickly raise funds to put to work.Silver Point Capital, a multibillion hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., started by two Goldman Sachs executives, is seeking to raise opportunistic funds, according to one person familiar with the fund’s activities. A spokesman for Silver Point declined to comment.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','But she said any combination would have been complicated by different strategies at the two papers, she said.The Financial Times, with a circulation of about 450,000, aims to serve a niche market of global business leaders and politicians, she said. As part of its strategy, the paper recently raised its cover price — to $2, from $1.50, in the United States.She described The Journal, which has a circulation of more than two million, as pursuing a “high-volume consumer audience.”Ms. Scardino described Pearson’s recent decision to enter into exclusive talks to sell Les Echos, a business newspaper in France, to LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury goods company, as a move to focus Pearson’s journalism strategy on global brands like The Financial Times.The circulation of The Financial Times rose 1 percent in the first half from a year earlier, while subscribers to its Web site increased 12 percent, to 97,000, Pearson said. Advertising revenue rose 5 percent.After a difficult few years, The Financial Times returned to profitability in 2005, and earnings at the newspaper rose in the first half to £10 million ($20.2 million), from £5 million a year earlier.“The F.T. is making hay while the sun shines,” said Paul Richards, an analyst at Numis Securities in London, noting that financial markets, notwithstanding recent jitters, have been strong. “The operating environment has been pretty rosy.”Over all, Pearson said its pretax profit rose to £40 million in the first half, from £14 million a year earlier. Sales rose 3 percent, to £1.72 billion.Growth was driven by the company’s education division, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Pearson’s revenue, as American schools spent more on textbooks.The professional education division, which provides testing services, and IDC, a provider of technology data in which Pearson owns a majority stake, were both doing better than expected. Revenue fell slightly at the Penguin publishing unit.Shares of Pearson rose 8 pence, or 1 percent, to close at 778 pence in London on Monday.Some analysts have speculated that Pearson might be worth more if it left the cyclical newspaper business by selling The Financial Times and, potentially, drawing a trophy price for the paper. But Mr. Richards, the analyst, said that Ms. Scardino’s comments to analysts and reporters Monday suggested she might relish a battle with Mr. Murdoch.“Certainly the way Marjorie was talking about the F.T. brand today, it doesn’t look like a breakup of the group is imminent,” Mr. Richards said.Ms. Scardino declined to discuss any plans for head-to-head competition with a Wall Street Journal owned by the News Corporation.Regarding Mr. Murdoch, she said: “He is obviously a very successful newspaper publisher. It is impossible not to respect him as a newspaperman.”'"
"'07-07-31,'0','LOS ANGELES, July 30 (Reuters) — The investor Nelson Peltz said on Monday that his Triarc Companies could offer up to $41 a share for Wendy’s International, but would consider other alternatives if the struggling hamburger chain did not sign his confidentiality agreement by Wednesday.In a letter to Wendy’s chairman, James V. Pickett, Mr. Peltz said that Triarc, parent of the fast-food chain Arby’s, would be willing to pay $37 to $41 a share for Wendy’s — a premium of roughly 10 to 20 percent to the company’s closing share price of $33.69 on Monday.But Mr. Peltz said that if Wendy’s did not agree to his proposed confidentiality agreement by the end of Wednesday, Triarc would consider other alternatives.In the letter, which was disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Peltz reiterated his objection to the confidentiality agreement proposed by a committee of Wendy’s directors that is overseeing the company’s sale process. Trian Fund Management, a company controlled by Mr. Peltz, has a 9.8 percent stake in Wendy’s, the filing said.Triarc is required to sign the confidentiality agreement to view Wendy’s financial information and participate in the company’s sale process.A Wendy’s spokesman, Denny Lynch, said the company would not comment on issues directed to the special committee.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Both Amgen and Johnson & Johnson said yesterday that they were still studying the 61-page decision and could not comment immediately.But investors reacted favorably, sending shares of Amgen by more than $2 in early after-hours trading, though it then began to drop back. Shares had closed at $56.19, up 57 cents.Shares of the larger and more diversified Johnson & Johnson rose about 30 cents after hours, having closed at $60.07, up 30 cents.Medicare’s decision is expected to influence how private insurers pay for the drugs, which are synthetic versions of erythropoietin, or EPO, a hormone that increases the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.“Our goal was to maintain physician autonomy while ensuring the safety of our Medicare beneficiaries,” Herb B. Kuhn, the acting deputy administrator of the agency, said in a statement.Medicare’s final “national coverage determination” still retains some significant restrictions. For instance, the program will not cover the use of the drugs to treat the anemia caused by cancer itself, as opposed to anemia caused by chemotherapy. The drugs are approved only for the anemia from chemotherapy but had been widely used by patients not getting chemotherapy.But other proposed restrictions have been lifted, like ones that would have barred reimbursement for the drugs’ use during chemotherapy for certain types of cancer or for patients being treated with the cancer drugs Avastin and Erbitux.Medicare also relaxed the requirements for beginning anemia treatment. Its proposal in May had said doctors should wait until a patient’s hemoglobin — the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells — dropped below 9 grams per deciliter, close to the point at which blood transfusions would be considered. Yesterday it said treatment could begin when the hemoglobin level drops to 10.In the past many doctors had started treatment when hemoglobin levels were even higher than 10.The agency also said it would leave to local contractors the decision on whether to pay for the drugs to treat myelodysplastic syndromes, a family of bone marrow diseases that can lead to leukemia. Medicare had proposed to deny such coverage, drawing protests from patient groups.The policy issued yesterday relates only to the use of the drugs for cancer patients, not for patients with kidney failure.Aranesp is Amgen’s biggest-selling product, with sales last year reaching $4.1 billion.But the safety concerns have already started to take a toll. Worldwide sales of Aranesp fell 10 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, to $949 million. In the United States the decline was even steeper — 19 percent, to $578 million.Johnson & Johnson’s worldwide sales of Procrit, which is called Eprex outside the United States, fell 6 percent, to $758 million.

"'07-07-31,'0','Verizon Communications posted a 4.5 percent rise in quarterly profit yesterday on growth in its wireless and advanced Internet and video services, but its shares fell as margins missed some analysts’ expectations.The stock was also under pressure from the announcement that Verizon Wireless, which Verizon owns jointly with Vodafone, planned to buy the Rural Cellular Corporation for $757 million in cash, or a 41 percent premium to its Friday closing price.Verizon, the No. 2 American phone company, said net profit rose to $1.68 billion, or 58 cents a share, from $1.61 billion, or 55 cents, a year earlier.Operating revenue rose 6.3 percent, to $23.37 billion. The earnings matched the average analyst expectation, according to Reuters Estimates, and revenue was a touch above the average estimate of $22.997 billion.But analysts said Verizon’s adjusted operating income margin was slightly below expectations. It rose to 17.9 percent in the second quarter, compared with 17.3 percent in the first quarter and 16.6 percent a year earlier.'"

Minutes later, Coach Tony Dungy said Simon had failed, which was confirmed later in the afternoon by Simon’s agent, Roosevelt Barnes.“It’s unexpected; Corey’s in great shape,” Barnes said. “He’s ready to play. He’s been ready to play. It’s a mystery to me why he didn’t pass the physical.”Polian acknowledged that the Colts had the options to keep Simon on the active roster or to release him.RAMS’ BROWN APPEALS SUSPENSION St. Louis cornerback Fakhir Brown said he was appealing the four-game suspension he received this month for violating the league’s substance-abuse policy because he accidentally missed a drug test.Brown, who started 14 games last season, said a meeting with Commissioner Roger Goodell had not yet been scheduled.Brown was placed in the substance-abuse program after a positive drug test earlier in his career, so he is subject to random testing. He must contact the league whenever he leaves what has been designated as his testing site. When he missed a test this month, he said, his testing site was at his football camp in Mansfield, La., and not his hometown, Shreveport, La., which is about 15 minutes away.“I was out of town and things just got mixed up,” Brown said.SEAHAWKS ALREADY HURTING Seattle safety Jordan Babineaux will miss the next three to four weeks after injuring his right knee on the first day of practice. And the often-injured offensive lineman Floyd Womack injured a hamstring.Babineaux skidded on wet grass and banged his right knee while leaping for a pass Sunday morning. Coach Mike Holmgren said yesterday that a scan on his knee showed a bone bruise.Womack had surgery on each knee in the spring.SURGERY FOR LIONS’ STANTON The Detroit rookie quarterback Drew Stanton will have arthroscopic surgery to clean cartilage from his right knee after irritating it during training camp workouts Sunday. He may miss as much as a month.Matt Millen, the team president, said yesterday that the problem was not related to an injury Stanton sustained to the same knee during the 2003 Alamo Bowl.That required surgery and bothered Stanton, a second-round draft pick from Michigan State, during the 2004 season.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','“You can generally get good food that’s less expensive than sitting in a restaurant,” she said. “There’s great people watching, and you can generally find somebody to have a friendly conversation.”Hotels increasingly see their lobbies as more than a way station to somewhere else, offering wireless Internet service, for instance, and comfortable chairs and sofas to encourage socializing and informal meetings. The changes at hotel bars are part of that trend, inspired by the thriving bar scene begun at boutique hotels run by Ian Schrager and the W brand from Starwood.Not surprisingly, the main driver of these innovations is money. According to Smith Travel Research, revenue from beverage sales (mostly generated by bars) is the third most important source of profit for United States hotels, after guest room revenue and revenue from food sales. In recent years, bar revenue has grown at a faster pace than food revenue, and, in 2004 and 2005, more than guest room revenue.In 2005, for example, bar revenue rose 16 percent, as against 11 percent for rooms and 7 percent for food, while last year it rose 8 percent, compared with 9 percent for rooms and 6 percent for food.Josep Juncosa, resident manager of the Conrad Miami, estimated that one guest who visits his hotel’s bar and orders several drinks and some food can generate $50 to $60 in new revenue.Guests’ bar use varies by age, said Bjorn Hanson, a lodging consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers.“Baby boomers tend to have a business agenda, while Gen Xers and older Gen Yers often have a social agenda as well,” he said.The changes at hotel bars are also being driven by greater, more sophisticated interest in dining and drinking.Guests are “increasingly discerning about all areas of beverages, particularly premium brands,” said Matthew Von Ertfelda, vice president of restaurants and bars for Marriott International.The hotels are paying more attention to bar design because many are now visited all day, not just at night.To serve guests’ needs throughout the day, Marriott has created special rotating displays at its full-service hotels. These hide liquor and bar equipment during the day and display the full bar setup at night. The Conrad in Miami has closed its Noir Bar, which had a South Beach, nightclublike atmosphere, and is replacing it with a brighter, lighter bar.Some hotel chains have developed formal concepts for bars. Park Inn, a Rezidor Hotel Group brand, opened its first Bravo Bravo bar in April at its hotel at Heathrow Airport in London. Films are projected on movie screens there, and the menu for the buffet dinner changes nightly to match the entertainment. Park Inn plans to open as many as eight bars by next year.Radisson SAS, another Rezidor brand, is planning an Irish pub called Sure that will serve Irish food and drinks, to open next month at the Royal Dublin Hotel and later elsewhere.Since February, Westin has offered a program every weeknight at its hotel bars worldwide to encourage guests to relax and socialize. The Westin Chicago River North, for example, allows guests to create their own mojitos.Since June, Sheraton has been testing an 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. social hour at bars at its hotels in New York, Stamford and Boston, Intended to help guests unplug from their cellphones and personal digital assistants, the social hour features drinks like the blackberry martini. Hoyt H. Harper II, a Sheraton senior vice president, said the chain would soon extend the concept to as many as 15 other hotels, and probably offer it systemwide by March of next year.Food and drink served in hotel bars has changed recently, going far beyond old standbys like Buffalo chicken wings. Bars at Park Hyatt hotels in Washington and Buenos Aires offer cheese selections, while the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead in Atlanta will introduce ice cream desserts, some infused with liqueurs, served in cocktail glasses, in September.The Red Bar, which opened at the Hyatt Regency O’Hare in April, even contains a full-service open kitchen that specializes in Italian cuisine.Flights — small pours of drinks served together — are now ubiquitous at hotel bars, featuring rum at the Conrad Miami, sake at the Serrano Hotel in San Francisco and a “create your own flight” from 20 cocktails at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.Many hotels are also trying to cater to female travelers. The Westin and Sheraton programs are aimed, in part, at them. The Champagne bar at the Grand Hyatt Hong Kong is popular with women. And the bar at the Park Hyatt Washington was designed with women in mind, with floor-to-ceiling windows and comfortable seats for working, drinking, socializing and people-watching.Many chains are also educating bar staff members as a way to better serve patrons and stimulate sales.Kimpton will run a “bartender boot camp” later this year, while Mandarin Oriental plans to start training its bartenders next year.Marriott has hired Dale DeGroff, a well-known bartender who once worked at the Rainbow Room in New York, to create a course for bar staff whose centerpiece is 250 cocktail recipes that use fresh lemon and lime juices and eliminate all mixes.The course, announced this spring, will eventually be offered at 300 Marriott, J. W. Marriott and Renaissance hotels worldwide.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','In the hopelessly fragmented post-Carson landscape of late-night television chat, a world of not only Jay and Dave, but also of Conan and Craig, and now Jon and Stephen, and even (yeesh) Jimmy, it is sometimes easier to talk about Tom Snyder in terms of what he wasn’t than in terms of what he was.Mr. Snyder, the avuncular, garrulous, occasionally combative host who presided over that post-midnight no man’s land known as NBC’s “Tomorrow” show from 1973 to 1981, and who died of complications of leukemia on Sunday at 71, wasn’t a master of the comedic monologue, didn’t possess a particularly irreverent perspective on the events of day, and was less likely to reply to a guest’s remark with a witty rejoinder than he was to trip over his own verbose, off-the-cuff utterances.But it was precisely these qualities that made Mr. Snyder and his breezy, cigarette-smoke-filled “Tomorrow” show such a memorably odd and vital part of broadcasting history. In an industry that has since become an escalating arms race of hipness, Mr. Snyder was happy to sit on the sidelines like Switzerland, a neutral player perfectly at ease with how ordinary and out of the loop he could be.The ethos of “Tomorrow,” whose desk Mr. Snyder arrived at after lengthy careers as a radio and television news anchor, was total inclusiveness. The show could vary wildly in its guest selection from bleary-eyed night to night: one episode might feature a cerebral interview with the author Ayn Rand, another a freewheeling chat with the rock band Kiss; a segment spotlighting Elvis Costello or Iggy Pop might be followed by one featuring Frank Capra or James A. Michener.No matter whom Mr. Snyder was interrogating, he approached every guest with a uniform demeanor that was equal parts journalistic inquisitiveness and genuine human interest. He wasn’t there to help you plug your new movie, album or tell-all memoir. He sincerely seemed to believe he could get to the bottom of who you were in 12 minutes or less.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Cabbages and other cruciferous plants contain the raw ingredients for chemical warfare: glucosinolates and an enzyme, myrosinase. The chemicals are kept apart in the plant tissue, but when the tissues are crushed (as when bitten by an insect) they mix and toxic mustard oil is produced.Researchers have likened these plants to mustard-oil bombs, because the lethal chemicals are always at the ready. Now it appears that an insect that munches on them, the cabbage aphid, is a mobile version of the same thing, a walking bomb that can kill ladybugs and other enemies.It has been known that cabbage aphids can take up glucosinolates (and their bite is so delicate that they don’t set off the plant’s bomb). These aphids also produce a form of myrosinase. And as in the plants, the two compounds are stored separately. So they only mix when the aphid is attacked and wounded.Glen Powell of Imperial College London and colleagues have now shown, in a paper in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, that this chemical warfare system does in fact serve a defensive purpose. Aphids raised on a diet containing 1 percent sinigrin, a kind of glucosinolate, were toxic to ladybugs, while those raised without sinigrin were not.What’s more, only those aphids that were wingless (as a certain percentage are) stored the sinigrin. “The ones that don’t have wings are stuck on the plant,” Dr. Powell said. “Really their only defense is to store up these chemicals.” But the winged aphids don’t have as much need for the chemicals. “Obviously they have other ways of escaping,” he said.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Mike and I must have done a hundred psychiatric emergency admissions together — the hallucinating, the intoxicated, the violent ones, brought in by the police. Mike was known as a smart, confident, level-headed nurse, one of the few male nurses in the field, back in the 1980s. As a fledgling psychiatrist, I always respected his assessments in the E.R.; when he said, “This guy needs to be on a locked unit,” I listened. Even on our excellent nursing staff, Mike was known as the “top gun.”One morning, as I arrived on our inpatient unit, I nearly froze in my tracks. Our overnight admission stood in the hallway, looking disheveled and sporting a dense 5 o’clock shadow. He had the vacant look of someone whose spirit had been snuffed out like a cold candle. Our overnight admission was Mike.It turned out that he had been struggling with a ferocious bout of depression for several weeks. Even those who had been with him recently in the E.R. were shocked at his appearance; he looked as if his blood had been drained and replaced with skim milk. I resolved immediately that I would be the one to bring him back from the Land of the Unliving.Before you can put some folks back together, as one of my supervisors liked to say, they need to fall apart. Mike certainly qualified on that score. He spent most of his time curled up in a ball, sleeping on his cot. He had the usual symptoms of major depression: low self-esteem, loss of pleasure in most activities, thoughts of suicide and a tremendous sense of guilt. The precipitating causes were not clear, and Mike seemed humiliated at our efforts to delve into them. He, too, saw himself as a sort of “top gun,” and he had been ignominiously shot down.I treated Mike with two robust antidepressant regimens over the course of about two months. I saw him twice weekly in individual psychotherapy and made sure he attended group therapy three days a week. Yet nothing seemed to budge his depression. His lethargy and somnolence seemed almost contagious, and our staff clearly felt uncomfortable working with Mike. He was a disconcerting reminder of our own vulnerability to depression, to what Winston Churchill used to call “The Black Dog.” I no longer wanted to meet Mike’s gaze in the hallway for fear he would catch the look of failure in my eyes.In those days before managed care, we could keep patients on our unit for eight weeks or even more. But after a couple of months, Mike signed out of our unit, against medical advice. He was not suicidal, and there was no legal justification to keep him. I sulked around the unit for days afterward, wondering how I could have let him down so miserably.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','The first cut into the skin of Eve’s upper arm is made, to the group’s great relief, by their instructor. Months afterward, they finish the last explorations of her face, skull and brain themselves, expertly and efficiently. From first to last, Eve pretty much lives up to her name, a benevolent mentor introducing the group to anatomy and to the bigger themes of medicine.Through her, they learn for themselves the fragility of the organism — that life literally hangs by threads so delicate they are barely visible and all too easily severed. “When I look at the tissues and organs responsible for keeping me alive, I am not reassured,” Dr. Montross writes, noting that the wall of one of the heart’s chambers is “the thickness of an old T shirt, and yet a tear in it means instant death.”At the same time, the body can also be remarkably tough. Removing the skin from one of Eve’s palms blunts five scalpel blades in one afternoon. And the valves of Eve’s heart, even after months of immersion in formaldehyde, still “work like a dream, catching the water as sails catch wind, closing fast and preventing any leakage. It is astonishing, almost impossible to believe.”The sanctity of the enterprise goes arm in arm with its sheer tedium. “Why does our guy have to be such a flippin’ horse?” explodes one of Dr. Montross’s classmates, part of another dissection team fed up with searching for important structures in their cadaver’s blanket of fat. No disrespect intended, but sometimes the work just has to get done.And underlying it all is the eternal paradox of medicine: the doctor and the patient who are at once identical and opposite. Before the students dissect out a structure, they instinctively feel for the landmarks on their own bodies. And yet, they cannot identify too closely with their cadavers, or with their patients in years to come, or they will become paralyzed by emotion.Dr. Montross records the moment in her third year of medical school when she looks down at a particularly tragic patient and, like every other doctor who ever lived, enunciates a silent prayer, “Please do not ever let me be you.” It is the beginning of her professional career, the sadly necessary demarcation of “them” and “us.”Dr. Montross is a capable and honest writer: her book is very much the work of a student, for good and ill. Although she augments her story with accounts of some of the great historical centers of anatomy in Europe, her versions are a little breathless and thin next to the masterful books by the Chicago pathologist F. Gonzalez-Crussi. Her war stories from her first few hospital experiences are also a little thin; she ain’t really seen nothing yet.By the same token, though, who better to describe the strange terrain between doctor and patient, dissector and cadaver, us and them, than someone actually crossing that no-man’s land? In a few years, Dr. Montross will be on the other side, never to return. That is when she will realize that, as terrifying and humbling it may be to cut up a human body who reminds you of your grandmother, the experience pales beside that of trying to heal a living version, smiling and fully clothed.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Young athletes with their sights set on breaking into professional tennis would do well to keep one eye on their backs, too.Researchers say that even though the aspiring pros may feel fine, their spines may already be damaged from intense training.The findings appear in a study in The British Journal of Sports Medicine that looked at 33 top adolescent players training at a national tennis center.None of the players complained of back problems. But when the researchers looked for spinal damage using M.R.I. scans, it was a different story.Almost all of the players, 28, showed signs of spinal damage, the researchers said.Part of the problem is that tennis players who hope to compete professionally know they need to make their mark early. And that means a lot of training at a time when their bodies are still developing.“Such repetitive, strenuous and intense training during the growth spurt is thought to play a role in the increased incidence of injury,” the study said.The most common problem found is known as facet joint arthropathy, which can cause severe back pain. But the researchers also saw degeneration and bulges in the spinal discs, partial and complete fractures, and cysts.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','Gasoline consumption gets all the publicity, but in truth, cars use up a lot more than fuel. Tire treads and brake linings, for example, wear down over time, their component materials ending up in the environment in the form of tiny particles.Some of those component materials are metals, and potentially toxic ones at that, like cadmium and lead. In cities, brakes and tires are considered a major source of metal emissions.A study from Sweden looks at whether metal emissions have changed since the mid-1990s, as manufacturers have worked to reduce the amount of some metals in their products. David S. T. Hjortenkrans and colleagues at the University of Kalmar calculated emissions from tires and brakes in Stockholm using data on traffic volume and car sales and analysis of samples of linings and tire rubber.In a report in Environmental Science and Technology they show that cadmium and lead emissions from brakes are about one-tenth of what they were in the 1990s, but levels of copper and zinc remain unchanged. And they calculate that tires are still a major source of zinc and cadmium in urban areas.'"
"'07-07-31,'0','In the United States, much of the attention in the premium markets has been on trans-Atlantic service, as airlines like United and American spruce up business-class cabins to try to compete with top-tier carriers like British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, as well as the start-up all business-class airlines like Eos.Foreign airlines like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific Airways, meanwhile, have set the standards for premium-class travel between the United States and Asia, and have a major chunk of the international premium-class market in India.Jet Airways made its mark in India’s fiercely competitive domestic market, where most airlines “are doing irrational pricing” and losing money, Mr. Goyal said.Jet Airways, which is profitable, now flies between 40 cities in India and has expanded to routes between India and London, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Southeast Asia. The airline plans to add service late this year to San Francisco and later to Toronto, Johannesburg and the Persian Gulf — all big premium-class markets.India’s main carrier, the government-owned Air India, has been reacting to the competitive threat to its long-haul markets. It has expanded its international routes and its fleet with 22 long-haul wide-body aircraft, including 777-200ERs and 747-400s in the last three years, and has ordered 27 Boeing 787s among other new long-haul planes. Air India, which recently upgraded its first-class cabins on long-haul flights, now has 29 flights a week between India and Newark, Kennedy International Airport, Los Angeles and Chicago.The lure of the Indian market recently prompted Continental Airlines to move up the starting date for its new nonstop service between Newark and Mumbai to Oct. 1 from Oct. 28. Continental has flown between New York and Delhi since 2005.Continental promotes its BusinessFirst-class service on long-haul routes. But top-tier premium airlines offer more luxurious amenities, including cubicle-like personal spaces and lie-flat beds in business class. Emirates even has first-class cabins with seats enclosed in private compartments with doors.Mr. Goyal says Jet Airways’ new long-haul first-class service will top that, with sliding double doors, an 83-inch lie-flat bed, storage closets, a 23-inch flat-screen video monitor, and a work table that can also seat two for an intimate dinner.The money is there, he insists.“In India, there are about 30 million people who would be called ‘rich rich’ and another 350 million middle class,” Mr. Goyal said. “The economy is growing. Many Indians have the money, and they want quality service when they fly internationally — standards not lower than Singapore and Cathay.”He said there are 39 million Indian nationals living overseas, many employed in high-paying jobs in banking, technology and medicine. That doesn’t include the growing number of affluent Americans and other foreign business travelers who are now flying regularly between the United States and many cities in India.Fare discounting for premium-class service has begun to break out among some airlines, chiefly United States carriers, on the lucrative trans-Atlantic market, where walk-up business-class fares are typically $8,000 to $9,000. (Walk-up first-class fares between New York and London on British Air are over $12,000.)Mr. Goyal insists that Jet Airways will be able to prosper without heavy discounting. “We will be charging fares like British Air, Lufthansa, Emirates, Singapore,” he said. “We will not go into that fare war craziness. We don’t have a Chapter 11 in India.”'"
"'07-07-31,'0','The weather station, designed to operate even after the craft’s primary digging mission is completed, is to track daily and seasonal changes in temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed and direction. In addition, a pulsing laser will fire into the atmosphere to measure the size and altitude of dust and ice particles in the vicinity.With a 7.7-foot-long hinged arm that operates like a backhoe, the craft is to dig a series of trenches more than 20 inches into the ground with a movable metal scoop that has sharp prongs and serrated blades on the end. At full range, the arm can reach eight square yards of surface area near the lander, Mr. Smith said.Guided by a camera on the end of the scoop, scientists will select soil and ice samples for detailed study by instruments on the lander. For one experiment, the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer, samples will be dropped into a hopper to feed eight single-use ovens the size of an ink cartridge in a ballpoint pen. The sample will be slowly heated to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit to study the transition from solid to liquid to gas, and the vapors analyzed by a mass spectrometer to measure the mass and composition of specific molecules.Four other samples are to be examined in a miniature wet chemistry laboratory, where they will be stirred into a prewarmed solution and mixed with chemicals to tease out certain constituents, such as carbonates, sulfates and soil oxidants. Such components could either encourage or deter the formation of life if liquid water were available at times, scientists said.This laboratory also contains two microscopes to examine the fine structure of soil and ice samples, revealing features as small as 1/1,000th the width of a human hair that could be evidence of past liquid water on the planet.Phoenix draws its name from the mythical bird that rose from its ashes because it is made of parts of two earlier efforts to explore Mars. “It’s really getting a second chance, as its name implies,” said Douglas McCuistion, director of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA. “It is mainly refurbished hardware.”The spacecraft is made of the supporting structure and some instruments from the 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, which never flew because of cost overruns, and several backup instruments from the unsuccessful Mars Polar Lander in 1999.Mr. McCuistion estimated the project would cost $420 million, including $90 million for the launch rocket. He said the amount was $25 million to $30 million above initial estimates because the program decided to do more tests and simulations to help assure mission success.Recent spacecraft like the rovers Spirit and Opportunity have landed on Mars encased in airbags to cushion their fall and bounce around obstacles. Phoenix Lander is too heavy for the airbag approach so it will make a fiery entry into Mars’s atmosphere protected by a heat shield before being slowed by a parachute and eventually making a soft landing with the help of pulsing retro rockets.Mr. McCuistion noted that the success rate for landing spacecraft on Mars was under 50 percent, and that there was added risk in attempting a soft landing.While Phoenix is to operate during the Martian summer, scientists hope the spacecraft survives dwindling sunlight and power to see approaching winter cover the area with ice. “I’d be thrilled if we could last long enough to see ice form around the spacecraft,” Mr. Smith said.'"
